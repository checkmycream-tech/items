            <li>The best razor cut system ever invented.  </li>

            <li>This kit is great.  </li>
            <li>Do not recommend even though the price is attractive.</li>
            <li>And ordering was great</li>
            <li>The replacement parts were not as good as factory remington.  </li>
            <li>Having said that, the product seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li>Amazon is great because they are attentive and determined to satisfy!</li>
            <li>They kindly refunded my money.</li>
            <li>Product was great, fit the old shaver perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Though, the razor is probably 5+ years old and still works awesome.  </li>
            <li>Nice price and works fine.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find this replacement part for my son&#x27;s shaver.  </li>
            <li>I was glad amazon had them because I was having difficulty locating them in the store where my razor was purchased.  </li>
            <li>The shaving heads need replacement periodically so I was glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this purchase.....</li>
            <li>How many years have I been on the planet and did not know this?</li>
            <li>Too many.</li>
            <li>Again, my husband has a set of razors - comfortable, uncomplicated, almost heirlooms!  </li>
            <li>We are most satisfied -</li>
            <li>but I am sure they are fine.</li>
            <li>everything came as expected and worked perfect.</li>
            <li>so easy to replace it.</li>
            <li>Easy to install.</li>
            <li>They fit well  and function well</li>
            <li>These are obviously cheap knock-off blades from \\&quot;who knows</li>
            <li>I did the one month trial of Prime to get the free two day shipping</li>
            <li>Am not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li>The Remington foil razor seems to give me the best shave, better than more expensive razor with triple heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing special.</li>
            <li>easy to replace; shaver works much better with the new blades &amp; screens</li>
            <li>The buying process was easy, delivery was prompt, and the parts were exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Works better than the new line of shavers.</li>
            <li>Be careful, if it sounds to good it true...</li>
            <li>The ones I purchased exactly what I hoped for!  </li>
            <li>Worked as described and price was economical.  </li>
            <li>Snaps right in.  </li>
            <li>Though it was the right part.</li>
            <li>Priced right.</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described; no problems; perfect way to extend the life of a best-rated shaver (unfortunately discontinued).</li>
            <li>They did not come in a fancy plastic sealed package, which was actually better, I did not have to spend extra time opening them.  </li>
            <li>The product exactly met our expectations.  </li>
            <li>It was the exact replacement for my SP69 Remington.  </li>
            <li>I was able to find a picture on the seller&#x27;s web site that was moderately helpful.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I was able to remove the old screen and install the new one in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered and delivered in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li>I love the new razor, especially that you can plug it in to always get max power.</li>
            <li>Item was also fine, although it did not last.</li>
            <li>A real time and money saver.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a foil and cutter set and much to my surprise</li>
            <li>Shipping time was amazingly fast.</li>
            <li>an it appears to fit, however there is a big gap between the two foils.</li>
            <li>Maybe I hit the purchase button too fast, but the item turned out to be aftermarket.  </li>
            <li>Quality product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied overall and plan to visit Amazon more often in the future when looking for hard to find items to buy.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this razor and the blades were wearing out and now it works like a new shaver!</li>
            <li>I rarely purchase items online, but I couldn&#x27;t find replacement Remington shaver parts in local stores.</li>
            <li>I use the razor every other day &amp; it still works fine with the new head.</li>
            <li>Thankful I didn&#x27;t have to purchase a new razor.</li>
            <li>The razor then worked like new.</li>
            <li>it was like new again.</li>
            <li>Just what my son needed to restore his dulling shaver blades to practically new.</li>
            <li>Could have saved some money over the years but you live and learn.</li>
            <li>and i had to buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>WE THOUGHT WE HAD TO BUY A NEW RAZOR,THEN I FOUND OUT</li>
            <li>100 dollars for a new one.20 for replacement.</li>
            <li>It made an old shaver like new again.  </li>
            <li>I have a old electric Remington SP 69</li>
            <li>Next time I will buy factory replacement parts for a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>parts were ok, but the shaver is the worse I ever owned and its in the trash, thanks to china</li>
            <li>no problems in replacing old ones, seems to be lasting six to eight weeks before replacement foils needed.</li>
            <li>Simple fact is they do not cut as close as the old ones my husband replaced.</li>
            <li>The price was much lower than I paid at the Target and Walmart previously.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It was like getting a new shaver for half the price!</li>
            <li> They are fine, unfortunately the MS2 razor died on me this year</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my blades and foil, on my Remington Shaver, after putting it off for too long.</li>
            <li> They pull and snag, and it takes twice as long to shave as before.</li>
            <li> it was cheap because it is a very very poor quality reproduction that does not work.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t understand what bulk packing was; perhaps that info was too near the bottom of the description or was the print too small?  </li>
            <li> But shaving on a daily basis is still not fun, not a fault of this product of course.</li>
            <li> Took me twice as long to shave as before and left my face feeling absolutely raw all day long.</li>
            <li> I had been looking in stores for the past three months for replacement and finally found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> so they are sharp again.</li>
            <li> , I notice that they last about a little over a year of use for my heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> One of the foils was a little irregular and the blades seemed like they weren&#x27;t quite sharp</li>
            <li> Blades were exactly as I expected based on past experience.  </li>
            <li> Foils very delicate and after a few shaves the foils developed a small hole that caused the cutters to cut my face.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> He really likes the shaver but can&#x27;t find replacement cutting foils in any stores.</li>
            <li> After laying in a drawer a few years (about 10) I decided to charge it and</li>
            <li> They did not fit or work.</li>
            <li> Part did not fit.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to find the blades stocked at local stores.  </li>
            <li> It arrived just a few days after the order!</li>
            <li> The foil spring does not move well and it pulls your hair due to poor contouring.  </li>
            <li> razor was dull and foil was torn.</li>
            <li> Soon after purchase, some blades started to brake and it is not effective.</li>
            <li> it works as the previous one, but it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> Poor quality shave.</li>
            <li> poor replacement,should have ordered from manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> These blades, purchased here, were actually worse than the worn out blades that I was replacing!  </li>
            <li> Found very difficult to figure out how to install.</li>
            <li> As bad as the one I replaced.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I was glad to find this replacement part for my son&#x27;s shaver.  He really likes the shaver but can&#x27;t find replacement cutting foils in any stores.</li>
            <li> I rarely purchase items online, but I couldn&#x27;t find replacement Remington shaver parts in local stores. The buying process was easy, delivery was prompt, and the parts were exactly what I needed. I was very satisfied overall and plan to visit Amazon more often in the future when looking for hard to find items to buy.</li>
            <li> I always have purchased these shaver head foils over the last 8 years at Amazon.com.  They fit well  and function well, I notice that they last about a little over a year of use for my heavy beard.  The only thing tricky is the installation, you have to be careful on removing the rubber type  holding bumpers at the ends of the shaver head to install the foil, and put the bumpers back on properly.</li>
            <li> Item was also fine, although it did not last. Soon after purchase, some blades started to brake and it is not effective. Need to replace soon.</li>
            <li> Blades were exactly as I expected based on past experience.  Worked as described and price was economical.  I was glad amazon had them because I was having difficulty locating them in the store where my razor was purchased.  Thankful I didn&#x27;t have to purchase a new razor.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my blades and foil, on my Remington Shaver, after putting it off for too long. These blades, purchased here, were actually worse than the worn out blades that I was replacing!  They pull and snag, and it takes twice as long to shave as before. These are obviously cheap knock-off blades from \\&quot;who knows were\\&quot;, and I am going to look for actual replacements for the shaver, and avoid trying to save a dollar or two.  DO NOT BUY THESE BLADES!</li>
            <li> This kit is great.  I use the Remington Titanium MS-680 to shave face and scalp.  I often split a foil with all this shaving.  This kit is great.  Snaps right in.  Nice and sharp.  A real time and money saver.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Be careful, if it sounds to good it true...it was cheap because it is a very very poor quality reproduction that does not work. Beware of this product. If I could of rated it a zero I would have done so.</li>
            <li> I was able to remove the old screen and install the new one in 10 minutes. The razor then worked like new.</li>
            <li> I have been using thi Remington, titanium, for 3 years. The shaving heads need replacement periodically so I was glad to find them on Amazon. I use the razor every other day &amp; it still works fine with the new head.</li>
            <li> After market pop out. Poor quality shave. As bad as the one I replaced. I&#x27;ll go with the one in the OEM package.  Spend your money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described; no problems; perfect way to extend the life of a best-rated shaver (unfortunately discontinued). Works better than the new line of shavers.</li>
            <li> It made an old shaver like new again.  After laying in a drawer a few years (about 10) I decided to charge it and the charge worked.&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered a foil and cutter set and much to my surprise it was like new again.</li>
            <li> Product was great, fit the old shaver perfectly.  Am not disappointed at all.  Would order this product again.</li>
            <li> Just what my son needed to restore his dulling shaver blades to practically new. It was like getting a new shaver for half the price! Shipping time was amazingly fast. Would have given &#x27;5 stars&#x27; had directions on how to install were included but he figured it out eventually.</li>
            <li> The best razor cut system ever invented.  Amazon is great because they are attentive and determined to satisfy! The trimmer combs up the strays so you don&#x27;t have a half-baked shave like a lot of elderly men do.</li>
            <li> I love the new razor, especially that you can plug it in to always get max power. Haven&#x27;t needed to use the extra set yet but I am sure they are fine.</li>
            <li> I have a old electric Remington SP 69 and you can&#x27;t find the replacement foils/cutters anywhere.  Though, the razor is probably 5+ years old and still works awesome.  I was pleased with this purchase.....everything came as expected and worked perfect.</li>
            <li> The Remington foil razor seems to give me the best shave, better than more expensive razor with triple heads. It was difficult to find the blades stocked at local stores.

The price was much lower than I paid at the Target and Walmart previously.  It arrived just a few days after the order!</li>
            <li> They did not fit or work. Though it was the right part. Part did not fit. Just threw out pieces today.</li>
            <li> The product exactly met our expectations.  My husband loves this razor and the blades were wearing out and now it works like a new shaver!</li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with the blades which he has ordered before.  No doubt, he will order these again.</li>
            <li> It was the exact replacement for my SP69 Remington.  I had been looking in stores for the past three months for replacement and finally found it on Amazon.  I recommend this item for anyone with a series SP69 Remington.</li>
            <li> They work grate they fix grate and I very happy with them I would recommend them to everyone who need it</li>
            <li> works well, no problems in replacing old ones, seems to be lasting six to eight weeks before replacement foils needed.</li>
            <li> The replacement parts were not as good as factory remington.  The foil spring does not move well and it pulls your hair due to poor contouring.  Next time I will buy factory replacement parts for a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> Kept having to buy razors until a friend told me you could replace the parts on a razor. How many years have I been on the planet and did not know this? Too many. Could have saved some money over the years but you live and learn. You can get parts for just about every razor so they are sharp again.</li>
            <li> Foils very delicate and after a few shaves the foils developed a small hole that caused the cutters to cut my face.&lt;br /&gt;Very poor replacement,should have ordered from manufacturer.</li>
            <li> They are fine, unfortunately the MS2 razor died on me this year and i had to buy a new razor. Might be possible to use these replacements on others but not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing special. Just descent replacement foil and cutters.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t understand what bulk packing was; perhaps that info was too near the bottom of the description or was the print too small?  They kindly refunded my money.</li>
            <li> The product is lacking installation instructions, and the installation process is not obvious.  I was able to find a picture on the seller&#x27;s web site that was moderately helpful.  Having said that, the product seems to be of good quality.</li>
            <li> Foil/cutters pulled the whiskers off my face, reported to manufactuer, they sent me a replacement &amp; had the same results, they were returned. purchased a set from Remington, had no issues</li>
            <li> I ordered a SP-69 as per my razor say I should use. I received a re-SP67R. I installed it an it appears to fit, however there is a big gap between the two foils. The SP69 before didn&#x27;t have that big gap. I am not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The blades came with no instructions whatsoever. Found very difficult to figure out how to install. Once installed, the blades did not want to cut. Took me twice as long to shave as before and left my face feeling absolutely raw all day long. Do not recommend even though the price is attractive.</li>
            <li> it works as the previous one, but it is too expensive. even more expensive than the shaver which I bought several years ago.</li>
            <li> no problems. and it works like it should. No hassle, no fuss. Will be back again. And ordering was great</li>
            <li> Nice price and works fine.  But shaving on a daily basis is still not fun, not a fault of this product of course.</li>
            <li> WE THOUGHT WE HAD TO BUY A NEW RAZOR,THEN I FOUND OUT I COULD ORDER THE PARTS FOR THE RAZOR. THAT SAVED ME ALOT OF MONEY. THANK YOU,DEB</li>
            <li> parts were ok, but the shaver is the worse I ever owned and its in the trash, thanks to china</li>
            <li> Maybe I hit the purchase button too fast, but the item turned out to be aftermarket.  One of the foils was a little irregular and the blades seemed like they weren&#x27;t quite sharp</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered and delivered in a very timely manner.  Will repeat order again when needed.</li>
            <li> easy to replace; shaver works much better with the new blades &amp; screens</li>
            <li> Simple fact is they do not cut as close as the old ones my husband replaced. I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> razor was dull and foil was torn. 100 dollars for a new one.20 for replacement. I had the parts in 2 days. so easy to replace it.</li>
            <li> Quality product and fast shipping. I was leaving for vacation in 3 days and needed this when mine wore out last minute. I did the one month trial of Prime to get the free two day shipping and now I&#x27;m hooked on Prime! Get it!</li>
            <li> Was as advertised. Easy to install. Priced right.</li>
            <li> Again, my husband has a set of razors - comfortable, uncomplicated, almost heirlooms!  He regularly orders replacement parts.  We are most satisfied - with both the product and the supplier.  Thanks!</li>
