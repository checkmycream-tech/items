    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>A great value!</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>This is a great product which I will use when I travel instead of the metal shoe horns that the jerks at the airports will confiscate!</li>
            <li>She thinks it&#x27;s the best invention!</li>
            <li>It is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>This seemed perfect, worked perfectly, looked nice.</li>
            <li>I could have used a glue remover, but I didn&#x27;t want to risk marring the beautiful wood grain of the plastic.</li>
            <li>Great tool to have for your shoes</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is great...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product but the shipping took a week longer than stated on the invoice.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice shoe horn, but it broke after a month of use.  </li>
            <li>For 7 dollars, it is still a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this shoehorn has a nice appearance, is well-built, has great features (especially the finger ring), has good balance, and has very good ergonomics.</li>
            <li>I got this instead of a metal one because I liked how it looked.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s kind of sturdy</li>
            <li>I realized my expectation was my own fault.</li>
            <li>A nice chair, couch, or stoop should work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really needed one , perfect</li>
            <li>The gum residue will be on it for the life I own it.  </li>
            <li>Nice item.</li>
            <li>Nice size.</li>
            <li>My finger easily slips through the hole in the handle!</li>
            <li>The shoe horn itself is fine and is a nice color.</li>
            <li>What more can I ask of it.</li>
            <li>I avoided having to pay more for fancier alternatives.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re someone who insists on doing everything to 110% (including the force you exert on objects as you move them), I would recommend you purchase a shoe horn made of more durable material.</li>
            <li>I had shoes (2 shoes or 1 pair), and making sure</li>
            <li>This might work great for some folks, but it is very pliable and bends too easily when you are trying to use it.  </li>
            <li>Having successfully completing the aforementioned prerequisites, I found a nice comfortable place to sit.</li>
            <li>Easy, convenient, and well-made product.  </li>
            <li>It is made of a sturdy plastic and makes getting the shoes on easy.  </li>
            <li>I was assured that it was strong.</li>
            <li>and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>The product had an inventory control label with adhesive so strong that 20 minutes of peeling and scrubbing with detergent and alcohol have still not removed all traces of tackiness from the surface.</li>
            <li>The size of the shoe horn is just fine as well.</li>
            <li>The pleasant far to is having something with Kiwi printed on it.</li>
            <li>Excellent product just at what I needed very well made absolutely delighted with my purchase definitely recommend this particular make if you need to purchase a shoe horn</li>
            <li>used the handy finger ring of the shoehorn as a handle, slipped my toes into the shoe, and used the shoehorn to guide my heel gently into the shoe.</li>
            <li>This shoe horn is constructed of a cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>I prepared for the first use by making sure</li>
            <li>I am certain I will enjoy using this shoehorn for many decades to come.</li>
            <li>Both shoes were installed flawlessly with very few mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What can I say, it was pretty cheap and helps me get my shoes on.  </li>
            <li>Although I was happy with this particular shoehorn, it did not last.  </li>
            <li>TIP: Be sure to choose an object that can hold your weight and keep you stable as you lean forward to use your new shoehorn.</li>
            <li>The plastic material is very brittle and breaks easily.</li>
            <li>The package arrived quickly, thanks to Amazon Prime&#x27;s free 2-day shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A bit shorter than I thought it would be but really nice and solid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many shoe horns in my life but this is by far the Cadillac of shoe horns.</li>
            <li>Nice and solid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through several of these since they&#x27;re all that&#x27;s carried at most stores, and they break pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>Small enough to be handy but good fit</li>
            <li>; Kiwi Show Horn is an easy to use, easy to carry with you, and fits into smaller women&#x27;s shoes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to be reminded that there is a world atthe other side of the globe.</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>for the product, it works exactly as I had hoped it would.</li>
            <li>Great for travel - but they are delicate.  </li>
            <li>They both broke during the first week of usage.</li>
            <li>stars instead of five only because five obliges me to say &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34;: hyperbolic rating.</li>
            <li>I carefully opened the sealed end (which took some time since the plastic sleeve was very strong).  </li>
            <li>Even though the shoehorn is made of plastic, it certainly does resemble real wood.</li>
            <li>Too much money for what I received.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem as flimsy as others have appeared to experience, but I also don&#x27;t apply much pressure to the shoe horn when I&#x27;m putting my shoes on.</li>
            <li>It probably does not matter that much anyway.</li>
            <li>Makes putting on shoes much easier.</li>
            <li>Worked perfectly for about 5 weeks, then snapped in half despite very little pressure.  </li>
            <li>After graduating from university and beginning my first job as a productive member of society, I decided it was time to dress like an adult as well.</li>
            <li>My heel slides down into my shoe smoothly!</li>
            <li>Stashed them in several different shoes AND in my \\&quot;ditty bag\\&quot; - just like my daughter does her reading glasses \\&quot;all over the house\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the vendor had no problem with charging so much for it.  </li>
            <li>device did not come with instructions, but having used shoehorns in the past, I felt confident using  it without too much difficulty.</li>
            <li>I really love this small piece of thing, although I don&#x27;t use it everyday :)</li>
            <li>I did first due to the excitement of using this new device for the first time.</li>
            <li>If you hold the shoehorn slightly below the &#x27;O&#x27; ring, it will not break and works fine.</li>
            <li>However, for those who really want to know, I will post a follow-up review with that information the next time I use my new shoehorn.</li>
            <li>me, it should have the large hole at the end which facilitates its removal from the shoe.&lt;br /&gt;The shape and size seem right--the same as others that I&#x27;ve had that broke eventually.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>looks a little cheap in person</li>
            <li>Too bad because I really liked the fit.</li>
            <li>Kind of thin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really strong enough for me, but for the price, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>small shoehorn - sturdy and easy to put in your luggage or in a desk drawer at work, helps take care of your shoes since you don&#x27;t breakdown the rear quarter, not metal so pass airport inspection</li>
            <li>For the price ($7.99), I expected a higher quality shoe horn.</li>
            <li>I am subconsciously hoping I lose it to justify buying a new one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I turned the shoehorn over and found a sticker fixed to the back side.</li>
            <li>I have a favorite pair of shoes with a high back which was always bending making it difficult to get the shoes on.  </li>
            <li>A pretty little plastic form which will cause no problem with airport security.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t broken, so I guess it&#x27;s fine</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Shoe horn color was not what I expected it was just solid brown and sticker residue was left on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say much about a shoe</li>

            <li> Be careful with them and they will last.</li>
            <li> Every single time I pick it up it is there.  </li>
            <li> The shoe horn itself is fine, but it came with a gummed label on the back, the gum of which is impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the box, it was packaged in a plastic sleeve that was folded in half and sealed on the open end.</li>
            <li> I am careful with it.</li>
            <li> It is of a sturdy plastic, formed to slide around your heel and ease your shoe on with a finesse here to unknown to me and those shoes I could never get on are now wearable.</li>
            <li> not much to say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After several weeks of ordinary use it cracked, and then broke.</li>
            <li> tool of choice to accomplish this was none other than the Kiwi 644-000 6&amp;#34; Shoe Horn.</li>
            <li> I repeated the procedure for the other foot.</li>
            <li> But beware, you are going to spend a half hour at least getting rid of the sticky label on the back.</li>
            <li> slightly wished it was maybe 3&amp;#34; longer, but length was well advertised in the item title, even.</li>
            <li> I chose this color but got a greenish black mold color.</li>
            <li> But it came with a price tag/UPC sticker that covered half the backside of it</li>
            <li> It broke in December, so it lasted less than a year.  </li>
            <li> No more slipping on shoes without tying them (unless they&#x27;re slippers).</li>
            <li> The sticker came off in three parts, plus a little fingernail scratching to remove residue.</li>
            <li> like I do everyday; there was no special strain.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months</li>
            <li> It seems shoe horns are not easily found anymore, so of course I went to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Its for little children and those whom have small feet..............</li>
            <li> Too small</li>
            <li> I was at first disappointed</li>
            <li> I decided to remove the sticker to prevent excessive friction during operation of this device.</li>
            <li> You can find these style plastic shoe horns at just about any retail or department store and they are usually given away as freebies with purchase.</li>
            <li> This shoehorn would be helpfull to anyone finding it difficult slipping into shoes of any sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lower section of the shoehorn is thick plastic but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ugly dark olive brown with black streaks through it -</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s broken.</li>
            <li> This experience has led me to the conclusion that plastic shoe horns are ill-conceived and a poor investment.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also an incredibly annoying sticker on the back, and the residue is nearly impossible to get off.</li>
            <li> the &#x27;O&#x27; ring connection point is vulnerable and prone to breaking if you hold the &#x27;O&#x27; ring.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this product...........</li>
            <li> I am afraid it will break off.</li>
            <li> And i am afraid that some of the come will transfer to the shoe.</li>
            <li> and it was impossible to peel off.  </li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Kind of thin. I am careful with it. I am afraid it will break off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a plastic shoehorn. Works as intended.</li>
            <li> what can I say. It is a shoe horn and it does what it is supposed to do. What more can I ask of it.</li>
            <li> At times, I have felt like the plastic my break, but it hasn&#x27;t yet.  Works like a shoe horn should.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shoe horn... I use it to put on my shoes... It hasn&#x27;t broken, so I guess it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> just as described.  A great value!</li>
            <li> The quintessential shoe horn.  It is of a sturdy plastic, formed to slide around your heel and ease your shoe on with a finesse here to unknown to me and those shoes I could never get on are now wearable.</li>
            <li> It works! My finger easily slips through the hole in the handle! My heel slides down into my shoe smoothly! The tortoise shell appearance blends well with the contents of my sock drawer - and I avoided having to pay more for fancier alternatives.</li>
            <li> Perfect. A bit shorter than I thought it would be but really nice and solid.</li>
            <li> small shoehorn - sturdy and easy to put in your luggage or in a desk drawer at work, helps take care of your shoes since you don&#x27;t breakdown the rear quarter, not metal so pass airport inspection</li>
            <li> Stashed them in several different shoes AND in my \\&quot;ditty bag\\&quot; - just like my daughter does her reading glasses \\&quot;all over the house\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for about 5 weeks, then snapped in half despite very little pressure.  Getting a metal one this time - it might bend but hopefully won&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> This might work great for some folks, but it is very pliable and bends too easily when you are trying to use it.  I should have gotten a metal one I guess.</li>
            <li> Hey, look at that.  It&#x27;s a shoe horn.  It horns your shoes.</li>
            <li> Shoe horn color was not what I expected it was just solid brown and sticker residue was left on. Also sorta flimsy just get a cheaper thicker one of ur looking NOT THIS ONE!</li>
            <li> It works well but it is too fragile.</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the picture. It&#x27;s an ugly dark olive brown with black streaks through it - I got this instead of a metal one because I liked how it looked. There&#x27;s also an incredibly annoying sticker on the back, and the residue is nearly impossible to get off.</li>
            <li> Easy, convenient, and well-made product.  It&#x27;s small enough to carry and large enough to do the job.  Price is right.</li>
            <li> I bought this shoe horn because it was all they had at the store. I was assured that it was strong. It wasn&#x27;t. After several weeks of ordinary use it cracked, and then broke. Get a metal one if you can.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice shoe horn, but it broke after a month of use.  Too bad because I really liked the fit.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a 5 star shoe horn. I&#x27;ve had many shoe horns in my life but this is by far the Cadillac of shoe horns. When I tried putting on my shoes without it, the heels of the shoes just bent and it was literally a pain to get them on. With the Kiwi shoe horn, it takes a fraction of the time and it saves the heels of my shoes. I&#x27;m definitely sold on this one.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it was pretty cheap and helps me get my shoes on.  I have been using it for a few months and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> This seemed perfect, worked perfectly, looked nice. Now it&#x27;s broken. The fault: simply putting on suede oxfords like I do everyday; there was no special strain. This experience has led me to the conclusion that plastic shoe horns are ill-conceived and a poor investment. Perhaps my story will spare you some minor frustration.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you don&#x27;t need to spend a lot of money to have your life improved and pain avoided. I really love this small piece of thing, although I don&#x27;t use it everyday :)</li>
            <li> not much to say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m turning into my grandpa!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s saving my finger and the backs of my shoes when i put them on. slightly wished it was maybe 3&amp;#34; longer, but length was well advertised in the item title, even.</li>
            <li> Excellent product just at what I needed very well made absolutely delighted with my purchase definitely recommend this particular make if you need to purchase a shoe horn</li>
            <li> It is what it says it is. Nice and solid. But beware, you are going to spend a half hour at least getting rid of the sticky label on the back. That is unless you want to leave it there which is an aesthetic judgment rather than a utilitarian one.The pleasant far to is having something with Kiwi printed on it. It&#x27;s good to be reminded that there is a world atthe other side of the globe.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s kind of sturdy but it broke after a couple weeks of use, I will try another model.</li>
            <li> Not a problem with this. It has worked as advertised. After two weeks of using it, I can see no damage whatsoever to the shoe or the horn</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Shoehorn, yay.</li>
            <li> It was 6&amp;#34; but that included the ring portion.  I was surprised that the vendor had no problem with charging so much for it.  I won&#x27;t be returning it but will keep an eye for that vendor.  Too much money for what I received.</li>
            <li> After graduating from university and beginning my first job as a productive member of society, I decided it was time to dress like an adult as well. No more slipping on shoes without tying them (unless they&#x27;re slippers). No - I am now a man. And what do men do? They put their shoes one WITHOUT smashing the heel down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tool of choice to accomplish this was none other than the Kiwi 644-000 6&amp;#34; Shoe Horn. The package arrived quickly, thanks to Amazon Prime&#x27;s free 2-day shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, it works exactly as I had hoped it would. It doesn&#x27;t seem as flimsy as others have appeared to experience, but I also don&#x27;t apply much pressure to the shoe horn when I&#x27;m putting my shoes on. The size of the shoe horn is just fine as well. However, if you&#x27;re someone who insists on doing everything to 110% (including the force you exert on objects as you move them), I would recommend you purchase a shoe horn made of more durable material.</li>
            <li> Great for travel - but they are delicate.  I have bought 3 of these shoe horns and 2 of them have cracked. The lower section of the shoehorn is thick plastic but the &#x27;O&#x27; ring connection point is vulnerable and prone to breaking if you hold the &#x27;O&#x27; ring. If you hold the shoehorn slightly below the &#x27;O&#x27; ring, it will not break and works fine. A pretty little plastic form which will cause no problem with airport security. Be careful with them and they will last. Look for the cheapest vendor.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these shoe horns. They both broke during the first week of usage. The plastic material is very brittle and breaks easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several of these since they&#x27;re all that&#x27;s carried at most stores, and they break pretty easily.  Way overpriced for a piece of plastic.  Get a metal one instead, they&#x27;re actually cheaper and they&#x27;ll last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I bought 2. One for the gym and one for home. They are lightweight but sturdy.</li>
            <li> Pay the extra buck or two for a larger metal one. Too small and I think my husband will break it soon enough.</li>
            <li> Its not the color I ordered but it does the job. I chose this color but got a greenish black mold color.</li>
            <li> This is a great product which I will use when I travel instead of the metal shoe horns that the jerks at the airports will confiscate!</li>
            <li> The shoe horn itself is fine, but it came with a gummed label on the back, the gum of which is impossible to remove. You can get the label off, but the gum stays on and just spreads around until now the entire back of the shoe horn is sticky. I have tried alcohol, bartender&#x27;s friend scouring powder, scraping it with a knife, acetone (mail polish remover), and household cleansers. The shoe horn is unusable because the sticky back sticks to the inside of the shoe. And i am afraid that some of the come will transfer to the shoe. Too bad. The shoe horn itself is fine and is a nice color. I am returning this to Amazon as a defective product.</li>
            <li> Great tool to have for your shoes</li>
            <li> Small enough to be handy but good fit</li>
            <li> I ordered this Kiwi shoehorn because of its appearance and functional handle. It came within 3 days. Upon opening the box, it was packaged in a plastic sleeve that was folded in half and sealed on the open end. I carefully opened the sealed end (which took some time since the plastic sleeve was very strong).  I was at first disappointed once I removed the shoehorn from the protective packaging to find it was made of plastic, rather than wood. The listing on Amazon did not say the material it was made of. I realized my expectation was my own fault. Even though the shoehorn is made of plastic, it certainly does resemble real wood. For 7 dollars, it is still a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I turned the shoehorn over and found a sticker fixed to the back side. The sticker informs the buyer that the parent company of Kiwi is S.C.Johnson and Son Inc., a company well known for quality and value. This is definitely not some fly-by-night shoehorn company! I decided to remove the sticker to prevent excessive friction during operation of this device. The sticker came off in three parts, plus a little fingernail scratching to remove residue. I could have used a glue remover, but I didn&#x27;t want to risk marring the beautiful wood grain of the plastic. After all, a shoehorn like this, you will want show to your friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device did not come with instructions, but having used shoehorns in the past, I felt confident using  it without too much difficulty. I prepared for the first use by making sure I had shoes (2 shoes or 1 pair), and making sure I had a sock installed on each foot. Having successfully completing the aforementioned prerequisites, I found a nice comfortable place to sit. TIP: Be sure to choose an object that can hold your weight and keep you stable as you lean forward to use your new shoehorn. A rocking chair is not recommended. A nice chair, couch, or stoop should work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the handy finger ring of the shoehorn as a handle, slipped my toes into the shoe, and used the shoehorn to guide my heel gently into the shoe. I repeated the procedure for the other foot. I don&#x27;t remember which foot/shoe I did first due to the excitement of using this new device for the first time. It probably does not matter that much anyway. However, for those who really want to know, I will post a follow-up review with that information the next time I use my new shoehorn. Both shoes were installed flawlessly with very few mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this shoehorn has a nice appearance, is well-built, has great features (especially the finger ring), has good balance, and has very good ergonomics. There was no documentation on how to contact technical support if problems arise. I assume you would just call the number for S.C. Johnson and Sons Inc. and they will connect you. I am certain I will enjoy using this shoehorn for many decades to come.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this product...........Its for little children and those whom have small feet..............I returned mines....I wear a Men&#x27;s size 12&amp;#34;...............</li>
            <li> I have a 7-year-old that needed a shoe horn.  I got her this one.  She loves it.  She thinks it&#x27;s the best invention!</li>
            <li> really needed one , perfect</li>
            <li> This should just be a shoe horn.  But it came with a price tag/UPC sticker that covered half the backside of it and it was impossible to peel off.  The gum residue will be on it for the life I own it.  Every single time I pick it up it is there.  I am subconsciously hoping I lose it to justify buying a new one.  Otherwise it is great...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Gets your shoes on&lt;br /&gt;Flat enough for side pocket of, say, suitcase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Sticker residue is the bane of my existence</li>
            <li> For the price ($7.99), I expected a higher quality shoe horn. I feel like I have been ripped off. This shoe horn is constructed of a cheap plastic. I guess I paid for the Kiwi brand name on it. You can find these style plastic shoe horns at just about any retail or department store and they are usually given away as freebies with purchase. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! If you have to buy a shoe horn, get a durable metal one.</li>
            <li> The product had an inventory control label with adhesive so strong that 20 minutes of peeling and scrubbing with detergent and alcohol have still not removed all traces of tackiness from the surface. Unacceptable.</li>
            <li> The 6&amp;#34; Kiwi Show Horn is an easy to use, easy to carry with you, and fits into smaller women&#x27;s shoes.  A longer version would work well for those persons with limitations to bending over for dressing. Nice item.</li>
            <li> I have a favorite pair of shoes with a high back which was always bending making it difficult to get the shoes on.  It seems shoe horns are not easily found anymore, so of course I went to Amazon.  After reviewing several I settled on this 6\\&quot; size.  It is perfect for me.  It is made of a sturdy plastic and makes getting the shoes on easy.  the backs are no longer bending and getting in the way.  This shoehorn would be helpfull to anyone finding it difficult slipping into shoes of any sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE January 2014.  Although I was happy with this particular shoehorn, it did not last.  It broke in December, so it lasted less than a year.  I have purchased a metal shoehorn which I suspect will last longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really strong enough for me, but for the price, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say much about a shoe horn.&lt;br /&gt;For me, it should have the large hole at the end which facilitates its removal from the shoe.&lt;br /&gt;The shape and size seem right--the same as others that I&#x27;ve had that broke eventually.&lt;br /&gt;This shoe  horn seem rather studier (thicker) than those, but only time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;Four stars instead of five only because five obliges me to say &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34;: hyperbolic rating.</li>
            <li> This shoe horn is lightweight and does its job.  Fits well in a suitcase pocket or dresser drawer.  Makes putting on shoes much easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product but the shipping took a week longer than stated on the invoice.  It was changed later but it still didn&#x27;t get to my home by that time either.</li>
            <li> Nice size. I bought it to carry in my purse especially for travel. Helps get the shoes back on in the airport after going through TSA.</li>
            <li> looks a little cheap in person</li>
