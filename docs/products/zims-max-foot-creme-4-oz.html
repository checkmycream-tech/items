            <li>I cannot begin to tell you how much I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>anything has got to smell better!</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best cream I have found for the purpose it serves.</li>
            <li>The cream is nice; however, it contains propylene glycol</li>
            <li>It does have a nice scent and has softened my feet nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice to find a product that does all it says.</li>
            <li>Feels great and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Now along comes this remarkable cream that brings relief within the first two days!</li>
            <li>I will get more of this when it runs out.</li>
            <li>I might have better results if I used it every day</li>
            <li>I have used Zim&#x27;s for years and love it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
            <li>I have been using the hand creme for many years.</li>
            <li>People will love it for their feet or their hands Have used it for years</li>
            <li>There are better choices.  </li>
            <li>Fast Delivery Great Product</li>
            <li>I love Crack Cream.  </li>
            <li>(I wasn&#x27;t able to place the smell.)</li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t be able to scratch your itchy shins with them anymore.</li>
            <li>I liked the original formula better.  </li>
            <li>Zim&#x27;s is the best at healing dry, cracked heels.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell for men and women and  it really heals.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, slow delivery but packaged good.</li>
            <li>this product is the best we have ever tried for resolving itchy dry winterized skin problems!  </li>
            <li>The soaking feels great after a long day and my feet have never looked better!</li>
            <li>It delivers a refreshingly cool feeling to your feet!</li>
            <li>This product does have a fairly strong, but not too offensive odor.  </li>
            <li>Strong clove scent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong clove scent, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>They appear better but still need to continue the cream as I am looking for full healing.</li>
            <li>please keep it available.</li>
            <li>I wanted a quick, easy fix.</li>
            <li>Originally when put on the heal, it looks like it is smoothing out the skin area.  </li>
            <li>Wow this stuff really makes your feet feel great.</li>
            <li>Finally, neither seemed to work as well when I just put the lotion on them; I found it more effective when I put the lotion, then put socks on (even at night).</li>
            <li>Used the good ole pumice stone, rinsed them, THEN rubbed Extra Virgin Olive Oil on them and socked &#x27;em up.</li>
            <li>And, there is no \\&quot;quick fix.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Softens and heals quickly.</li>
            <li>I apply this product for 2-3 days &amp; it heals up quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is a strange, runny consistency, but trust me, use it several times a day and you&#x27;ll be just as happy as I am!  </li>
            <li>of Course Amazon had it and it works even better than the old cream</li>
            <li>I have heard such nice things about this cream though so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance reminds me of spice gum drops, for what that&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It makes your feet feel soft and repairs the cracked areas of your heel so your able to wear sandals etc.</li>
            <li>I work at home and walk around the house barefoot all day, so my feet get kind of dry.</li>
            <li>Both made some difference, but I found the Flexitol Heel Balm more effective with my dry feet in a short time.</li>
            <li>Nice smell of cloves, skin shines like a mannequin,other than that not really much to shout about.</li>
            <li>Works perfect but need patience.&lt;br /&gt;We have to apply daily twice/more regularly for  10 days to 2 weeks then only you can see the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>On the upside, it&#x27;s not greasy, and absorbs pretty well.</li>
            <li>It smells really funny.</li>
            <li>I will be using this all summer to keep my feet pretty for sandal weather.  </li>
            <li>Most winters she goes through several bottles of creams and lotions.  </li>
            <li>your feet are cracking because of fungal growth, treat that first then use the Zim&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the hand lotion as well, especially in the winter!</li>
            <li>But this works pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have had tremendous luck with a much natural process.</li>
            <li>I certainly won&#x27;t be buying it again.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need it all the time, but when I do, I really do.</li>
            <li>Thanks Rick Edwards</li>
            <li>, when I ran out, I had to really look for it...</li>
            <li>I just wasn&#x27;t ready to accept the way it made my feet feel.</li>
            <li>We find this product works very well</li>
            <li>really wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It performs very well</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any better results than from any other lotion...</li>
            <li>this product has healed my cracked heels better than other products i would recomend this for anyone with hell and foot problams</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s not a thick lotion, so you have to reapply every night for any effect.  </li>
            <li>While it temporarily relieves dry skin, I don&#x27;t think it does anything better than regular lotion.  </li>
            <li>Skin is smooth after application, have only used periodically for the last 2 weeks ...</li>
            <li>The aroma just doesn&#x27;t bother me (and I have a very sensitive nose.)</li>
            <li>so I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised that Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme worked so well!</li>
            <li>I most likely won&#x27;t purchase again due</li>
            <li>Every other week I would pull out the pumice stone and \\&quot;saw\\&quot; down the callous skin and was pretty much satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Does not last very long, but still good for dry feet when you live in the desert, dry areas.&lt;br /&gt;D</li>
            <li>I had and old can of this stuff</li>
            <li>friend recommended this crack cream and it fixed my wife&#x27;s problem within a day or two.  </li>
            <li>The healing takes some time so be patient - it took far longer for your heels to get to the point of cracking than it does to heal them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I later it on at bedtime and put on socks...once it is gone, I will go back to any other lotion I many pick out at the store-</li>
            <li>works only half as well as the original</li>
            <li>We live in possibly the driest state in the US-New Mexico.</li>
            <li>Really softened rough spots</li>
            <li>Some of the cracks are still pretty deep on both feet, but neither heel is rough anymore.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as bad as stinky feet, but it isn&#x27;t pleasant either.</li>
            <li>They have a strong smell and its not great smell</li>
            <li>I read other reviews and had such high hopes for this cream.</li>
            <li>It healed my 2 year old son&#x27;s dry crack underneath his big toe.</li>

            <li> I do not get the same results from this &#x27;regular&#x27; crack creme for my EXTREMELY DRY feet.</li>
            <li> LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW IF IT WILL WORK OR NOT - HOPING</li>
            <li> But the actual feel of the cream is strange.  </li>
            <li> i have had ceacked heal problems for a long time this product tskes care of this problem if you use it regularly.</li>
            <li> If your heels are so bad that they are cracking give it a month and be sure to use it 2 times a day and you will see that all but the deepest cracks (which will have been reduced and far less tender) are nearly gone.</li>
            <li> started practicing yoga regularly and realized I really needed to take more care of those heels, if not for my benefit, than for the poor person behind me who had to stare at them!</li>
            <li> However, I saw very little difference between the effect Zim&#x27;s had versus other, much cheaper lotions.</li>
            <li> I did use a foot buffer to slough off the dead skin as much as I could before I started using it, so do the same as you can&#x27;t heal dead skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my experience that If your heels are severely cracked, calloused, and dry as mine, a bit of lotion is not going to heal them.</li>
            <li> dry skin problems solved...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dry cracked feet from reading reviews.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s feet get so dry and cracked and sore.</li>
            <li> The noticeable difference is that the Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme heel was still a bit dry, whereas the Flexitol heel</li>
            <li> To help with the dry feet, I order the Zim&#x27;s Crack Crème for Heels and Feet and .....</li>
            <li> They never crack or feel dry.  </li>
            <li> This Crack Creme does basically what it says, it relieves dry, cracked skin on your feet.  </li>
            <li> Stops all rough, dry feeling on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for anyone with dry tried feet.</li>
            <li> put the cream on my feet everyday for ten days.</li>
            <li> We actually started using it in the NW when we lived there, then I had to order it online when he ran into trouble here</li>
            <li> I imagine over time, if you can put up with the feel, the cream may just help heal those rough heals.  </li>
            <li> If your heels are just calloused or rough give it 2 weeks</li>
            <li> and I now have minimal skin discomfort.  </li>
            <li> If your cracks are really deep and raw don&#x27;t get the cream in them it will sting.</li>
            <li> Vaseline and other products are too greasy.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I thought it was.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s related to performance, but the Flexitol is a thicker lotion than the Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme.</li>
            <li> It is extremely watery and smells like an odd mixture of medicinal licorice.  </li>
            <li> use it daily No more cracked heels and cuticles!</li>
            <li> not sure how this is supposed to heal dry cracked heels when it is like applying stinky water to your feet.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is alright, but a little thin in consistency and doesn&#x27;t last long before needing reapplication.</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few products that helps my extremely dry skin in the winter and it helps it to heal as well as soothes the pain.  </li>
            <li> In the evenings I soaked my feet in half parts water and vinegar (helps eliminate fungus, athlete&#x27;s foot, plantar warts, etc.).</li>
            <li> I have previously just used the Zims Crack creme for hands.  </li>
            <li> I had my doubts as this isn&#x27;t your typical lotion.  </li>
            <li> it sounds like a weird name, and is not easy to find in stores,  but it really works on healing heals</li>
            <li> RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT IF YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH TIGHT SKIN ON YOUR FEET.</li>
            <li> Tried the diabetic formula a few months ago, which is what&#x27;s pictured here, but not what I recieved.</li>
            <li> This will cure your severe dried and cracked skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> and it did not irritate my skin in the least.</li>
            <li> Walk barefoot all summer long inside and out, and continue to walk barefoot in the house during the cold months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a long, cold winter in Minnesota.</li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of walking around the house barefooted, this product brings back the softness and moisture lost.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes have problems with the bottom of my feet splitting/cracking open, making it painful to walk.  </li>
            <li> My feet get really dry and cracked -- it can be very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> They dry out, crack and are very painful.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I bought it..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put it on before a blind date.</li>
            <li> too expensive!</li>
            <li> Heel cracks have plagued me in this cold environment for years!</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed...</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t find it horribly offensive.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really softened rough spots</li>
            <li> This is one of the very few products that helps my extremely dry skin in the winter and it helps it to heal as well as soothes the pain.  I will continue to use it on a regular basis and my husband loves it as well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!!! This works great for cracked and calloused skin including feet, hands and elbows.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders on &amp;#34;winter&amp;#34; hands!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best cream I have found for the purpose it serves. It works quickly with excellent result &amp; smells nice &amp; its not greasy</li>
            <li> I never tried this product before but I tried it when I purchased the regular Zim&#x27;s crack creme for my hands. Wow this stuff really makes your feet feel great. I will get more of this when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Great product ... smell isn&#x27;t pleasant at all!!!  Skin is smooth after application, have only used periodically for the last 2 weeks ... I might have better results if I used it every day</li>
            <li> Tried the diabetic formula a few months ago, which is what&#x27;s pictured here, but not what I recieved. I do not get the same results from this &#x27;regular&#x27; crack creme for my EXTREMELY DRY feet.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and had such high hopes for this cream. I l-o-v-e to walk barefoot. Love it! Walk barefoot all summer long inside and out, and continue to walk barefoot in the house during the cold months. I could post a photo of my feet, with all its cracks, but it would frighten the bejeezus out of you! Every other week I would pull out the pumice stone and \\&quot;saw\\&quot; down the callous skin and was pretty much satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started practicing yoga regularly and realized I really needed to take more care of those heels, if not for my benefit, than for the poor person behind me who had to stare at them! I wanted a quick, easy fix. I tried several creams, that didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference, and then tried Zim&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the cream on my feet everyday for ten days. I did not mind the scent and it did not irritate my skin in the least. However, I saw very little difference between the effect Zim&#x27;s had versus other, much cheaper lotions. It&#x27;s been my experience that If your heels are severely cracked, calloused, and dry as mine, a bit of lotion is not going to heal them. And, there is no \\&quot;quick fix.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had tremendous luck with a much natural process. In the evenings I soaked my feet in half parts water and vinegar (helps eliminate fungus, athlete&#x27;s foot, plantar warts, etc.). Used the good ole pumice stone, rinsed them, THEN rubbed Extra Virgin Olive Oil on them and socked &#x27;em up. The soaking feels great after a long day and my feet have never looked better!</li>
            <li> This crème is very good.  Stops all rough, dry feeling on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for anyone with dry tried feet.</li>
            <li> I use this on my feet and cracked skin. Softens and heals quickly. Has a fairly distinctive smell. I use socks to keep creme from rubbing off.</li>
            <li> The cream is nice; however, it contains propylene glycol and so I will not buy it again. It does have a nice scent and has softened my feet nicely.</li>
            <li> I have used Zim&#x27;s for years and love it. I don&#x27;t need it all the time, but when I do, I really do. Can&#x27;t ask for much more. I know some people object to the way it smells. The aroma just doesn&#x27;t bother me (and I have a very sensitive nose.)</li>
            <li> dry skin problems solved...this product is the best we have ever tried for resolving itchy dry winterized skin problems!  Try it, you will like it!</li>
            <li> I have previously just used the Zims Crack creme for hands.  I used the hand creme on my feet.  I do not see a big difference in the two products.  I will probably just continue using the hand creme for both in the future.  It is a good product, but the hand creme works for feet too.  I have been using the hand creme for many years.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I sometimes have problems with the bottom of my feet splitting/cracking open, making it painful to walk.  I apply this product for 2-3 days &amp; it heals up quickly.  This product does have a fairly strong, but not too offensive odor.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Heel cracks have plagued me in this cold environment for years! Now along comes this remarkable cream that brings relief within the first two days! I have used the lip balm so I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised that Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme worked so well!</li>
            <li> Nice smell of cloves, skin shines like a mannequin,other than that not really much to shout about. Sorry I bought it..</li>
            <li> Feels great and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Works perfect but need patience.&lt;br /&gt;We have to apply daily twice/more regularly for  10 days to 2 weeks then only you can see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worked for me.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. please keep it available. People will love it for their feet or their hands Have used it for years</li>
            <li> I cannot begin to tell you how much I love this stuff!  I have thyroid disease and psoriasis on my feet.  They dry out, crack and are very painful.  I started using this on Saturday night and today, Wednesday, the cracks are healed, my feel are moist and I am wearing sandals without being embarrassed!  Great formula by a pharmacist and wonderful smell that I think emanates from the tea tree oil in the formula.  I had my doubts as this isn&#x27;t your typical lotion.  It is a strange, runny consistency, but trust me, use it several times a day and you&#x27;ll be just as happy as I am!  I did use a foot buffer to slough off the dead skin as much as I could before I started using it, so do the same as you can&#x27;t heal dead skin!</li>
            <li> Nice to find a product that does all it says.</li>
            <li> bought a similar product from you a year ago from the same company.&lt;br /&gt;Now it has mysteriously disappeared leaving only this in it&#x27;s place.&lt;br /&gt;This works only half as well as the original and if course the price went up.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dry cracked feet from reading reviews.  I certainly won&#x27;t be buying it again.  It is extremely watery and smells like an odd mixture of medicinal licorice.  Totally disappointed...not sure how this is supposed to heal dry cracked heels when it is like applying stinky water to your feet.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any better results than from any other lotion...and I later it on at bedtime and put on socks...once it is gone, I will go back to any other lotion I many pick out at the store-anything has got to smell better!</li>
            <li> This product is smelly and doesn&#x27;t work well either.  There are better choices.  Flexitol heel balm works great and doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> So far, the cream is slowly working on smoothing out my very cracked heels.  They appear better but still need to continue the cream as I am looking for full healing.</li>
            <li> Great for the diabetic foot.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. It helps in keeping my feet from cracking when wearing open toe shoes. Would recommend to anyone who has a problem with heels splitting and cracking.</li>
            <li> Made a world of difference. I would highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, slow delivery but packaged good. Thanks Rick Edwards</li>
            <li> Zim&#x27;s is the best at healing dry, cracked heels. Vaseline and other products are too greasy. This is the one product that actually works! It&#x27;s been a long, cold winter in Minnesota.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery Great Product</li>
            <li> Great or feet. Work well.</li>
            <li> this product has healed my cracked heels better than other products i would recomend this for anyone with hell and foot problams</li>
            <li> I had and old can of this stuff and it was still working, when I ran out, I had to really look for it...of Course Amazon had it and it works even better than the old cream</li>
            <li> Works great on &amp;#34;winter feet&amp;#34;!  I love it and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> it sounds like a weird name, and is not easy to find in stores,  but it really works on healing heals</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this stuff. I don&#x27;t even mind putting it on for her, plus I use it on my cracked fingers tips.</li>
            <li> I love Crack Cream.  It has a pleasant smell for men and women and  it really heals.</li>
            <li> HAVE NOT USED THIS PRODUCT LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW IF IT WILL WORK OR NOT - HOPING SO - CAN&#x27;T HURT</li>
            <li> Strong clove scent. Not exactly what I thought it was.</li>
            <li> We live in possibly the driest state in the US-New Mexico. My husband&#x27;s feet get so dry and cracked and sore. Zim&#x27;s works like nothing else. We actually started using it in the NW when we lived there, then I had to order it online when he ran into trouble here and we couldn&#x27;t find it. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Originally when put on the heal, it looks like it is smoothing out the skin area.  But the actual feel of the cream is strange.  I don&#x27;t like the way it feels.  I imagine over time, if you can put up with the feel, the cream may just help heal those rough heals.  I just wasn&#x27;t ready to accept the way it made my feet feel.</li>
            <li> No difference after a week of use.  I have heard such nice things about this cream though so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> We find this product works very well</li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of walking around the house barefooted, this product brings back the softness and moisture lost.  Great!</li>
            <li> I work at home and walk around the house barefoot all day, so my feet get kind of dry. This stuff is alright, but a little thin in consistency and doesn&#x27;t last long before needing reapplication. The fragrance reminds me of spice gum drops, for what that&#x27;s worth. On the upside, it&#x27;s not greasy, and absorbs pretty well.</li>
            <li> I purchased Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme for Heels and Feet and Flexitol Heel Balm at the same time. I used each on separate feet for several days twice a day to compare their results. Prior, I have very dry, very rough, very cracked heels. Both made some difference, but I found the Flexitol Heel Balm more effective with my dry feet in a short time. Some of the cracks are still pretty deep on both feet, but neither heel is rough anymore. The noticeable difference is that the Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme heel was still a bit dry, whereas the Flexitol heel really wasn&#x27;t.I am not sure if it&#x27;s related to performance, but the Flexitol is a thicker lotion than the Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme. I&#x27;ve seen some comments about the smell. They have a strong smell and its not great smell but I didn&#x27;t find it horribly offensive. (I wasn&#x27;t able to place the smell.) Finally, neither seemed to work as well when I just put the lotion on them; I found it more effective when I put the lotion, then put socks on (even at night).</li>
            <li> This will cure your severe dried and cracked skin. It smells really funny. Don&#x27;t put it on before a blind date. But this stuff works I promise.</li>
            <li> Very good product and it repairs the heel.  It makes your feet feel soft and repairs the cracked areas of your heel so your able to wear sandals etc.</li>
            <li> Living in the &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34; mid-Atlantic this year, my skin and feet took a beating.  To help with the dry feet, I order the Zim&#x27;s Crack Crème for Heels and Feet and .....problem solved.  I will be using this all summer to keep my feet pretty for sandal weather.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED WITH USING IT. RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT IF YOU ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH TIGHT SKIN ON YOUR FEET.</li>
            <li> Does not last very long, but still good for dry feet when you live in the desert, dry areas.&lt;br /&gt;D Webster</li>
            <li> My feet get really dry and cracked -- it can be very uncomfortable. I&#x27;ve tried lots of foot creams and I think this is the best one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My wife always has cracked hands and feet during the winter.  Sometimes they even bleed!  Most winters she goes through several bottles of creams and lotions.  She even bought gloves that will allow her to soak her hands in lotion at night, but nothing seemed to fix the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend recommended this crack cream and it fixed my wife&#x27;s problem within a day or two.  Seriously, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> It healed my 2 year old son&#x27;s dry crack underneath his big toe. His cracked skin wasn&#x27;t improved with prescribed cream. About a week of use, his cracked/exposed skin has healed. Good cream!</li>
            <li> use it daily No more cracked heels and cuticles!</li>
            <li> It delivers a refreshingly cool feeling to your feet!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a miracle product that transforms your feet overnight - nothing will. However, with regular use they will heal. The only way to get the maximum effect of this (or any) crack cream is to exfoliate the foot with a ped egg or something similar first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliate the feet and use the Zim&#x27;s at night and then just the Zim&#x27;s in the morning (your feet will not feel greasy or slippery in your socks if you rub it in thoroughly)and within a week you will notice a difference. If your heels are just calloused or rough give it 2 weeks and you won&#x27;t be able to scratch your itchy shins with them anymore. If your heels are so bad that they are cracking give it a month and be sure to use it 2 times a day and you will see that all but the deepest cracks (which will have been reduced and far less tender) are nearly gone. If your cracks are really deep and raw don&#x27;t get the cream in them it will sting. The healing takes some time so be patient - it took far longer for your heels to get to the point of cracking than it does to heal them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your feet are cracking because of fungal growth, treat that first then use the Zim&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one star off because of the way it smells. It&#x27;s not as bad as stinky feet, but it isn&#x27;t pleasant either.</li>
            <li> I put it on my heels every day after my shower!  They never crack or feel dry.  I love the hand lotion as well, especially in the winter!</li>
            <li> I always have cracked hands and feet every winter. I even have it to the point of bleeding sometimes.  I used to go through all sorts of creams and lotions until I found this product.  It performs very well and I now have minimal skin discomfort.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> I liked the original formula better.  But this works pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;First tube arrived with a hole in the crimp.&lt;br /&gt;Vendor replaced it very quickly - thank you for that!!!</li>
            <li> again another great product from zim,s i have had ceacked heal problems for a long time this product tskes care of this problem if you use it regularly. stop using it the cracks come back.so it is a foot maintenance product</li>
            <li> This Crack Creme does basically what it says, it relieves dry, cracked skin on your feet.  However, it&#x27;s not a thick lotion, so you have to reapply every night for any effect.  While it temporarily relieves dry skin, I don&#x27;t think it does anything better than regular lotion.  I most likely won&#x27;t purchase again due it&#x27;s strong clove scent, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> the spray works best on all areas of my body! Don&#x27;t waste your money! too expensive!</li>
