            <li>The soap is very effective and gentle.</li>
            <li>I finished using my last bar, so I&#x27;m ordering more!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good soap though.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and absolutely fabulous on my skin, especially since I have so many allergies!  </li>
            <li>It is rich in lather, smells great, reasonably priced, &amp; more importantly it has no SLN, SLES, Parabens, PG derivatives, fragrances or preservatives.</li>
            <li>I also got these complimentary for my honest review.</li>
            <li>main great thing is that business owners really care what they do and from what kind of ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have ordered the moisturizer and facial wash and fine this soap is ideal.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it leaves my body so clean.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best soap I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Finally I have found the perfect soap/gentle cleanser I have been looking for most of my adult life!!</li>
            <li>This is silky smooth on my skin and stopped the itchy feeling I had.</li>
            <li>Glycerin soaps are cheap to make</li>
            <li>but they left my skin feeling so silky smooth!!!</li>
            <li>Rich lather, cleansing, not too drying.</li>
            <li>I am clean and fresh without perfumes and residue!</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling clean</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and NOT chemicalized.  </li>
            <li>This one won out because it feels silky clean and leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li>and I swear I have never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>I feel so clean after using it.</li>
            <li>My skin is glowing and I am completely make up free!!</li>
            <li>Great soap, I have sensitive skin so the simplicity and organic nature of the ingredients have proven very beneficial (thanks :)</li>
            <li>Love the product but somewhat large for my hand</li>
            <li>Received a nice email after purchase and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The soap makes my skin very smooth and  this is the kind of  soap that  I will trust because  The soap is 100% natural and  highly  recommended to all.</li>
            <li>So be prepared for it to disappear quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a mild body cleanser</li>
            <li>the price &amp; the fact that is dissolves rather quickly, I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>I have never seen a companyas dedicated to their products as Christina Moss Naturals, Thank you so very much!</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best all natural soap I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>ONLY downside is that the soap gets used up kind of quickly, but I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li>This is fabulous soap, It lathers very well, and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for my honest review!&lt;br /&gt;I have oily/acne prone skin on my face chest shoulders and back</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve changed laundry detergents (love Nellies) and many other things in my life, but still problems.  </li>
            <li>Works great though on my dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This soap is extremely pure and mild.</li>
            <li>it goes fast!</li>
            <li>and I will most likely not even use it.</li>
            <li>Love using this for my entire body.</li>
            <li>and so glad to actually be using something that is completely chemical free.  </li>
            <li>I first tried this body soap in the sampler package with the shampoo, conditioner and face wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice gentle scent (all natural) and leaves my skin soft</li>
            <li>This is my second review because I cannot say enough of how great this product really is.</li>
            <li>My only issue was that it dissolved so quickly, especially when using it with a wash cloth or bath pouf, but I will continue to buy it as it really is the best soap I&#x27;ve found that I can actually use without irritation!</li>
            <li>BTW it&#x27;s the best soap I ever used for shaving, it doesn&#x27;t leave my feeling tight, dry or  filmy, and I really think it&#x27;s giving me a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>After cleansing, the skin feels dewy soft and moisturized as well as really clean, almost as if no additional lotion or moisturizer is needed - although I am looking forward to the soon to come Christina Moss body lotion.</li>
            <li>They do clean well and seem pure and natural.</li>
            <li>I set it on a dry wash cloth after use, and it does not get mushy or dissolve like so many others.</li>
            <li>and I really like the glycerin scent (no fragrance).</li>
            <li>Really like it and will re-buy.</li>
            <li>I like a gentle scent in my soaps.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Christina Moss Naturals</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really have a scent to them</li>
            <li>so I am usually very weary of what I use on it.</li>
            <li>Packaging was done securely and wrapped properly.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for your care in your product it is greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>, was I wrong, this soap is terrific in every way, it suds quickly, has a good fell in the hand, perfect for bath or sink use, and it won&#x27;t get MUSHY!, like other clear commercial soaps.</li>
            <li>That said, I love the way this soap leaves me feeling supple, not tight and dry at all.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other natural soap products, mostly from other websites &amp; food co-ops, then I accidently discover this item online with Amazon &amp; I was immediately amazed at how well my sensitive skin responded to the application - from day one!</li>
            <li>so I wanted a bath soap that was organic, pure and natural.</li>
            <li>Luckily this did not break me out or dry my skin too much to where it also caused breakouts.</li>
            <li>I really like the soap and like that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>This is very important for me as for a raw foodist.</li>
            <li>Paired with the exfoliating gloves this soap works very well for me and is gentle enough for use three times a day if needed.</li>
            <li>Thanks guys, keep up the good products and costumer service, you&#x27;ll never go wrong.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s very sensitive to every body wash</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re on a budget (like me), you&#x27;ll definitely need to factor in the costs of having to reorder more often than with other soaps.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure there must be other cheaper, all natural options that last longer.</li>
            <li>Even with my sensitive skin, the product still has chemicals in it that will irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>I do like this soap, but wow . . .</li>
            <li>I ordered it because I like to use natural products</li>
            <li>I handled this by storing it on my shower shelf out of the stream of the shower and this helped make it last much longer.  </li>
            <li>Silky, not perfumey, glides across your skin, leaving you feeling soft and supple all over.</li>
            <li>I am SO sensitive... everywhere.</li>
            <li>I ordered it because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I like a product that is natural, organic and not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>It must be because all of the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>only con is that it melts pretty fast, even with careful use.  </li>
            <li>but it was less harsh and not even close to as many chemicals!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel dried out when I use it and my skin feels clean without a film on it.</li>
            <li>has really helped our dry skin</li>
            <li>The company behind this product is very concerned about their product and has sent me several personal e-mails , asking if I was satisfied with their product, what else could you want?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not big on bar soaps but do like the products as far as cleansing.</li>
            <li>I really like that the soap isn&#x27;t fragranced, another reason maybe it should be called something other than &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; - because almost every soap on the market has added fragrance (even if it&#x27;s a so-called &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; fragrance)</li>
            <li>I like to try different products on the market these days, especially ones like this that are natural with no harmful additives.</li>
            <li>Therefore, lasts not very long but believe me, you&#x27;ll accept it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>It lathers easily in soft microscopic bubbles that glide onto the skin and provide deep clean without stripping or irritating surface skin.</li>
            <li>This product delivers such a gentle, thorough cleansing, maybe it should be called something other than &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;!</li>

            <li> This is my second review because I cannot say enough of how great this product really is.</li>
            <li> My only issue was that it dissolved so quickly, especially when using it with a wash cloth or bath pouf, but I will continue to buy it as it really is the best soap I&#x27;ve found that I can actually use without irritation!</li>
            <li> BTW it&#x27;s the best soap I ever used for shaving, it doesn&#x27;t leave my feeling tight, dry or  filmy, and I really think it&#x27;s giving me a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> After cleansing, the skin feels dewy soft and moisturized as well as really clean, almost as if no additional lotion or moisturizer is needed - although I am looking forward to the soon to come Christina Moss body lotion.</li>
            <li> They do clean well and seem pure and natural.</li>
            <li> I set it on a dry wash cloth after use, and it does not get mushy or dissolve like so many others.</li>
            <li> and I really like the glycerin scent (no fragrance).</li>
            <li> Really like it and will re-buy.</li>
            <li> I like a gentle scent in my soaps.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Christina Moss Naturals</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really have a scent to them</li>
            <li> so I am usually very weary of what I use on it.</li>
            <li> Packaging was done securely and wrapped properly.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for your care in your product it is greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> , was I wrong, this soap is terrific in every way, it suds quickly, has a good fell in the hand, perfect for bath or sink use, and it won&#x27;t get MUSHY!, like other clear commercial soaps.</li>
            <li> That said, I love the way this soap leaves me feeling supple, not tight and dry at all.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other natural soap products, mostly from other websites &amp; food co-ops, then I accidently discover this item online with Amazon &amp; I was immediately amazed at how well my sensitive skin responded to the application - from day one!</li>
            <li> so I wanted a bath soap that was organic, pure and natural.</li>
            <li> Luckily this did not break me out or dry my skin too much to where it also caused breakouts.</li>
            <li> I really like the soap and like that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> This is very important for me as for a raw foodist.</li>
            <li> Paired with the exfoliating gloves this soap works very well for me and is gentle enough for use three times a day if needed.</li>
            <li> Thanks guys, keep up the good products and costumer service, you&#x27;ll never go wrong.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s very sensitive to every body wash</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re on a budget (like me), you&#x27;ll definitely need to factor in the costs of having to reorder more often than with other soaps.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure there must be other cheaper, all natural options that last longer.</li>
            <li> Even with my sensitive skin, the product still has chemicals in it that will irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> I do like this soap, but wow . . .</li>
            <li> I ordered it because I like to use natural products</li>
            <li> I handled this by storing it on my shower shelf out of the stream of the shower and this helped make it last much longer.  </li>
            <li> Silky, not perfumey, glides across your skin, leaving you feeling soft and supple all over.</li>
            <li> I am SO sensitive... everywhere.</li>
            <li> I ordered it because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like a product that is natural, organic and not tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> It must be because all of the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> only con is that it melts pretty fast, even with careful use.  </li>
            <li> but it was less harsh and not even close to as many chemicals!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel dried out when I use it and my skin feels clean without a film on it.</li>
            <li> has really helped our dry skin</li>
            <li> The company behind this product is very concerned about their product and has sent me several personal e-mails , asking if I was satisfied with their product, what else could you want?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on bar soaps but do like the products as far as cleansing.</li>
            <li> I really like that the soap isn&#x27;t fragranced, another reason maybe it should be called something other than &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; - because almost every soap on the market has added fragrance (even if it&#x27;s a so-called &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; fragrance)</li>
            <li> I like to try different products on the market these days, especially ones like this that are natural with no harmful additives.</li>
            <li> Therefore, lasts not very long but believe me, you&#x27;ll accept it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> It lathers easily in soft microscopic bubbles that glide onto the skin and provide deep clean without stripping or irritating surface skin.</li>
            <li> This product delivers such a gentle, thorough cleansing, maybe it should be called something other than &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> But........it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft, never irritated (I do have sensitive skin), leaves no soap scum in my shower.</li>
            <li> Some soap bars smell bad, this one smells nice.</li>
            <li> I have an open one in my shower that I don&#x27;t use and the other bar is still wrapped and in my storage bin.</li>
            <li> I do not keep it in the shower as I had read other reviews that reported the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;Considering</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any feeling of dry</li>
            <li> but I did not particularly like the feel or fragrance of this soap</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It sits on the shelf away from the water spray in my shower and lasts just a little over a week with only one shower a day.  </li>
            <li> My only hang up being that it tends to leave my skin feeling a little oily and over moisturized.</li>
            <li> I did notice that the bar seemed to be getting smaller a little faster than I expected</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be happier with this body soap because I find it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like other products do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using just the bare minimum to soap up but still feels a little heavy.</li>
            <li> Not many of those left, I believe...</li>
            <li> ; this soap doesn&#x27;t, there is absolutely NO added scent!</li>
            <li> I have a filter on my shower to filter out chlorine and other unwanted chemicals</li>
            <li> I use other organic soaps that have mint etc.</li>
            <li> , I think this is because there are no chemicals in it to withstand the water breaking it down.</li>
            <li> This soap is dense and thick and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> just skin feels a little heavy and coated after use.</li>
            <li> It lathers up very thick (I use it with a shower pouf)</li>
            <li> Listen--Don&#x27;t bother with all the hype behind ProActivPlus, etc.</li>
            <li> So, I was skeptical about the claims made about this soap.</li>
            <li> but I noticed a lot of them have propylene glycol and that&#x27;s supposed to be bad for your kidneys.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with the soap.</li>
            <li> I have been greatly disappointed with commericial soaps regardless of their claims.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it because it leaves my body so clean. The soap makes my skin very smooth and  this is the kind of  soap that  I will trust because  The soap is 100% natural and  highly  recommended to all. I have tried many organic soaps but this soap is AAAAA+. The best  organic soap so far!  This soap is a keeper and a great find. I&#x27;m 150 % satisfied with this soap and exceeded beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best soap I have ever used.  This is silky smooth on my skin and stopped the itchy feeling I had. I would recommend this to anyone who has skin problems as this sooth&#x27;s the skin.  10+ Stars for this company and the follow-up they provide.  I have never seen a companyas dedicated to their products as Christina Moss Naturals, Thank you so very much!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Received a nice email after purchase and was pleasantly surprised. I think this company actually cares. Not many of those left, I believe...I do miss a scent, but I bought scent-less on purpose, so I got what I paid for, and I&#x27;ll get used to it. Will recommend it to anyone trying to be rid of chemicals. Rich lather, cleansing, not too drying.</li>
            <li> I love it. I am going to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great soap, no smell. I don&#x27;t like overpowering scents and there seems to be no scent at all to this soap! Cleans like it should, what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Love this soap!  I am clean and fresh without perfumes and residue!</li>
            <li> Listen--Don&#x27;t bother with all the hype behind ProActivPlus, etc. Even with my sensitive skin, the product still has chemicals in it that will irritate your skin. These bars of soap are super-gentle on the skin and have rectified my need to see a dermatologist! My acne has diminished dramatically since using this impeccable product. Kenny(CEO) Thank You for giving me the freedom to wear short-sleeves again! You are the best!</li>
            <li> I do like this soap, but wow . . . it goes fast! I use this with the exfoliating gloves and my skin feels great!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with the soap. I ordered it because I like to use natural products but I did not particularly like the feel or fragrance of this soap and I will most likely not even use it. I have an open one in my shower that I don&#x27;t use and the other bar is still wrapped and in my storage bin.</li>
            <li> I like glycerine soap but I noticed a lot of them have propylene glycol and that&#x27;s supposed to be bad for your kidneys. this does&#x27;t have it AND it&#x27;s unscented. A winner</li>
            <li> This is a great product and absolutely fabulous on my skin, especially since I have so many allergies!  My only issue was that it dissolved so quickly, especially when using it with a wash cloth or bath pouf, but I will continue to buy it as it really is the best soap I&#x27;ve found that I can actually use without irritation!</li>
            <li> This soap is quite good. It lathers up very thick (I use it with a shower pouf) and it doesn&#x27;t smell and doesn&#x27;t try out my skin or make it itch. It leaves me feeling clean and I really like the glycerin scent (no fragrance). There are no chemicals in this soap and I just feel good using it. I did notice that the bar seemed to be getting smaller a little faster than I expected, I think this is because there are no chemicals in it to withstand the water breaking it down. I handled this by storing it on my shower shelf out of the stream of the shower and this helped make it last much longer.  Really like it and will re-buy. If you don&#x27;t want to put chemicals on your skin, this is a great soap.</li>
            <li> The soap is very effective and gentle.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin. That said, I love the way this soap leaves me feeling supple, not tight and dry at all. Love it!</li>
            <li> I like a gentle scent in my soaps.  These have none.  They do clean well and seem pure and natural.</li>
            <li> Silky, not perfumey, glides across your skin, leaving you feeling soft and supple all over. I finished using my last bar, so I&#x27;m ordering more!!! Love this soap!!!</li>
            <li> Love using this for my entire body. I don&#x27;t feel dried out when I use it and my skin feels clean without a film on it. I do love that it&#x27;s Organic.  Some soap bars smell bad, this one smells nice.</li>
            <li> I ONLY PURCHASE THIS SOAP.  It leaves my skin feeling clean and NOT chemicalized.  Organic all the way.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!  This is hands down the best all natural soap I have ever purchased. Finally I have found the perfect soap/gentle cleanser I have been looking for most of my adult life!! LOVE it and so glad to actually be using something that is completely chemical free.  Thanks to Christina Moss Naturals I can now cleanse and moisturize as healthy as I eat :)  My skin is glowing and I am completely make up free!!</li>
            <li> This product delivers such a gentle, thorough cleansing, maybe it should be called something other than &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;! It lathers easily in soft microscopic bubbles that glide onto the skin and provide deep clean without stripping or irritating surface skin. It&#x27;s called &amp;#34;body soap&amp;#34; but I also used it on my face and loved the result. After cleansing, the skin feels dewy soft and moisturized as well as really clean, almost as if no additional lotion or moisturizer is needed - although I am looking forward to the soon to come Christina Moss body lotion. I really like that the soap isn&#x27;t fragranced, another reason maybe it should be called something other than &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; - because almost every soap on the market has added fragrance (even if it&#x27;s a so-called &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; fragrance); this soap doesn&#x27;t, there is absolutely NO added scent! I will be a repeat customer and anticipate sampling additional Christina Moss products.</li>
            <li> It feels good to use a soap without harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I am SO sensitive... everywhere. I&#x27;ve changed laundry detergents (love Nellies) and many other things in my life, but still problems.  So I went shopping.  I ordered about 10 specialty soaps (unscented, unadulterated, etc) that all looked pretty perfect.  This one won out because it feels silky clean and leaves no residue.  Doesn&#x27;t bother any part of me.  Finally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that it melts pretty fast, even with careful use.  I&#x27;ll definitely order again but if you&#x27;re on a budget (like me), you&#x27;ll definitely need to factor in the costs of having to reorder more often than with other soaps.</li>
            <li> I first tried this body soap in the sampler package with the shampoo, conditioner and face wash. I have a filter on my shower to filter out chlorine and other unwanted chemicals so I wanted a bath soap that was organic, pure and natural. This is fabulous soap, It lathers very well, and leaves no residue. I set it on a dry wash cloth after use, and it does not get mushy or dissolve like so many others. This soap is dense and thick and lasts a very long time. Great caring company with a great product.</li>
            <li> I like to try different products on the market these days, especially ones like this that are natural with no harmful additives. I recommend this soap for anyone. It&#x27;s got a nice gentle scent (all natural) and leaves my skin soft</li>
            <li> one bar only last about a week.  This stuff disappears so quickly it is amazing.  It sits on the shelf away from the water spray in my shower and lasts just a little over a week with only one shower a day.  Glycerin soaps are cheap to make and I&#x27;m sure there must be other cheaper, all natural options that last longer.</li>
            <li> Words can not express how much I love this soap. I use it with exfoliating gloves and I swear I have never felt so clean. It leaves my skin soft, never irritated (I do have sensitive skin), leaves no soap scum in my shower. I just wish they sold it in sets of 6 or even 12 (hint, hint) :)</li>
            <li> Very good soap. I did notice that it does not last though. So be prepared for it to disappear quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the product but somewhat large for my hand and I tend to drop it a lot.  Works great though on my dry sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m not big on bar soaps but do like the products as far as cleansing.</li>
            <li> This soap is extremely pure and mild. I ordered it because I have sensitive skin. I have been greatly disappointed with commericial soaps regardless of their claims. So, I was skeptical about the claims made about this soap. WOW!, was I wrong, this soap is terrific in every way, it suds quickly, has a good fell in the hand, perfect for bath or sink use, and it won&#x27;t get MUSHY!, like other clear commercial soaps. BTW it&#x27;s the best soap I ever used for shaving, it doesn&#x27;t leave my feeling tight, dry or  filmy, and I really think it&#x27;s giving me a closer shave.  The company behind this product is very concerned about their product and has sent me several personal e-mails , asking if I was satisfied with their product, what else could you want? What&#x27;s that, a volume discount, well good news, I just received a code to use on Amazon for 20% off my next order. Thanks guys, keep up the good products and costumer service, you&#x27;ll never go wrong.</li>
            <li> Great soaps! I got two as pictured in two different colors.  They don&#x27;t really have a scent to them but they left my skin feeling so silky smooth!!! I also got these complimentary for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Love the suds but, I think soap needs a fragrance. I use other organic soaps that have mint etc.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be happier with this body soap because I find it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like other products do. It is a mild body cleanser and I love it!</li>
            <li> I really like the soap and like that it is all natural. My only hang up being that it tends to leave my skin feeling a little oily and over moisturized. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out at all just skin feels a little heavy and coated after use. I&#x27;ve tried using just the bare minimum to soap up but still feels a little heavy. All in all it&#x27;s pretty good soap though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely happy with this product. It saponifies very easily. Therefore, lasts not very long but believe me, you&#x27;ll accept it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once a day I wash my head and body with it. I don&#x27;t have any feeling of dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;For head I also use Christina Moss Shampoo, cause I love it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main great thing is that business owners really care what they do and from what kind of ingredients. This is very important for me as for a raw foodist.</li>
            <li> This is the best organic soap that is out there on the Amazon internet market! I have tried many other natural soap products, mostly from other websites &amp; food co-ops, then I accidently discover this item online with Amazon &amp; I was immediately amazed at how well my sensitive skin responded to the application - from day one! I will never need to look for another organic soap because this is it people! It is rich in lather, smells great, reasonably priced, &amp; more importantly it has no SLN, SLES, Parabens, PG derivatives, fragrances or preservatives. This is my second review because I cannot say enough of how great this product really is. Thank you Christina Moss Naturals, thank you Kenny (CMN - CEO), &amp; thank you Amazon for making it possible for consumers like myself &amp; others who are health conscientious like-minded to have access to excellent hand-made organic cleansing bar of body &amp; face soap! 100% Satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STP Wave (Dan)</li>
            <li> Love it it&#x27;s the only soap that doesn&#x27;t irritate my daughters skin. She&#x27;s very sensitive to every body wash I&#x27;ve ever used on her.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. This soap is very good. No itching. Feels great. It&#x27;s even OK to use on your face.</li>
            <li> But........it doesn&#x27;t last long. I do not keep it in the shower as I had read other reviews that reported the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;Considering the price &amp; the fact that is dissolves rather quickly, I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest review!&lt;br /&gt;I have oily/acne prone skin on my face chest shoulders and back so I am usually very weary of what I use on it. Luckily this did not break me out or dry my skin too much to where it also caused breakouts. Paired with the exfoliating gloves this soap works very well for me and is gentle enough for use three times a day if needed. My skin is clearing up just as well with this as it was with my acne cleanser but it was less harsh and not even close to as many chemicals! I am in love.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the organic body soap.  Packaging was done securely and wrapped properly.  I have ordered the moisturizer and facial wash and fine this soap is ideal.  I like a product that is natural, organic and not tested on animals.  Thank you for your care in your product it is greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I will buy more.  My skin feels great.</li>
            <li> Love this soap!!! Very light scented and it suds up nice. I feel so clean after using it. Awesome soap and will order again!! Shampoo and conditioner us nice also</li>
            <li> Great soap, I have sensitive skin so the simplicity and organic nature of the ingredients have proven very beneficial (thanks :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY downside is that the soap gets used up kind of quickly, but I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> has really helped our dry skin</li>
            <li> Such wonderful soap. I use this with this company&#x27;s exfoliating gloves and I feel like I&#x27;m in heaven. My skin looks a lot nicer now that I switched to this non scented soap.</li>
            <li> For years my skin has been getting itchy in the shower from body soap. I have tried all kinds and couldn&#x27;t find a soap that wouldn&#x27;t cause me to itch. Until i tried this body soap. It must be because all of the ingredients are natural.</li>
