            <li>This seller delivered my package very quickly and it was well packaged too.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is too strong</li>
            <li>No, it didn&#x27;t eradicate my wrinkles - it isn&#x27;t supposed to and, let&#x27;s be honest, after a certain point, nothing does.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great part of a 3 step facial routine with Yonka products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially nice for int he summer, helps cool you down, just spritz some on and blot...</li>
            <li>Feels so good on my face - cool and soothing - I can&#x27;t imagine not using this on a daily basis!</li>
            <li>I had been tried large number of toners and I like YonKa Lotion PS Toner Normal - Dry Skin best!!</li>
            <li>bottle lasts forever, it is well worth the price, and I can&#x27;t recommend it more highly.</li>
            <li>Every woman should buy a container of Yonka right this minute.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is very light &amp; hydrating actually.</li>
            <li>fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li>My esthetician uses Yonka products and I love them but wasn&#x27;t a daily user.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been this soft and fabulous looking.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this toner I was hesitant at first to use a toner.</li>
            <li>I have used this for a long time and really love it</li>
            <li>My favorite Yonka product, keeps my skin from getting dry during the day.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and you only need 3 or so sprays to do the whole face.</li>
            <li>I see a huge difference in my pour size and overall complexion.</li>
            <li>I was worried this would be too much for me to use</li>
            <li>It is so much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li>I think all of them are reliable, easy on my skin and hydrating as my skin tends to be quite dry.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li>I lightly tap it into my skin and it serves as a great base before I use their Creme 11</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what is in it, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to find out</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve hit 35 and my skin has started to mature</li>
            <li>Sweet, Instant Relief...  for dry skin, in the desert.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin, and this makes my face feel soooo soft.</li>
            <li>Right after I use the Lait Nettoyant Cleansing Milk I follow up with a few sprays with the toner.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the huge glass bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my sixties, and my skin tone looks like it did ten years ago - soft, with smaller pores, and even color.</li>

            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite. She loves the Yonka products.  I love them, as well. Yonka keeps her looking as beautiful as the day we met.  With her natural beauty, she uses few makeup products.  Just the Yonka PS Toner, Yonka Stimulastine and lipstick.</li>
            <li> the most hydrating toner!  fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li> Great price&lt;br /&gt;Great service&lt;br /&gt;As usual</li>
            <li> I indulge with this toner whenever I can.  It smells so heavenly, and it lasts a long time.  It invigorates my skin, and hydrates it, too. Great for summer or winter.</li>
            <li> This is some kind of miracle spray. I don&#x27;t know what is in it, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to find out it&#x27;s a combination of pixie dust and oxygen. Better than coffee for waking up —and that is saying A LOT.</li>
            <li> It is very nice spray toner.&lt;br /&gt;I love it :)</li>
            <li> As noted above, Yonka is the best toner EVER!  Every woman should buy a container of Yonka right this minute.</li>
            <li> I have used Yonka products off and on for many years.  I think all of them are reliable, easy on my skin and hydrating as my skin tends to be quite dry.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I use it daily, and met my expectations. Plus, the price on Amazon was awesome!</li>
            <li> I had been tried large number of toners and I like YonKa Lotion PS Toner Normal - Dry Skin best!!</li>
            <li> It hydrates my skin well. I use it before applying moisturizer &amp; throughout the day if I need a litte extra moisturizing .</li>
            <li> My esthetician uses Yonka products and I love them but wasn&#x27;t a daily user. I was headed on a ski trip &amp; asked if she had any samples for dry weather skin. She gave me mini sizes of creame 25, 28, cleansing milk &amp; my favorite, this amazing toner. My skin has never been this soft and fabulous looking. Even in dry snowy weather. And this toner is heavenly. Now I use as a freshner during the day. LOVE YONKA.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this toner I was hesitant at first to use a toner. I tried them back in my high school years &amp; remember them to all be harsh &amp; over drying. Since I&#x27;ve hit 35 and my skin has started to mature I was worried this would be too much for me to use but I went ahead anyway since on the Yonka website they&#x27;re typically used together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toner is not alcohol or witch hazel based. It&#x27;s is very light &amp; hydrating actually. Right after I use the Lait Nettoyant Cleansing Milk I follow up with a few sprays with the toner. The bottle is huge and you only need 3 or so sprays to do the whole face. So it will last me months I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;After I put it on I lightly tap it into my skin and it serves as a great base before I use their Creme 11 Calming Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PS Toner would also make a great midday refreshing spray but I&#x27;ve found the product line in whole to be so wonderfully moisturizing that I&#x27;ve yet to have to rehydrate during the day. I will definitely try it out in the summer if that changes though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the toner...it&#x27;s a great part of a 3 step facial routine with Yonka products.</li>
            <li> My favorite Yonka product, keeps my skin from getting dry during the day.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. and the bottle is big. so I use it day and night  love the scent good toner</li>
            <li> Sweet, Instant Relief...  for dry skin, in the desert. This is a personal MUST have in my world. Best right after shower but works at anytime.</li>
            <li> smells great, feels great and makes my skin smoother. i just love it. i keep repeating this toner.&lt;br /&gt;i live in MA, so this toner helps new england cold winter.</li>
            <li> Face looks great after use.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Smells like lavender.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time and really love it</li>
            <li> Fragrance is too strong</li>
            <li> Love this product&lt;br /&gt;Used it for years.</li>
            <li> Feels so good on my face - cool and soothing - I can&#x27;t imagine not using this on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> skin toner is the best</li>
            <li> Yonka products have done wonders for my skin.  This toner feels great going on and refreshes the skin.  I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, if I stop using it I see a huge difference in my pour size and overall complexion. I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading about it in the Wall Street Journal. It is an excellent product for your skin, and this is an outstanding way to buy it</li>
            <li> It is so much cheaper than the salon. It is authentic. the most mist motion ever. It is my second time using it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and great company.  Excellent.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, fantastic price! Can&#x27;t beat it! It&#x27;s especially nice for int he summer, helps cool you down, just spritz some on and blot...</li>
            <li> Yonka toner was created by a physician to treat severely burned skin, and my aesthetician used it when I had a reaction to the wax she uses for eyebrows. The pain stopped immediately, the burning stopped immediately, and the redness faded almost immediately. She recommended it for regular use after cleansing, and I haven&#x27;t even tried anything else since. I&#x27;m in my sixties, and my skin tone looks like it did ten years ago - soft, with smaller pores, and even color. No, it didn&#x27;t eradicate my wrinkles - it isn&#x27;t supposed to and, let&#x27;s be honest, after a certain point, nothing does. But I&#x27;ve used this for six hers now, and don&#x27;t expect to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bottle lasts forever, it is well worth the price, and I can&#x27;t recommend it more highly.</li>
            <li> I love Yonka, but i love this stuff! I have had a dry patch for months and tried everything. My skin is dewy and I no longer have dry patch issues, thank you Yonka!</li>
            <li> Depending on the season, I may only need to use this toner on my face. I like using it in the winter time, when it gets so dry out, as another layer of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hydrate remember?</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. I have normal to dry skin, and this makes my face feel soooo soft. My only complaint is the huge glass bottle. I&#x27;ll just transfer some of it into a plastic spray bottle. This is expensive for a &amp;#34;toner&amp;#34; but it is well worth it to me. This seller delivered my package very quickly and it was well packaged too.</li>
            <li> HAPPY it was shipped in bubble wrap because envelope looked like it passed through Afghanistan.</li>
            <li> I have used Yonka products for years, and everytime I use this toner (twice a day) I say to myself \\&quot;Love this stuff!\\&quot;</li>
