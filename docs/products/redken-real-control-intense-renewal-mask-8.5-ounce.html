            <li>Really great scent.  </li>
            <li>I use this once a week and it is great for reviving hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product - - used it for years.</li>
            <li>This mask is great.</li>
            <li>My hair feels amazing!</li>
            <li>Use this once a week and my hair feels/looks amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>smells good and makes hair look and feel great.</li>
            <li>My hair feel nice!</li>
            <li>I bought it, kept it on for a while and while it felt nice when it was soaking into my hair, it made no difference once I rinsed it out!</li>
            <li>My best friend (who is also my stylist) Strongly recommended this to me.  </li>
            <li>and I needed a good conditioner to do a repair.</li>
            <li>Try the Aussie 3X moist conditioner or the 10X. Works really good and doesn&#x27;t make you cringe every time you run out because of the cost.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair wonderfully tamed, smooth, sleek, and easy to style!  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best products of the many great ones in the Redken Real Control line of hair products!  </li>
            <li>It arrived very fast, and is real good if you have brittle hair that is always falling out.</li>
            <li>My hair has literally never felt better!</li>
            <li>I am buying 3 more jars so I won&#x27;t run out for a while!</li>
            <li>It is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>Amazing product, what every girl needs.</li>
            <li>I saw so many good reviews on this product, so I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I also recalled how good most of the Redkin products smell.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I had hoped but it smells really nice.</li>
            <li>Fuller, softer, more manageable, and  my hair smells so good.</li>
            <li>It also smells nice.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m not too impressed, my hair seems kind of</li>
            <li>If you have curly hair like me a good follow up is Paul Mitchell original leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I found a PERFECT conditioner at the drugstore that smells really nice and only $5-6.</li>
            <li>I go around touching my own hair now all the time :-)  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already notice a huge difference in my hair!</li>
            <li>But I think the oil treatment is better and cheaper.</li>
            <li>and it makes it feel stronger and fuller after I use it, which I love because my hair had lost almost all of it&#x27;s shine and body.    </li>
            <li>I recently bought this after reading the awesome reviews here.</li>
            <li>Best hair conditioning treatment I&#x27;ve found outside a salon, for hair that is over-treated, over-styled and over-worked.</li>
            <li>grerat love this</li>
            <li>I am in love with this hair mask.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many conditioners once-</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>glad I Found it again.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so refreshing when a beauty product</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Finally found a product that I LOVE !!!!!  </li>
            <li>I would recommended to any one my wife love it, I order two</li>
            <li>but we will keep ordering more is A plus</li>
            <li>Works good if you use it consistently.</li>
            <li>The reviews on this were pretty good</li>
            <li>nice quality product and quick shipping</li>
            <li>I use the real control shampoo with the Intense renewal my hair is perfect with just a blowdry.</li>
            <li>Seems to be OK for my fine damage, dye and perm hair.  </li>
            <li>I heard really good reviews about this conditioner but something&#x27;s don&#x27;t work as well for certain hair types.</li>
            <li>It smells great and makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner and not heavy</li>
            <li>bought this at a salon supply store after the staff strongly recommended it to me.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for the super price as well!</li>
            <li>Great product went to order again price had doubled since buying last.  </li>
            <li>The product is amazing, it really helped my slip ends</li>
            <li>It does seem to repair the hair as it leaves it smooth.</li>
            <li>I will start by saying I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by a stylist, and I noticed a HUGE difference the very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I use it once a week and before every special occasion.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair.</li>
            <li>I shampoo and condition with Paul Mitchell Special Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>The price did seem pretty hefty but most Redken products are and usually worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made my super-damaged hair much stronger, softer, and more manageable.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very hydrated and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>This product helped repair my hair tremendously</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;super moisturizing\\&quot; product sounded like just what I needed.</li>
            <li>But I can say that it makes my hair super shiny</li>
            <li>Yet w/Redken Real Control it actually started making my hair better and better!</li>
            <li>Unless the price drops I probably will not repurchase this unless absolutely no other mask delivers results as nice.</li>
            <li>After so many years of having such nappy hair, I am now completely satisfied w/Redken Real Control!!</li>
            <li>This product is the next best thing as it makes the hair soft and shiny and very manageable.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping that after a few more repeated treatments my hair will appear to be much more healthy.</li>
            <li>Love this product and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Mine has a thick cortex, but, is fine in numbers of hair, and it is great</li>
            <li>Excellent conditioner especially for very dry hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe I just need to leave it in longer or use more of it at a time because my hair is so thick, but it doesn&#x27;t really seem to work all that great for me.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and how soft it leaves my hair</li>
            <li>She speaks very highly of it and says her hair got improved significantly.</li>
            <li>I have purchased it twice; the first few times I&#x27;ve used this product it was great, but it felt like my hair didn&#x27;t like as I was using it.</li>
            <li>Great suff -- my hair is fine but wavy and very thick -</li>
            <li>and my hair felt softer right after the first wash</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say this one smells as good as some of their other products.</li>
            <li>Good for curly thick hair since the formula of it is pretty rich.</li>
            <li>i recommend sitting under a dryer when using this, it really intensifies the treatment and its worth it.</li>
            <li>Works really well for my hair!</li>
            <li>This product really delivers on its promise!</li>
            <li>LOVE this product and wish it came in a bigger size!</li>
            <li>I later tried Moroccan Oil&#x27;s hydrating mask, it worked 100times better.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to pay so much for a hair mask, get one that works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I think it&#x27;s going to be a great weekly treatment to help bring my very bleached hair back to life!</li>
            <li>ANd you really can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use this properly (read the instructions).</li>
            <li>but I have definitely noticed my hair has gotten softer and more compliant</li>
            <li>I purchased my Redken Real Control Intense Renewal Mask on Amazon and received the item rather quickly.</li>
            <li>however if you have fine hair, you probably shouldn&#x27;t use it more than once a week as it might make your hair too heavy.</li>
            <li>I use it every other wash and it gives my hair a nice shine and softness.</li>
            <li>Absolute favorite deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>after about 2 weeks of using the intense renewal mask with the real control shampoo, WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and healthier feeling.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner - works instantly and keeps hair super healthy - usually use it twice a week.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Real Control line for quite some time now.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair with a gentle sulfate-free shampoo and squeezed the water out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It was like washing my hair and applying way too much styling product before blow-drying and the result was straight, but fried-looking hair.</li>
            <li>I have found that this product really does give me real control.</li>
            <li>It also moisturizes my ends very well, which is why I purchased it.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair with the &amp;#34;Redken Real Control&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>rinsed the shampoo out &amp; applied the &amp;#34; Redken Real Control</li>
            <li>Really moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I have really blond (bleach...)</li>
            <li>I  bought this because my hair is very over processed</li>
            <li>I had to use too much product to get it feeling both staight and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was damaged from coloring and using cheap products, however this products brought my hair back to life.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely will continue to use this.</li>
            <li>really* does what it claims it will do.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the results.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried the Chi intense renewal and a few other brands and this is by far the best product we have tried!</li>
            <li>I have really dry often brittle very curly hair that tangles easily.      </li>
            <li>It brought my hair (almost) back to its original health!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It provides much needed moisture to dry desensitized hair and has a rather pleasant smell; this container lasts for quite a while since I only use it once per week as a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>I can comb through my hair without breakage and it keeps my hair smooth after I blow it dry.  </li>
            <li>I have coarse overdyed hair and have tried many deep conditioners to remedy the problem.</li>
            <li>It lost one star because it does not smell as good as some of the other products they make, and the fact that I did not get more dramatic results.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for damaged or over colored hair.</li>
            <li>The All Soft line by Redken is MUCH better in my opinion, as it makes my hair softer and shinier, while the Real Control mask provides too much control and very little softness and shine.</li>
            <li>I recently bleached my hair and this has helped it so much to get it back to the healthy feeling it had prior to the bleach.</li>
            <li>After using this on my ends and the middle of my hair, I have noticed a huge difference in the amount of moisture and softness in my hair, definitely a blessing in this summer heat.</li>
            <li>I like this mask because its not heavy and has a decent smell to it.  </li>
            <li>My hair was super dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>Makes hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Just bought this product and used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>After all the reviews and using other redken products this is far better for my long hair..</li>
            <li>My hair is only a bit softer and a little more manageable after I use it.</li>
            <li>Makes my 62 year old hair, shiny and soft like a 30 year old.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I layer the All soft conditioner over the intense renewal if I need extra silkyness.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Blonde Idol over the Real Control, but they are both 5 star.</li>
            <li>Intense Renewal Mask.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I left it on for 8 minutes &amp; rinsed it out.  </li>
            <li>I used to use the All Soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright, it doesn&#x27;t work miracles for me like the old formula did.</li>
            <li>and it has resulted in a marked improvement in my hair health.</li>
            <li>My hair feels sooo soft.</li>
            <li>,Leaves hair soft, use once a month.  </li>
            <li>There was nothing wrong with it and the smell was good but didn&#x27;t linger in my hair.</li>
            <li>What I do is wash my hair first, towel dry, put my hair into a plastic shower cap and sit under the dryer for about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>My hair went from tangly, dry, coarse, and flyaway to smooth, relatively tangle-free, and soft-feeling.  </li>
            <li>I cant even recall how many different type of products i&#x27;ve used in the past for recovery of my hair.</li>
            <li>It is most like due to a combo of aging and the hard and highly chlorinated water in the new town</li>
            <li>I read tons of reviews elsewhere on the web, most saying the product is wonderful, and a few saying it was awful, and decided to try it for myself.</li>
            <li>and I just wet my hair, add a little more cream</li>
            <li>I dye my hair often and my boyfriend has super curly hair and puts gel in it everyday.</li>
            <li>It does take a little planning because I step out of the shower to put it on and then wait 15 minutes to rinse it out, but the results are definitely worth the effort.</li>
            <li>It is somewhat pricey, but one of the few pricey beauty products that is truly worth it imo.</li>
            <li>Smells good but doesnt feel very helpful or repairative for my hair :(</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair soft and shiny without weighting my hair down.</li>
            <li>I now use Real Control every other day - leave it in for 30 minutes after shampooing then rinse out.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t slide off like the other I can put it all over my hair and not use the whole container</li>
            <li>It works very well for THICK and VERY DAMAGED HAIR.</li>
            <li>That left my normally workable hair in a hot mess- dry, tangled and just looking like straw.</li>
            <li>I would not reccomend it for people with thin hair but other than that it really helped with my split ends and made my hair feel super soft!</li>
            <li>My hair is long and color treated as well as naturally curly.</li>
            <li>I bleached my dyed brown hair back to my natural blonde back in October and my hair was utterly destroyed.</li>
            <li>It started getting a little too much for my hair</li>
            <li>The mask made my hair a little smoother and softer at the roots, and helped me to get my hair very straight, but made my hair feel stiff and made my ends seem even drier than normal.</li>

            <li> I saw so many good reviews on this product, so I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I also recalled how good most of the Redkin products smell.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I had hoped but it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Fuller, softer, more manageable, and  my hair smells so good.</li>
            <li> It also smells nice.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m not too impressed, my hair seems kind of</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair like me a good follow up is Paul Mitchell original leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I found a PERFECT conditioner at the drugstore that smells really nice and only $5-6.</li>
            <li> I go around touching my own hair now all the time :-)  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already notice a huge difference in my hair!</li>
            <li> But I think the oil treatment is better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> and it makes it feel stronger and fuller after I use it, which I love because my hair had lost almost all of it&#x27;s shine and body.    </li>
            <li> I recently bought this after reading the awesome reviews here.</li>
            <li> Best hair conditioning treatment I&#x27;ve found outside a salon, for hair that is over-treated, over-styled and over-worked.</li>
            <li> grerat love this</li>
            <li> I am in love with this hair mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many conditioners once-</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> glad I Found it again.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so refreshing when a beauty product</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Finally found a product that I LOVE !!!!!  </li>
            <li> I would recommended to any one my wife love it, I order two</li>
            <li> but we will keep ordering more is A plus</li>
            <li> Works good if you use it consistently.</li>
            <li> The reviews on this were pretty good</li>
            <li> nice quality product and quick shipping</li>
            <li> I use the real control shampoo with the Intense renewal my hair is perfect with just a blowdry.</li>
            <li> Seems to be OK for my fine damage, dye and perm hair.  </li>
            <li> I heard really good reviews about this conditioner but something&#x27;s don&#x27;t work as well for certain hair types.</li>
            <li> It smells great and makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner and not heavy</li>
            <li> bought this at a salon supply store after the staff strongly recommended it to me.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for the super price as well!</li>
            <li> Great product went to order again price had doubled since buying last.  </li>
            <li> The product is amazing, it really helped my slip ends</li>
            <li> It does seem to repair the hair as it leaves it smooth.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a stylist, and I noticed a HUGE difference the very first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I use it once a week and before every special occasion.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair.</li>
            <li> I shampoo and condition with Paul Mitchell Special Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> The price did seem pretty hefty but most Redken products are and usually worth it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made my super-damaged hair much stronger, softer, and more manageable.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very hydrated and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> This product helped repair my hair tremendously</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;super moisturizing\\&quot; product sounded like just what I needed.</li>
            <li> But I can say that it makes my hair super shiny</li>
            <li> Yet w/Redken Real Control it actually started making my hair better and better!</li>
            <li> Unless the price drops I probably will not repurchase this unless absolutely no other mask delivers results as nice.</li>
            <li> After so many years of having such nappy hair, I am now completely satisfied w/Redken Real Control!!</li>
            <li> This product is the next best thing as it makes the hair soft and shiny and very manageable.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping that after a few more repeated treatments my hair will appear to be much more healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this product and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Mine has a thick cortex, but, is fine in numbers of hair, and it is great</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner especially for very dry hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just need to leave it in longer or use more of it at a time because my hair is so thick, but it doesn&#x27;t really seem to work all that great for me.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how soft it leaves my hair</li>
            <li> She speaks very highly of it and says her hair got improved significantly.</li>
            <li> I have purchased it twice; the first few times I&#x27;ve used this product it was great, but it felt like my hair didn&#x27;t like as I was using it.</li>
            <li> Great suff -- my hair is fine but wavy and very thick -</li>
            <li> and my hair felt softer right after the first wash</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say this one smells as good as some of their other products.</li>
            <li> Good for curly thick hair since the formula of it is pretty rich.</li>
            <li> i recommend sitting under a dryer when using this, it really intensifies the treatment and its worth it.</li>
            <li> Works really well for my hair!</li>
            <li> This product really delivers on its promise!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product and wish it came in a bigger size!</li>
            <li> I later tried Moroccan Oil&#x27;s hydrating mask, it worked 100times better.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to pay so much for a hair mask, get one that works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I think it&#x27;s going to be a great weekly treatment to help bring my very bleached hair back to life!</li>
            <li> ANd you really can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use this properly (read the instructions).</li>
            <li> but I have definitely noticed my hair has gotten softer and more compliant</li>
            <li> I purchased my Redken Real Control Intense Renewal Mask on Amazon and received the item rather quickly.</li>
            <li> however if you have fine hair, you probably shouldn&#x27;t use it more than once a week as it might make your hair too heavy.</li>
            <li> I use it every other wash and it gives my hair a nice shine and softness.</li>
            <li> Absolute favorite deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> after about 2 weeks of using the intense renewal mask with the real control shampoo, WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and healthier feeling.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner - works instantly and keeps hair super healthy - usually use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Real Control line for quite some time now.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair with a gentle sulfate-free shampoo and squeezed the water out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It was like washing my hair and applying way too much styling product before blow-drying and the result was straight, but fried-looking hair.</li>
            <li> I have found that this product really does give me real control.</li>
            <li> It also moisturizes my ends very well, which is why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair with the &amp;#34;Redken Real Control&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> rinsed the shampoo out &amp; applied the &amp;#34; Redken Real Control</li>
            <li> Really moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I have really blond (bleach...)</li>
            <li> I  bought this because my hair is very over processed</li>
            <li> I had to use too much product to get it feeling both staight and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged from coloring and using cheap products, however this products brought my hair back to life.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> really* does what it claims it will do.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the results.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried the Chi intense renewal and a few other brands and this is by far the best product we have tried!</li>
            <li> I have really dry often brittle very curly hair that tangles easily.      </li>
            <li> It brought my hair (almost) back to its original health!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It provides much needed moisture to dry desensitized hair and has a rather pleasant smell; this container lasts for quite a while since I only use it once per week as a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> I can comb through my hair without breakage and it keeps my hair smooth after I blow it dry.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse overdyed hair and have tried many deep conditioners to remedy the problem.</li>
            <li> It lost one star because it does not smell as good as some of the other products they make, and the fact that I did not get more dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for damaged or over colored hair.</li>
            <li> The All Soft line by Redken is MUCH better in my opinion, as it makes my hair softer and shinier, while the Real Control mask provides too much control and very little softness and shine.</li>
            <li> I recently bleached my hair and this has helped it so much to get it back to the healthy feeling it had prior to the bleach.</li>
            <li> After using this on my ends and the middle of my hair, I have noticed a huge difference in the amount of moisture and softness in my hair, definitely a blessing in this summer heat.</li>
            <li> I like this mask because its not heavy and has a decent smell to it.  </li>
            <li> My hair was super dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Makes hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Just bought this product and used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> After all the reviews and using other redken products this is far better for my long hair..</li>
            <li> My hair is only a bit softer and a little more manageable after I use it.</li>
            <li> Makes my 62 year old hair, shiny and soft like a 30 year old.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I layer the All soft conditioner over the intense renewal if I need extra silkyness.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Blonde Idol over the Real Control, but they are both 5 star.</li>
            <li> Intense Renewal Mask.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I left it on for 8 minutes &amp; rinsed it out.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the All Soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, it doesn&#x27;t work miracles for me like the old formula did.</li>
            <li> and it has resulted in a marked improvement in my hair health.</li>
            <li> My hair feels sooo soft.</li>
            <li> ,Leaves hair soft, use once a month.  </li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong with it and the smell was good but didn&#x27;t linger in my hair.</li>
            <li> What I do is wash my hair first, towel dry, put my hair into a plastic shower cap and sit under the dryer for about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> My hair went from tangly, dry, coarse, and flyaway to smooth, relatively tangle-free, and soft-feeling.  </li>
            <li> I cant even recall how many different type of products i&#x27;ve used in the past for recovery of my hair.</li>
            <li> It is most like due to a combo of aging and the hard and highly chlorinated water in the new town</li>
            <li> I read tons of reviews elsewhere on the web, most saying the product is wonderful, and a few saying it was awful, and decided to try it for myself.</li>
            <li> and I just wet my hair, add a little more cream</li>
            <li> I dye my hair often and my boyfriend has super curly hair and puts gel in it everyday.</li>
            <li> It does take a little planning because I step out of the shower to put it on and then wait 15 minutes to rinse it out, but the results are definitely worth the effort.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat pricey, but one of the few pricey beauty products that is truly worth it imo.</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesnt feel very helpful or repairative for my hair :(</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair soft and shiny without weighting my hair down.</li>
            <li> I now use Real Control every other day - leave it in for 30 minutes after shampooing then rinse out.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t slide off like the other I can put it all over my hair and not use the whole container</li>
            <li> It works very well for THICK and VERY DAMAGED HAIR.</li>
            <li> That left my normally workable hair in a hot mess- dry, tangled and just looking like straw.</li>
            <li> I would not reccomend it for people with thin hair but other than that it really helped with my split ends and made my hair feel super soft!</li>
            <li> My hair is long and color treated as well as naturally curly.</li>
            <li> I bleached my dyed brown hair back to my natural blonde back in October and my hair was utterly destroyed.</li>
            <li> It started getting a little too much for my hair</li>
            <li> The mask made my hair a little smoother and softer at the roots, and helped me to get my hair very straight, but made my hair feel stiff and made my ends seem even drier than normal.</li>
            <li> I have very course, thick, color-treated hair and this actually makes it feel soft.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, straight hair that I just had dyed ombre from dark brown to golden blonde in a matter of a few weeks.</li>
            <li> product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that this tub is smaller than the previous one I bought.</li>
            <li> Three words describe my hair right now: dry, damaged, and dull.</li>
            <li> I applied a few small scoops of the mask to my wet hair and then gently combed it through with a very wide-toothed comb.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months, along with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Overnight Repair treatment and Redken&#x27;s Time Reset Youth Revitalizer alongside Organix Teatree Mint and Garnier&#x27;s Triple Nutrition shampoo and conditioner in an attempt to make my dry frizzy hair soft, bring back my waves, and make my hair less porous.    </li>
            <li> and then I add the Redken Real Control and toss a shower cap on, I try to leave it on my hair for at least five minutes and then rinse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my long hair for 30 years and then blow drying it staight and flatironing it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not alive.</li>
            <li> I have really dry and frizzy hair due to bleaching &amp; daily flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I had my hair bleached around this time last year and it was extremely damaged.  </li>
            <li> After the hour passed, I rinsed my hair and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> so it is really dry and damaged at times.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t condition as well and stripped all of the oils out of my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It hydrates really dry hair quite well.</li>
            <li> My hair is so dry, so</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all which is a big plus!</li>
            <li> It was still very dry and frizzy though.</li>
            <li> I have bleached it multiple times, and this stuff keeps my hair from looking like a fried mess.</li>
            <li> My hair was mid neck length with lots of layers and bangs, so I only got it trimmed, but at least that got rid of the mushiness and plastic feeling.</li>
            <li> I have straight, thin, med length hair.</li>
            <li> but after few times of using it, my hair was back to square one.</li>
            <li> I have thick, frizz-prone, very dry, very coarse hair that is damaged from being chemically straightened, colored and flat</li>
            <li> i have long, bleached platinum hair that used to be thick but started falling out/breaking constantly</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> doen&#x27;t make it &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; like the other customer said.</li>
            <li> I tried a bunch of other conditioners and nothing helped.</li>
            <li> I have well water and have spent a lot of $$ trying to find something that works for me!</li>
            <li> I tried using Mane and Tail shampoo to help strengthen it after it was recommended to me, but that only made it ten times worse.    </li>
            <li> my hair dresser suggested this for dry hair and said to put it on and leave it on and watch a few hours of TV or read a book...then rinse...</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, thick, and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Holy crap, this stuff is magic in a jar.</li>
            <li> a lot less frizz, manageable looser curls, shine, less volume, extreme softness and my hair</li>
            <li> It flopped like wet noodles when damp and was hard and plastic like when it was dry.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week, it goes from awful dry to amazing.</li>
            <li> Assume the manufacture has redesigned the container with a slimmed down bottom design...</li>
            <li> I color my hair black every 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair became hard and dry.</li>
            <li> felt a lot less dried out/brittle.    </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, heavily damaged hair and nothing has worked like this before.</li>
            <li> also a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;ll keep using it until I run out since it does help a little, but I probably won&#x27;t buy another tub.</li>
            <li> used a little every time I shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s greats from an inch off the scalp and down!</li>
            <li> my hair literally looks like a million bucks everyday.  </li>
            <li> There were few products that I thought were purty</li>
            <li> It repairs damaged and dried ends.</li>
            <li> No matter what though, at the end of the day just remember that your hair is already dead so there is nothing you can do to make it &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I began using this product at the recommendation of my hair stylist after I complained to her of increasingly dry, dull and tangle-prone hair.</li>
            <li> not sure if  I will buy it again..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for those of us with hair really thick.</li>
            <li> Thick and curly one use SILK.&lt;br /&gt;AM PLANNING.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second tub in 5 months, which isn&#x27;t bad for medium length hair.</li>
            <li> : Do NOT use if you have thin hair, or even medium thickness.</li>
            <li> My friend used it who has somewhat thin hair</li>
            <li> My hair now has the chocolaty sheen it used to have and brushing through it is much less painful.</li>
            <li> Works just as well, if not better, than some very expensive ($50</li>
            <li> Whoever said you had to have thick hair was so very wrong.  </li>
            <li> Useless help to my hair.</li>
            <li> You are merely coating your hair with stuff to fake healthiness.</li>
            <li> and i was on the verge of cutting it all off.  </li>
            <li> (I have crazy curls).</li>
            <li> but my hair is in bad shape.      </li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> The way it arrived, howver was terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased my Redken Real Control Intense Renewal Mask on Amazon and received the item rather quickly. I have been using the Real Control line for quite some time now. It provides much needed moisture to dry desensitized hair and has a rather pleasant smell; this container lasts for quite a while since I only use it once per week as a deep conditioning treatment. The only con is that Redken shrunk the size of the jar, it was much larger, and now it is 8.5oz, and the same price.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week, it goes from awful dry to amazing. i recommend sitting under a dryer when using this, it really intensifies the treatment and its worth it. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I began using this product at the recommendation of my hair stylist after I complained to her of increasingly dry, dull and tangle-prone hair. It is most like due to a combo of aging and the hard and highly chlorinated water in the new town I recently moved to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has done wonders to combat and even reverse the drying effects. My hair now has the chocolaty sheen it used to have and brushing through it is much less painful. I leave it in for 15 mins and then rinse (1-2x a week). I&#x27;m on my second tub in 5 months, which isn&#x27;t bad for medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner - works instantly and keeps hair super healthy - usually use it twice a week. The way it arrived, howver was terrible. Had to wipe up and salvage any conditioner i could and put it in another container. Box looked like it had been run over.</li>
            <li> Redken renewal Mask has helped my hair get softer and fuller. I would recommend this this product.</li>
            <li> bought this at a salon supply store after the staff strongly recommended it to me.  i have long, bleached platinum hair that used to be thick but started falling out/breaking constantly and i was on the verge of cutting it all off.  after about 2 weeks of using the intense renewal mask with the real control shampoo, WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  there is no hair in the shower drain anymore!  it&#x27;s made my super-damaged hair much stronger, softer, and more manageable. my hair literally looks like a million bucks everyday.  however if you have fine hair, you probably shouldn&#x27;t use it more than once a week as it might make your hair too heavy. also a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> Seems to be OK for my fine damage, dye and perm hair.  But I think the oil treatment is better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me. After using it, my hair became hard and dry.</li>
            <li> Great product. Wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I had my hair bleached around this time last year and it was extremely damaged.  I have very coarse, thick, and curly hair.  This product helped repair my hair tremendously and I have been using it ever since!  I now am back to brown but still use this conditioner because my hair is still damaged in some areas.  I can comb through my hair without breakage and it keeps my hair smooth after I blow it dry.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have really dry often brittle very curly hair that tangles easily.      I washed my hair with a gentle sulfate-free shampoo and squeezed the water out of my hair.  I applied a few small scoops of the mask to my wet hair and then gently combed it through with a very wide-toothed comb.  I then covered my hair with a plastic shower cap and let it sit in my hair for an hour (I know the directions read 5-15mins) but my hair is in bad shape.      After the hour passed, I rinsed my hair and let it air dry.  Results, a lot less frizz, manageable looser curls, shine, less volume, extreme softness and my hair felt a lot less dried out/brittle.    A little goes a long way...This one is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I read tons of reviews elsewhere on the web, most saying the product is wonderful, and a few saying it was awful, and decided to try it for myself. I have thick, frizz-prone, very dry, very coarse hair that is damaged from being chemically straightened, colored and flat ironed. This \\&quot;super moisturizing\\&quot; product sounded like just what I needed. But, it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. After leaving the mask on my hair for 30 minutes, I rinsed, blow-dried, and flat-ironed my hair. The mask made my hair a little smoother and softer at the roots, and helped me to get my hair very straight, but made my hair feel stiff and made my ends seem even drier than normal. It was like washing my hair and applying way too much styling product before blow-drying and the result was straight, but fried-looking hair. The All Soft line by Redken is MUCH better in my opinion, as it makes my hair softer and shinier, while the Real Control mask provides too much control and very little softness and shine.</li>
            <li> nice quality product and quick shipping</li>
            <li> I have straight, thin, med length hair. I have been using this mask for a couple of years now.  I use the Real Control Conditioner daily and the mask once in a few weeks.  It really makes my hair soft and shiny without weighting my hair down. It&#x27;s a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that this tub is smaller than the previous one I bought. I double checked the 2 containers and they show the same weight 8.5oz. Assume the manufacture has redesigned the container with a slimmed down bottom design... However, this is not an issue with the seller.</li>
            <li> This was literally my lifesaver. After over-processing my hair several times, it looked and felt like straw. Believe me, I have literally tried it all. I saw so many good reviews on this product, so I decided to try it. Holy crap, this stuff is magic in a jar. My hair has literally never felt better! I am buying 3 more jars so I won&#x27;t run out for a while!</li>
            <li> My hair is long and color treated as well as naturally curly. I have found that this product really does give me real control. I use it once a week and before every special occasion. My hair has never been smoother or shinier. It does take a little planning because I step out of the shower to put it on and then wait 15 minutes to rinse it out, but the results are definitely worth the effort.</li>
            <li> product great. smells good and makes hair look and feel great. Packaging and shipping packaging could be improved upon</li>
            <li> I bleached my dyed brown hair back to my natural blonde back in October and my hair was utterly destroyed. It flopped like wet noodles when damp and was hard and plastic like when it was dry. My hair was mid neck length with lots of layers and bangs, so I only got it trimmed, but at least that got rid of the mushiness and plastic feeling. It was still very dry and frizzy though. I tried using Mane and Tail shampoo to help strengthen it after it was recommended to me, but that only made it ten times worse.    I&#x27;ve been using this for about two months, along with L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Overnight Repair treatment and Redken&#x27;s Time Reset Youth Revitalizer alongside Organix Teatree Mint and Garnier&#x27;s Triple Nutrition shampoo and conditioner in an attempt to make my dry frizzy hair soft, bring back my waves, and make my hair less porous.    Maybe I just need to leave it in longer or use more of it at a time because my hair is so thick, but it doesn&#x27;t really seem to work all that great for me. My hair is only a bit softer and a little more manageable after I use it. But I can say that it makes my hair super shiny and it makes it feel stronger and fuller after I use it, which I love because my hair had lost almost all of it&#x27;s shine and body.    All in all, I&#x27;ll keep using it until I run out since it does help a little, but I probably won&#x27;t buy another tub.</li>
            <li> Works really well for my hair!</li>
            <li> This product really delivers on its promise! I have coarse overdyed hair and have tried many deep conditioners to remedy the problem. I now use Real Control every other day - leave it in for 30 minutes after shampooing then rinse out. Terrific results. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Makes my 62 year old hair, shiny and soft like a 30 year old.</li>
            <li> I use it everytime I wash my hair and it has helped me a lot in recovering it&#x27;s  moisture and shine after I had an accident were I burned my hair.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this after reading the awesome reviews here. It is pretty awesome. I have thick, coarse, straight hair that I just had dyed ombre from dark brown to golden blonde in a matter of a few weeks. That left my normally workable hair in a hot mess- dry, tangled and just looking like straw. I knew I needed to upgrade my deep conditioner and bought this and Redken Blonde Idol conditioning mask. I am blown away. I don&#x27;t know why I had not tried Redken&#x27;s products earlier but you should, NOW. I prefer the Blonde Idol over the Real Control, but they are both 5 star. You pick!</li>
            <li> Best hair conditioning treatment I&#x27;ve found outside a salon, for hair that is over-treated, over-styled and over-worked.</li>
            <li> grerat love this if your hair is fried from bleaching this would b great for it alesome product !! u should get</li>
            <li> Great product went to order again price had doubled since buying last.  Will not order again until price lowers.  Disappointed</li>
            <li> Perfect for my hair!!!!!! Redken products suit perfect w me. I prefer these than others I tried before. My hair feel nice!</li>
            <li> overall, I like it. I have purchased it twice; the first few times I&#x27;ve used this product it was great, but it felt like my hair didn&#x27;t like as I was using it. not sure if  I will buy it again..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair. Smells good but doesnt feel very helpful or repairative for my hair :(</li>
            <li> Amazing product, what every girl needs. great seller, perfect arrival. really happy.</li>
            <li> It arrived very fast, and is real good if you have brittle hair that is always falling out. It also moisturizes my ends very well, which is why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this hair mask. It smells great and makes my hair shiny and soft. The shipping was fast as well. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many conditioners once- then have thrown them in the trash after.&lt;br /&gt;This one&#x27;s a keeper. I washed my hair with the &amp;#34;Redken Real Control&amp;#34; shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed the shampoo out &amp; applied the &amp;#34; Redken Real Control Intense Renewal Mask.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I left it on for 8 minutes &amp; rinsed it out.  My hair looked silky, shiny &amp; smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Really moisturizing.  Really great scent.  Lasts a while. I have really blond (bleach...) hair so it is really dry and damaged at times.  This product definitely helped.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week and it is great for reviving hair.  Makes hair very soft.</li>
            <li> This product is a life saver.  I used to get Redken shots when I went to a salon.  This product is the next best thing as it makes the hair soft and shiny and very manageable.  I see the difference in the overall condition of my hair after using this product twice.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair often and my boyfriend has super curly hair and puts gel in it everyday. We buy this product often and use it one to two times a week and you can just feel a difference in the way your hair feels without even having to touch it! We&#x27;ve tried the Chi intense renewal and a few other brands and this is by far the best product we have tried!</li>
            <li> I  bought this because my hair is very over processed and I needed a good conditioner to do a repair. I also recalled how good most of the Redkin products smell. I can&#x27;t really say this one smells as good as some of their other products. What I do is wash my hair first, towel dry, put my hair into a plastic shower cap and sit under the dryer for about 15 to 20 minutes. I am hoping that after a few more repeated treatments my hair will appear to be much more healthy. It lost one star because it does not smell as good as some of the other products they make, and the fact that I did not get more dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used just about everything to control the frizz on my overprocessed hair.  I&#x27;ve been coloring my long hair for 30 years and then blow drying it staight and flatironing it. I had to use too much product to get it feeling both staight and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use the real control shampoo with the Intense renewal my hair is perfect with just a blowdry. I used to use the All Soft but it didn&#x27;t condition as well and stripped all of the oils out of my dry hair.  Sometimes I layer the All soft conditioner over the intense renewal if I need extra silkyness. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product and wish it came in a bigger size!</li>
            <li> I like this mask because its not heavy and has a decent smell to it.  I use it every other wash and it gives my hair a nice shine and softness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, it doesn&#x27;t work miracles for me like the old formula did. For me it can be used as a regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> My best friend (who is also my stylist) Strongly recommended this to me.  It is now a part of my daily hair regimen.  I shampoo and condition with Paul Mitchell Special Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner and then I add the Redken Real Control and toss a shower cap on, I try to leave it on my hair for at least five minutes and then rinse.  It leaves my hair very hydrated and healthy looking.  If you have curly hair like me a good follow up is Paul Mitchell original leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner and not heavy</li>
            <li> it does the job but its not the best ive used</li>
            <li> Great product - - used it for years.</li>
            <li> I have very course, thick, color-treated hair and this actually makes it feel soft. Works just as well, if not better, than some very expensive ($50+) brands like kerastase. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of deep conditioners, but this is the one I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Just bought this product and used it for the first time last night. It works very well for THICK and VERY DAMAGED HAIR. I just bleached mine last month twice and then dyed it. It brought my hair (almost) back to its original health!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: Do NOT use if you have thin hair, or even medium thickness. It&#x27;s for those of us with hair really thick. My friend used it who has somewhat thin hair and it didn&#x27;t help. She said it made her hair feel hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, awesome product!</li>
            <li> Great suff -- my hair is fine but wavy and very thick - this reduces the frizzies &amp; I used a little every time I shampoo.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner especially for very dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have really dry and frizzy hair due to bleaching &amp; daily flat ironing. I cant even recall how many different type of products i&#x27;ve used in the past for recovery of my hair. There were few products that I thought were purty alright but after few times of using it, my hair was back to square one. Yet w/Redken Real Control it actually started making my hair better and better! After so many years of having such nappy hair, I am now completely satisfied w/Redken Real Control!! &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Three words describe my hair right now: dry, damaged, and dull. My stylist recommended this mask to help repair the hair, strengthen it and bring some life back to it. I bought it, kept it on for a while and while it felt nice when it was soaking into my hair, it made no difference once I rinsed it out! It felt like it had done nothing! I later tried Moroccan Oil&#x27;s hydrating mask, it worked 100times better. If you&#x27;re going to pay so much for a hair mask, get one that works! For my hair type, it was not this one!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t moisturize as well as I had hoped but it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Works good if you use it consistently. It repairs damaged and dried ends.</li>
            <li> I heard really good reviews about this conditioner but something&#x27;s don&#x27;t work as well for certain hair types. It&#x27;s always a hit or miss. There was nothing wrong with it and the smell was good but didn&#x27;t linger in my hair. I found a PERFECT conditioner at the drugstore that smells really nice and only $5-6. Try the Aussie 3X moist conditioner or the 10X. Works really good and doesn&#x27;t make you cringe every time you run out because of the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice now and I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s repairing or doing what it says it&#x27;s suppose too. The reviews on this were pretty good and it is Redken but so far I&#x27;m not too impressed, my hair seems kind of straw-like after I use it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I recently bleached my hair and this has helped it so much to get it back to the healthy feeling it had prior to the bleach. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Useless help to my hair. They&#x27;ve changed the formula or something.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  My hair was damaged from coloring and using cheap products, however this products brought my hair back to life.  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Mary Poppins.</li>
            <li> my hair dresser suggested this for dry hair and said to put it on and leave it on and watch a few hours of TV or read a book...then rinse...it did the trick...</li>
            <li> This product smells so good! After using it and washing it out it does make my hair feel smoother than before.</li>
            <li> This stuff has saved my hair. I have bleached it multiple times, and this stuff keeps my hair from looking like a fried mess. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Used redden in the 80s and 90s glad I Found it again.  I have  butt length hair. Thick and curly one use SILK.&lt;br /&gt;AM PLANNING. ON ORDERING MATCHING SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but I think it&#x27;s going to be a great weekly treatment to help bring my very bleached hair back to life! ANd you really can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how soft it leaves my hair</li>
            <li> Love this product and can&#x27;t live without it. I have curly hair and I leave it in daily - I only wash every 3-4 days and I just wet my hair, add a little more cream and I&#x27;m good to go. Love it!</li>
            <li> I color my hair black every 2-3 weeks. It started getting a little too much for my hair so I decided to try this. The price did seem pretty hefty but most Redken products are and usually worth it. I will start by saying I was not disappointed. This thing re-newed my hair and made it feel like silk, along with a beautiful shine! My husband even commented on it not knowing I had put this in my hair. I highly recommend this product for damaged or over colored hair.</li>
            <li> This mask is great. It hydrates really dry hair quite well. I use it once a week and it has resulted in a marked improvement in my hair health. Absolutely will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so refreshing when a beauty product *really* does what it claims it will do.  This is one of those products.  This was recommended to me by a stylist, and I noticed a HUGE difference the very first time I used it.  My hair went from tangly, dry, coarse, and flyaway to smooth, relatively tangle-free, and soft-feeling.  I go around touching my own hair now all the time :-)  It is somewhat pricey, but one of the few pricey beauty products that is truly worth it imo.</li>
            <li> I do not use it myself but buying for my wife all the time. She speaks very highly of it and says her hair got improved significantly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I use it twice a week, Wednesday and Saturdays. My hair feels amazing! Fuller, softer, more manageable, and  my hair smells so good. It is definitely working wonders for my over processed, colored, and damaged hair. My hairdresser is very impressed also!</li>
            <li> The product is amazing, it really helped my slip ends and my hair felt softer right after the first wash&lt;br /&gt;It got here on time.</li>
            <li> Good for curly thick hair since the formula of it is pretty rich. I would not reccomend it for people with thin hair but other than that it really helped with my split ends and made my hair feel super soft!</li>
            <li> After all the reviews and using other redken products this is far better for my long hair.. it doesn&#x27;t slide off like the other I can put it all over my hair and not use the whole container and it doesn&#x27;t drip off... I will purchase again and again!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair extremely soft and smooth. It also restores it after I straighten it throughout the week.</li>
            <li> My hair feels sooo soft. Just make sure to use this properly (read the instructions). No matter what though, at the end of the day just remember that your hair is already dead so there is nothing you can do to make it &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34;. You are merely coating your hair with stuff to fake healthiness. Think of hair as a leather handbag, you can&#x27;t fix damaged leather but you can shine it, protect it, and etc. but it&#x27;s not alive.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I try to use it once a week since it is on the pricey side but I have definitely noticed my hair has gotten softer and more compliant (I have crazy curls).</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products of the many great ones in the Redken Real Control line of hair products!  Leaves hair wonderfully tamed, smooth, sleek, and easy to style!  Thank you for the super price as well!</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Best I&#x27;ve used to date!</li>
            <li> This is awesome! My hair is so dry, so once a week I leave this in there for 1/2 hour after my shower, then rinse it out. Best purchase ever!!!</li>
            <li> Use this once a week and my hair feels/looks amazing!</li>
            <li> ,Leaves hair soft, use once a month.  Whoever said you had to have thick hair was so very wrong.  Mine has a thick cortex, but, is fine in numbers of hair, and it is great........doen&#x27;t make it &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; like the other customer said.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, heavily damaged hair and nothing has worked like this before. I noticed a difference after only using it twice. Amazing!</li>
            <li> works well to reduce dryness in hair.</li>
            <li> Absolute favorite deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair was super dry and brittle. I tried a bunch of other conditioners and nothing helped. I&#x27;ve used this 4 times now and I&#x27;ve already notice a huge difference in my hair! It&#x27;s super soft and healthier feeling. It also doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair at all which is a big plus!</li>
            <li> Have used this before and I really like the results. It does seem to repair the hair as it leaves it smooth. It also smells nice.</li>
            <li> Finally found a product that I LOVE !!!!!  I have well water and have spent a lot of $$ trying to find something that works for me!</li>
            <li> I would recommended to any one my wife love it, I order two but we will keep ordering more is A plus</li>
            <li> It leaves a bit of a waxy build-up, so I don&#x27;t recommend you leave this on your scalp overnight (like I did). It&#x27;s greats from an inch off the scalp and down! *EDIT* After using this on my ends and the middle of my hair, I have noticed a huge difference in the amount of moisture and softness in my hair, definitely a blessing in this summer heat. However, when I bought this mask it was $11, and now it&#x27;s gone up to $40! Unless the price drops I probably will not repurchase this unless absolutely no other mask delivers results as nice.</li>
