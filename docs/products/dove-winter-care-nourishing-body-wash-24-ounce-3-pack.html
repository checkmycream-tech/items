            <li> Use it daily, great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> THE best body wash for dry skin no matter what the season</li>
            <li> skin in very well hydrated!</li>
            <li> What can I say? It&#x27;s soap! Jump in the tub with it, and, when you get out, you will have clean, soft skin! It smells really nice, also.</li>
            <li> Dove Winter Care helps to combat my winter dry skin so well!  I&#x27;ve always had success using Dove products and this one didn&#x27;t disapoint.  Thank you Dove.</li>
            <li> Keps the skin soft and the body clean, what more could one ask for...</li>
            <li> Best body wash I have ever used. Thick, creamy, and smells great. Also moisturizes wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.  I use it all year round because of my dry skin.  I just  bought another pack for this summer and was very disapointed that it now carries a very strong parfume.  As an asthmatic, parfumes can be life endangering for me.  I am hoping that the company will come out with an unscented version soon.</li>
            <li> I have used other Dove products better than this one. I will possibly stick to those products. Its always a hit or a miss buying such things online without having used them before.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great on healing dry skin! I would recommend this product. I only wish it smelled a bit better.</li>
            <li> My Daughter in Law loves this product. We can only find it @ Costco in  winter time. There were 3 full size bottles. I actually kept one to use. Great product, it really moisturizes and was actually cheaper for what I usually get @ Costco.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both LOVE this product. Best ever for dry winter skin!!! Wish it was available in stores all year!</li>
            <li> This body wash really does seem to keep my skin softer and my legs less dry though all the seasons.  I live in a dry area and even my husband says he is &amp;#34;less dusty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have bought this body wash for the past two winters here in Utah. Whenever that cooooold winter air sets in here, it stays. For months. And doesn&#x27;t go away. Which means my skin stays dry, dull and flaky. For months. And it doesn&#x27;t get better. Until I started using this body wash. I have been impressed with Dove products over the years, so I figured I would give this product a shot. First thing first, it is ridiculously creamy. Creamier than any other body wash I have ever tried. And I&#x27;ve tried a lot. I&#x27;m a toiletry junkie. It feels as though you are washing with half body-wash and half lotion. It lathers up very nicely with even a small amount on a loofah. It glides over your skin effortlessly and does not leave you with that weird soap feeling on your skin (you know what I&#x27;m talking about!) It truly does moisturize your skin even though it is only on there a short amount of time. I would HIGHLY recommend buying this body wash, even if you aren&#x27;t stuck in a cold and dry climate six months out of the year like here in Utah. You will not be disappointed as your skin will feel moistruzied, glowing and not flaky. And, not to mention, it smells so yummy! Which we girls all know is VERY important when it comes to products we use on our bodies.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Price&lt;br /&gt;2. Actually works- leaves skin feeling like that moisturized, glowing summer skin we all want&lt;br /&gt;3. Smells yummy!&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. None!</li>
            <li> Too think and doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  Don&#x27;t see any difference in skin condition compared to other products.</li>
            <li> If you want soft skin buy this</li>
            <li> you can tell the difference using this product, skin is less dry</li>
            <li> We live in an area which has very dry summers followed by very dry winters.  Our summer humidity is often less than 15% with winter being not much better.  As such, our skin gets very, very dry.  The first use my wife noticed a difference and made me &amp;#34;check&amp;#34;.  Yes, her legs were softer.  My first use was much the same.  My legs, which would get very itchy at work, never once bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second use was only better.  This stuff works!  Follow the directions and lather it up.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash. The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming, it&#x27;s refreshing and it lingers on your skin/clothes all day. It also moisturizes my skin so well sometimes I can skip putting on lotion. This is a really good price too.. thank you Dove!</li>
            <li> I just love this product.For the winter time it is  wonderful. No more elephant skin for me in the winter.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry winter months!</li>
            <li> I saw this mentioned on a beauty blog to help ease dry winter skin.  It made note of the fact that this wash ha both&lt;br /&gt;sodium cocoyl isethionate and sodium cocoyl glycinate, which are both another mild cleansers that are gentle to the skin (the latter ingredient is usually found in high-end facial products)&lt;br /&gt;Since my skin is getting itchy and dry as the cold weather wears on, I decided to give this wash a try-- thumbs up!

            <li> Love the softness of my skin. My skin stays soft too. Relieved itching dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great body wash to use during the winter especially. If you don&#x27;t like to put on body lotion or don&#x27;t have the time to, using this will help your skin. This is a very thick cream which provides great moisturizing properties and does not dry out your skin like most gel based body washes do.</li>
