            <li>and then this finishes it off beautifully.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to help style and control my hair and it works beautifully for it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get beautiful curls and flips in my shoulder length hair with this tool</li>
            <li>beautifully otherwise, great curls and dries well.</li>
            <li>This may be a very good styler,however it does not do a good job of drying the hair.</li>

            <li>The release button is a great thing to have.</li>

            <li>Works perfectly, was pleased to find this since I&#x27;ve been using this for 13 years</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and performs perfectly!  </li>
            <li>It is wonderful for me and my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This product is wonderful for my shortish fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the best for styling my permed, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>But I still think this is the best product for one-handed styling of fine hair.</li>
            <li>Best dryer/iron I&#x27;ve ever used on my baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this product would be good for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>If you are good with your hands, it helps a litte bit.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find it on Amazon.com and bought TWO, a one-inch barrel and a 1 and 1/2 inch barrel and by the way, the barrels are inter-changeable.</li>
            <li>Good for drying your hair but does nothing for styling.</li>
            <li>good service</li>
            <li>Fabulous tool for perfect styling.</li>
            <li>I am delighted with this tool.</li>
            <li>I loved this tool.</li>
            <li>It is good value for the money</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find it on Amazon for a cheaper price than I had paid for it three (3) years ago.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted that I could find it on Amazon!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good price ?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too good at using it-</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s still a good thing.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to buy this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>WORKS FAIR.</li>
            <li>This brush is going to the Good Will.</li>
            <li>Good choice.</li>
            <li>Do this on every slot then it is good to go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good value for money.</li>
            <li>Good for medium length hair styles.</li>
            <li>It seemed like a good idea</li>
            <li>For the price, it is still a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I was so delighted to succeed in finding these appliances.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Susan wise</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>it does make my hair look every bit as good- sleek with good body.  </li>
            <li>It did not work as good as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>This product is fair.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived on time and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>The quality of this styler/dryer is really good.</li>
            <li>and I got a good price on it.</li>
            <li>The price was good to try something like this too.</li>
            <li>ITS A GOOD PRODUCT  </li>
            <li>Good hair styling tool, priced well.  </li>
            <li>So, I ordered another one, and this one the cord doesn&#x27;t make good connection, so each time and turn the handle, it cuts off...</li>
            <li>Recieved product in good condition and working order.</li>
            <li>a good brand too at a good price.  </li>
            <li>it looks good, but I didn&#x27;t use it yet,</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Dont make the mistake of reading all the good reviews and buy this.</li>
            <li>Good for travel usage.  </li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise a good buy and will work well for travel.</li>
            <li>Package and appearance good.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>I did buy a Salon Edition brand in the 3/4\\&quot; size, but it is not as good a product as Sassoon.</li>
            <li>Good size with 1 inch barrel.</li>
            <li>I have never been good at styling my hair.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good for convenience but the wires inside break because of the twisting.</li>
            <li>Good price, too.</li>
            <li>good product for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not a good choice.</li>
            <li>of them work as good as this</li>
            <li>It does do a good job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to lift the roots and curl the ends.</li>
            <li>This product has not one good thing going for it.</li>
            <li>Loved it</li>
            <li>Best tangle free iron out there.  </li>
            <li>CAME IN GOOD TIME</li>
            <li>It is fairly noisy.</li>
            <li>The size is good for medium length hair.</li>
            <li>Over all does a good job.</li>
            <li>I guess this is good if you know how to use it.  </li>
            <li>The brush does a good job of setting a curl in your hair;&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>

            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I have always used a blow dryer to get most of the water out of my hair and then used this great airstyler to finish it off.  </li>
            <li>About five years ago I was able to purchase this item in the store and it was a great tool for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with product.</li>

            <li>More than happy</li>
            <li>I was really happy to find it available here and put this one away as a spare!</li>
            <li>It works great, but the top keeps popping off and so the brush part likewise falls off.</li>
            <li>The rubber grips my hair good for a nice roll.</li>
            <li>to be honest, this one is good among all the air brush dryer products, but i wanted a iron one, so i returned it .</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, and just the right size brush...</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s perfect, and the 1 inch barrel is just right for me.  </li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might mention, too, that it is incredibly lightweight, something that I appreciate now more than ever, and I&#x27;m sure others will too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>A bar dryer and brush work better !</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, my hair kept getting tangled in it despite my best efforts to cleanly handle it.</li>
            <li>This gives you a great look and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and produces great results.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and great price.  </li>
            <li>Using this leaves my hair looking great and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to write a review for a product I don&#x27;t use, but I can say my wife loved this brush, which lasted two-plus years of daily use, so we have bought two more for about $14 each—an excellent price for an excellent product sold by an excellent vendor through an excellent company (Amazon)!</li>
            <li>This is great for anyone with fine hair because it doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the barrel because they are plastic bristles.</li>
            <li>Great for women with fine hair.</li>
            <li>thought it might be too large, but it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s plastic  but works fine and is light and is perfect for your overnight bag.</li>
            <li>It works amazing</li>
            <li>Warm air does blow through the bristles, but by no means is this a replacement for a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>and I was thrilled to find another&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>I still own mine, and it&#x27;s still operational after three years.</li>
            <li>The brush works as advertised, however, it is not for every kind of hair.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes and was delighted to find them  on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>If you like to do your own hair, give this a try.  </li>
            <li>I liked someone&#x27;s suggestion of buying two.  </li>
            <li>Over all it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li>I really liked this styling tool until it started to over heat and shut off after about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Wife liked it.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I saw it on your website.  </li>
            <li>I LOOKED EVERYWHERE, BUT COULD NOT LOCATE IT IN A STORE OF ANY KIND.</li>
            <li>in all a nice manual styler for the price.</li>
            <li>Release button on roller also is nice.</li>
            <li>but still get nice body.</li>
            <li>I would have liked a hotter heat setting in addition to the 2 that it has</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S OK, BUT NOT AS GOOD</li>
            <li>My hair&#x27;s kinda funny--it has a mind of its own, but it cooperates nicely with Vidal.  </li>
            <li>what kind of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great product would recommend</li>
            <li>I was confident with the good reviews</li>
            <li>This is quite a handy tool.  </li>
            <li>Nice doing business with you.</li>
            <li>I use it for curling the ends of my hair inward and find that it does this effectively.</li>
            <li>The product description is kind of misleading.</li>
            <li>It shapes nicely; also adds body.  </li>
            <li>She really liked the one that she&#x27;d had for 4 to 5 years, and it just gave out.</li>
            <li>I thought this would rotate on its own.</li>
            <li>I got it thinking it would rotate on its own..</li>
            <li>That was really good. :)</li>
            <li>Does I nice job.</li>
            <li>but it is still a nice brush for grooming hair after shampoo.</li>
            <li>This imparts a nice curl -</li>
            <li>I love this, but with the caveat that it&#x27;s good if you&#x27;re not looking for a hair-dryer per se.</li>
            <li>Perfect for finishing off my medium length straight hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even get the chance to check if its effective on the hair or not.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was much more affordable than a comparable one for sale in the salon and works just as good.  </li>
            <li>- this is a nice styling tool.</li>
            <li>This Vidal Sasson was one she had before and really liked it.</li>
            <li>This absolutely the best styler/dryer ever.  </li>
            <li>I own 3 of these now.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and works great!</li>
            <li>Rose</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it gives volume.</li>
            <li>It has a nice swivel for the cord at the bottom which I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice thought</li>
            <li>So far so good - it has performed perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice brush styler.</li>
            <li>nice to have and inexpensive.</li>

            <li>I have used this hot airbrush for years, but can&#x27;t find it in the stores now, so I ordered on line and had to pay more for this item , but it works the best for me.</li>

            <li>The best part of my hair routine, you can blow out a voluminous look in less than 10 minutes, I love this thing!!</li>
            <li>As mentioned in so many of the reviews, it&#x27;s best to let your hair dry up to a good 80%, then I finish it up with this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really very nice, and the right styler for</li>
            <li>this is the only styler I use and was happy to purchase two more at a great price.  </li>
            <li>It worked great the first time I used it, although it did have a mildew smell.  </li>
            <li>This was my first experience, and it was great.</li>
            <li>great hot air brush ,i use it every morning  </li>
            <li>This hot airbrush is a great styling tool.  </li>
            <li>A great 1&amp;#34; hot air brush for longer hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great hot air brush for when you need a fuller look to your bob haircut.  </li>
            <li>It works just as great as the first one I purchased 3 yrs ago.</li>
            <li>It works best on damp not wet hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light-weight and very easy to use and gives you much more control with one hand than you may be able to achieve with both hands using a blower and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a great job, it heat up higher than most, and it curls my hair too.</li>
            <li>It does not slide through my hair nicely and gets tangled easily....</li>
            <li>A nice size and weight to handle easily.  </li>
            <li>My hair is curly but straightens easily, so I figured this would be a nice way to mellow the curls after the shower and not have hair the shape of a mushroom cloud (it happens)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, it&#x27;s wonderful for people who want to use it to &#x27;style&#x27; their hair, not dry their hair.  </li>
            <li>Very nice for a quick and easy hair style.</li>
            <li>Gives nice fullness to thinner and fine hair when used with styling product.</li>
            <li>It gives nice volume to my fine (in thickness) hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Wish I could give it a lower rating because I haven&#x27;t been able to use it once.</li>

            <li>I have been looking in all the stores for this curling brush dryer, couldn&#x27;t find it any more, looked at Amazon and there it was</li>
            <li>My favorite curling brush.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found this online</li>
            <li>But, the price is okay</li>
            <li>If it would cost more (as some others do), I would probably not continue to buy them and look for something else.  </li>
            <li>Was looking for one of these for some time and glad I found this one.</li>
            <li>Love the brush.</li>
            <li>I love this styler dryer.  </li>
            <li>I was no longer able to find this product there.</li>
            <li>I was grateful I was able to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>&amp; I just love it.</li>
            <li>return policy is better for products that stop working before their time.</li>
            <li>but im sure there are better out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many years and continue to buy them.</li>
            <li>Love this thing for styling my hair.</li>
            <li>Its ok, but my instyler works better.</li>
            <li>I was.hoping to be able to curl the ends of my bob better with this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Now we&#x27;re looking for one of this design but of a much better quality.  </li>

            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I really love this hairdryer</li>
            <li>OK, I guess.  </li>
            <li>Must have wavy/curly hair, but I use this brush every day and I get so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li>was so glad to see them on Amazon, was delivered to my house as soon as 10 days</li>
            <li>Instead my brother was able to cut the spikes off of the barrel to get my hair out.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this product but am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, nothing to write home about.</li>

            <li>this works ok.</li>
            <li>but then working with the dryer and brush leads to pain in my hand everything but with this product i love using it.</li>
            <li>We were ver pleased.</li>
            <li>It just gives a nice shape with some smooth curls.  </li>
            <li>Have used this brush before and love it.</li>
            <li>I have used one of these for many years.</li>
            <li>HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY</li>
            <li>I do have a frustration with the curler that I haven&#x27;t seen mentioned in many reviews.</li>
            <li>: I increased the stars from 3 to 4 because I got this caught in my hair and had to disassemble the top to untangle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works for some people.</li>
            <li>Love this styler.</li>
            <li>This is a great product My hands do not work very well</li>
            <li>but I have not been able to find one like it in retail stores.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>This is so much better than</li>
            <li>Pay more for the &amp;#34;In Styler&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>Not a lot of power or heat, but for traveling it&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li>I love the Vidal Sasson curler brush..</li>
            <li>So glad I found one again...</li>
            <li>I can do better waves/curls with my straightner.</li>
            <li>I would return it, but the shipping would cost me more money</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a whisper.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;blow brush, and it is better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have given up on doing this because I am worried that I won&#x27;t be able to get my hair unrolled.  </li>
            <li>I have bought several and this is the best one I have found.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li>It makes a lot more noise than anything.</li>
            <li>I have tried many stylers over the years, and I think this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it at Amazon</li>
            <li>I love that, unlike a curling iron, I can touch it and not burn my fingers.  </li>
            <li>The body to hold during use is a nice size to fit petite hands.</li>
            <li>I found that warm water, a soft nail brush and liquid soap provide great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is an excellent tool at a very low price, one which I&#x27;ve not been able to find anywhere except Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I have it.  </li>
            <li>Now she uses the 1-1/2 size as it works better</li>
            <li>I have used these Sasson styling brushes for MANY years.  </li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>What more can</li>

            <li>What more could you want for the price?</li>
            <li>Love the release feature.</li>
            <li>I would be sure to keep hair sectioned just to be sure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>but maybe I need to do a better job of cleaning it ...</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I know it will get more use as my hair grows longer.  </li>

            <li>This is my favorite one.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>Invest in a quality styler/dryer even if costs a bit more.</li>
            <li>Love this product, my mom and I both</li>
            <li>thank you for having it available!</li>
            <li>I truly love the ease of using this air brush, but I have shorter hair</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this produce.</li>
            <li>but so much better.  </li>
            <li>Love this appliance.</li>
            <li>though it was more of a mist to it.</li>
            <li>I WAS HOPING THAT THE BRUSH WOULD BE MORE SLENDER.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M LOOKING FOR A MORE SLENDER BRUSH.</li>
            <li>it needs more power  but its ok</li>
            <li>I thought it was just okay.</li>
            <li>I will order more as I need them.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite of all styling tools.</li>
            <li>I used it on my elbow length hair and it curled the ends of my hair wonderfully, giving it some extra style.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I tried many and did not like them as well.</li>
            <li>Have been using this air brush for many years and like how it works for my hair</li>
            <li>Works ok.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did not spend a fortune on it.</li>
            <li>Glad someone invented this tool.</li>
            <li>I love this curling brush.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it styles and dries all in one.</li>
            <li>My favorite styler ever.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer curling iron has been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find this product in a retail store.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It is perfect for those of us who cannot handle a brush and hairdryer at the same time and want a salon look.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find any more buttons than two to push..  </li>
            <li>I am sure I will conquer it.</li>
            <li>Always satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love this styler.</li>
            <li>I used to have a tiny straightener since that was all that was needed, but this combination is perfect!</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Love this tool.</li>
            <li>This is better for your hair and safer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better than a straighten iron.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning myself.</li>
            <li>Love this drying brush.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean and very easy to use to style hair and release longer hair so that it doesn&#x27;t pull out any hair.</li>
            <li>My wife liked this model she&#x27;d had for years and asked me to order two more for home and the gym when the original wore out.  </li>
            <li>BUT HEY AMAZON, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE SELLING TO THE CUSTOMERS!!!</li>
            <li>I hope Vidal Sassoon will continue to make this great hot brush available.</li>
            <li>It makes the most beautiful natural looking curls with no frizz  and waves that look like you just stepped out of a salon.</li>
            <li>than that, it&#x27;s a good product at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Would be better for someone with strong arms, but I&#x27;m glad I have it just in case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m elderly, with Fibromyalgia and this one is very light weight, and easy for me to manage.  </li>
            <li>and my hair looks full, shiny and amazing.</li>
            <li>Vidal Sasson VS433C Hot Air Brush and Styler broke 5 days after the return policy would have given a refund, before that I really loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good dependable hot air brush.</li>
            <li>drys hair pretty good, not complaints.</li>
            <li>I have had a Vidal Sasson hot air brush before and absolutely loved it</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t warm to full capacity.</li>
            <li>Excellent styling tool, especially for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased a Vidal Sasson hot hair brush many years ago from a chain store and was very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I have thin hair and too uncoordinated (LOL) to use a curling iron, so this is the best of both worlds.  </li>
            <li>Although it looks cheap motor works better than most.</li>
            <li>Works very good, soft curl, easy  to use, light weight.</li>

            <li>I have had this one for 3 yrs and its going strong.</li>
            <li>My old one like it broke after many years of good service.</li>
            <li>I saw this one on line, it looked very close to the one I had, so decided to try 1 more time to purchase a product that I liked.</li>
            <li>expectations for this tool weren&#x27;t high and that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair, the brush must be doing something right!  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product if you have the time and effort to put into it, but until it is improved some more</li>
            <li>so fine hair isn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, this brush attachment grabs the hair, curls it and holds the style.</li>
            <li>It is light weight, easy to manage, does what it claims, and has changed my morning routine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think those of you with longer fine hair, or</li>
            <li>A hot styling brush that&#x27;s great and really works well...</li>
            <li>I need the plastic rigid bristles to hold my ultra fine hair.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I I HAVE SHORTER FINE HAIR</li>
            <li>Since my hair is fine; this type of Hot air brush is perfect for giving it some volume and curling it at the same time</li>
            <li>The easy release button prevents my hair from getting tangled and it&#x27;s extremely light weight.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length hair baby fine.</li>
            <li>Everything&#x27;s working fine.  </li>
            <li>This one seems fine.  </li>
            <li>For my fine hair it did nothing.  </li>
            <li>I have jaw-length fine hair.</li>
            <li>, let me tell you - if you have fine hair or shorter hair, this thing is AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like the tangle free button , it makes the curl easy to roll out my hair.</li>
            <li>Having fine, thinning hair, I needed a brush I could manage well.</li>
            <li>This lightweight brush is so light &amp; easy to manage without tiring my arms.</li>
            <li>This brush would probably not be ideal for thicker &amp; longer hair if you wanted it to dry the hair as well as curl.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I have tried for years to make my fine hair  have body and form and this is the item that worked for me.</li>
            <li>but my fine hair gets caught it in all the time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The brush gives body to my fine hair.</li>
            <li>The one inch barrel is just fine on using this on my hair.</li>
            <li>You cannot fine them in any store.</li>
            <li>I have fine, just below the shoulders length hair</li>
            <li>It works well on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Thought it had a smaller diameter barrel when I ordered it, but was able to take barrel off of older one and switch it to this handle, WORKS GREAT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This curls hair quickly without getting tangled in the brush!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am super pleased with this one, and will probably get another one just to have for a spare.  </li>
            <li>The price was super!  </li>
            <li>It was hot enough to straighten (like getting a good blowdrying at the hairdressers, I notice they always use a very hot setting on the hairdryer and it works great on my hair) and give volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>So after reading other reviews, I saw that one person suggested using a toothpick to clean out the vent at the bottom of the unit, and now the dryer works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, exactly what I wanted, fast delivery &amp; price was good.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean the brush head.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use and so far i have had not problems and the prize was good also.</li>
            <li>I have only used this once since I received it, but I am happy with the way it operates and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other kinds, but this one works perfectly for me...and the price is right too!</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m lucky to be able to get a great style with misted 2nd day hair and this styler.    </li>
            <li>Love this hot air brush!</li>
            <li>Love using this hot air brush!</li>
            <li>great for short fine hair.</li>
            <li>Great for my short fine hair.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect product for me - it styles great you can use it wet or dry!  </li>
            <li>I have very straight, very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I can no longer find this product at my local department stores, so am happy to find it still available at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Huge mistake, won&#x27;t happen again.</li>
            <li>I used an adaptor, plugged it in and BOOM huge sparks every.</li>
            <li>That is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I would like to give 5 stars because I liked it so much</li>
            <li>When I use it, I have to follow with the InStyler to smooth it.</li>
            <li>Its also really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Why isn&#x27;t this model still available in stores?</li>
            <li>Oh well, with 2, shipping is free here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I use it to help smooth out my curls.</li>
            <li>Great product for styling short to medium length hair.   </li>
            <li>and there are some that wont even grab your hair to smooth it out, there a joke, and</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>Let it be said that she wasn&#x27;t happy with the product for only one reason.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t work that well, and the end is cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Smooth, shiny results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles are comfortable and flexible</li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>With just a trace of dampness, my hair responds beautifully--it just gives up and behaves itself like an obedient child.  </li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t rotate so ignore that on the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it a try since it is so cheap.</li>
            <li>also use it to smooth frizzy hair days</li>
            <li>Not what I was looking for, but too cheap to pay return shipping.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li>it is light weight and does not pull hair.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how hassle free it styles my hair.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>After I use this i then use CHI 44 finishing shine spray which puts a light shiny gloss on my hair and the look is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, it was so cheap, I&#x27;ll probably just buy another.</li>
            <li>I start off drying my hair with a more powerful dryer, but finish with this.</li>
            <li>Temperaure choices provide comfortable drying.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the curling brushes that have bristles and my hair just doesn&#x27;t look smooth</li>
            <li>I think it is the air/brush/curling iron combination at the same time that makes it work so great on your hair.</li>
            <li>Great for short hair.</li>
            <li>This would be great on my mom&#x27;s thinner hair if it had a smaller barrel.</li>
            <li>and It feels comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>It is not available in the stores anymore, so this was a great find!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>flimsy and cheap.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to see just what I had in mind and reasonably priced, too.  </li>
            <li>but as you start using it you will be comfortable with it(may</li>
            <li>Its light weight</li>
            <li>God Bless and enjoy your day,,</li>
            <li>This seems to fit the bill</li>
            <li>The best part is no curling iron burns or dried out hair from every day use.</li>
            <li>Price was cheap, so  </li>
            <li>material is cheap</li>
            <li>- it looks really cheap and feels really cheap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The cord doesn&#x27;t twist as freely as one might hope.</li>
            <li>Works great with my short hair.  </li>
            <li>It is tangle free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>I hope this styler remains available.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I have had two or more which I rarely use because I have my hair done at the shop.  </li>
            <li>This works out great for especially my curly hair, and makes it easier for straightening out before using the hair straightener.</li>
            <li>Could it be more powerful?</li>
            <li>Cheap and a piece of junk.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much I bought one for my mom as well.</li>
            <li>But great for travel and no pre-heating necessary</li>
            <li>My hair was not going smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s advertised as tangle free, but it took me 20 minutes to untangle my hair from the brush</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>Cheap, didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s available to purchase again.</li>
            <li>Not too sure if like... have rarely used</li>
            <li>Great price, and the ONLY place I can find it is on Amazon!</li>
            <li>tangle free, my butt...</li>
            <li>The plastic combs help to hold my hair on the curling brush to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>I liked the curlng brush (iron) but whould have liked it to make smaller curls.  </li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll be, like me, surprised and delighted with it.</li>
            <li>It was so cheap, it would cost more than it&#x27;s worth to return it--otherwise I&#x27;d send it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After blow drying with a round brush to mostly-dry my hair, I use this tool to shape and smooth and it does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>On Monday my brushes arrived - on Tuesday I was able to return to easy use of a hot air heating brush.</li>
            <li>This is an okay hot air brush but it gets tangled easily in my hair</li>
            <li>It also features a cool tip for easy styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what you get for $10!!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t find this dryer very useful.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very worth your money.</li>
            <li>This hot air brush is way easier and faster than a curling iron, and it does a great job on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>so I was happy to find this exactly like the old one,</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t thrown it away because it does make my hair look great, and i haven&#x27;t seen anything that looks exactly like my old one (the barrel was longer, wider, and the bristles were shorter).  </li>
            <li>My curling iron was burning me half the time, so I feel that this brush is much safer, and, if you spend the time to figure how how to get the best result on your hair, you&#x27;ll be pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, quick, and won&#x27;t tangle.  </li>
            <li>Have never been able to produce good results with the brush and dryer, so gave up long ago.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li>Makes drying and fixing my hair an easy, quick job.  </li>
            <li>It curls quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This one is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>so I had hoped this would be a quick and easy styling tool</li>
            <li>It gives a nice curl and does a decent job at helping to keep the frizzies at bay.  </li>
            <li>Curls and drys my hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for smoothing down the frizzies and getting all the ends going in the right direction after a shampoo, and it&#x27;s good for touch-ups in between.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and dries my hair and lets me style it very easy.</li>
            <li>It works great on my fine long hair!!</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to get a new one.</li>
            <li>It gets warm right away, but not too hot</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this curling brush..keeps my hair frizz free, even on dry hair..</li>
            <li>I love this hot air curling brush&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the reviews -- I&#x27;ve used the Revlon and Conair Hot Air Brush for YEARS and LOVE how they work.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try this.</li>

            <li>I never thought I would love a hot air brush</li>
            <li>This curling brush is worth its weight in gold!  </li>
            <li>Better than hot curlers for smoothing the hair and adding volume.</li>
            <li>I love this curling hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>I love this hot air styler.</li>
            <li>So now that the first one is literally falling apart, I bought two more.  </li>
            <li>This hot air brush is okay, but it&#x27;s not what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Glad I made the purchase because it is the exact one I had.</li>
            <li>My original burned out and I could not find anything that worked as well and did not fry my hair....</li>
            <li>I love my Vidal Sasson Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer, 1 inch.</li>
            <li>I love this hot air brush.i try to keep one on hand at all times.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and totally in love  with it.</li>
            <li>Love hot air brushes.</li>
            <li>I love this hot air brush...</li>
            <li>Ok as a hot air brush.</li>
            <li>Love this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>I recommend spending more money and getting one of higher quality.</li>
            <li>Had first one for many years.</li>
            <li>I love using this type of device for drying and styling my hair, to avoid using a hot iron as well.  </li>
            <li>I love this hot air brush styler.  </li>
            <li>I think a hot curling brush would be better for me.</li>
            <li>this hot air brush is ok.</li>
            <li>This hot hair brush is just OK</li>
            <li>I was so pleased when I tried this one out for the first time.</li>
            <li>And my first one lasted for many years before I had to replace it.</li>
            <li>after use 2 times the hot air brush not turn on any more  .</li>
            <li>I dry and curl my hair with this brush and am very satisfied with the product!</li>
            <li>I have very fine baby hair that is an absolute nightmare to style.</li>
            <li>have very straight hair and need this kind of hot air brush</li>
            <li>I squirt foaming hand soap on the brush and then scrub it with a tooth brush to get all the bristles clean.  </li>
            <li>Looked in many different popular stores.</li>
            <li>I get perms as needed and these are great to dry my hair and keep the curls from looking frizzy.</li>
            <li>I often have to clean out the air intake to avoid overheating.</li>
            <li>It worked out okay for me because I don&#x27;t own an actually blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Your hair comes out super smooth and salon quality.</li>
            <li>Although it states to clean the lint filter, there is no access to the lint filter.  </li>
            <li>I tried to roll more and more hair onto the barrel to get it to style and my hair got completely tangled in it and would not come off.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a screw-off cap at the end of the barrel which allows you to remove the brush to clean it.</li>
            <li>but, you couldn&#x27;t take it apart to clean.  </li>
            <li>even with keeping it clean and well maintained.</li>
            <li>Since I am not very good with curling irons this is perfect!</li>
            <li>I tried another brand first which didn&#x27;t work for me although it had three accessories, which I liked (one was just a kind of a comb) but left my hair quite frizzy as I have a perm.</li>
            <li>this brush is pretty good for touching up volume in my short and thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>The size is just right for my medium length hair, and would be great for short hair as well.</li>
            <li>My hair is short and fine and this gives it a very smooth and healthy look.</li>
            <li>This is perfect to give my fine straight hair a little body.  </li>
            <li>AM CERTAIN THAT YOU WILL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I like this Tangle Free Hot Air Brush, I like the way it feels I like the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve using hot air brushes before and they work well on my hair (shorter, fine, curl resistant) to smooth and add volume and curve.</li>
            <li>Love this curling brush, only thing works on my baby fine hair, love this product</li>
            <li>this hot air brush is super light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Yes, it blows warm air, but pretty much like a dryer on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making them available for me!</li>
            <li>It makes the hair kind of fuzzy, not silky because the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; are too far apart.</li>
            <li>I cannot see this as ANY GOOD for short hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair full with just the bend I want..  </li>
            <li>You twirl it yourself; it doesn&#x27;t rotate on its own, so you have complete control.  </li>
            <li>I cant get any styler to make my hair look full</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.  </li>
            <li>Overall, for the price it is a good buy.</li>
            <li>I could get some element of style using only one hand and it also did a good job of taming the &amp;#34;frizzies) on damp days.</li>
            <li>most desirable thing about this dryer is that it&#x27;s very convenient to pack it in a suitcase</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like to be able to get it with a 3/4&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>But it was cheap and worth a try just to know.</li>
            <li>It is true to its word.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;d likely wear out the dryer fairly</li>
            <li>Works well enough good price</li>
            <li>Have used one for years &amp; works perfectly with my thick hair.</li>
            <li>then let it cool off.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks shiny, bouncy and full again.</li>
            <li>but definitely almost as good as the &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; one as seen on T V...</li>
            <li>I wanted an air brush that I could use on my thick shoulder length hair and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I am out much if I never am able to get the hang of using it on my hair.</li>
            <li>I was ready to scrap growing it out and cut it ultra-short to avoid the headache of messing with it, but I bought this in a last-ditch attempt to find a cute way to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, Will purchase more.</li>
            <li>Loved it until it tangled in my hair about 1/2 around and had to yank out a big section of my hair!</li>
            <li>&amp; they last fairly well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pushed all the buttons, let it cool between button pushing - well, I had no choice.  </li>
            <li>It thought the barrel would be smaller because I have a shorter hair, but over all, works good</li>
            <li>Having said that, it is not a bad product.</li>
            <li>I like it very much because it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone it is easy to use and blows hot air out as it curls</li>
            <li>Based on other ratings I thought this would be great for my hair</li>
            <li>I think it is the best hot air brush, because of the brush that does not have any bristles that helps to grab the thin hair much better than the ones that have them.</li>
            <li>Once I got a good trim, my hair looked better, but it needed a little something.</li>
            <li>have used several conners over the years - all smooth and curl ALMOST dry hair perfectly.  </li>
            <li>the seller was quick to send I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the order</li>
            <li>Works quickly and well.</li>
            <li>I had one that quit running, I was so happy when I looked and found the same one, I really like this dryed.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.  </li>
            <li>just wish they would not burn out so quickly.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer came quickly and was packaged well.  </li>
            <li>It came quickly was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>However, after some use it quickly gets to the point where it begins to shut off halfway through styling.  </li>
            <li>so that it was mildly damp</li>
            <li>It did well drying my hair quickly, however to curl it</li>
            <li>I received this quickly but it didn&#x27;t rotate.</li>
            <li>Handle is quite fat, hair got tangled and the quick release didn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly and gives a curl and body.</li>
            <li>This curling iron with the tangle free bristles/plastic is perfect for my thin sparse hair</li>
            <li>i had Helen of Troy before, similar but much more power and better performance.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>and I can finish my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super helpful if you&#x27;re away to college and there aren&#x27;t reliable hair salons around.</li>
            <li>It dries and curls it quickly and gives it some body.  </li>
            <li>It blow dries quickly and generally can be combed into a pretty good style, then sprayed and hand adjusted.  </li>
            <li>How lucky for me.  </li>
            <li>Could have a more powerful motor, but for the price I guess you can&#x27;t complain, really.</li>
            <li>This is the second one of these I have bought and it is perfect for my short hair.</li>
            <li>Styles my hair quickly and effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>Purchasing from Amazon is the best way to purchase since it is hard to find in the stores and its mailed right to you.</li>
            <li>No other kind worked,for me.</li>
            <li>However, for me it is perfect since I generally let my hair air dry until it&#x27;s damp--</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and was easy to use -- just too large.</li>
            <li>Even on the warmest setting the air isn&#x27;t very hot.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Tangle Free Hot Air Bush on my hair for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li>trying to get a tangle Free Curling Hot Brush compared to the Perfector and</li>
            <li>Its made cheap and my hair got so tangled with first use, I never used it again...</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this brush.  </li>
            <li>free hot air brush styler is an awsome product.</li>
            <li>Nothing worked to smooth my hair more than a few minutes before this amazing gadget.  </li>
            <li>the higher heat setting (250 watt) really seems to work so much better on normal-to-thick hair (full bodied hair) than the lower (150 watt).</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a good curl for long.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is the best kind for my short, thin and fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It works great for several months, however, as it gets older, it overheat and shuts off.  </li>
            <li>I actually can make my hair look decent, I&#x27;m so happy I purchased this.  </li>
            <li>bristles make it easy for me to grab a chunk of hair and blow it dry around the bristle brush and have a nice curl.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product that I have been using until it broke down</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 or 4 weeks now, and my average number of good hair days has increased tremendously!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, very easy to use, and the sound is low</li>
            <li>This product is not easy to find in the stores any longer so was glad to be able to obtain because it is my favorite hair product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, styles well, but if you have thin hair than it&#x27;s better to pay more and buy smth with more options.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for one of these for several months, just this kind, and when I found you had them I bought 2 right away!  </li>
            <li>Totally satisfied with my purchase and will order one again when I need a new one.</li>
            <li>However, it does overheat easily and turn off which is a real hassle if you are in a hurry to go somewhere.  </li>
            <li>It is very practical, easy to use and curl the hair in a blink.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>My hair gets caught in it easily and the release doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>Best suited for use with long hair rather than short.</li>
            <li>It kind of works - not powerful, but that is okay for finer hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the plastic &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; and it doesn&#x27;t get very hot, but this is fine when I&#x27;m not putting much effort into my hair.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I use it daily and love it!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t opened but am currently using one I&#x27;ve had for years and love it!</li>
            <li>You are my go-to first from now on!</li>
            <li>I am glad i could find another one like my old one!</li>
            <li>then I found it with this seller, at a cheaper price than I paid 10 years ago for the first one!</li>
            <li>This is the second Vidal Sasson VS433C Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer (1-inch) I&#x27;ve owned, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, and love it because it doesn&#x27;t burn you like a curling iron does!</li>
            <li>first one goes out!</li>
            <li>The barrel of the brush was larger and this one tangles hair more easily.</li>
            <li>best product out there  dry and curl hair at the same time .</li>
            <li>The hot air brush has the right kind of bristles - soft tip rather than bristle brush, so you won&#x27;t have hair/bang breakage;&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>but I have straight fine hair.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a little learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it works great.  </li>
            <li>This product gets as hot as a hot air blower and makes for great loose curls.  </li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your time and money on this POS!!!!!</li>
            <li>few times I&#x27;ve been able for it to hold and release successfully, it does leave a decent curl</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t encourage anyone to buy something that won&#x27;t even last 3 months--especially when you take very good care of it and only use it once a day!!</li>
            <li>HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS, AND WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND REPLACEMENT WHEN I WORE MY OTHER ONE OUT!!  </li>
            <li>This has largely dissapated over time but causes me to rate a VERY useful tool with three stars.  </li>
            <li>It works great for a few weeks then start to overheat.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and really doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>The 3/4 in barrel styler is also available in stores, but gives me too much curl rather than the lift I am looking for.  </li>
            <li>but this one works very well and isn&#x27;t as loud as my Conair curling brush and the softer brush bristles are more comfortable for the head.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t give a great curl if you have heavy hair</li>
            <li>Really gives body and makes your hair feel light.</li>
            <li>This is great for those of us who can&#x27;t seem to get the round brush and the dryer working in unison.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s finger in a light socket without taking a curler to it and being able to blow-dry at the same time</li>
            <li>is nice especially when I travel.</li>
            <li>It is always nice to buy a product that actually performs as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I looked at the store for the brush I had used without success.  </li>
            <li>I love this hot air brush, --as it truly is tangle-free,--works in the air just the way that you work it in with the hair,--AND,--so much safer to use than a hot curling iron.  </li>
            <li>My hair has become thinner with age, and more fine and drier - and it&#x27;s become evident to me that the less I do to my hair, the better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li>Trust me, it isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love how it gives soft curls.</li>
            <li>Still, I think it is worth it and will keep buying them.</li>
            <li>This is a nice styler, dryer for short hair.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled to find this--the only thing that works well on my hair!  </li>
            <li>I have purchased several of the Sasson hot air brushes and am always very pleased with the price and performance.</li>
            <li>I have one that is MANY years old and could not find a replacement in any store.</li>
            <li>as a result i rarely use.  </li>
            <li>It does not have the soft bristle brush as my old one from Vidal Sasson that I loved.</li>
            <li>I used to own one that look similar to this but has a stronger air blow.</li>
            <li>I have a short haircut and this item gives a nice fullness.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to try Amazon.com and was thrilled to find one.</li>
            <li>I have returned it and getting something worth my money.</li>
            <li>Not even worth the one-star</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth trying to return for the price, but will NEVER buy this product again.</li>
            <li>oh wow, do I love this,</li>
            <li>greatly appreciated that the product was of great quality, delivered as expected and there were no hassles or inconveniences in receiving the product.</li>
            <li>but it is nice having it short.  </li>
            <li>The release button near the top of the shaft lets the brush part turn</li>
            <li>I know a lot of people have liked it and only after reading those reviews i bought it, i wanted a dual voltage air brush, and my hair is short,so i didnt need a thicker styler.</li>
            <li>but I rarely used it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t return it because it wasn&#x27;t worth paying the shipping but</li>
            <li>I have very fine straight hair and really need the body this Hot air Brush/Dryer provides.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice little hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It works beautifully, does not damage my wispy thin hair, and, as someone who is not a cosmetologist, it makes finishing styling my hair so easy.  </li>
            <li>Even though the product suggests the warm setting for fine hair, I have to use the hot setting with heat protective spray  to get what curl it will give me or I am left with almost straight hair.</li>
            <li>YES I was right to pay shipping - it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>I like this styling brush better than any other that I&#x27;ve been able to purchase.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hot air brush.&lt;br /&gt;Really works for my short, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these hot air sttler for many years, adds volume to my short fine hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product, however, like many other customers I have to keep ordering it since it overheats and the motor gives out.</li>
            <li>I have had several of these over the years and am never disappointed, it is one of the most reliable</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, I wish I had ordered it much sooner!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, too!</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair, wear it in a flip, and it takes me about 5 minutes after drying my hair to be ready to go!  </li>
            <li>My hair nis fine and about six inches long on top.  </li>
            <li>I can keep my hand over the barrel to hold my hair and it is not hot to the touch (which is a good thing in my opinion).  </li>
            <li>My other one I LOVED quit working.</li>
            <li>(watch it break off), then use hot rollers (more breakage) then have to pull it back to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>so I come right to Amazon which always has this product.</li>
            <li>, just right and no tangles, though I know if this happened there is a release button to stop the problem.</li>
            <li>This dryer/styler with its lower heat is exactly right for me.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m trying to grow it out right now.  </li>
            <li>The barrel is just the right size.  </li>
            <li>It gives volume and just the right amount of curl.</li>
            <li>i like this styler and it is just the right size for me.  </li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair which slips right through the brush.  </li>
            <li>and the price is right if you&#x27;re a patient person.  </li>
            <li>It took a bit to get the knack of using it correctly, and drying my hair to just the right state of dampness, but, now, I&#x27;ve got it.  </li>
            <li>Just what I needed, it holds my hair without tangling, has just the right amount of airflow.</li>
            <li>The barrel IS supposed to rotate, right?  </li>
            <li>The shipping was right on, came when they said it would.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that needs curl and body and the time it would take to get this brush to make that happen is twice that of the normal process of a hair dryer and roll brush.</li>
            <li>This one should be much easier to clean..</li>
            <li>Thankfully I haven&#x27;t experienced the issues other people have had with the heat being too high.  </li>
            <li>would recommend it to anyone with short to medium length, fine to medium fine hair.  </li>
            <li>If you travel a lot, it is compact and weighs less than most hair dryers, and for me it curls better than a curling iron.</li>
            <li>Definitely cuts my routine time in half and gives an awesome finished look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in one of the many phases of growing my hair out from super short to shoulder length.  </li>
            <li>I really like this Hot Air Brush, however, I liked the previous model better.</li>
            <li>As usual it is a gift for someone else, I am happy that I could get it for her, as she is in getting it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and gives a nice soft curl to short hair.  </li>
            <li>In the past they have had dual voltage (120 &amp;amp; 240)and been great for travelling over seas.  </li>
            <li>it is my favorite type of hot air brush styler and dryer that I have found that helps my naturally curly hair that frizzes in hot humid weather</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s worth the time and the efforts to learn to utilize this Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer.</li>
            <li>Works great on every hair type...thick, thin, fine or course.  </li>
            <li>She was so glad to throw the old one away and get started on the new one!!</li>
            <li>with my short hair do...not working out quite as easily as I had hoped for!</li>
            <li>Save yourself some time and spend a little more for a better product.  </li>
            <li>Probably because my hair is short,  I really do not feel like I get very good results with this brush.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and have tried other kinds of hot air brushes, the bristles on this one work the BEST.</li>
            <li>This Vidal Sasson Hot Air Brush stopped working right at 60 days.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly the right size for my medium layered hair length.</li>
            <li>I still use a round brush, but is a perfect addition..especially when styling the back.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I bought 3 as a back up.</li>
            <li>Left to its own devices it would curl in some areas, be straight in others, frizz and puff up in others.</li>
            <li>this makes styling my hair so much easier and it really is tangle free.</li>
            <li>It works best when you hold it in place for a few second and release it; then repeat until you get the desired curl.</li>
            <li>easy to use with my naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length hair that I blow out until almost dry then finish with tis product that puts a nice bend or curl depending</li>
            <li>, the price was reasonable and I received it quickly.</li>
            <li>I had one by another brand that blew as strongly as my hair dryer which is loud.</li>
            <li>Does not get super hot but certainly does the job to which it is intended.</li>
            <li>Connair has a metal barrel which gets slightly warm and helps dry and very much smoothes the hair.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I find where it is not as good as my old Vidal Sasson is it does not heat quite as hot.</li>
            <li>Creates great curls with little frizz and keeps hair super soft.</li>
            <li>Better than John Freida&#x27;s brush, which I used to love, but too much use of the brush and the heat over the last six months was causing irritation to my sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>Like this curling brush very much.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>At one point, I had to pull the plug, and take off the brush portion to untangle my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Not using it very much.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much, couldn&#x27;t find one like it in the stores.  </li>
            <li>PRICE WAS VERY REASONABLE.  </li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced</li>
            <li>Received very fast.  </li>
            <li>It was priced very reasonably also.</li>
            <li>Very good product - this is the exact same product as the ones for 49.99 and up on other websites.  </li>
            <li>Good little appliance.</li>
            <li>I just purchased a new one to put in my suitcase for travel or if my original goes on the fritz.  </li>
            <li>works well, saves using two hands  and fluffs hair,  Heat is not too strong so it take longer but feel better about less heat</li>
            <li>Styling fo rme works best when my hair is about half dry</li>
            <li>Straight hair may be in for some but for those of us who have straight, flat hair and need a bit of lift, this really does a good job.</li>
            <li>I like this hot air brush styler  very much.  </li>
            <li>The high is too hot and tow is so cool it doesn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the look of the soft curls this air brush provides.. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but I find that a regular hair dryer does a better job</li>
            <li>I have never used a hot air brush before, so I cannot compare this to others on the market.  </li>
            <li>I would say it would be ok for short hair.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser, bless her heart, who is my friend as well as my hairdresser, gave me this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>The product (Vidal Sasson VS433C Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush)is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>It is NOT a curling iron - It blows hot air while you wrap your hair around it to make curls.</li>
            <li>Vidal Sasson VS433C Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer, 1 Inch]]  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know who thought of a hot air brush styler, but they deserve awards.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll buy a different model to better suit my hair type.</li>
            <li>I love this hair styling too but it is getting more and more difficult to find.  </li>
            <li>so this time my first search was on Amazon and to my delight there</li>
            <li>No maker has ever been able to replace a curling iron and blow drier but this is better than the others I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get too hot, so it won&#x27;t burn your head or ears.</li>
            <li>For this low price I&#x27;m pleased with the results it delivers.</li>
            <li>HOT AIR BRUSH</li>
            <li>Buying another, although my first one is still working.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, did not work well in my short hair, gave it to my granddaughter.</li>
            <li>Tames my hair to how I want it, not what it wants to do!  </li>
            <li>The Vidal Sasson Styler is the only curling iron type hot air dryer type I&#x27;ve been able to find.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Vidal Sasson hot air brush that I have owned</li>
            <li>I have used this hot air brush for years...</li>
            <li>I still have the first brush purchased with some cosmetic issues.  </li>
            <li>The present brush (purchased through Amazon) also seems to have electrical issues, indicated by static like clicking when in use.  </li>
            <li>Vidal Sasson VS433C Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer, 1 Inch]]</li>
            <li>I have two put away for back up and will purchase two more just in case.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I cannot find anything that curls my hair like this hot air styler.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what she wanted.  </li>
            <li>Finally, a hot air curler with a brush.  </li>
            <li>I rely on Vidal Sasson&#x27;s hot brushes.</li>
            <li>I have had many different hair lengths during that period.</li>
            <li>I got my first 2 from the grocery/mart stores.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s my second one I have had the first one for many years.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I had air-dried my hair for 45 min</li>
            <li>I have used this brand of hot air brush before</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get overly hot</li>
            <li>I wanted just a hot curling brush</li>
            <li>but I kept seeing these hot air ones and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this hot air brush for about 5 years.</li>
            <li>I have used this Vidal Sasson Hot Air Brush for years.  </li>
            <li>Not so hot the</li>
            <li>I am so grateful to Vidal Sasson for providing this type of hot air brush, hope they never quit making like</li>
            <li>doesnt get too hot.</li>
            <li>size would work better with my very short hair.</li>
            <li>I tried this product several times, with varying dampness of hair, and it would not create many curls.</li>
            <li>my local merchant stopped selling Vidal Sasson&#x27;s Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush, I panicked and bought four more from Amazon just to have on hand in case</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Vidal Hot Air Stylers for years.  </li>
            <li>I returned my first one because it did not rotate at all as advertised.</li>
            <li>The first one received did not work at all so returned for replacement.  </li>
            <li>The handle needs to be smaller, to grip better</li>
            <li>I had a hot air brush some time ago and it stopped working.  </li>
            <li>this does it all so bought 2 and have had the first one for over a year</li>
            <li>I bought this hot air brush because I am spending some weeks in a place where there was no hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>My hair gets tangled when I use them but not with this hot air brush.</li>
            <li>and this is the only place I&#x27;ve been able to find it.  </li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying I have tried all types of hair styling products from hot rollers, to straightening irons to curling irons.</li>
            <li>Got this in the mail and the first thing I tried was to go from bedhead and test</li>
            <li>I wrapped it up around the brush (its not too hot to wrap your hand around) and used the release button</li>
            <li>with the hot air brush and styler.  </li>
            <li>It immediately begins blowing hot air, depending on your setting choice, so there is no waiting for it to heat up.  </li>
            <li>the first that happened was my hair was severely tangled and knotted.</li>
            <li>I heard a pop and it smelled hot.</li>
            <li>and I love the convenience of drying and curling at the same time.</li>
            <li>However the first one quit working after one use.  </li>
            <li>Neither are the quality of the first one she owned.  </li>
            <li>Have used this hot air brush for years</li>
            <li>First one I had for years before I dropped it and broke the end.  </li>
            <li>this blow dryer - rather than a blow dryer, brush to use with the blow dryer and maybe hot</li>
            <li>I cannot find them in stores locally anymore and was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The first one stopped working after using it twice.  </li>
            <li>i was able to use it for 3x only.</li>
            <li>I recommend this hot air brush 100%; do not know what I would do without it.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough positives on this hot air brush - I just love it.  </li>
            <li>My first one lasted about a year</li>
            <li>I had looked for this exact brush in mutiple stores, but couldn&#x27;t find anythinglike it.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I would not recommend, instead get the Revlon shine enhancing hot air kit.</li>
            <li>so this hot air brush smoothes out my hair.</li>
            <li>I can now style my hair with fullness without using hair dryer and hot curling iron.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>and I get exactly the look I want with it.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>If I change my style and go longer or shorter or use different products, I will try it again and see if it works better for me.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>My first one last me for many years.</li>
            <li>so much that I got two of them, just in case!  </li>
            <li>Works like the one I had 20 years ago and still does the job for a very desirable price!  </li>
            <li>Got tangled in my hair the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>The Vidal Sasson Hot Air Brush styler and dryer has almost no power.</li>
            <li>However, I believe there are better similar products out there!</li>
            <li>BUT I think I will get the hang of it pretty soon.</li>
            <li>love the concept that I will only have to use this tool instead of two tools to get my hair done each morning.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted over 2 years.</li>
            <li>get to hot.</li>
            <li>As many reviewers have commented, this product tends to have a short life because it overheats.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite blow dryer, for my short hair.</li>
            <li>Not as hot.</li>
            <li>this is the onley hot air brush my wife will use.</li>
            <li>Instead, if I turn it off momentarily, I can hear a click (the internal, automatic shut-off) and the dryer won&#x27;t run again until it has safely cooled off.</li>
            <li>So whatever positives I said about this product at first</li>
            <li>I have recently gone back over the latest reviews and saw many ladies talking about overheating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and was unable to find it in the store, so happy to have found it here!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this and have wondered why I can only find it online these days.  </li>
            <li>I use this hot air brush instead.  </li>
            <li>should note that I use this Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer for my synthetic wigs and one day</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I ruined my first one for running for longs periods of time although it lasted 2 years.</li>
            <li>It came on time and it was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It works well on my hair and is probably the 4th exactly like it I have bought.</li>
            <li>I suppose I am glad that they only cost $15...</li>
            <li>After using this hot air brush for 10 years, my hairdresser dropped it and it cracked.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what the Wife wanted.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I need it to do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Vidal Sassoon hot air brush for years and years.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what was wanted.</li>
            <li>It is compact and blows hot and fast!</li>
            <li>It would probably be better if it was the 3/4 inch size as my hair is so short, but it still works well.  </li>
            <li>I wore out my first one (that I purchased at a store) and couldn&#x27;t find another one</li>
            <li>THEY WERE EXACTLY WHAT</li>
            <li>This was exactly as described….easy</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY</li>
            <li>I had used this hot air type of curling iron for years.</li>
            <li>Love the way this styler works on my hair, but it overheats and won&#x27;t turn back on.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for something like my 1970&#x27;s hot comb, and this is it</li>
            <li>And it isn&#x27;t exactly tangle-free either.</li>
            <li>Overall ok</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy this item locally.  </li>
            <li>it is exactly what i was looking for..</li>
            <li>I had a hot air brush similar to this for many years and it had quit working.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It seems rather flimsy and generates a funny smell when it is being used.</li>
            <li>Also, it over heats after 2 minutes of use and will not turn back on for 5-10 more minutes.</li>
            <li>The first one stopped working immediately after plugging it in and the motor got really hot and smelled like burning plastic.  </li>
            <li>It is okay, but my short hair needs to grow out, before I will know if it serves the purpose or not.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd Vidal Sasson hot air brush - love it</li>
            <li>This item works better than others I have used, even of the same brand.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t reach hot setting after a month.</li>
            <li>the first use it never worked&lt;br</li>
            <li>Vidal Sasson VS433C Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer, 1 Inch]]</li>
            <li>This is the first one that tangles my hair EACH time I use it.  </li>
            <li>And the hot air brush is exactly like the one I had.  </li>
            <li>This blew up in my hand the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Purchased same product and love it.</li>
            <li>and I need to use a hair dryer first</li>
            <li>The first one lasted almost 5 years</li>
            <li>Its not expensive (i paid about $17)</li>
            <li>This is not a complicated brush - 2 settings only.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There were a couple times that it would get a little tangled but easy  to get out for the most part.</li>
            <li>The problem, if you have my kind of hair, is that the bristles are simply too far apart and the hair slides right off.</li>
            <li>I used some spray gel for a little more body because my hair is so fine</li>
            <li>This works and is the right size, but after wrapping my hair around the wand, the \\&quot;tangle free\\&quot; feature didn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>, I keep it handy for special occasions when I&#x27;m willing to take extra time, but don&#x27;t bother with it at all for regular styling.course</li>
            <li>, I keep it handy for special occasions when I&#x27;m willing to take extra time, but don&#x27;t bother with it at all for regular styling.</li>
            <li>It honestly took me more time to use the Hot Air Brush than it normally does to simple blow dry and style.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s quick / easy to use if I need to \\&quot;freshen-up\\&quot; my &#x27;do after a long day or a night of sleeping on it.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what I expected it to do and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>You dry and style your hair all in one easy step!  </li>
            <li>I spritz a little soft hold hairspray, and my hair looks great all day</li>
            <li>Prior to this I had a conair hot brush (white handle with purple plastic barrel) that I used foryears and loved it...</li>
            <li>It just went from a normal motor sound to a high whine and died.  </li>
            <li>Finally found my faithful product on Amazon and was excited the day it arrived!  </li>
            <li>A great curling brush - unlike regular curling irons, the danger of getting burned is minimal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is ok and does good, but it is loud and it takes longer to get the hair dry than if one just blew it dry , but it saves time with the two steps in one, just use ear plugs.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better for medium to short hair but works very well.</li>
            <li>It has a softly rubberized barrel and widely-spaced &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; (more like soft tines)</li>
            <li>so smart choice not to make it too hot.</li>
            <li>medium thickness would have much success with this great little tool, it&#x27;s just not enough power.  </li>
            <li>I was able to free my hair after some time and patience, but it was not easy.  </li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair to get most of the moisture out them finish up with the hot air brush to give me the style and volume.</li>
            <li>Make sure you dry your hair some first</li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t know what to try, and then - I saw all the positive reviews about this product.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>That is the positive thing.  </li>
            <li>I have short fine hair and with the right styling product, this really gives my hair volume.</li>
            <li>I also find it very relaxing to just sit on the couch while I use this hot air brush to finish drying and smoothing my hair.</li>
            <li>Mostly I keep my hair long</li>
            <li>This Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer works very well.</li>
            <li>do--I have to replace it pretty much every year</li>
            <li>And is so much easier than hot curlers or the blow-dryer/roll brush combination</li>
            <li>dries my hair fast without getting too hot.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would have made it better would be the dual wattage switch that would give it more widely scattered use in US as well as in Europe.  </li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s so lightweight that at first I thought I just got a case with no insides, but it is really just lightweight.</li>
            <li>This one will do, but it wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice if there were real choices out there.</li>
            <li>have used Vidal Sasson in the past and the products always gave good results.  </li>
            <li>I get big, soft, pretty curls that make my hair super easy to style.</li>
            <li>When I am adept at using this tool I will have cut down on the time it takes me to style my hair each morning.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, my friend was able to cut the brush up into little pieces around the hair and save me from having to do that, but I still lost about two fists full of hair.</li>
            <li>Awesome little tool, as someone with a lot of hair, whatever can make the process simpler, I&#x27;m down for.</li>
            <li>It would take you an hour to dry your hair, so just use it more for smoothing your curls.</li>
            <li>but it sure helps to dry and style the hairs without entangling it.</li>
            <li>It claims to dry your hair but it would take so much more time than blow drying and curling or straightening your hair.</li>
            <li>Max Alderman&#x27;s wife-I use my hot air brush daily as my primary hair styling tool.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and it is quiet.  </li>
            <li>so mine takes awhile to dry which is why I may not be satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>This is the second Vidal Sasson Tangle Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer I have owned.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a smaller size styler/dryer that I could easily pack for trips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and if used properly, doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair.  </li>
            <li>simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and so you would not be able to actually dry your hair this way.</li>
            <li>It is not so hot , even in the highest position  and for my type of thin hair it is great.</li>
            <li>It does not get as hot, so it doesn&#x27;t really seem to style my hair very well.</li>
            <li>hold  somewhere before retailing as I have had two now that had the same strong smell of  mildew in their air output when 1st using them.  </li>
            <li>it turns off in certain spots.</li>
            <li>that grip well and a large barrel.  </li>
            <li>It could work for certain hair type.</li>
            <li>It is a kind of cheap plastic tool and no powerful enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this type brush for several years; when my old one stopped working I was glad to find an exact replacement.</li>
            <li>So I open my new one and place an order for two more...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to dry sopping wet hair with this you&#x27;re not gonna be happy.</li>
            <li>Best results when used on towel dried slightly damp hair.</li>
            <li>It works great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>It works best if your hair is at least 50% dry.</li>
            <li>It gave my hair a soft natural wave and was easy to handle</li>
            <li>If you have long hair it can get tangled pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Not the fastest but better than my other hot air brush.</li>
            <li>Mine is short and fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing it would be fine if my hair was only shoulder length.</li>
            <li>I purchased this at the advice of my sister but after receiving it, found that my hair was too fine and short to work.</li>
            <li>best thing for my hair using this brush is No static friz which other brushes cause on my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would dry it eventually, but I don&#x27;t recommend this styler for that!</li>
            <li>I have short hair and this brush works fine.</li>
            <li>I love this, I&#x27;m not good at doing my hair but this hot air brush makes it easy.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone with short to medium length and fine to medium thickness hair.</li>
            <li>My original Vidal Sasson Hot Air Brush styler finally gave out after 10 years.  </li>
            <li>This is the only Air Brush that will work well with my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Died after using it twice, and I&#x27;ve only got fine, chin length hair.</li>
            <li>It gets hot enough to style hair quickly without being too hot to handle.</li>
            <li>Good for soft curling - unsure if tight curls could be achieved.</li>
            <li>I then use this little wonder to give my hair the nice body and style that I want.  </li>
            <li>If you have naturally curly hair, and you like the smoother looks, this hot air brush is for you!</li>
            <li>so I was on the hunt for another to puff up my short, straight, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I missed having one to use on my straight, fine, short hair.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle on fine hair, it packs well for travel, and you only need one appliance for styling.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hot air brush and styler.</li>
            <li>This works great with longer hair, mine was a little short</li>
            <li>Great to curl thin straight hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is straight but will get fuzzy sometimes with humidity.</li>
            <li>I am finding that it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I cannot find another styler/brush that I like as much as I like this one.  </li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s a 5 star product that I highly endorse!  </li>
            <li>I have used something like this before, but i really like this one.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and hope this problem can be resolved.</li>
            <li>the whole room with that odor.  </li>
            <li>So much so that when she replaced it she order two in order to have a backup.</li>
            <li>Thanks again Amazon for finding the unfindable.</li>
            <li>I really like this product although like others have said it does overheat</li>
            <li>I expected more from the Vidal Sassoon name.</li>
            <li>Three purchases were at a retail store and the last purchase was through Amazon, since it was no longer available at any store.  </li>
            <li>I hope that Vidal Sassoon makes this brush for ever - what a difference it makes on your mornings ready for work time.</li>
            <li>i do have to agree that they heat up way too fast and shut off.  </li>
            <li>so much I bought 2 this time.  </li>
            <li>so this airbrush dryer works really well.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>I find it really speeds up my hair routine.</li>
            <li>I would return it except the shipping would be almost as much as the item itself.  </li>
            <li>Really like this item.  </li>
            <li>you have to twist the whole thing</li>
            <li>and it didnt grab my hair very well.</li>
            <li>and I really like the way it works with my hair.  </li>
            <li>This makes styling my hair much easier and faster.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it as much as I thought I would</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>very curly/wavy hair and this styler/drying has really helped control my hair.  </li>
            <li>ALTHOUGH IT HAS A RELEASE BUTTON ON IT, WHICH TO ME DOESN&#x27;T WORK VERY WELL</li>
            <li>The blowing heat really sets the style.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping,product was as stated, just what was ordered, my wife likes the 1 inch size</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>Not having to hold up the brush and blow dryer has saved my so much effort.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>The lukewarm air blows doing absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>, it works, it&#x27;s gentle on my hair, and it&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li>I have been using one my air brush for a while now and really like it.</li>
            <li>it takes a lot of time to untangle, it hurts, and it ends up breaking way too much hair.  </li>
            <li>It did not add volume, I really was expecting more&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really have no opinion on this.  </li>
            <li>It really does not tangle.  </li>
            <li>I have straight hair that just hangs there.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions specifically and nothing was really happening.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, but it would have been nicer, if&lt;br /&gt;it had a couple of different size</li>
            <li>WORKS REALLY WELL.  </li>
            <li>I KEEP REPLACING THEM EVERY YEAR SINCE IT REALLY STRAIGHTENS AND SMOOTHS THE HAIR TO PERFECTION.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I really should buy another just in case</li>
            <li>Great for thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like this styling brush.</li>
            <li>I works so fast</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>She really likes this style of brush and dryer in one.</li>
            <li>and i really wish I had saved my money and not buy this dryer brush.</li>
            <li>I really, really did try.  </li>
            <li>better than I expected.....</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>They were very helpful and sent me another brush which also doesn&#x27;t rotate.  </li>
            <li>I can be ready to go in 10-15 min.</li>
            <li>it DOES have that twisting/untwisting cord tip, but it doesn&#x27;t work very well for me.  </li>
            <li>This model was no longer available locally.</li>
            <li>Then I take the Styler and brush it through my hair, gently making curls at the ends.</li>
            <li>Two much for a travel device</li>
            <li>It is lite weight and heats up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like spending much (if any) time on my hair</li>
            <li>I use it for curly styles and straight styles.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>(the buttons are very close to one another), although I didn&#x27;t see that that release button was very helpful anyway.  </li>
            <li>A real improvement.</li>
            <li>Also, the price is reasonable for what you get and lasts beyond what you would expect.</li>
            <li>The heat was very damaging to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much that I am ordering a back-up brush in the event that this one dies on me.</li>
            <li>solo much</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Its gentle on the hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made my life so much simpler, no curling iron, no straightening implements, etc.</li>
            <li>The cord is too short to use comfortably in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>Not so much.  </li>
            <li>so much faster styling time</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for always having what I need.</li>
            <li>It is cheap plastic and does not unwind properly.</li>
            <li>Bought this because of all the rave reviews of how fast you can get your hair styled.</li>
            <li>so much found another one two replace it.</li>
            <li>It really depends on ur hair type..</li>
            <li>I kept waiting for the top layer to make its Bozo fluff, but it never happened.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really blow that much air and just didn&#x27;t work for me..</li>
            <li>Where was this item in the 60&#x27;s when I really could have used it instead of rollers?</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li>does not spin and gives a very frizzy curl.</li>
            <li>I really like it -</li>
            <li>I have had one of these for a few years and liked it so much that when it started to make some noises</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be careful with this though because if you use too much hair it might get caught in the top part of the brush and get tangled.</li>
            <li>Looked everywhere locally after my old one of five years broke after being dropped on its head too many times.</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about this order was that it only took a day to get here!</li>
            <li>If I turn the thing on and let it sit for a bit the air does warm up some, but I have to use an outlet in a  different room since both this and my blow dryer can&#x27;t use the same outlet without blowing a fuse.  </li>
            <li>Works well, glad I was able to replace a broken one.</li>
            <li>Like that one a lot more.. Doesn&#x27;t have a loud blower like this and this one only lasted me about a month.</li>
            <li>Love this Curling Brush, Hard to find curling brush with hot air!!  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning and was extremely pleased with how easily it was handled, and how well it dried with only 1 arm.  </li>
            <li>Cannot live without this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it especially for us of the fine hair variety.</li>
            <li>It does not make my hair stick straight which is fine as long as it straightens it</li>
            <li>Have used this styling brush for years and love it, but wasn&#x27;t able to find it at a local store where I usually purchase it.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love the product.</li>
            <li>The 1 1/2 inch barrel styler is available, but gives me a flat result.  </li>
            <li>The brush is much better, then other brands.</li>
            <li>Her original lasted about ten years, so hoping this one will also.</li>
            <li>I bought 3 or 4 different styles trying to find something to replace my original, but was not satisified with any of them.</li>
            <li>Although I have combo fine brown hair and coarse white hair, this dryer does its work quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have had many of these in the past, and the most recent one I purchased had poorer quality.</li>
            <li>This type of styler works better than any other for me.  </li>
            <li>This dryer feels really cheap, like there&#x27;s hardly anything going on in the handle (on the positive side, it makes this really light), but it doesn&#x27;t put out a lot of air or heat.</li>
            <li>I tried another hot air brush with higher wattage and could barely get my hand around the handle.  </li>
            <li>Just use the higher setting on this one and spend a few more minutes</li>
            <li>Only criticism is that if you don&#x27;t clean out the air intake area(at</li>
            <li>&quot; Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer features a 1\\&quot; barrel and soft, tangle-free bristles that gently grip and hold to enhance body and volume.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the Vidal Sasson hot air brush styler to anyone who wants to add soft curls to their hair without the worry of burning your fingers.  </li>
            <li>Best when used to style almost dry hair dried with a regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li>THINK MEN MAKE THOSE OTHER HOT AIR BRUSHES, they dont know what there doing!!!</li>
            <li>my hairdresser uses her blowdryer on cool setting to cool it down faster and it works.  </li>
            <li>I took a 2 inch section of hair and pulled down straight - worked ok</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for people like me who have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>The item is high quality and works very well.</li>
            <li>I like it very much for my naturally curly hair  </li>
            <li>I had one previously and love it so much</li>
            <li>Chose this one since I had had such good experience with the previous one.</li>
            <li>I really love this, better than all the titanium, ceramic , ionic other stuff that cost so much and do so little.</li>
            <li>I have fine dry hair</li>
            <li>I ordered this one because the other one I have started to sound funny after 2 years.  </li>
            <li>My old vidal sasoon hot air brush overheated and the connecting parts of the brush melted off.</li>
            <li>It blows hot air while giving a soft curl,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So tonight I&#x27;m ordering the $33 Conair Curling Brush 1.5&amp;#34; Hot Air Dual Voltage from Amazon hoping it&#x27;s a newer model of my old one that died.  </li>
            <li>That requires you to unplug it and let it cool off for several minutes.  </li>
            <li>It may be my luck, but I am returning this second one for a full refund and will NEVER try buying this model again.</li>
            <li>The bristles stay cool enough.  </li>
            <li>This iron allows me to give my hair enough &amp;#34;flip&amp;#34; to it that it gives the appears of being longer and full of body.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this one because it exactly like my old one.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find another blow brush that has these solid plastic bristles that don&#x27;t make my hair full of static.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  </li>
            <li>The product is a good one, but now no good to me.&lt;br /&gt;Anita Redmond</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying hot air brushes for nearly 25 years and for the price, this one cannot be beat.</li>
            <li>The first was about 10 years old when it broke.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quick and easy way to dry my hair and style it at the same time.  </li>
            <li>The curler didn&#x27;t get quite hot enough so was very disiappointed, it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>More money down the drain.</li>
            <li>This product needs a hotter setting and a higher speed to adequately style and dry the hair.</li>
            <li>This low powered VS Hot Air Brush Styler/Curler takes me more than an hour to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>but I live in fear that Vidal Sasson will stop making it!</li>
            <li>I wish I tried this before I purchased a new one!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I found right away that the air that blows out of the wand to encourage drying and curling is barely warm and quite weak.  </li>
            <li>This one is very reasonable in price, and works exactly the same...</li>
            <li>NOT tangle free, my hair gets catch up in it and hard to get free.</li>
            <li>I purchased this hot air brush dryer after seeing the commercial for the much more expensive high end kind.</li>
            <li>so uses much less electricity to get the job done than most blow dryers that are 1200watts or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you use the hot air brush, it works fine for 5 minutes, it suddenly stops, then will not turn back on.</li>
            <li>I USE IT MAINLY</li>
            <li>2nd review - more than a year later!</li>
            <li>This particular model has lasted me the longest.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for a spare as I have had my other one just like it for several years and love it!</li>
            <li>I love this styler/dryer but it doesn&#x27;t hold up to daily use like regular hairdryers</li>
            <li>My only problem is that they don&#x27;t last more than about 4 months if you use it every day.  </li>
            <li>hair dries quickly and this wand helps curl it on the low setting as the insert suggested</li>
            <li>This air brush is hard to find , so glad I could find it , this helps take the frizz out of my hair !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a similar product from a different company for many years without ever getting it caught in my hair.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I have against it is that it doesn&#x27;t last me more than about 6 months.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it is a decent styling tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This hot air brush is exactly what I needed for my short curly hair.</li>
            <li>But, I like them better than some of the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>When it quit working I could not purchase this particular one in any stores.</li>
            <li>AS I HAVE USED THIS PARTICULAR</li>
            <li>I purchased this one because it seemed to have the same brush which i love and for the price i figured if it didnt work out -- no big loss.</li>
            <li>She has short thick hair and says it is great for styling.</li>
            <li>Have been using this particular brand for years, I always have a spare for backup.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length thin soft curly hair and thought this would be a great product for me.</li>
            <li>says works better than way more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>I have never used any kind of curling irons or brushes, so this is a whole new experience for me.&lt;br /&gt;For not knowing what I am doing, my first attempt at styling my hair did not turn out too bad, except over the top of my head</li>
            <li>I do the crown for a bit of lift there as well and it makes the back hang very prettily.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair and this gets it pretty straight for the most part.</li>
            <li>Curling irons probably are more efficient, but if you&#x27;re clumsy like me, this is the right tool.</li>
            <li>I have had a previous version of this styler with a 1.5&amp;#34; brush and absolutely loved it as it had a long cord.</li>
            <li>I love the product, not wanting the tight curl of a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recomend this.</li>
            <li>After reading the buyer reviews and noticing the high ratings on this product, I decided to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>This time it started, but just emitted the high whine and then again quit  immediately.  </li>
            <li>But if you need or like high heat in your styler/dryer this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this drying/styling brush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would work better with little longer hair.</li>
            <li>On the other hot air brushes you cant even get your hair in some of these hot air brushes to do what u want to do on some hot air brushes...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay a little more and get both brushes again.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 the last time so that when the first one breaks, I won&#x27;t have to worry that I will be without one!</li>
            <li>I use this and it helps a little, but there seem to be as many disadvantages as advantages.  </li>
            <li>* UPDATE****I have been using this brush daily for over 2 1/2 years &amp; it has not failed me yet!  </li>
            <li>so it is ok for a little girl to play with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since my hair is fairly fine, it doesn&#x27;t take me a long time to complete the job.  </li>
            <li>hot air brush is not meant to be the only tool used to completely dry a full head of soaking wet hair; it&#x27;s much better suited for finishing.</li>
            <li>barrel is too large &amp; it isnt hot enough.</li>
            <li>This product is all plastic (gentler on my hair) and, if it&#x27;s as good as the last one like this that I owned, it will last a very long time!  </li>
            <li>I have to blow dry my hair with my original drier then styling with this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not have high expectations for this product, but when I used it I was pleasantly surprised at how much it lifted and refreshed my hair.</li>
            <li>Burns out in a few months if you use the &#x27;high&#x27; button, but I still love this curler.</li>
            <li>Love this hard to find hot air styler.</li>
            <li>This brush doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair which is fine yet slightly wavy.  </li>
            <li>me, it takes the place of what professional hair stylists do -- i.e., use a real brush/hand held dryer to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I plan on ordeing a few more to keep in my gym bag and travel bag.  </li>
            <li>Long hair may get tangled up, so it&#x27;s better for short to medium length hair.</li>
            <li>So much that I bought one to leave at my yearly travel destination and a spare at home for the day my first finally gives out.</li>
            <li>It never worked again, and it wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much simpler and lighter to use this hot air brush than to use a brush and a dryer, although it doesn&#x27;t deliver the same result.</li>
            <li>I love this product and received it within a few days</li>
            <li>Unless you have very short, very wispy hair, this hot air brush isn&#x27;t going to do anything for you.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to buy another normal one.</li>
            <li>These last about 5 years, but at the price it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>However, the brush doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to provide much curl.  </li>
            <li>It somewhat blow dried our hair after sitting there for more than a hour.  </li>
            <li>It barely gets hot, and maybe it&#x27;s me, but the &amp;#34;styling&amp;#34; part of this styling tool eludes me.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years now and it is one of the few that works well for my type hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is relatively short (3-4&amp;#34;), but this size styler works really well.  </li>
            <li>Having at the same time the curler and the dryer is one of the best ideas because you don&#x27;t get tired holding the dryer and the brush at the same time.</li>
            <li>, they only seem to work for a couple of years before they need to be replaced, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick with waves and a mind of it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>If you want a little body after your hair is almost dry then this would be a good tool.  </li>
            <li>My old Sassoon was SO old it started melting and left black flecks in my hair, but I got a good twenty years out of it, so no complaints here.</li>
            <li>It was not hard to decide 1 day shipping at quite a cost.</li>
            <li>And, no it is not a breaker because other items electrical items will work just fine.</li>
            <li>I love this product but they dont last very long before they burn up.  </li>
            <li>It says \\&quot;rotating\\&quot; right on the package, but the only way it would \\&quot;rotate\\&quot; is by manually turning it around and around.  </li>
            <li>They are just right for my short permed hair.</li>
            <li>Went right to the same model for the replacement.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; my hair (unless your hair is very short), but right after I blowdry it to add some curl.  </li>
            <li>My wife had a previous unit that lasted &gt;10 years before becoming inoperable.</li>
            <li>It styles my hair quickly and my curls hold for a long time.</li>
            <li>my super long hair gets tangled in the brissles</li>
            <li>When I let it air dry, I just don&#x27;t get the full curls as I do with this unit.</li>
            <li>Because it isn&#x27;t super curly or thick, my hair just kind of goes &amp;#34;blah&amp;#34; after I blow it dry.</li>
            <li>The last one I had worked fine on short hair</li>
            <li>I need to buy a new styler.</li>
            <li>After a while it wears out and I need a new one.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>And when this new one wears out, will get me another one..</li>
            <li>I need to or a new  one once in a while.</li>
            <li>I have already had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I immediately went and shopped for a new one, specifically VS.</li>
            <li>I ordered this, and another brand, as a result of a new hair style.  </li>
            <li>She wanted a new one and couldn&#x27;t find one in a retail store.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live with out it.</li>
            <li>I  thought, &amp;#34; I can&#x27;t live without this tool for my hair</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t mind buying a new one.  </li>
            <li>Paid for shipping both ways and had a new one in a week.  </li>
            <li>but thought it time for a new one.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>since I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>I order a new one after it quits working.</li>
            <li>When the one I had started wearing out I ordered a new one from Amazon and received it yesterday.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Have used this for years and always return to it after trying something new on the market.</li>
            <li>I needed a new one and ordered this.  </li>
            <li>It went to the heaven closet where all the products I don&amp;#34;t like live.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been working on getting use to this new</li>
            <li>This is just what my brand new pixie cut needed to get that bit of oomph on the crown.  </li>
            <li>Still works but the new one will take over now.</li>
            <li>and I needed a new one.</li>
            <li>The one I had and this new one are both 1 inch in size.</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cant live without it</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live w/o this hair styler.</li>
            <li>local stores carry only the HUGE items&lt;br /&gt;lightweight</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle, lightweight, and my hair (slightly longer than chin-length) has never tangled in it.  </li>
            <li>This will dry your hair quickly and allow you some styling ability.</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly, so I use this after using the blow dryer with the round brush to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll get the same result -- worth it as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time to wait on the whole process when I&#x27;m getting ready for work, so the last time I bought two to have a spare when that happens.  </li>
            <li>Can dry and style quickly  </li>
            <li>i quick dry just out of shower hair then finish drying hair and style also with this brush styler/ dryer-</li>
            <li>Quick hair drying that adds volume as you dry.  </li>
            <li>Others might last longer don&#x27;t know but ones I have paid more for have a harder brush and the ones with metal shafts</li>
            <li>long, pretty straight</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own after a few minutes and does not want to switch back on for another 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars on fancy products, oils and the ever popular \\&quot;what-not\\&quot; only to end up with soft, nice smelling, frizzy, thin</li>
            <li>Quick dry and style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine now since it cooled down.  </li>
            <li>Another problem is that the untangle button is very near the on and off button</li>
            <li>Very professional results.</li>
            <li>Very loud, did not curl hair..</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the smell that was there in the first order over a year ago is present in  my brand new brushes.  </li>
            <li>I had my hair cut shorter than usual and thought this item would be good to dry and curl my hair under.</li>
            <li>Okay, it has a smell like mildew, but I can get past that.</li>
            <li>This is the only hot air brush that works on my baby-fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact model I had and the only one I would buy.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it gets hot and shuts off.  </li>
            <li>I have used this hot brush for years, replacing it when necessary.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this Hot Air Brush (this is my third one) years.</li>
            <li>so I had to use a regular heating iron or one with brush(not hot air).</li>
            <li>This is my second hot air brush.</li>
            <li>After several years the first one gave out.</li>
            <li>This hot air brush left my hair frizzy.  </li>
            <li>instant heat and not too hot...</li>
            <li>I used this exact product for years, until it recently broke (after using for over 10 years).  </li>
            <li>Not one of the local stores carried this type of hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have bought a few of them in case they are ever discontinued!</li>
            <li>I found the prior model of this hot air brush almost a decade ago and have been using them ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>mM hair is pretty short.  </li>
            <li>I have used this style of hot air brush for several years, but then I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.  </li>
            <li>This air brush was a replacement for my worn out brush,but it didn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>It has a mind of its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only become aware of the hot air brush recently and did my research on you tube</li>
            <li>I have used it for years and dreaded the death of my current hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>This is my second bought it just in case my first burns out &amp; it was on sale too</li>
            <li>This hot air brush is essential to me!  </li>
            <li>Works much better that several other Name Brand ones</li>
            <li>My hot air brush died and none of the big box stores had the one I wanted!  </li>
            <li>I feel I can go to work looking professional once again!</li>
            <li>The Vidal Sassoon Hot Air Brush Styler/Curler 1 1/2\\&quot; has been my only functional source of hair styling since the &#x27;90s.     </li>
            <li>Thus, my search on Amazon to find the hot version of the only tool that works with body, my hair, and my patience level.</li>
            <li>After 6 months when it gets too hot shuts off and won&#x27;t turn back on till it has cooled off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this hot air brush for years; it&#x27;s an essential tool for me.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and the hot air brush styler</li>
            <li>AMAZON is the only place I can find this HOT AIR BRUSH.</li>
            <li>This is my third one over the last ten years, love it</li>
            <li>.. it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my liking and I also would prefer if the barrel was metal or ceramic to retain the heat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used hot air brushes daily for years.</li>
            <li>(it blows the same way you blow you hot coffee to get colder</li>
            <li>so I was already aware of it&#x27;s capabilities and wanted another like it but couldn&#x27;t find it at a local store.</li>
            <li>Just like using big curlers, but much faster!</li>
            <li>I have used this hot air brush for several years now.  </li>
            <li>Also good for those of us too uncoordinated to have a blow dryer in one hand and the round brush in the other.</li>
            <li>It does not entangle my fine hair, but the curls come up quite lose, and do not last long.</li>
            <li>I purchased a different brush and had to go back to this as you can remove the brush and clean the hair product gook out.</li>
            <li>I do need to say I use it everyday and within about 12 to 18 months it just dies.. but not bad for the money!</li>
            <li>I have a torn rotator cuff and cannot hold my arm high enough to hold a regular iron long enough to make a nice curl.  </li>
            <li>My old brush fits my new styler so now I can use both sizes.  </li>
            <li>I bought new this one when my old destroyed.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy the same item as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>I had previously had the same product approx 10 yrs and \\&quot;thanks\\&quot; to&lt;br /&gt;Amazon I was able to purchase the exact same hot-air/style brush.  </li>
            <li>Have an old Vidal sassoon hot air brush and finally it stopped working and replaced it with another...great product</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this appliance allows me to have a fuller head of hair with little effort.</li>
            <li>Particularly useful if limited hair styling skills like me.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the positive reviews and the price, but you definitely get what you pay for in this case.</li>
            <li>I have used the exact same Hot Air Brush Styler for a long time and bought this one as a replacement.  </li>
            <li>Have short hair and this hot air brush really doesn&#x27;t work for short hair.</li>
            <li>They actually last pretty well, especially considering the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>but i do not use on long hair only shoulder length or short love it</li>
            <li>I have purchased several of these brushes in the past and they give a nice natural wave to my hair.  </li>
            <li>It all depends on how much it pulls my hair over the next couple of days it takes for the new one to arrive.</li>
            <li>I buy a new one every year, but lately haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores.</li>
            <li>It is tangle free, can dry &amp; style at the same time and do \\&quot;not\\</li>
            <li>This styler dryer does a decent job of taming the frizz, which is my main objective.</li>
            <li>This is such a time-saver, being able to dry and curl hair at the same time.</li>
            <li>but it was too large for short hair.  </li>
            <li>A little cheaply made,  but works well.</li>
            <li>Keep both intake areas clean and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I have long, very straight hair and purchased this as an alternative to a curling iron to curl the ends of my hair under.</li>
            <li>I tried mostly drying my hair with the regular dryer then using this but still little luck.</li>
            <li>this item is hard to find love it</li>
            <li>OK product, hard to get it to grip hair</li>
            <li>so I went ahead and bought two new ones so they would be available when the other ones finally go out.</li>
            <li>If you have extremely thin/delicate hair, you may be able to completely dry your hair with it</li>
            <li>You will have to be careful to keep the lint filter free of buildup or it will stop working if it gets too hot--but it will run on high heat for quite a long time.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t make clear the elctric power before I order it.</li>
            <li>This low heat ensures my hair is very shiny and soft when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>Yes, as a previous custmer mentiioned, clean out the vent every couple of months.</li>
            <li>My hair wants to curl naturally, but at the same time it tends to be frizzy.</li>
            <li>But it is clearly junk.</li>
            <li>But again - for the price amazon offers -no complaints.</li>
            <li>Looks and performs like the old one.</li>
            <li>If my hair dries to much, i just brush through it briefly with a damp brush and then style.  </li>
            <li>It really should last longer than this!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what I will do if they discontinue it completely.  </li>
            <li>But the big plus is that it&#x27;s very lightweight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had long hair for many years and finally decided to cut it all off into a long bob.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking all over to replace my old one that stopped working.  </li>
            <li>My old Conair went out and I couldn&#x27;t find another one</li>
            <li>Now she has a spare, as the problem with the old one was clogged vent slots.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t every\ die, it just gets old and used.</li>
            <li>I ordered two so that I would have the next one ready to go.</li>
            <li>My hair fluffs up and the wave becomes a loverly soft curl.</li>
            <li>The rubbery bristles and wand are gentle on my hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;No burned fingers wrapping my short hair around it.</li>
            <li>Is Vidal still alive?  </li>
            <li>Boy was I surprised.  </li>
            <li>I took it straight back to the store.</li>
            <li>My hair is rather coarse and is a mix of curly and straight with lots of cowlicks.  </li>
            <li>If I could I&#x27;d post a before-and-after picture here to show the marked difference</li>
            <li>This is the only curling iron you really need.</li>
            <li>The brush part is soft plastic and doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp when I use it.</li>
            <li>The absolute only frown face about the product</li>
            <li>If you are a child I would use this but not on an adult.</li>
            <li>I purchased a curling iron years ago and it being so old the name had worn off.</li>
            <li>Wife&#x27;s old one quit working and bought these as replacements.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a soft brush styler/dryer</li>
            <li>and i really didn&#x27;t think it would be much different.  </li>
            <li>I have short and straight hair.</li>
            <li>I love this unit and have been using one like it for at least 20 years.</li>
            <li>I had an old brush that was 15 yrs old when it quit working.  </li>
            <li>It makes soft curls, which is what I want fr this brush.  </li>
            <li>Now my old one just &amp;#34; couldn&#x27;t take it anymore&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My old model died of old age..</li>
            <li>replaced an old one just like it.  </li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li>A natural look.</li>
            <li>They burn my hair and sizzle anytime I get near my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The dryer still works but not the spin action.</li>
            <li>I have hair that hangs 4-5 inches below my shoulders and this curls and dries my hair for a soft curl look.  </li>
            <li>Not enough heat to really curl the ends of your hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back when I&#x27;ve accomplished getting to my goal</li>
            <li>The description for this product is completely misleading.  </li>
            <li>I now have soft hair that has ringlets at the bottom.</li>
            <li>I HAVE HAD A VIDAL SASSON HOT AIR CURLING BRUSH FOR AS LONG</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for the vast variety of products you offer!</li>
            <li>First one of these I ever used, wish I could have found it long ago.</li>
            <li>(its already old and used by 5~6 Young Ladies).</li>
            <li>old.</li>
            <li>Drys and soft curls.</li>
            <li>I guess there is a reason why it was so much cheaper than similar products.</li>
            <li>and I learned that a 1&amp;#34; brush is really too big.  </li>
            <li>I do plan to order another one just like it but a smaller size since I now wear my hair much shorter.</li>
            <li>Now I can style it just like a professional would.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like it because it gives you soft looking</li>
            <li>curls- not the really defined ones that you get with a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li>I prefer the thicker plastic bristles to the natural boar bristles because they don&#x27;t get tangled in my hair.  </li>
            <li>OK, not thrilled with it</li>
            <li>Smoothes while enhancing natural waves.</li>
            <li>I think this would actually take much longer.</li>
            <li>I have natural curls on my hair.</li>
            <li>I was using it one morning and heard a loud click and the brush no longer worked.  </li>
            <li>Since the brush doesn&#x27;t have much power to begin with, I&#x27;ve never tried the low</li>
            <li>It is more expensive, a bit over $50, but worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Result is a good, casual hair style.</li>
            <li>It helps give my fine hair a lift and helps take away the frizzy mess that I often get!</li>
            <li>Basically, Every morning since I was 15 years old I plugged in the curlers, waited for them to heat up, set and wait for it to cool down.</li>
            <li>The brush has very little blow power/force, thus making the styler only good for setting a curl, not drying a curl in place (unless you have hours to dry your hair);&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>it turns off after 1 minuet of use and has to cool down before it will turn on again.</li>
            <li>I can only use on the longer back part right now.</li>
            <li>Last time, I ordered 3 of them at once and 1 of them had a short in it right off the bat.  </li>
            <li>I have used Vidal Sassoon hot brushes for over 10 years, and hope they are around for a long time!</li>
            <li>(all I want) and semi dries it if I towel dry first and let it rest awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li>I have to blow dry my hair with a blow dryer and brush first</li>
            <li>I blow dry first then use it.  </li>
            <li>then  blow the rest dry with Sasson hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>Quick dry as i have short hair</li>
            <li>No tangles, no mess.</li>
            <li>You take small sections and go over each piece a few times twisting and turning the brush if you want long beautiful waves.</li>
            <li>My old one was beginning to slow down, so I thought it wise to have another one on hand.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because my hair is now very short and my other hot air brush is too large to use.  </li>
            <li>I like this hot air brush enough that I keep an extra one on hand.</li>
            <li>Later I found the exact same item for $10.99 at Wal-Mart store.</li>
            <li>I had a Conair hot air brush that finally quit working after several years</li>
            <li>Not good quality, and I probably need a larger roll, the brush was kind of flimsy and it would get tangled with my hair.</li>
            <li>but I suspect you are not going to get decent curls out of this because of the low heat.</li>
            <li>I have tried similar Vidal Sassoon stylers in the past that worked better than this one on my shorter hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this one with decent reviews for a low price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Does not cause the same heat damage that regular curling irons do because it creates curls with hot air.</li>
            <li>Also like because the hot air barrell is smaller for short hair, and I like the plastic comb instead of bristles.</li>
            <li>Best purchase ever it does exactly what i want and has never shut down!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I use a regular blow dryer to do the main drying after I wash my hair, then use this brush/dryer to finish.</li>
            <li>I have fine, medium-short hair that wants to curl always in the opposite direction of what I want, and lots of cowlicks that make it really hard to style.</li>
            <li>AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT THE HIGH HEAT OF A CURLING IRON.</li>
            <li>It gets stuck constantly in my (long, straight) hair, creates static (seriously), and has crappy drying power.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it after my hairdresser recommended a new way of drying my hair that entailed me needing two extra arms to complete.  </li>
            <li>Takes only a little while and my hair looks better than it has in several years.</li>
            <li>and if I briefly towel dry and then let my hair air dry for a bit, it only takes about 20 minutes more to complete the job.  </li>
            <li>My short, straight, grey hair needed a &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;, so I had high hopes for this brush.  </li>
            <li>Was unable to find it locally, so very glad Amazon still carries this one.</li>
            <li>Old one apparently gave out and couldn&#x27;t find a replacement in stores.  </li>
            <li>This styling brush is a bit underpowered, but the far bigger problem is that the bristles are so far apart from one another hair just falls off of it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve used a hot air brush - much harder to use than I remembered, tangles a lot and takes forever.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I expected of it.  </li>
            <li>The heat on the hot side is just minimal</li>
            <li>I have bought so many much more expensive styling tools that I took back in a hurry due to the fact that they did not work.</li>
            <li>On my first try, I got so tangled that I spent 2.5 hours ripping hair out of the brush and still had to cut the thing out.</li>
            <li>Great tool for those of us too clumsy to hold a brush in one hand and a hairdryer in the other and point them in the same place at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;But can overheat if you wrap your hair in it instead of keeping it moving.</li>
            <li>They were either too large, too small, or did not have hot air.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>This is light enough to keep at work for those times when your hair needs a little help.  </li>
            <li>I normally air dry my hair and only use the brush dryer on my bangs, so it doesn&#x27;t have to do much.  </li>
            <li>If hair does get tangled on brush you simply turn off the brush which immediately cools down and then just simply push the release button and your hair can easily be removed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this was a great buy for anyone with thick or hard to manage hair.  </li>
            <li>I of course have to use a transformer adapter to use it in New Zealand as the above Conair products but the Air Brush is spasmodic in its output and becomes noisy and turns off.  </li>
            <li>Tried this one and it was doing a great job but must have had a short somewhere because it kept cutting in and out while I was using it.</li>
            <li>completely dry straight out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>It took much longer for my hair to dry</li>
            <li>hair is very curly, and I used to just let it dry.</li>
            <li>It is inexpensive enough that if you don&#x27;t like it or don&#x27;t use it daily, you are not out much money.</li>
            <li>Its very lightweight and so much easier to maneuver than a heavy blow dryer and brush.  </li>
            <li>The soft rubber bristles give me Soft curls that last all day.</li>
            <li>It will not deafen you as others I have tried, which the flipside of that is that it is not super powerful.  </li>
            <li>I can get to last at least a couple of years or more.  </li>
            <li>This one I&#x27;ve had for a few years, but is starting to sound like it&#x27;s going to die, so ordered another one.  </li>
            <li>I have used this very same brand hot air brush for years (in fact I&#x27;ve had it for so long</li>
            <li>Before I used this, people were telling me I should probably just cut my hair short again, and since I started using this, those same people are saying how much they like how my hair looks.</li>
            <li>I do turn the brush on a few minutes before I plan to use it since it takes a few minutes to warm up.</li>
            <li>Dried my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Others I tried had a very large handle which was uncomfortable in my hand or had so much power that my hair would blow all over the place and the style would blow right out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only got 45 seconds to get my hair done (unless I want to wait another 10 minutes for it to cool down.)</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care for the ones you find in the stores right now with the hard bristle brush attachments.</li>
            <li>I always use the high fan speed because I have super thick hair</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just really fine and hard to wrap around the wand...</li>
            <li>this one is ok but weak.</li>
            <li>have baby fine hair, and it is hard to get any sort of curl or body into it without a perm.  </li>
            <li>My other hot air brush had 1100 watts of power &amp; it caused my hair to frizz.  </li>
            <li>(No other company makes one like this that I can find.)  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t try to dry your hair with it, because the heat is pretty low.</li>
            <li>When i used it for the first time the look was like as if i got a salon dry and looked similar to what my haircut was 3 months ago when i had one.</li>
            <li>I have had this product for about a month and the first time I used it my hair got tangled and there was not enough air coming out of it to dry my hair,,</li>
            <li>Giving it only one star, because after only a few uses, it made a loud popping sound &amp; quit working.</li>
            <li>right where the brush attaches it broke in half.</li>
            <li>Good for thin hair ,and up to chin length.can dry and style at the same time.</li>
            <li>I can recommend this one only to somebody who is willing to buy a new one every half year.</li>
            <li>This product works fine, my only complaint is that this product was shown when I searched for a revolving dryer/styler, 1&amp;#34; diameter, soft bristols.</li>
            <li>I am going to give it to my little 7 years old niece who is interested to style her hair to play with it as a toy.</li>
            <li>There are only 2 settings - high &amp; low.  </li>
            <li>With irons I would always have the occasional ouch when my hand went where it shouldn&#x27;t have gone, I&#x27;m really not good with most styling</li>
            <li>Small enough to fit into a suitcase for travel.  </li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for, to replace an old one that died... same model, etc.  </li>
            <li>This Hot Air Brush is not worth buying.</li>
            <li>It dries and soft curls at the same time.</li>
            <li>I had this product for several years when it tried to die, but my husband fixed it w/duct tape.  </li>
            <li>This tangles in my hair if I am not careful.  </li>
            <li>Went back to using my old one even though it is heavier.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and the curls didn&#x27;t last two hours.  </li>
            <li>It dries your hair and adds soft curls (that hold) at the same time.</li>
            <li>I recently broke my old VS \\&quot;blowbrush\\&quot; by dropping it on my cermamic bathroom floor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely dependent on them and keep an extra supply at all times.</li>
            <li>is the power button is located directly below the brush release button, so inevitably I am turning off my device when attempting to release the curl.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m back to my old blow dryer and electric rollers.</li>
            <li>Well it barely blows air, does not heat like a curling iron or at all for that matter, tangled up in my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>I finally bought one at Walmart, the Infiniti Conair with soft bristle brush that also rotates as you curl.</li>
            <li>: The low wattage means it takes quite some time to get your hair completely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one for years, same brand, and I knew mine was going to stop working soon because it was about 35 years old.</li>
            <li>Got this for my sister, her old one finally gave out.  </li>
            <li>was really fooled big time, ill threw this away because it will cost me more to return it to the shipper.</li>
            <li>I hope this brush is not discontinued in the near future, for me, its all I need.</li>
            <li>is the only way to get a soft lift to my hair.  </li>
            <li>You can unlock the brush to release curls made in a fixed poition, which is not the same thing as rotation.</li>
            <li>I had used the 3/4\\&quot;, but could not find in stores; apparently the 3/4\\&quot; size is not made by Sassoon any longer, but I got the 1\\&quot; at Amazon</li>
            <li>Went back to professional products.</li>
            <li>My curls are soft and they last.</li>
            <li>but apparently they all are.</li>
            <li>I have only used this once so far.  </li>
            <li>I am going to send it back but have been too busy to do yet.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do any styling, just barely leaves a wave.  </li>
            <li>Barely warms up either .</li>
            <li>Barely any air comes out.  </li>
            <li>With this hot air brush I expected I could actually shorten the process and assure a smoother look.  </li>
            <li>Really nice and just like the expensive one.</li>
            <li>The secret to this one is no metal touching my hair.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re growing your hair out like I am, this tool is definitely a good one to help with those awkward in-between stages.</li>
            <li>I have very wavy hair that is getting worse with age, and this works very well to smooth it and get it to lay down.  </li>
            <li>I get it almost dry with a blow dryer then finish with this to smooth the frizz a little.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mom who has very fine blond hair quite thin for a woman only in her 60s</li>
            <li>I use this daily on my shorter, very fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>ONLY buy if you have very fine thin hair</li>
            <li>and I use it probably more due to the handle size being a little smaller.</li>
            <li>started with complete bed head and dampened my hair then followed the directions to dry two inch sections of it at a time from underneath, then in the opposite direction occasionally since I wanted it straight, not curled.  </li>
            <li>The heat comes quickly and the rubber bristles are soft enough but firm enough.</li>
            <li>Sucking lint out with a vacuum cleaner fixed it.</li>
            <li>I have had several of these and am trying to extend the life of the current one by drying my hair first with a blow dryer and just using the styler when the hair is nearly dry.</li>
            <li>My wife tried several different types of  Hot Air Brushes, and all seem to have characteristic that did not meet her expectation.</li>
            <li>really like the way this allows me to dry and style my hair at the same time</li>
            <li>I use it to partially dry my hair, then I stick in the same diameter Velcro rollers and by the time I&#x27;ve finished my make- up, my hair is ready to style.</li>
            <li>it easily gets hot...which is not good for the hair.</li>
            <li>It died in less than three minutes the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought three other brands of similar dryers over the years when I couldn&#x27;t find this one, and they were all way too hot, even when used on the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li>I have thick straight hair and this brush dryer did not have the blowing power to dry my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>The Sassoon one dries gently enough on high setting, but you can still change to low as you finish up, or refresh the next day.  </li>
            <li>She was so happy as her old one she was still using was very dangerous as it was taped up and falling apart.  </li>
            <li>My hair is coarse and hard to curl, but the hot air brush really does the trick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Usually I allow my hair to air dry until it&#x27;s just damp and then finish it with the hot air brush, but in a hurry, I blow it nearly dry and then use the brush.  </li>
            <li>IT WAS THE ONLY STYLER THAT WORKED ON MY FINE, THICK HAIR.</li>
            <li>My hair slides through the other bristle types leaving my hair straight and fly-away.   </li>
            <li>I take very god care of my hair and this is extremely damaging.</li>
            <li>I have thick wavey hair, this is easy to use, it smooths out my hair , ive tryed alot of stuff, But flat irons dont do like this</li>
            <li>Do blow dry to damp, then style....and shipping a new one was a 2 day process.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li>My hair is not thick or long and I have only been using it for about 4 months.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really save me any time, as my hair is just below bra-strap length and quite thick, but by combining the brush with the dryer, it is easier to smooth the hair and is also less work.  </li>
            <li>I have found others in stores that are much more expensive and don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>I have been using it now for about 2 weeks and though better than the Conair, it still SUCKS unless I curl my hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>Creates big, soft curls that look like they took you all morning to do, but really only take minutes from beginning to end.</li>
            <li>I have permed short hair and I mainly use it to straighten out the some of the curl and to dry my hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One can create soft curls or waves by wrapping strands and holding for a few seconds, or create straight styles by brushing through from underneath.  </li>
            <li>After several years of daily use my old brush quit working.</li>
            <li>I bought this styler to replace a ten year old one that had finally started to wear out.  </li>
            <li>This is meant for finishing the style on your 75% dried hair or for touching up already dried hair.  </li>
            <li>I had been lusting after a far more expensive version of this brush and decided to go the cheaper route with this Vidal Sasson version.</li>
            <li>but I have thick hair and have to use my regular hair dryer to dry my hair most of the way before finishing off with this.  </li>
            <li>For those who are complaining this does not dry their hair, I don&#x27;t believe it was meant to do that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kinda getting sick of looking at my pride and joy (my hair) in the mirror and seeing a hot mess staring back at</li>
            <li>I ordered one a year ago and once the motor gets hot, you can&#x27;t turn it back on until it cools down...</li>
            <li>This is a nifty little thing that I first found in a thrift store for $2.</li>
            <li>it doesnt get hot enough to use on even slightly damp hair.</li>
            <li>But when I turned it on to high the blow is not strong nor hot enough to dry my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bad part is that I really liked how it styled my hair!  </li>
            <li>It smells when you first use it, but after a few times, it goes away.  </li>
            <li>First few times I used, I too, had tangled hair.  </li>
            <li>For $11, though, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the hassle of trying to send it in.</li>
            <li>The first few uses smelled like burning plastic, but that eventually fades.  </li>
            <li>to use, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be as harsh and hot as my hair dryer was.  </li>
            <li>The brush did exactly what I wanted it to, I no longer have to suffer through hand cramps using the blow dryer and round brush.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair which doesn&#x27;t dry very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This one leaves my hair very soft and shiny after I spray my hair with a heat protector (my perm always leaves my dyed hair very dry).</li>
            <li>have spent a few years and quite a few dollars trying to find a replacement as Conair doesn&#x27;t make this kind any more...and FINALLY I have found it!</li>
            <li>For the moment I use the thinner brush as my hair is not very long.</li>
            <li>My other goal was to puff up my hair on a non-shampoo day, but that really doesn&#x27;t work since it&#x27;s hard to dampen my hair just the right amount</li>
            <li>I usually use a blow dryer but this product adds great curls and bounce to my otherwise thin hair!</li>
            <li>Also not recommended if you like to dry your hair completely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Relatively low temperature doesn&#x27;t get your hair so hot that it leaves your hair feeling dried out, frizzy and crispy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Five munites with the hot air brush and my hair looks tame.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thin, so this dries it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>When my hair was a little longer, I used the Conair spinning hair brush (large barrel).  </li>
            <li>A pity this was not made clear in the write-up!</li>
            <li>I like it because it takes the place of holding the blow dryer in one hand and a brush in the other and the air is hot enough to dry my coarse/thick Sicilian short hair.</li>
            <li>Although I have the 1-inch roller brush, it is a little bit large for my short hair</li>
            <li>Works gret for fine thin hai.</li>
            <li>My hair (straight, fine-ish) has also gotten tangled in this as I&#x27;ve tried to release the curl, and not just a little tangled, but ripping-hair-out-by-the-roots tangled.</li>
            <li>I dry my hair until it&#x27;s just slightly damp and use the hot air brush to finish styling</li>
            <li>I dry my hair until slightly damp, use this hot air brush</li>
            <li>I like it because it has low heat and will not damage my hair as my hair is thin and fine.</li>
            <li>I usually just dry my hair and leave it slightly damp, pin up the top layers and start curling.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a little more forced air.</li>
            <li>So far, this one does not shut down due to over heating as readily as the last one.</li>
            <li>I wanted to but a hot air brush from a while now and was just researching on the internet about all kinds of hot air brushes and was little skeptical whether they really work or not so tried this one proper in my budget so that even if it dint work i could not cry over it.</li>
            <li>even on high it won&#x27;t dry my short, fine, thin hair and you can forget any curl!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a good or bad product in and of itself.</li>

            <li> It is so easy to use and performs perfectly!  </li>
            <li> It is wonderful for me and my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for my shortish fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the best for styling my permed, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> But I still think this is the best product for one-handed styling of fine hair.</li>
            <li> Best dryer/iron I&#x27;ve ever used on my baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product would be good for curly hair.  </li>
            <li> If you are good with your hands, it helps a litte bit.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find it on Amazon.com and bought TWO, a one-inch barrel and a 1 and 1/2 inch barrel and by the way, the barrels are inter-changeable.</li>
            <li> Good for drying your hair but does nothing for styling.</li>
            <li> good service</li>
            <li> Fabulous tool for perfect styling.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with this tool.</li>

            <li> Good price ?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too good at using it-</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s still a good thing.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to buy this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> WORKS FAIR.</li>
            <li> This brush is going to the Good Will.</li>
            <li> Good choice.</li>
            <li> Do this on every slot then it is good to go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good value for money.</li>
            <li> Good for medium length hair styles.</li>
            <li> It seemed like a good idea</li>
            <li> For the price, it is still a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I was so delighted to succeed in finding these appliances.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Susan wise</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> it does make my hair look every bit as good- sleek with good body.  </li>
            <li> It did not work as good as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> This product is fair.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and in good condition.  </li>
            <li> The quality of this styler/dryer is really good.</li>
            <li> and I got a good price on it.</li>
            <li> The price was good to try something like this too.</li>
            <li> ITS A GOOD PRODUCT  </li>
            <li> Good hair styling tool, priced well.  </li>
            <li> So, I ordered another one, and this one the cord doesn&#x27;t make good connection, so each time and turn the handle, it cuts off...</li>
            <li> Recieved product in good condition and working order.</li>
            <li> a good brand too at a good price.  </li>
            <li> it looks good, but I didn&#x27;t use it yet,</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Dont make the mistake of reading all the good reviews and buy this.</li>
            <li> Good for travel usage.  </li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> Otherwise a good buy and will work well for travel.</li>
            <li> Package and appearance good.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> I did buy a Salon Edition brand in the 3/4\\&quot; size, but it is not as good a product as Sassoon.</li>
            <li> Good size with 1 inch barrel.</li>
            <li> I have never been good at styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good for convenience but the wires inside break because of the twisting.</li>
            <li> Good price, too.</li>
            <li> good product for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a good choice.</li>
            <li> of them work as good as this</li>
            <li> It does do a good job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to lift the roots and curl the ends.</li>
            <li> This product has not one good thing going for it.</li>
            <li> Loved it</li>
            <li> Best tangle free iron out there.  </li>
            <li> CAME IN GOOD TIME</li>
            <li> It is fairly noisy.</li>
            <li> The size is good for medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Over all does a good job.</li>
            <li> I guess this is good if you know how to use it.  </li>
            <li> The brush does a good job of setting a curl in your hair;&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> IT DOES A GOOD JOB DRYING AND CURLING</li>
            <li> My hair tangles very easily and this one does a great job.  </li>
            <li> This air drier is very good and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great addition for easy hair styling!</li>

            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have always used a blow dryer to get most of the water out of my hair and then used this great airstyler to finish it off.  </li>
            <li> About five years ago I was able to purchase this item in the store and it was a great tool for my hair.  </li>

            <li> I was really happy to find it available here and put this one away as a spare!</li>
            <li> It works great, but the top keeps popping off and so the brush part likewise falls off.</li>
            <li> The rubber grips my hair good for a nice roll.</li>
            <li> to be honest, this one is good among all the air brush dryer products, but i wanted a iron one, so i returned it .</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, and just the right size brush...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s perfect, and the 1 inch barrel is just right for me.  </li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might mention, too, that it is incredibly lightweight, something that I appreciate now more than ever, and I&#x27;m sure others will too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> A bar dryer and brush work better !</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, my hair kept getting tangled in it despite my best efforts to cleanly handle it.</li>
            <li> This gives you a great look and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and produces great results.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great price.  </li>
            <li> Using this leaves my hair looking great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to write a review for a product I don&#x27;t use, but I can say my wife loved this brush, which lasted two-plus years of daily use, so we have bought two more for about $14 each—an excellent price for an excellent product sold by an excellent vendor through an excellent company (Amazon)!</li>
            <li> This is great for anyone with fine hair because it doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the barrel because they are plastic bristles.</li>
            <li> Great for women with fine hair.</li>
            <li> thought it might be too large, but it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plastic  but works fine and is light and is perfect for your overnight bag.</li>
            <li> It works amazing</li>
            <li> Warm air does blow through the bristles, but by no means is this a replacement for a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> and I was thrilled to find another&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> I still own mine, and it&#x27;s still operational after three years.</li>
            <li> The brush works as advertised, however, it is not for every kind of hair.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and was delighted to find them  on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> If you like to do your own hair, give this a try.  </li>
            <li> I liked someone&#x27;s suggestion of buying two.  </li>
            <li> Over all it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li> I really liked this styling tool until it started to over heat and shut off after about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Wife liked it.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I saw it on your website.  </li>
            <li> I LOOKED EVERYWHERE, BUT COULD NOT LOCATE IT IN A STORE OF ANY KIND.</li>
            <li> in all a nice manual styler for the price.</li>
            <li> Release button on roller also is nice.</li>
            <li> but still get nice body.</li>
            <li> I would have liked a hotter heat setting in addition to the 2 that it has</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OK, BUT NOT AS GOOD</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s kinda funny--it has a mind of its own, but it cooperates nicely with Vidal.  </li>
            <li> what kind of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great product would recommend</li>
            <li> I was confident with the good reviews</li>
            <li> This is quite a handy tool.  </li>
            <li> Nice doing business with you.</li>
            <li> I use it for curling the ends of my hair inward and find that it does this effectively.</li>

            <li> As mentioned in so many of the reviews, it&#x27;s best to let your hair dry up to a good 80%, then I finish it up with this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really very nice, and the right styler for</li>

            <li> My favorite curling brush.  </li>
            <li> So glad I found this online</li>
            <li> But, the price is okay</li>
            <li> If it would cost more (as some others do), I would probably not continue to buy them and look for something else.  </li>

            <li> Love the brush.</li>
            <li> I love this styler dryer.  </li>

            <li> I was grateful I was able to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> &amp; I just love it.</li>

            <li> Its ok, but my instyler works better.</li>
            <li> I was.hoping to be able to curl the ends of my bob better with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>

            <li> I really love this hairdryer</li>
            <li> OK, I guess.  </li>
            <li> Must have wavy/curly hair, but I use this brush every day and I get so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> was so glad to see them on Amazon, was delivered to my house as soon as 10 days</li>
            <li> Instead my brother was able to cut the spikes off of the barrel to get my hair out.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s ok, nothing to write home about.</li>

            <li> I have used one of these for many years.</li>
            <li> HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY</li>
            <li> I do have a frustration with the curler that I haven&#x27;t seen mentioned in many reviews.</li>
            <li> : I increased the stars from 3 to 4 because I got this caught in my hair and had to disassemble the top to untangle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works for some people.</li>
            <li> Love this styler.</li>
            <li> This is a great product My hands do not work very well</li>
            <li> but I have not been able to find one like it in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> This is so much better than</li>
            <li> Pay more for the &amp;#34;In Styler&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of power or heat, but for traveling it&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li> I love the Vidal Sasson curler brush..</li>
            <li> So glad I found one again...</li>
            <li> I can do better waves/curls with my straightner.</li>
            <li> I would return it, but the shipping would cost me more money</li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a whisper.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;blow brush, and it is better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have given up on doing this because I am worried that I won&#x27;t be able to get my hair unrolled.  </li>
            <li> I have bought several and this is the best one I have found.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li> It makes a lot more noise than anything.</li>
            <li> I have tried many stylers over the years, and I think this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find it at Amazon</li>
            <li> I love that, unlike a curling iron, I can touch it and not burn my fingers.  </li>
            <li> The body to hold during use is a nice size to fit petite hands.</li>
            <li> I found that warm water, a soft nail brush and liquid soap provide great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this is an excellent tool at a very low price, one which I&#x27;ve not been able to find anywhere except Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I have it.  </li>

            <li> Love the release feature.</li>
            <li> I would be sure to keep hair sectioned just to be sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> but maybe I need to do a better job of cleaning it ...</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this produce.</li>
            <li> but so much better.  </li>
            <li> Love this appliance.</li>
            <li> though it was more of a mist to it.</li>
            <li> I WAS HOPING THAT THE BRUSH WOULD BE MORE SLENDER.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M LOOKING FOR A MORE SLENDER BRUSH.</li>
            <li> it needs more power  but its ok</li>
            <li> I thought it was just okay.</li>
            <li> I will order more as I need them.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of all styling tools.</li>
            <li> I used it on my elbow length hair and it curled the ends of my hair wonderfully, giving it some extra style.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I tried many and did not like them as well.</li>
            <li> Have been using this air brush for many years and like how it works for my hair</li>
            <li> Works ok.  </li>
            <li> Glad I did not spend a fortune on it.</li>
            <li> Glad someone invented this tool.</li>
            <li> I love this curling brush.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it styles and dries all in one.</li>
            <li> My favorite styler ever.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer curling iron has been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find this product in a retail store.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It is perfect for those of us who cannot handle a brush and hairdryer at the same time and want a salon look.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find any more buttons than two to push..  </li>
            <li> I am sure I will conquer it.</li>
            <li> Always satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this styler.</li>
            <li> I used to have a tiny straightener since that was all that was needed, but this combination is perfect!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Love this tool.</li>
            <li> This is better for your hair and safer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better than a straighten iron.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning myself.</li>
            <li> Love this drying brush.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean and very easy to use to style hair and release longer hair so that it doesn&#x27;t pull out any hair.</li>
            <li> My wife liked this model she&#x27;d had for years and asked me to order two more for home and the gym when the original wore out.  </li>
            <li> BUT HEY AMAZON, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE SELLING TO THE CUSTOMERS!!!</li>
            <li> I hope Vidal Sassoon will continue to make this great hot brush available.</li>
            <li> It makes the most beautiful natural looking curls with no frizz  and waves that look like you just stepped out of a salon.</li>
            <li> than that, it&#x27;s a good product at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Would be better for someone with strong arms, but I&#x27;m glad I have it just in case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m elderly, with Fibromyalgia and this one is very light weight, and easy for me to manage.  </li>
            <li> and my hair looks full, shiny and amazing.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sasson VS433C Hot Air Brush and Styler broke 5 days after the return policy would have given a refund, before that I really loved it.  </li>
            <li> Good dependable hot air brush.</li>
            <li> drys hair pretty good, not complaints.</li>
            <li> I have had a Vidal Sasson hot air brush before and absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t warm to full capacity.</li>
            <li> Excellent styling tool, especially for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased a Vidal Sasson hot hair brush many years ago from a chain store and was very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair and too uncoordinated (LOL) to use a curling iron, so this is the best of both worlds.  </li>
            <li> Although it looks cheap motor works better than most.</li>
            <li> Works very good, soft curl, easy  to use, light weight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of plastic and is very light and cheap feeling.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and most curling irons</li>
            <li> After I reassembled it, the top stays on just fine.</li>
            <li> Very good, I am on my fourth one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been very talented in doing my hair; holding a brush and blow drying at the same time.</li>
            <li> Glad  to see it&#x27;s still available to purchase.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to find it available through Amazon.  </li>

            <li> had I known it easily breaks.</li>
            <li> as soon as it turns on and gets going it releases a really strong burnt smell and just shuts off.</li>
            <li> I have had this one for 3 yrs and its going strong.</li>
            <li> My old one like it broke after many years of good service.</li>
            <li> I saw this one on line, it looked very close to the one I had, so decided to try 1 more time to purchase a product that I liked.</li>
            <li> expectations for this tool weren&#x27;t high and that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair, the brush must be doing something right!  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product if you have the time and effort to put into it, but until it is improved some more</li>
            <li> so fine hair isn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, this brush attachment grabs the hair, curls it and holds the style.</li>
            <li> It is light weight, easy to manage, does what it claims, and has changed my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think those of you with longer fine hair, or</li>
            <li> A hot styling brush that&#x27;s great and really works well...</li>
            <li> I need the plastic rigid bristles to hold my ultra fine hair.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I I HAVE SHORTER FINE HAIR</li>
            <li> Since my hair is fine; this type of Hot air brush is perfect for giving it some volume and curling it at the same time</li>
            <li> The easy release button prevents my hair from getting tangled and it&#x27;s extremely light weight.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length hair baby fine.</li>
            <li> Everything&#x27;s working fine.  </li>
            <li> This one seems fine.  </li>
            <li> For my fine hair it did nothing.  </li>
            <li> I have jaw-length fine hair.</li>
            <li> , let me tell you - if you have fine hair or shorter hair, this thing is AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like the tangle free button , it makes the curl easy to roll out my hair.</li>
            <li> Having fine, thinning hair, I needed a brush I could manage well.</li>
            <li> This lightweight brush is so light &amp; easy to manage without tiring my arms.</li>
            <li> This brush would probably not be ideal for thicker &amp; longer hair if you wanted it to dry the hair as well as curl.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> I have tried for years to make my fine hair  have body and form and this is the item that worked for me.</li>
            <li> but my fine hair gets caught it in all the time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The brush gives body to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> The one inch barrel is just fine on using this on my hair.</li>
            <li> You cannot fine them in any store.</li>
            <li> I have fine, just below the shoulders length hair</li>
            <li> It works well on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Thought it had a smaller diameter barrel when I ordered it, but was able to take barrel off of older one and switch it to this handle, WORKS GREAT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This curls hair quickly without getting tangled in the brush!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am super pleased with this one, and will probably get another one just to have for a spare.  </li>
            <li> The price was super!  </li>
            <li> It was hot enough to straighten (like getting a good blowdrying at the hairdressers, I notice they always use a very hot setting on the hairdryer and it works great on my hair) and give volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> So after reading other reviews, I saw that one person suggested using a toothpick to clean out the vent at the bottom of the unit, and now the dryer works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, exactly what I wanted, fast delivery &amp; price was good.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean the brush head.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use and so far i have had not problems and the prize was good also.</li>
            <li> I have only used this once since I received it, but I am happy with the way it operates and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other kinds, but this one works perfectly for me...and the price is right too!</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m lucky to be able to get a great style with misted 2nd day hair and this styler.    </li>
            <li> Love this hot air brush!</li>
            <li> Love using this hot air brush!</li>
            <li> great for short fine hair.</li>
            <li> Great for my short fine hair.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect product for me - it styles great you can use it wet or dry!  </li>
            <li> I have very straight, very fine hair.</li>
            <li> I can no longer find this product at my local department stores, so am happy to find it still available at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Huge mistake, won&#x27;t happen again.</li>
            <li> I used an adaptor, plugged it in and BOOM huge sparks every.</li>
            <li> That is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I would like to give 5 stars because I liked it so much</li>
            <li> When I use it, I have to follow with the InStyler to smooth it.</li>
            <li> Its also really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Why isn&#x27;t this model still available in stores?</li>
            <li> Oh well, with 2, shipping is free here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use it to help smooth out my curls.</li>
            <li> Great product for styling short to medium length hair.   </li>
            <li> and there are some that wont even grab your hair to smooth it out, there a joke, and</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Let it be said that she wasn&#x27;t happy with the product for only one reason.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work that well, and the end is cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Smooth, shiny results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles are comfortable and flexible</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Light weight.</li>
            <li> With just a trace of dampness, my hair responds beautifully--it just gives up and behaves itself like an obedient child.  </li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t rotate so ignore that on the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it a try since it is so cheap.</li>
            <li> also use it to smooth frizzy hair days</li>
            <li> Not what I was looking for, but too cheap to pay return shipping.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li> it is light weight and does not pull hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how hassle free it styles my hair.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> After I use this i then use CHI 44 finishing shine spray which puts a light shiny gloss on my hair and the look is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, it was so cheap, I&#x27;ll probably just buy another.</li>
            <li> I start off drying my hair with a more powerful dryer, but finish with this.</li>
            <li> Temperaure choices provide comfortable drying.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the curling brushes that have bristles and my hair just doesn&#x27;t look smooth</li>
            <li> I think it is the air/brush/curling iron combination at the same time that makes it work so great on your hair.</li>
            <li> Great for short hair.</li>
            <li> This would be great on my mom&#x27;s thinner hair if it had a smaller barrel.</li>
            <li> and It feels comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> It is not available in the stores anymore, so this was a great find!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> flimsy and cheap.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to see just what I had in mind and reasonably priced, too.  </li>
            <li> but as you start using it you will be comfortable with it(may</li>
            <li> Its light weight</li>
            <li> God Bless and enjoy your day,,</li>
            <li> This seems to fit the bill</li>
            <li> The best part is no curling iron burns or dried out hair from every day use.</li>
            <li> Price was cheap, so  </li>
            <li> material is cheap</li>
            <li> - it looks really cheap and feels really cheap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The cord doesn&#x27;t twist as freely as one might hope.</li>
            <li> Works great with my short hair.  </li>
            <li> It is tangle free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> I hope this styler remains available.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have had two or more which I rarely use because I have my hair done at the shop.  </li>
            <li> This works out great for especially my curly hair, and makes it easier for straightening out before using the hair straightener.</li>
            <li> Could it be more powerful?</li>
            <li> Cheap and a piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much I bought one for my mom as well.</li>
            <li> But great for travel and no pre-heating necessary</li>
            <li> My hair was not going smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s advertised as tangle free, but it took me 20 minutes to untangle my hair from the brush</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> Cheap, didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s available to purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not too sure if like... have rarely used</li>
            <li> Great price, and the ONLY place I can find it is on Amazon!</li>
            <li> tangle free, my butt...</li>
            <li> The plastic combs help to hold my hair on the curling brush to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> I liked the curlng brush (iron) but whould have liked it to make smaller curls.  </li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll be, like me, surprised and delighted with it.</li>
            <li> It was so cheap, it would cost more than it&#x27;s worth to return it--otherwise I&#x27;d send it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After blow drying with a round brush to mostly-dry my hair, I use this tool to shape and smooth and it does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> On Monday my brushes arrived - on Tuesday I was able to return to easy use of a hot air heating brush.</li>
            <li> This is an okay hot air brush but it gets tangled easily in my hair</li>
            <li> It also features a cool tip for easy styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what you get for $10!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t find this dryer very useful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very worth your money.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush is way easier and faster than a curling iron, and it does a great job on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> so I was happy to find this exactly like the old one,</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t thrown it away because it does make my hair look great, and i haven&#x27;t seen anything that looks exactly like my old one (the barrel was longer, wider, and the bristles were shorter).  </li>
            <li> My curling iron was burning me half the time, so I feel that this brush is much safer, and, if you spend the time to figure how how to get the best result on your hair, you&#x27;ll be pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, quick, and won&#x27;t tangle.  </li>
            <li> Have never been able to produce good results with the brush and dryer, so gave up long ago.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> Makes drying and fixing my hair an easy, quick job.  </li>
            <li> It curls quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This one is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> so I had hoped this would be a quick and easy styling tool</li>
            <li> It gives a nice curl and does a decent job at helping to keep the frizzies at bay.  </li>
            <li> Curls and drys my hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for smoothing down the frizzies and getting all the ends going in the right direction after a shampoo, and it&#x27;s good for touch-ups in between.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and dries my hair and lets me style it very easy.</li>
            <li> It works great on my fine long hair!!</li>
            <li> So glad I was able to get a new one.</li>
            <li> It gets warm right away, but not too hot</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this curling brush..keeps my hair frizz free, even on dry hair..</li>
            <li> I love this hot air curling brush&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reviews -- I&#x27;ve used the Revlon and Conair Hot Air Brush for YEARS and LOVE how they work.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try this.</li>
            <li> I love these hot air brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this Hot Air Brush.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for my first one which lasted many years.</li>
            <li> Try it, I feel sure you will like it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> Have used this hot air brush for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I never thought I would love a hot air brush</li>
            <li> This curling brush is worth its weight in gold!  </li>
            <li> Better than hot curlers for smoothing the hair and adding volume.</li>
            <li> I love this curling hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> I love this hot air styler.</li>
            <li> So now that the first one is literally falling apart, I bought two more.  </li>
            <li> This hot air brush is okay, but it&#x27;s not what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Glad I made the purchase because it is the exact one I had.</li>
            <li> My original burned out and I could not find anything that worked as well and did not fry my hair....</li>
            <li> I love my Vidal Sasson Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer, 1 inch.</li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush.i try to keep one on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time and totally in love  with it.</li>
            <li> Love hot air brushes.</li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush...</li>
            <li> Ok as a hot air brush.</li>
            <li> Love this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> I recommend spending more money and getting one of higher quality.</li>
            <li> Had first one for many years.</li>
            <li> I love using this type of device for drying and styling my hair, to avoid using a hot iron as well.  </li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush styler.  </li>
            <li> I think a hot curling brush would be better for me.</li>
            <li> this hot air brush is ok.</li>
            <li> This hot hair brush is just OK</li>
            <li> I was so pleased when I tried this one out for the first time.</li>
            <li> And my first one lasted for many years before I had to replace it.</li>
            <li> after use 2 times the hot air brush not turn on any more  .</li>
            <li> I dry and curl my hair with this brush and am very satisfied with the product!</li>
            <li> I have very fine baby hair that is an absolute nightmare to style.</li>
            <li> have very straight hair and need this kind of hot air brush</li>
            <li> I squirt foaming hand soap on the brush and then scrub it with a tooth brush to get all the bristles clean.  </li>
            <li> Looked in many different popular stores.</li>
            <li> I get perms as needed and these are great to dry my hair and keep the curls from looking frizzy.</li>
            <li> I often have to clean out the air intake to avoid overheating.</li>
            <li> It worked out okay for me because I don&#x27;t own an actually blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Your hair comes out super smooth and salon quality.</li>
            <li> Although it states to clean the lint filter, there is no access to the lint filter.  </li>
            <li> I tried to roll more and more hair onto the barrel to get it to style and my hair got completely tangled in it and would not come off.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a screw-off cap at the end of the barrel which allows you to remove the brush to clean it.</li>
            <li> but, you couldn&#x27;t take it apart to clean.  </li>
            <li> even with keeping it clean and well maintained.</li>
            <li> Since I am not very good with curling irons this is perfect!</li>
            <li> I tried another brand first which didn&#x27;t work for me although it had three accessories, which I liked (one was just a kind of a comb) but left my hair quite frizzy as I have a perm.</li>
            <li> this brush is pretty good for touching up volume in my short and thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> The size is just right for my medium length hair, and would be great for short hair as well.</li>
            <li> My hair is short and fine and this gives it a very smooth and healthy look.</li>
            <li> This is perfect to give my fine straight hair a little body.  </li>
            <li> AM CERTAIN THAT YOU WILL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I like this Tangle Free Hot Air Brush, I like the way it feels I like the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve using hot air brushes before and they work well on my hair (shorter, fine, curl resistant) to smooth and add volume and curve.</li>
            <li> Love this curling brush, only thing works on my baby fine hair, love this product</li>
            <li> this hot air brush is super light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Yes, it blows warm air, but pretty much like a dryer on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making them available for me!</li>
            <li> It makes the hair kind of fuzzy, not silky because the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; are too far apart.</li>
            <li> I cannot see this as ANY GOOD for short hair.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair full with just the bend I want..  </li>
            <li> You twirl it yourself; it doesn&#x27;t rotate on its own, so you have complete control.  </li>
            <li> I cant get any styler to make my hair look full</li>
            <li> Overall a good product.  </li>
            <li> Overall, for the price it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I could get some element of style using only one hand and it also did a good job of taming the &amp;#34;frizzies) on damp days.</li>
            <li> most desirable thing about this dryer is that it&#x27;s very convenient to pack it in a suitcase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like to be able to get it with a 3/4&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> But it was cheap and worth a try just to know.</li>
            <li> It is true to its word.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;d likely wear out the dryer fairly</li>
            <li> Works well enough good price</li>
            <li> Have used one for years &amp; works perfectly with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> then let it cool off.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks shiny, bouncy and full again.</li>
            <li> but definitely almost as good as the &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; one as seen on T V...</li>
            <li> I wanted an air brush that I could use on my thick shoulder length hair and this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I am out much if I never am able to get the hang of using it on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was ready to scrap growing it out and cut it ultra-short to avoid the headache of messing with it, but I bought this in a last-ditch attempt to find a cute way to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, Will purchase more.</li>
            <li> Loved it until it tangled in my hair about 1/2 around and had to yank out a big section of my hair!</li>
            <li> &amp; they last fairly well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pushed all the buttons, let it cool between button pushing - well, I had no choice.  </li>
            <li> It thought the barrel would be smaller because I have a shorter hair, but over all, works good</li>
            <li> Having said that, it is not a bad product.</li>
            <li> I like it very much because it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone it is easy to use and blows hot air out as it curls</li>
            <li> Based on other ratings I thought this would be great for my hair</li>
            <li> I think it is the best hot air brush, because of the brush that does not have any bristles that helps to grab the thin hair much better than the ones that have them.</li>
            <li> Once I got a good trim, my hair looked better, but it needed a little something.</li>
            <li> have used several conners over the years - all smooth and curl ALMOST dry hair perfectly.  </li>
            <li> the seller was quick to send I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the order</li>
            <li> Works quickly and well.</li>
            <li> I had one that quit running, I was so happy when I looked and found the same one, I really like this dryed.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.  </li>
            <li> just wish they would not burn out so quickly.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer came quickly and was packaged well.  </li>
            <li> It came quickly was well packaged.  </li>
            <li> However, after some use it quickly gets to the point where it begins to shut off halfway through styling.  </li>
            <li> so that it was mildly damp</li>
            <li> It did well drying my hair quickly, however to curl it</li>
            <li> I received this quickly but it didn&#x27;t rotate.</li>
            <li> Handle is quite fat, hair got tangled and the quick release didn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly and gives a curl and body.</li>
            <li> This curling iron with the tangle free bristles/plastic is perfect for my thin sparse hair</li>
            <li> i had Helen of Troy before, similar but much more power and better performance.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> and I can finish my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super helpful if you&#x27;re away to college and there aren&#x27;t reliable hair salons around.</li>
            <li> It dries and curls it quickly and gives it some body.  </li>
            <li> It blow dries quickly and generally can be combed into a pretty good style, then sprayed and hand adjusted.  </li>
            <li> How lucky for me.  </li>
            <li> Could have a more powerful motor, but for the price I guess you can&#x27;t complain, really.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have bought and it is perfect for my short hair.</li>
            <li> Styles my hair quickly and effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> Purchasing from Amazon is the best way to purchase since it is hard to find in the stores and its mailed right to you.</li>
            <li> No other kind worked,for me.</li>
            <li> However, for me it is perfect since I generally let my hair air dry until it&#x27;s damp--</li>
            <li> It heats quickly and was easy to use -- just too large.</li>
            <li> Even on the warmest setting the air isn&#x27;t very hot.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Tangle Free Hot Air Bush on my hair for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li> trying to get a tangle Free Curling Hot Brush compared to the Perfector and</li>
            <li> Its made cheap and my hair got so tangled with first use, I never used it again...</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with this brush.  </li>
            <li> free hot air brush styler is an awsome product.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked to smooth my hair more than a few minutes before this amazing gadget.  </li>
            <li> the higher heat setting (250 watt) really seems to work so much better on normal-to-thick hair (full bodied hair) than the lower (150 watt).</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a good curl for long.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is the best kind for my short, thin and fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It works great for several months, however, as it gets older, it overheat and shuts off.  </li>
            <li> I actually can make my hair look decent, I&#x27;m so happy I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> bristles make it easy for me to grab a chunk of hair and blow it dry around the bristle brush and have a nice curl.  </li>
            <li> It is a great product that I have been using until it broke down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 or 4 weeks now, and my average number of good hair days has increased tremendously!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, very easy to use, and the sound is low</li>
            <li> This product is not easy to find in the stores any longer so was glad to be able to obtain because it is my favorite hair product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, styles well, but if you have thin hair than it&#x27;s better to pay more and buy smth with more options.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for one of these for several months, just this kind, and when I found you had them I bought 2 right away!  </li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with my purchase and will order one again when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> However, it does overheat easily and turn off which is a real hassle if you are in a hurry to go somewhere.  </li>
            <li> It is very practical, easy to use and curl the hair in a blink.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> My hair gets caught in it easily and the release doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> Best suited for use with long hair rather than short.</li>
            <li> It kind of works - not powerful, but that is okay for finer hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the plastic &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; and it doesn&#x27;t get very hot, but this is fine when I&#x27;m not putting much effort into my hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I use it daily and love it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t opened but am currently using one I&#x27;ve had for years and love it!</li>
            <li> You are my go-to first from now on!</li>
            <li> I am glad i could find another one like my old one!</li>
            <li> then I found it with this seller, at a cheaper price than I paid 10 years ago for the first one!</li>
            <li> This is the second Vidal Sasson VS433C Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer (1-inch) I&#x27;ve owned, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, and love it because it doesn&#x27;t burn you like a curling iron does!</li>
            <li> first one goes out!</li>
            <li> The barrel of the brush was larger and this one tangles hair more easily.</li>
            <li> best product out there  dry and curl hair at the same time .</li>
            <li> The hot air brush has the right kind of bristles - soft tip rather than bristle brush, so you won&#x27;t have hair/bang breakage;&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> but I have straight fine hair.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it works great.  </li>
            <li> This product gets as hot as a hot air blower and makes for great loose curls.  </li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your time and money on this POS!!!!!</li>
            <li> few times I&#x27;ve been able for it to hold and release successfully, it does leave a decent curl</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t encourage anyone to buy something that won&#x27;t even last 3 months--especially when you take very good care of it and only use it once a day!!</li>
            <li> HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS, AND WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND REPLACEMENT WHEN I WORE MY OTHER ONE OUT!!  </li>
            <li> This has largely dissapated over time but causes me to rate a VERY useful tool with three stars.  </li>
            <li> It works great for a few weeks then start to overheat.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and really doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> The 3/4 in barrel styler is also available in stores, but gives me too much curl rather than the lift I am looking for.  </li>
            <li> but this one works very well and isn&#x27;t as loud as my Conair curling brush and the softer brush bristles are more comfortable for the head.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t give a great curl if you have heavy hair</li>
            <li> Really gives body and makes your hair feel light.</li>
            <li> This is great for those of us who can&#x27;t seem to get the round brush and the dryer working in unison.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s finger in a light socket without taking a curler to it and being able to blow-dry at the same time</li>
            <li> is nice especially when I travel.</li>
            <li> It is always nice to buy a product that actually performs as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I looked at the store for the brush I had used without success.  </li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush, --as it truly is tangle-free,--works in the air just the way that you work it in with the hair,--AND,--so much safer to use than a hot curling iron.  </li>
            <li> My hair has become thinner with age, and more fine and drier - and it&#x27;s become evident to me that the less I do to my hair, the better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li> Trust me, it isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love how it gives soft curls.</li>
            <li> Still, I think it is worth it and will keep buying them.</li>
            <li> This is a nice styler, dryer for short hair.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled to find this--the only thing that works well on my hair!  </li>
            <li> I have purchased several of the Sasson hot air brushes and am always very pleased with the price and performance.</li>
            <li> I have one that is MANY years old and could not find a replacement in any store.</li>
            <li> as a result i rarely use.  </li>
            <li> It does not have the soft bristle brush as my old one from Vidal Sasson that I loved.</li>
            <li> I used to own one that look similar to this but has a stronger air blow.</li>
            <li> I have a short haircut and this item gives a nice fullness.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try Amazon.com and was thrilled to find one.</li>
            <li> I have returned it and getting something worth my money.</li>
            <li> Not even worth the one-star</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth trying to return for the price, but will NEVER buy this product again.</li>
            <li> oh wow, do I love this,</li>
            <li> greatly appreciated that the product was of great quality, delivered as expected and there were no hassles or inconveniences in receiving the product.</li>
            <li> but it is nice having it short.  </li>
            <li> The release button near the top of the shaft lets the brush part turn</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people have liked it and only after reading those reviews i bought it, i wanted a dual voltage air brush, and my hair is short,so i didnt need a thicker styler.</li>
            <li> but I rarely used it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t return it because it wasn&#x27;t worth paying the shipping but</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair and really need the body this Hot air Brush/Dryer provides.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice little hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It works beautifully, does not damage my wispy thin hair, and, as someone who is not a cosmetologist, it makes finishing styling my hair so easy.  </li>
            <li> Even though the product suggests the warm setting for fine hair, I have to use the hot setting with heat protective spray  to get what curl it will give me or I am left with almost straight hair.</li>
            <li> YES I was right to pay shipping - it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> I like this styling brush better than any other that I&#x27;ve been able to purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hot air brush.&lt;br /&gt;Really works for my short, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these hot air sttler for many years, adds volume to my short fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, however, like many other customers I have to keep ordering it since it overheats and the motor gives out.</li>
            <li> I have had several of these over the years and am never disappointed, it is one of the most reliable</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, I wish I had ordered it much sooner!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, too!</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair, wear it in a flip, and it takes me about 5 minutes after drying my hair to be ready to go!  </li>
            <li> My hair nis fine and about six inches long on top.  </li>
            <li> I can keep my hand over the barrel to hold my hair and it is not hot to the touch (which is a good thing in my opinion).  </li>
            <li> My other one I LOVED quit working.</li>
            <li> (watch it break off), then use hot rollers (more breakage) then have to pull it back to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> so I come right to Amazon which always has this product.</li>
            <li> , just right and no tangles, though I know if this happened there is a release button to stop the problem.</li>
            <li> This dryer/styler with its lower heat is exactly right for me.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m trying to grow it out right now.  </li>
            <li> The barrel is just the right size.  </li>
            <li> It gives volume and just the right amount of curl.</li>
            <li> i like this styler and it is just the right size for me.  </li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair which slips right through the brush.  </li>
            <li> and the price is right if you&#x27;re a patient person.  </li>
            <li> It took a bit to get the knack of using it correctly, and drying my hair to just the right state of dampness, but, now, I&#x27;ve got it.  </li>
            <li> Just what I needed, it holds my hair without tangling, has just the right amount of airflow.</li>
            <li> The barrel IS supposed to rotate, right?  </li>
            <li> The shipping was right on, came when they said it would.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that needs curl and body and the time it would take to get this brush to make that happen is twice that of the normal process of a hair dryer and roll brush.</li>
            <li> This one should be much easier to clean..</li>
            <li> Thankfully I haven&#x27;t experienced the issues other people have had with the heat being too high.  </li>
            <li> would recommend it to anyone with short to medium length, fine to medium fine hair.  </li>
            <li> If you travel a lot, it is compact and weighs less than most hair dryers, and for me it curls better than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Definitely cuts my routine time in half and gives an awesome finished look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in one of the many phases of growing my hair out from super short to shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> I really like this Hot Air Brush, however, I liked the previous model better.</li>
            <li> As usual it is a gift for someone else, I am happy that I could get it for her, as she is in getting it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and gives a nice soft curl to short hair.  </li>
            <li> In the past they have had dual voltage (120 &amp;amp; 240)and been great for travelling over seas.  </li>
            <li> it is my favorite type of hot air brush styler and dryer that I have found that helps my naturally curly hair that frizzes in hot humid weather</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s worth the time and the efforts to learn to utilize this Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer.</li>
            <li> Works great on every hair type...thick, thin, fine or course.  </li>
            <li> She was so glad to throw the old one away and get started on the new one!!</li>
            <li> with my short hair do...not working out quite as easily as I had hoped for!</li>
            <li> Save yourself some time and spend a little more for a better product.  </li>
            <li> Probably because my hair is short,  I really do not feel like I get very good results with this brush.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and have tried other kinds of hot air brushes, the bristles on this one work the BEST.</li>
            <li> This Vidal Sasson Hot Air Brush stopped working right at 60 days.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly the right size for my medium layered hair length.</li>
            <li> I still use a round brush, but is a perfect addition..especially when styling the back.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I bought 3 as a back up.</li>
            <li> Left to its own devices it would curl in some areas, be straight in others, frizz and puff up in others.</li>
            <li> this makes styling my hair so much easier and it really is tangle free.</li>
            <li> It works best when you hold it in place for a few second and release it; then repeat until you get the desired curl.</li>
            <li> easy to use with my naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length hair that I blow out until almost dry then finish with tis product that puts a nice bend or curl depending</li>
            <li> , the price was reasonable and I received it quickly.</li>
            <li> I had one by another brand that blew as strongly as my hair dryer which is loud.</li>
            <li> Does not get super hot but certainly does the job to which it is intended.</li>
            <li> Connair has a metal barrel which gets slightly warm and helps dry and very much smoothes the hair.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I find where it is not as good as my old Vidal Sasson is it does not heat quite as hot.</li>
            <li> Creates great curls with little frizz and keeps hair super soft.</li>
            <li> Better than John Freida&#x27;s brush, which I used to love, but too much use of the brush and the heat over the last six months was causing irritation to my sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li> Like this curling brush very much.  </li>
            <li> I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> At one point, I had to pull the plug, and take off the brush portion to untangle my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Not using it very much.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much, couldn&#x27;t find one like it in the stores.  </li>
            <li> PRICE WAS VERY REASONABLE.  </li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Received very fast.  </li>
            <li> It was priced very reasonably also.</li>
            <li> Very good product - this is the exact same product as the ones for 49.99 and up on other websites.  </li>
            <li> Good little appliance.</li>
            <li> I just purchased a new one to put in my suitcase for travel or if my original goes on the fritz.  </li>
            <li> works well, saves using two hands  and fluffs hair,  Heat is not too strong so it take longer but feel better about less heat</li>
            <li> Styling fo rme works best when my hair is about half dry</li>
            <li> Straight hair may be in for some but for those of us who have straight, flat hair and need a bit of lift, this really does a good job.</li>
            <li> I like this hot air brush styler  very much.  </li>
            <li> The high is too hot and tow is so cool it doesn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the look of the soft curls this air brush provides.. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> but I find that a regular hair dryer does a better job</li>
            <li> I have never used a hot air brush before, so I cannot compare this to others on the market.  </li>
            <li> I would say it would be ok for short hair.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser, bless her heart, who is my friend as well as my hairdresser, gave me this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> The product (Vidal Sasson VS433C Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush)is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> It is NOT a curling iron - It blows hot air while you wrap your hair around it to make curls.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sasson VS433C Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer, 1 Inch]]  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who thought of a hot air brush styler, but they deserve awards.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll buy a different model to better suit my hair type.</li>
            <li> I love this hair styling too but it is getting more and more difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> so this time my first search was on Amazon and to my delight there</li>
            <li> No maker has ever been able to replace a curling iron and blow drier but this is better than the others I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get too hot, so it won&#x27;t burn your head or ears.</li>
            <li> For this low price I&#x27;m pleased with the results it delivers.</li>
            <li> HOT AIR BRUSH</li>
            <li> Buying another, although my first one is still working.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, did not work well in my short hair, gave it to my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Tames my hair to how I want it, not what it wants to do!  </li>
            <li> The Vidal Sasson Styler is the only curling iron type hot air dryer type I&#x27;ve been able to find.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Vidal Sasson hot air brush that I have owned</li>
            <li> I have used this hot air brush for years...</li>
            <li> I still have the first brush purchased with some cosmetic issues.  </li>
            <li> The present brush (purchased through Amazon) also seems to have electrical issues, indicated by static like clicking when in use.  </li>
            <li> Vidal Sasson VS433C Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer, 1 Inch]]</li>
            <li> I have two put away for back up and will purchase two more just in case.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I cannot find anything that curls my hair like this hot air styler.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what she wanted.  </li>
            <li> Finally, a hot air curler with a brush.  </li>
            <li> I rely on Vidal Sasson&#x27;s hot brushes.</li>
            <li> I have had many different hair lengths during that period.</li>
            <li> I got my first 2 from the grocery/mart stores.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s my second one I have had the first one for many years.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I had air-dried my hair for 45 min</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of hot air brush before</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get overly hot</li>
            <li> I wanted just a hot curling brush</li>
            <li> but I kept seeing these hot air ones and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this hot air brush for about 5 years.</li>
            <li> I have used this Vidal Sasson Hot Air Brush for years.  </li>
            <li> Not so hot the</li>
            <li> I am so grateful to Vidal Sasson for providing this type of hot air brush, hope they never quit making like</li>
            <li> doesnt get too hot.</li>
            <li> size would work better with my very short hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this product several times, with varying dampness of hair, and it would not create many curls.</li>
            <li> my local merchant stopped selling Vidal Sasson&#x27;s Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush, I panicked and bought four more from Amazon just to have on hand in case</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vidal Hot Air Stylers for years.  </li>
            <li> I returned my first one because it did not rotate at all as advertised.</li>
            <li> The first one received did not work at all so returned for replacement.  </li>
            <li> The handle needs to be smaller, to grip better</li>
            <li> I had a hot air brush some time ago and it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> this does it all so bought 2 and have had the first one for over a year</li>
            <li> I bought this hot air brush because I am spending some weeks in a place where there was no hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> My hair gets tangled when I use them but not with this hot air brush.</li>
            <li> and this is the only place I&#x27;ve been able to find it.  </li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I have tried all types of hair styling products from hot rollers, to straightening irons to curling irons.</li>
            <li> Got this in the mail and the first thing I tried was to go from bedhead and test</li>
            <li> I wrapped it up around the brush (its not too hot to wrap your hand around) and used the release button</li>
            <li> with the hot air brush and styler.  </li>
            <li> It immediately begins blowing hot air, depending on your setting choice, so there is no waiting for it to heat up.  </li>
            <li> the first that happened was my hair was severely tangled and knotted.</li>
            <li> I heard a pop and it smelled hot.</li>
            <li> and I love the convenience of drying and curling at the same time.</li>
            <li> However the first one quit working after one use.  </li>
            <li> Neither are the quality of the first one she owned.  </li>
            <li> Have used this hot air brush for years</li>
            <li> First one I had for years before I dropped it and broke the end.  </li>
            <li> this blow dryer - rather than a blow dryer, brush to use with the blow dryer and maybe hot</li>
            <li> I cannot find them in stores locally anymore and was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The first one stopped working after using it twice.  </li>
            <li> i was able to use it for 3x only.</li>
            <li> I recommend this hot air brush 100%; do not know what I would do without it.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough positives on this hot air brush - I just love it.  </li>
            <li> My first one lasted about a year</li>
            <li> I had looked for this exact brush in mutiple stores, but couldn&#x27;t find anythinglike it.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I would not recommend, instead get the Revlon shine enhancing hot air kit.</li>
            <li> so this hot air brush smoothes out my hair.</li>
            <li> I can now style my hair with fullness without using hair dryer and hot curling iron.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> and I get exactly the look I want with it.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> If I change my style and go longer or shorter or use different products, I will try it again and see if it works better for me.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> My first one last me for many years.</li>
            <li> so much that I got two of them, just in case!  </li>
            <li> Works like the one I had 20 years ago and still does the job for a very desirable price!  </li>
            <li> Got tangled in my hair the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> The Vidal Sasson Hot Air Brush styler and dryer has almost no power.</li>
            <li> However, I believe there are better similar products out there!</li>
            <li> BUT I think I will get the hang of it pretty soon.</li>
            <li> love the concept that I will only have to use this tool instead of two tools to get my hair done each morning.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted over 2 years.</li>
            <li> get to hot.</li>
            <li> As many reviewers have commented, this product tends to have a short life because it overheats.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite blow dryer, for my short hair.</li>
            <li> Not as hot.</li>
            <li> this is the onley hot air brush my wife will use.</li>
            <li> Instead, if I turn it off momentarily, I can hear a click (the internal, automatic shut-off) and the dryer won&#x27;t run again until it has safely cooled off.</li>
            <li> So whatever positives I said about this product at first</li>
            <li> I have recently gone back over the latest reviews and saw many ladies talking about overheating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and was unable to find it in the store, so happy to have found it here!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this and have wondered why I can only find it online these days.  </li>
            <li> I use this hot air brush instead.  </li>
            <li> should note that I use this Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer for my synthetic wigs and one day</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I ruined my first one for running for longs periods of time although it lasted 2 years.</li>
            <li> It came on time and it was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> It works well on my hair and is probably the 4th exactly like it I have bought.</li>
            <li> I suppose I am glad that they only cost $15...</li>
            <li> After using this hot air brush for 10 years, my hairdresser dropped it and it cracked.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what the Wife wanted.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I need it to do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Vidal Sassoon hot air brush for years and years.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what was wanted.</li>
            <li> It is compact and blows hot and fast!</li>
            <li> It would probably be better if it was the 3/4 inch size as my hair is so short, but it still works well.  </li>
            <li> I wore out my first one (that I purchased at a store) and couldn&#x27;t find another one</li>
            <li> THEY WERE EXACTLY WHAT</li>
            <li> This was exactly as described….easy</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> EXACTLY</li>
            <li> I had used this hot air type of curling iron for years.</li>
            <li> Love the way this styler works on my hair, but it overheats and won&#x27;t turn back on.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like my 1970&#x27;s hot comb, and this is it</li>
            <li> And it isn&#x27;t exactly tangle-free either.</li>
            <li> Overall ok</li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy this item locally.  </li>
            <li> it is exactly what i was looking for..</li>
            <li> I had a hot air brush similar to this for many years and it had quit working.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It seems rather flimsy and generates a funny smell when it is being used.</li>
            <li> Also, it over heats after 2 minutes of use and will not turn back on for 5-10 more minutes.</li>
            <li> The first one stopped working immediately after plugging it in and the motor got really hot and smelled like burning plastic.  </li>
            <li> It is okay, but my short hair needs to grow out, before I will know if it serves the purpose or not.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Vidal Sasson hot air brush - love it</li>
            <li> This item works better than others I have used, even of the same brand.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t reach hot setting after a month.</li>
            <li> the first use it never worked&lt;br</li>
            <li> Vidal Sasson VS433C Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer, 1 Inch]]</li>
            <li> This is the first one that tangles my hair EACH time I use it.  </li>
            <li> And the hot air brush is exactly like the one I had.  </li>
            <li> This blew up in my hand the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Purchased same product and love it.</li>
            <li> and I need to use a hair dryer first</li>
            <li> The first one lasted almost 5 years</li>
            <li> Its not expensive (i paid about $17)</li>
            <li> This is not a complicated brush - 2 settings only.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There were a couple times that it would get a little tangled but easy  to get out for the most part.</li>
            <li> The problem, if you have my kind of hair, is that the bristles are simply too far apart and the hair slides right off.</li>
            <li> I used some spray gel for a little more body because my hair is so fine</li>
            <li> This works and is the right size, but after wrapping my hair around the wand, the \\&quot;tangle free\\&quot; feature didn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li> , I keep it handy for special occasions when I&#x27;m willing to take extra time, but don&#x27;t bother with it at all for regular styling.course</li>
            <li> , I keep it handy for special occasions when I&#x27;m willing to take extra time, but don&#x27;t bother with it at all for regular styling.</li>
            <li> It honestly took me more time to use the Hot Air Brush than it normally does to simple blow dry and style.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s quick / easy to use if I need to \\&quot;freshen-up\\&quot; my &#x27;do after a long day or a night of sleeping on it.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what I expected it to do and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> You dry and style your hair all in one easy step!  </li>
            <li> I spritz a little soft hold hairspray, and my hair looks great all day</li>
            <li> Prior to this I had a conair hot brush (white handle with purple plastic barrel) that I used foryears and loved it...</li>
            <li> It just went from a normal motor sound to a high whine and died.  </li>
            <li> Finally found my faithful product on Amazon and was excited the day it arrived!  </li>
            <li> A great curling brush - unlike regular curling irons, the danger of getting burned is minimal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is ok and does good, but it is loud and it takes longer to get the hair dry than if one just blew it dry , but it saves time with the two steps in one, just use ear plugs.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better for medium to short hair but works very well.</li>
            <li> It has a softly rubberized barrel and widely-spaced &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; (more like soft tines)</li>
            <li> so smart choice not to make it too hot.</li>
            <li> medium thickness would have much success with this great little tool, it&#x27;s just not enough power.  </li>
            <li> I was able to free my hair after some time and patience, but it was not easy.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair to get most of the moisture out them finish up with the hot air brush to give me the style and volume.</li>
            <li> Make sure you dry your hair some first</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t know what to try, and then - I saw all the positive reviews about this product.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> That is the positive thing.  </li>
            <li> I have short fine hair and with the right styling product, this really gives my hair volume.</li>
            <li> I also find it very relaxing to just sit on the couch while I use this hot air brush to finish drying and smoothing my hair.</li>
            <li> Mostly I keep my hair long</li>
            <li> This Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer works very well.</li>
            <li> do--I have to replace it pretty much every year</li>
            <li> And is so much easier than hot curlers or the blow-dryer/roll brush combination</li>
            <li> dries my hair fast without getting too hot.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would have made it better would be the dual wattage switch that would give it more widely scattered use in US as well as in Europe.  </li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s so lightweight that at first I thought I just got a case with no insides, but it is really just lightweight.</li>
            <li> This one will do, but it wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice if there were real choices out there.</li>
            <li> have used Vidal Sasson in the past and the products always gave good results.  </li>
            <li> I get big, soft, pretty curls that make my hair super easy to style.</li>
            <li> When I am adept at using this tool I will have cut down on the time it takes me to style my hair each morning.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, my friend was able to cut the brush up into little pieces around the hair and save me from having to do that, but I still lost about two fists full of hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome little tool, as someone with a lot of hair, whatever can make the process simpler, I&#x27;m down for.</li>
            <li> It would take you an hour to dry your hair, so just use it more for smoothing your curls.</li>
            <li> but it sure helps to dry and style the hairs without entangling it.</li>
            <li> It claims to dry your hair but it would take so much more time than blow drying and curling or straightening your hair.</li>
            <li> Max Alderman&#x27;s wife-I use my hot air brush daily as my primary hair styling tool.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and it is quiet.  </li>
            <li> so mine takes awhile to dry which is why I may not be satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the second Vidal Sasson Tangle Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer I have owned.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a smaller size styler/dryer that I could easily pack for trips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and if used properly, doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair.  </li>
            <li> simple and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and so you would not be able to actually dry your hair this way.</li>
            <li> It is not so hot , even in the highest position  and for my type of thin hair it is great.</li>
            <li> It does not get as hot, so it doesn&#x27;t really seem to style my hair very well.</li>
            <li> hold  somewhere before retailing as I have had two now that had the same strong smell of  mildew in their air output when 1st using them.  </li>
            <li> it turns off in certain spots.</li>
            <li> that grip well and a large barrel.  </li>
            <li> It could work for certain hair type.</li>
            <li> It is a kind of cheap plastic tool and no powerful enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this type brush for several years; when my old one stopped working I was glad to find an exact replacement.</li>
            <li> So I open my new one and place an order for two more...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to dry sopping wet hair with this you&#x27;re not gonna be happy.</li>
            <li> Best results when used on towel dried slightly damp hair.</li>
            <li> It works great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> It works best if your hair is at least 50% dry.</li>
            <li> It gave my hair a soft natural wave and was easy to handle</li>
            <li> If you have long hair it can get tangled pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Not the fastest but better than my other hot air brush.</li>
            <li> Mine is short and fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing it would be fine if my hair was only shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at the advice of my sister but after receiving it, found that my hair was too fine and short to work.</li>
            <li> best thing for my hair using this brush is No static friz which other brushes cause on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would dry it eventually, but I don&#x27;t recommend this styler for that!</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this brush works fine.</li>
            <li> I love this, I&#x27;m not good at doing my hair but this hot air brush makes it easy.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone with short to medium length and fine to medium thickness hair.</li>
            <li> My original Vidal Sasson Hot Air Brush styler finally gave out after 10 years.  </li>
            <li> This is the only Air Brush that will work well with my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Died after using it twice, and I&#x27;ve only got fine, chin length hair.</li>
            <li> It gets hot enough to style hair quickly without being too hot to handle.</li>
            <li> Good for soft curling - unsure if tight curls could be achieved.</li>
            <li> I then use this little wonder to give my hair the nice body and style that I want.  </li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly hair, and you like the smoother looks, this hot air brush is for you!</li>
            <li> so I was on the hunt for another to puff up my short, straight, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I missed having one to use on my straight, fine, short hair.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle on fine hair, it packs well for travel, and you only need one appliance for styling.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hot air brush and styler.</li>
            <li> This works great with longer hair, mine was a little short</li>
            <li> Great to curl thin straight hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is straight but will get fuzzy sometimes with humidity.</li>
            <li> I am finding that it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I cannot find another styler/brush that I like as much as I like this one.  </li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s a 5 star product that I highly endorse!  </li>
            <li> I have used something like this before, but i really like this one.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and hope this problem can be resolved.</li>
            <li> the whole room with that odor.  </li>
            <li> So much so that when she replaced it she order two in order to have a backup.</li>
            <li> Thanks again Amazon for finding the unfindable.</li>
            <li> I really like this product although like others have said it does overheat</li>
            <li> I expected more from the Vidal Sassoon name.</li>
            <li> Three purchases were at a retail store and the last purchase was through Amazon, since it was no longer available at any store.  </li>
            <li> I hope that Vidal Sassoon makes this brush for ever - what a difference it makes on your mornings ready for work time.</li>
            <li> i do have to agree that they heat up way too fast and shut off.  </li>
            <li> so much I bought 2 this time.  </li>
            <li> so this airbrush dryer works really well.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> I find it really speeds up my hair routine.</li>
            <li> I would return it except the shipping would be almost as much as the item itself.  </li>
            <li> Really like this item.  </li>
            <li> you have to twist the whole thing</li>
            <li> and it didnt grab my hair very well.</li>
            <li> and I really like the way it works with my hair.  </li>
            <li> This makes styling my hair much easier and faster.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it as much as I thought I would</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> Very durable.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> very curly/wavy hair and this styler/drying has really helped control my hair.  </li>
            <li> ALTHOUGH IT HAS A RELEASE BUTTON ON IT, WHICH TO ME DOESN&#x27;T WORK VERY WELL</li>
            <li> The blowing heat really sets the style.  </li>
            <li> fast shipping,product was as stated, just what was ordered, my wife likes the 1 inch size</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Not having to hold up the brush and blow dryer has saved my so much effort.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> The lukewarm air blows doing absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> , it works, it&#x27;s gentle on my hair, and it&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li> I have been using one my air brush for a while now and really like it.</li>
            <li> it takes a lot of time to untangle, it hurts, and it ends up breaking way too much hair.  </li>
            <li> It did not add volume, I really was expecting more&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really have no opinion on this.  </li>
            <li> It really does not tangle.  </li>
            <li> I have straight hair that just hangs there.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions specifically and nothing was really happening.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, but it would have been nicer, if&lt;br /&gt;it had a couple of different size</li>
            <li> WORKS REALLY WELL.  </li>
            <li> I KEEP REPLACING THEM EVERY YEAR SINCE IT REALLY STRAIGHTENS AND SMOOTHS THE HAIR TO PERFECTION.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I really should buy another just in case</li>
            <li> Great for thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like this styling brush.</li>
            <li> I works so fast</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> She really likes this style of brush and dryer in one.</li>
            <li> and i really wish I had saved my money and not buy this dryer brush.</li>
            <li> I really, really did try.  </li>
            <li> better than I expected.....</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> They were very helpful and sent me another brush which also doesn&#x27;t rotate.  </li>
            <li> I can be ready to go in 10-15 min.</li>
            <li> it DOES have that twisting/untwisting cord tip, but it doesn&#x27;t work very well for me.  </li>
            <li> This model was no longer available locally.</li>
            <li> Then I take the Styler and brush it through my hair, gently making curls at the ends.</li>
            <li> Two much for a travel device</li>
            <li> It is lite weight and heats up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like spending much (if any) time on my hair</li>
            <li> I use it for curly styles and straight styles.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> (the buttons are very close to one another), although I didn&#x27;t see that that release button was very helpful anyway.  </li>
            <li> A real improvement.</li>
            <li> Also, the price is reasonable for what you get and lasts beyond what you would expect.</li>
            <li> The heat was very damaging to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I like it so much that I am ordering a back-up brush in the event that this one dies on me.</li>
            <li> solo much</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Its gentle on the hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my life so much simpler, no curling iron, no straightening implements, etc.</li>
            <li> The cord is too short to use comfortably in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Not so much.  </li>
            <li> so much faster styling time</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for always having what I need.</li>
            <li> It is cheap plastic and does not unwind properly.</li>
            <li> Bought this because of all the rave reviews of how fast you can get your hair styled.</li>
            <li> so much found another one two replace it.</li>
            <li> It really depends on ur hair type..</li>
            <li> I kept waiting for the top layer to make its Bozo fluff, but it never happened.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really blow that much air and just didn&#x27;t work for me..</li>
            <li> Where was this item in the 60&#x27;s when I really could have used it instead of rollers?</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> does not spin and gives a very frizzy curl.</li>
            <li> I really like it -</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for a few years and liked it so much that when it started to make some noises</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be careful with this though because if you use too much hair it might get caught in the top part of the brush and get tangled.</li>
            <li> Looked everywhere locally after my old one of five years broke after being dropped on its head too many times.</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked about this order was that it only took a day to get here!</li>
            <li> If I turn the thing on and let it sit for a bit the air does warm up some, but I have to use an outlet in a  different room since both this and my blow dryer can&#x27;t use the same outlet without blowing a fuse.  </li>
            <li> Works well, glad I was able to replace a broken one.</li>
            <li> Like that one a lot more.. Doesn&#x27;t have a loud blower like this and this one only lasted me about a month.</li>
            <li> Love this Curling Brush, Hard to find curling brush with hot air!!  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning and was extremely pleased with how easily it was handled, and how well it dried with only 1 arm.  </li>
            <li> Cannot live without this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it especially for us of the fine hair variety.</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair stick straight which is fine as long as it straightens it</li>
            <li> Have used this styling brush for years and love it, but wasn&#x27;t able to find it at a local store where I usually purchase it.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love the product.</li>
            <li> The 1 1/2 inch barrel styler is available, but gives me a flat result.  </li>
            <li> The brush is much better, then other brands.</li>
            <li> Her original lasted about ten years, so hoping this one will also.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 or 4 different styles trying to find something to replace my original, but was not satisified with any of them.</li>
            <li> Although I have combo fine brown hair and coarse white hair, this dryer does its work quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have had many of these in the past, and the most recent one I purchased had poorer quality.</li>
            <li> This type of styler works better than any other for me.  </li>
            <li> This dryer feels really cheap, like there&#x27;s hardly anything going on in the handle (on the positive side, it makes this really light), but it doesn&#x27;t put out a lot of air or heat.</li>
            <li> I tried another hot air brush with higher wattage and could barely get my hand around the handle.  </li>
            <li> Just use the higher setting on this one and spend a few more minutes</li>
            <li> Only criticism is that if you don&#x27;t clean out the air intake area(at</li>
            <li> &quot; Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer features a 1\\&quot; barrel and soft, tangle-free bristles that gently grip and hold to enhance body and volume.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Vidal Sasson hot air brush styler to anyone who wants to add soft curls to their hair without the worry of burning your fingers.  </li>
            <li> Best when used to style almost dry hair dried with a regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li> THINK MEN MAKE THOSE OTHER HOT AIR BRUSHES, they dont know what there doing!!!</li>
            <li> my hairdresser uses her blowdryer on cool setting to cool it down faster and it works.  </li>
            <li> I took a 2 inch section of hair and pulled down straight - worked ok</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for people like me who have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> The item is high quality and works very well.</li>
            <li> I like it very much for my naturally curly hair  </li>
            <li> I had one previously and love it so much</li>
            <li> Chose this one since I had had such good experience with the previous one.</li>
            <li> I really love this, better than all the titanium, ceramic , ionic other stuff that cost so much and do so little.</li>
            <li> I have fine dry hair</li>
            <li> I ordered this one because the other one I have started to sound funny after 2 years.  </li>
            <li> My old vidal sasoon hot air brush overheated and the connecting parts of the brush melted off.</li>
            <li> It blows hot air while giving a soft curl,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So tonight I&#x27;m ordering the $33 Conair Curling Brush 1.5&amp;#34; Hot Air Dual Voltage from Amazon hoping it&#x27;s a newer model of my old one that died.  </li>
            <li> That requires you to unplug it and let it cool off for several minutes.  </li>
            <li> It may be my luck, but I am returning this second one for a full refund and will NEVER try buying this model again.</li>
            <li> The bristles stay cool enough.  </li>
            <li> This iron allows me to give my hair enough &amp;#34;flip&amp;#34; to it that it gives the appears of being longer and full of body.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this one because it exactly like my old one.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find another blow brush that has these solid plastic bristles that don&#x27;t make my hair full of static.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  </li>
            <li> The product is a good one, but now no good to me.&lt;br /&gt;Anita Redmond</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying hot air brushes for nearly 25 years and for the price, this one cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> The first was about 10 years old when it broke.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quick and easy way to dry my hair and style it at the same time.  </li>
            <li> The curler didn&#x27;t get quite hot enough so was very disiappointed, it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> More money down the drain.</li>
            <li> This product needs a hotter setting and a higher speed to adequately style and dry the hair.</li>
            <li> This low powered VS Hot Air Brush Styler/Curler takes me more than an hour to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> but I live in fear that Vidal Sasson will stop making it!</li>
            <li> I wish I tried this before I purchased a new one!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I found right away that the air that blows out of the wand to encourage drying and curling is barely warm and quite weak.  </li>
            <li> This one is very reasonable in price, and works exactly the same...</li>
            <li> NOT tangle free, my hair gets catch up in it and hard to get free.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hot air brush dryer after seeing the commercial for the much more expensive high end kind.</li>
            <li> so uses much less electricity to get the job done than most blow dryers that are 1200watts or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you use the hot air brush, it works fine for 5 minutes, it suddenly stops, then will not turn back on.</li>
            <li> I USE IT MAINLY</li>
            <li> 2nd review - more than a year later!</li>
            <li> This particular model has lasted me the longest.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for a spare as I have had my other one just like it for several years and love it!</li>
            <li> I love this styler/dryer but it doesn&#x27;t hold up to daily use like regular hairdryers</li>
            <li> My only problem is that they don&#x27;t last more than about 4 months if you use it every day.  </li>
            <li> hair dries quickly and this wand helps curl it on the low setting as the insert suggested</li>
            <li> This air brush is hard to find , so glad I could find it , this helps take the frizz out of my hair !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a similar product from a different company for many years without ever getting it caught in my hair.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I have against it is that it doesn&#x27;t last me more than about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise it is a decent styling tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This hot air brush is exactly what I needed for my short curly hair.</li>
            <li> But, I like them better than some of the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> When it quit working I could not purchase this particular one in any stores.</li>
            <li> AS I HAVE USED THIS PARTICULAR</li>
            <li> I purchased this one because it seemed to have the same brush which i love and for the price i figured if it didnt work out -- no big loss.</li>
            <li> She has short thick hair and says it is great for styling.</li>
            <li> Have been using this particular brand for years, I always have a spare for backup.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length thin soft curly hair and thought this would be a great product for me.</li>
            <li> says works better than way more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I have never used any kind of curling irons or brushes, so this is a whole new experience for me.&lt;br /&gt;For not knowing what I am doing, my first attempt at styling my hair did not turn out too bad, except over the top of my head</li>
            <li> I do the crown for a bit of lift there as well and it makes the back hang very prettily.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this gets it pretty straight for the most part.</li>
            <li> Curling irons probably are more efficient, but if you&#x27;re clumsy like me, this is the right tool.</li>
            <li> I have had a previous version of this styler with a 1.5&amp;#34; brush and absolutely loved it as it had a long cord.</li>
            <li> I love the product, not wanting the tight curl of a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recomend this.</li>
            <li> After reading the buyer reviews and noticing the high ratings on this product, I decided to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> This time it started, but just emitted the high whine and then again quit  immediately.  </li>
            <li> But if you need or like high heat in your styler/dryer this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this drying/styling brush.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would work better with little longer hair.</li>
            <li> On the other hot air brushes you cant even get your hair in some of these hot air brushes to do what u want to do on some hot air brushes...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay a little more and get both brushes again.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 the last time so that when the first one breaks, I won&#x27;t have to worry that I will be without one!</li>
            <li> I use this and it helps a little, but there seem to be as many disadvantages as advantages.  </li>
            <li> * UPDATE****I have been using this brush daily for over 2 1/2 years &amp; it has not failed me yet!  </li>
            <li> so it is ok for a little girl to play with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since my hair is fairly fine, it doesn&#x27;t take me a long time to complete the job.  </li>
            <li> hot air brush is not meant to be the only tool used to completely dry a full head of soaking wet hair; it&#x27;s much better suited for finishing.</li>
            <li> barrel is too large &amp; it isnt hot enough.</li>
            <li> This product is all plastic (gentler on my hair) and, if it&#x27;s as good as the last one like this that I owned, it will last a very long time!  </li>
            <li> I have to blow dry my hair with my original drier then styling with this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not have high expectations for this product, but when I used it I was pleasantly surprised at how much it lifted and refreshed my hair.</li>
            <li> Burns out in a few months if you use the &#x27;high&#x27; button, but I still love this curler.</li>
            <li> Love this hard to find hot air styler.</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair which is fine yet slightly wavy.  </li>
            <li> me, it takes the place of what professional hair stylists do -- i.e., use a real brush/hand held dryer to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan on ordeing a few more to keep in my gym bag and travel bag.  </li>
            <li> Long hair may get tangled up, so it&#x27;s better for short to medium length hair.</li>
            <li> So much that I bought one to leave at my yearly travel destination and a spare at home for the day my first finally gives out.</li>
            <li> It never worked again, and it wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much simpler and lighter to use this hot air brush than to use a brush and a dryer, although it doesn&#x27;t deliver the same result.</li>
            <li> I love this product and received it within a few days</li>
            <li> Unless you have very short, very wispy hair, this hot air brush isn&#x27;t going to do anything for you.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy another normal one.</li>
            <li> These last about 5 years, but at the price it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> However, the brush doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to provide much curl.  </li>
            <li> It somewhat blow dried our hair after sitting there for more than a hour.  </li>
            <li> It barely gets hot, and maybe it&#x27;s me, but the &amp;#34;styling&amp;#34; part of this styling tool eludes me.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years now and it is one of the few that works well for my type hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is relatively short (3-4&amp;#34;), but this size styler works really well.  </li>
            <li> Having at the same time the curler and the dryer is one of the best ideas because you don&#x27;t get tired holding the dryer and the brush at the same time.</li>
            <li> , they only seem to work for a couple of years before they need to be replaced, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick with waves and a mind of it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> If you want a little body after your hair is almost dry then this would be a good tool.  </li>
            <li> My old Sassoon was SO old it started melting and left black flecks in my hair, but I got a good twenty years out of it, so no complaints here.</li>
            <li> It was not hard to decide 1 day shipping at quite a cost.</li>
            <li> And, no it is not a breaker because other items electrical items will work just fine.</li>
            <li> I love this product but they dont last very long before they burn up.  </li>
            <li> It says \\&quot;rotating\\&quot; right on the package, but the only way it would \\&quot;rotate\\&quot; is by manually turning it around and around.  </li>
            <li> They are just right for my short permed hair.</li>
            <li> Went right to the same model for the replacement.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; my hair (unless your hair is very short), but right after I blowdry it to add some curl.  </li>
            <li> My wife had a previous unit that lasted &gt;10 years before becoming inoperable.</li>
            <li> It styles my hair quickly and my curls hold for a long time.</li>
            <li> my super long hair gets tangled in the brissles</li>
            <li> When I let it air dry, I just don&#x27;t get the full curls as I do with this unit.</li>
            <li> Because it isn&#x27;t super curly or thick, my hair just kind of goes &amp;#34;blah&amp;#34; after I blow it dry.</li>
            <li> The last one I had worked fine on short hair</li>
            <li> I need to buy a new styler.</li>
            <li> After a while it wears out and I need a new one.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> And when this new one wears out, will get me another one..</li>
            <li> I need to or a new  one once in a while.</li>
            <li> I have already had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I immediately went and shopped for a new one, specifically VS.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, and another brand, as a result of a new hair style.  </li>
            <li> She wanted a new one and couldn&#x27;t find one in a retail store.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with out it.</li>
            <li> I  thought, &amp;#34; I can&#x27;t live without this tool for my hair</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mind buying a new one.  </li>
            <li> Paid for shipping both ways and had a new one in a week.  </li>
            <li> but thought it time for a new one.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> since I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> I order a new one after it quits working.</li>
            <li> When the one I had started wearing out I ordered a new one from Amazon and received it yesterday.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and always return to it after trying something new on the market.</li>
            <li> I needed a new one and ordered this.  </li>
            <li> It went to the heaven closet where all the products I don&amp;#34;t like live.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been working on getting use to this new</li>
            <li> This is just what my brand new pixie cut needed to get that bit of oomph on the crown.  </li>
            <li> Still works but the new one will take over now.</li>
            <li> and I needed a new one.</li>
            <li> The one I had and this new one are both 1 inch in size.</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cant live without it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live w/o this hair styler.</li>
            <li> local stores carry only the HUGE items&lt;br /&gt;lightweight</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle, lightweight, and my hair (slightly longer than chin-length) has never tangled in it.  </li>
            <li> This will dry your hair quickly and allow you some styling ability.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly, so I use this after using the blow dryer with the round brush to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll get the same result -- worth it as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to wait on the whole process when I&#x27;m getting ready for work, so the last time I bought two to have a spare when that happens.  </li>
            <li> Can dry and style quickly  </li>
            <li> i quick dry just out of shower hair then finish drying hair and style also with this brush styler/ dryer-</li>
            <li> Quick hair drying that adds volume as you dry.  </li>
            <li> Others might last longer don&#x27;t know but ones I have paid more for have a harder brush and the ones with metal shafts</li>
            <li> long, pretty straight</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own after a few minutes and does not want to switch back on for another 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on fancy products, oils and the ever popular \\&quot;what-not\\&quot; only to end up with soft, nice smelling, frizzy, thin</li>
            <li> Quick dry and style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine now since it cooled down.  </li>
            <li> Another problem is that the untangle button is very near the on and off button</li>
            <li> Very professional results.</li>
            <li> Very loud, did not curl hair..</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the smell that was there in the first order over a year ago is present in  my brand new brushes.  </li>
            <li> I had my hair cut shorter than usual and thought this item would be good to dry and curl my hair under.</li>
            <li> Okay, it has a smell like mildew, but I can get past that.</li>
            <li> This is the only hot air brush that works on my baby-fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact model I had and the only one I would buy.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it gets hot and shuts off.  </li>
            <li> I have used this hot brush for years, replacing it when necessary.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this Hot Air Brush (this is my third one) years.</li>
            <li> so I had to use a regular heating iron or one with brush(not hot air).</li>
            <li> This is my second hot air brush.</li>
            <li> After several years the first one gave out.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush left my hair frizzy.  </li>
            <li> instant heat and not too hot...</li>
            <li> I used this exact product for years, until it recently broke (after using for over 10 years).  </li>
            <li> Not one of the local stores carried this type of hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and have bought a few of them in case they are ever discontinued!</li>
            <li> I found the prior model of this hot air brush almost a decade ago and have been using them ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> mM hair is pretty short.  </li>
            <li> I have used this style of hot air brush for several years, but then I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.  </li>
            <li> This air brush was a replacement for my worn out brush,but it didn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> It has a mind of its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only become aware of the hot air brush recently and did my research on you tube</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and dreaded the death of my current hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> This is my second bought it just in case my first burns out &amp; it was on sale too</li>
            <li> This hot air brush is essential to me!  </li>
            <li> Works much better that several other Name Brand ones</li>
            <li> My hot air brush died and none of the big box stores had the one I wanted!  </li>
            <li> I feel I can go to work looking professional once again!</li>
            <li> The Vidal Sassoon Hot Air Brush Styler/Curler 1 1/2\\&quot; has been my only functional source of hair styling since the &#x27;90s.     </li>
            <li> Thus, my search on Amazon to find the hot version of the only tool that works with body, my hair, and my patience level.</li>
            <li> After 6 months when it gets too hot shuts off and won&#x27;t turn back on till it has cooled off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hot air brush for years; it&#x27;s an essential tool for me.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and the hot air brush styler</li>
            <li> AMAZON is the only place I can find this HOT AIR BRUSH.</li>
            <li> This is my third one over the last ten years, love it</li>
            <li> .. it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my liking and I also would prefer if the barrel was metal or ceramic to retain the heat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hot air brushes daily for years.</li>
            <li> (it blows the same way you blow you hot coffee to get colder</li>
            <li> so I was already aware of it&#x27;s capabilities and wanted another like it but couldn&#x27;t find it at a local store.</li>
            <li> Just like using big curlers, but much faster!</li>
            <li> I have used this hot air brush for several years now.  </li>
            <li> Also good for those of us too uncoordinated to have a blow dryer in one hand and the round brush in the other.</li>
            <li> It does not entangle my fine hair, but the curls come up quite lose, and do not last long.</li>
            <li> I purchased a different brush and had to go back to this as you can remove the brush and clean the hair product gook out.</li>
            <li> I do need to say I use it everyday and within about 12 to 18 months it just dies.. but not bad for the money!</li>
            <li> I have a torn rotator cuff and cannot hold my arm high enough to hold a regular iron long enough to make a nice curl.  </li>
            <li> My old brush fits my new styler so now I can use both sizes.  </li>
            <li> I bought new this one when my old destroyed.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy the same item as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> I had previously had the same product approx 10 yrs and \\&quot;thanks\\&quot; to&lt;br /&gt;Amazon I was able to purchase the exact same hot-air/style brush.  </li>
            <li> Have an old Vidal sassoon hot air brush and finally it stopped working and replaced it with another...great product</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this appliance allows me to have a fuller head of hair with little effort.</li>
            <li> Particularly useful if limited hair styling skills like me.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the positive reviews and the price, but you definitely get what you pay for in this case.</li>
            <li> I have used the exact same Hot Air Brush Styler for a long time and bought this one as a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Have short hair and this hot air brush really doesn&#x27;t work for short hair.</li>
            <li> They actually last pretty well, especially considering the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> but i do not use on long hair only shoulder length or short love it</li>
            <li> I have purchased several of these brushes in the past and they give a nice natural wave to my hair.  </li>
            <li> It all depends on how much it pulls my hair over the next couple of days it takes for the new one to arrive.</li>
            <li> I buy a new one every year, but lately haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> It is tangle free, can dry &amp; style at the same time and do \\&quot;not\\</li>
            <li> This styler dryer does a decent job of taming the frizz, which is my main objective.</li>
            <li> This is such a time-saver, being able to dry and curl hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> but it was too large for short hair.  </li>
            <li> A little cheaply made,  but works well.</li>
            <li> Keep both intake areas clean and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long, very straight hair and purchased this as an alternative to a curling iron to curl the ends of my hair under.</li>
            <li> I tried mostly drying my hair with the regular dryer then using this but still little luck.</li>
            <li> this item is hard to find love it</li>
            <li> OK product, hard to get it to grip hair</li>
            <li> so I went ahead and bought two new ones so they would be available when the other ones finally go out.</li>
            <li> If you have extremely thin/delicate hair, you may be able to completely dry your hair with it</li>
            <li> You will have to be careful to keep the lint filter free of buildup or it will stop working if it gets too hot--but it will run on high heat for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t make clear the elctric power before I order it.</li>
            <li> This low heat ensures my hair is very shiny and soft when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> Yes, as a previous custmer mentiioned, clean out the vent every couple of months.</li>
            <li> My hair wants to curl naturally, but at the same time it tends to be frizzy.</li>
            <li> But it is clearly junk.</li>
            <li> But again - for the price amazon offers -no complaints.</li>
            <li> Looks and performs like the old one.</li>
            <li> If my hair dries to much, i just brush through it briefly with a damp brush and then style.  </li>
            <li> It really should last longer than this!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I will do if they discontinue it completely.  </li>
            <li> But the big plus is that it&#x27;s very lightweight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had long hair for many years and finally decided to cut it all off into a long bob.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking all over to replace my old one that stopped working.  </li>
            <li> My old Conair went out and I couldn&#x27;t find another one</li>
            <li> Now she has a spare, as the problem with the old one was clogged vent slots.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t every\ die, it just gets old and used.</li>
            <li> I ordered two so that I would have the next one ready to go.</li>
            <li> My hair fluffs up and the wave becomes a loverly soft curl.</li>
            <li> The rubbery bristles and wand are gentle on my hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;No burned fingers wrapping my short hair around it.</li>
            <li> Is Vidal still alive?  </li>
            <li> Boy was I surprised.  </li>
            <li> I took it straight back to the store.</li>
            <li> My hair is rather coarse and is a mix of curly and straight with lots of cowlicks.  </li>
            <li> If I could I&#x27;d post a before-and-after picture here to show the marked difference</li>
            <li> This is the only curling iron you really need.</li>
            <li> The brush part is soft plastic and doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp when I use it.</li>
            <li> The absolute only frown face about the product</li>
            <li> If you are a child I would use this but not on an adult.</li>
            <li> I purchased a curling iron years ago and it being so old the name had worn off.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s old one quit working and bought these as replacements.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a soft brush styler/dryer</li>
            <li> and i really didn&#x27;t think it would be much different.  </li>
            <li> I have short and straight hair.</li>
            <li> I love this unit and have been using one like it for at least 20 years.</li>
            <li> I had an old brush that was 15 yrs old when it quit working.  </li>
            <li> It makes soft curls, which is what I want fr this brush.  </li>
            <li> Now my old one just &amp;#34; couldn&#x27;t take it anymore&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My old model died of old age..</li>
            <li> replaced an old one just like it.  </li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair</li>
            <li> A natural look.</li>
            <li> They burn my hair and sizzle anytime I get near my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dryer still works but not the spin action.</li>
            <li> I have hair that hangs 4-5 inches below my shoulders and this curls and dries my hair for a soft curl look.  </li>
            <li> Not enough heat to really curl the ends of your hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back when I&#x27;ve accomplished getting to my goal</li>
            <li> The description for this product is completely misleading.  </li>
            <li> I now have soft hair that has ringlets at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD A VIDAL SASSON HOT AIR CURLING BRUSH FOR AS LONG</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for the vast variety of products you offer!</li>
            <li> First one of these I ever used, wish I could have found it long ago.</li>
            <li> (its already old and used by 5~6 Young Ladies).</li>
            <li> old.</li>
            <li> Drys and soft curls.</li>
            <li> I guess there is a reason why it was so much cheaper than similar products.</li>
            <li> and I learned that a 1&amp;#34; brush is really too big.  </li>
            <li> I do plan to order another one just like it but a smaller size since I now wear my hair much shorter.</li>
            <li> Now I can style it just like a professional would.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like it because it gives you soft looking</li>
            <li> curls- not the really defined ones that you get with a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> I prefer the thicker plastic bristles to the natural boar bristles because they don&#x27;t get tangled in my hair.  </li>
            <li> OK, not thrilled with it</li>
            <li> Smoothes while enhancing natural waves.</li>
            <li> I think this would actually take much longer.</li>
            <li> I have natural curls on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was using it one morning and heard a loud click and the brush no longer worked.  </li>
            <li> Since the brush doesn&#x27;t have much power to begin with, I&#x27;ve never tried the low</li>
            <li> It is more expensive, a bit over $50, but worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Result is a good, casual hair style.</li>
            <li> It helps give my fine hair a lift and helps take away the frizzy mess that I often get!</li>
            <li> Basically, Every morning since I was 15 years old I plugged in the curlers, waited for them to heat up, set and wait for it to cool down.</li>
            <li> The brush has very little blow power/force, thus making the styler only good for setting a curl, not drying a curl in place (unless you have hours to dry your hair);&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> it turns off after 1 minuet of use and has to cool down before it will turn on again.</li>
            <li> I can only use on the longer back part right now.</li>
            <li> Last time, I ordered 3 of them at once and 1 of them had a short in it right off the bat.  </li>
            <li> I have used Vidal Sassoon hot brushes for over 10 years, and hope they are around for a long time!</li>
            <li> (all I want) and semi dries it if I towel dry first and let it rest awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li> I have to blow dry my hair with a blow dryer and brush first</li>
            <li> I blow dry first then use it.  </li>
            <li> then  blow the rest dry with Sasson hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> Quick dry as i have short hair</li>
            <li> No tangles, no mess.</li>
            <li> You take small sections and go over each piece a few times twisting and turning the brush if you want long beautiful waves.</li>
            <li> My old one was beginning to slow down, so I thought it wise to have another one on hand.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because my hair is now very short and my other hot air brush is too large to use.  </li>
            <li> I like this hot air brush enough that I keep an extra one on hand.</li>
            <li> Later I found the exact same item for $10.99 at Wal-Mart store.</li>
            <li> I had a Conair hot air brush that finally quit working after several years</li>
            <li> Not good quality, and I probably need a larger roll, the brush was kind of flimsy and it would get tangled with my hair.</li>
            <li> but I suspect you are not going to get decent curls out of this because of the low heat.</li>
            <li> I have tried similar Vidal Sassoon stylers in the past that worked better than this one on my shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one with decent reviews for a low price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Does not cause the same heat damage that regular curling irons do because it creates curls with hot air.</li>
            <li> Also like because the hot air barrell is smaller for short hair, and I like the plastic comb instead of bristles.</li>
            <li> Best purchase ever it does exactly what i want and has never shut down!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use a regular blow dryer to do the main drying after I wash my hair, then use this brush/dryer to finish.</li>
            <li> I have fine, medium-short hair that wants to curl always in the opposite direction of what I want, and lots of cowlicks that make it really hard to style.</li>
            <li> AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT THE HIGH HEAT OF A CURLING IRON.</li>
            <li> It gets stuck constantly in my (long, straight) hair, creates static (seriously), and has crappy drying power.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it after my hairdresser recommended a new way of drying my hair that entailed me needing two extra arms to complete.  </li>
            <li> Takes only a little while and my hair looks better than it has in several years.</li>
            <li> and if I briefly towel dry and then let my hair air dry for a bit, it only takes about 20 minutes more to complete the job.  </li>
            <li> My short, straight, grey hair needed a &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;, so I had high hopes for this brush.  </li>
            <li> Was unable to find it locally, so very glad Amazon still carries this one.</li>
            <li> Old one apparently gave out and couldn&#x27;t find a replacement in stores.  </li>
            <li> This styling brush is a bit underpowered, but the far bigger problem is that the bristles are so far apart from one another hair just falls off of it!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve used a hot air brush - much harder to use than I remembered, tangles a lot and takes forever.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I expected of it.  </li>
            <li> The heat on the hot side is just minimal</li>
            <li> I have bought so many much more expensive styling tools that I took back in a hurry due to the fact that they did not work.</li>
            <li> On my first try, I got so tangled that I spent 2.5 hours ripping hair out of the brush and still had to cut the thing out.</li>
            <li> Great tool for those of us too clumsy to hold a brush in one hand and a hairdryer in the other and point them in the same place at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;But can overheat if you wrap your hair in it instead of keeping it moving.</li>
            <li> They were either too large, too small, or did not have hot air.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> This is light enough to keep at work for those times when your hair needs a little help.  </li>
            <li> I normally air dry my hair and only use the brush dryer on my bangs, so it doesn&#x27;t have to do much.  </li>
            <li> If hair does get tangled on brush you simply turn off the brush which immediately cools down and then just simply push the release button and your hair can easily be removed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this was a great buy for anyone with thick or hard to manage hair.  </li>
            <li> I of course have to use a transformer adapter to use it in New Zealand as the above Conair products but the Air Brush is spasmodic in its output and becomes noisy and turns off.  </li>
            <li> Tried this one and it was doing a great job but must have had a short somewhere because it kept cutting in and out while I was using it.</li>
            <li> completely dry straight out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> It took much longer for my hair to dry</li>
            <li> hair is very curly, and I used to just let it dry.</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive enough that if you don&#x27;t like it or don&#x27;t use it daily, you are not out much money.</li>
            <li> Its very lightweight and so much easier to maneuver than a heavy blow dryer and brush.  </li>
            <li> The soft rubber bristles give me Soft curls that last all day.</li>
            <li> It will not deafen you as others I have tried, which the flipside of that is that it is not super powerful.  </li>
            <li> I can get to last at least a couple of years or more.  </li>
            <li> This one I&#x27;ve had for a few years, but is starting to sound like it&#x27;s going to die, so ordered another one.  </li>
            <li> I have used this very same brand hot air brush for years (in fact I&#x27;ve had it for so long</li>
            <li> Before I used this, people were telling me I should probably just cut my hair short again, and since I started using this, those same people are saying how much they like how my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I do turn the brush on a few minutes before I plan to use it since it takes a few minutes to warm up.</li>
            <li> Dried my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Others I tried had a very large handle which was uncomfortable in my hand or had so much power that my hair would blow all over the place and the style would blow right out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only got 45 seconds to get my hair done (unless I want to wait another 10 minutes for it to cool down.)</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for the ones you find in the stores right now with the hard bristle brush attachments.</li>
            <li> I always use the high fan speed because I have super thick hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just really fine and hard to wrap around the wand...</li>
            <li> this one is ok but weak.</li>
            <li> have baby fine hair, and it is hard to get any sort of curl or body into it without a perm.  </li>
            <li> My other hot air brush had 1100 watts of power &amp; it caused my hair to frizz.  </li>
            <li> (No other company makes one like this that I can find.)  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to dry your hair with it, because the heat is pretty low.</li>
            <li> When i used it for the first time the look was like as if i got a salon dry and looked similar to what my haircut was 3 months ago when i had one.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about a month and the first time I used it my hair got tangled and there was not enough air coming out of it to dry my hair,,</li>
            <li> Giving it only one star, because after only a few uses, it made a loud popping sound &amp; quit working.</li>
            <li> right where the brush attaches it broke in half.</li>
            <li> Good for thin hair ,and up to chin length.can dry and style at the same time.</li>
            <li> I can recommend this one only to somebody who is willing to buy a new one every half year.</li>
            <li> This product works fine, my only complaint is that this product was shown when I searched for a revolving dryer/styler, 1&amp;#34; diameter, soft bristols.</li>
            <li> I am going to give it to my little 7 years old niece who is interested to style her hair to play with it as a toy.</li>
            <li> There are only 2 settings - high &amp; low.  </li>
            <li> With irons I would always have the occasional ouch when my hand went where it shouldn&#x27;t have gone, I&#x27;m really not good with most styling</li>
            <li> Small enough to fit into a suitcase for travel.  </li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, to replace an old one that died... same model, etc.  </li>
            <li> This Hot Air Brush is not worth buying.</li>
            <li> It dries and soft curls at the same time.</li>
            <li> I had this product for several years when it tried to die, but my husband fixed it w/duct tape.  </li>
            <li> This tangles in my hair if I am not careful.  </li>
            <li> Went back to using my old one even though it is heavier.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and the curls didn&#x27;t last two hours.  </li>
            <li> It dries your hair and adds soft curls (that hold) at the same time.</li>
            <li> I recently broke my old VS \\&quot;blowbrush\\&quot; by dropping it on my cermamic bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely dependent on them and keep an extra supply at all times.</li>
            <li> is the power button is located directly below the brush release button, so inevitably I am turning off my device when attempting to release the curl.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m back to my old blow dryer and electric rollers.</li>
            <li> Well it barely blows air, does not heat like a curling iron or at all for that matter, tangled up in my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> I finally bought one at Walmart, the Infiniti Conair with soft bristle brush that also rotates as you curl.</li>
            <li> : The low wattage means it takes quite some time to get your hair completely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one for years, same brand, and I knew mine was going to stop working soon because it was about 35 years old.</li>
            <li> Got this for my sister, her old one finally gave out.  </li>
            <li> was really fooled big time, ill threw this away because it will cost me more to return it to the shipper.</li>
            <li> I hope this brush is not discontinued in the near future, for me, its all I need.</li>
            <li> is the only way to get a soft lift to my hair.  </li>
            <li> You can unlock the brush to release curls made in a fixed poition, which is not the same thing as rotation.</li>
            <li> I had used the 3/4\\&quot;, but could not find in stores; apparently the 3/4\\&quot; size is not made by Sassoon any longer, but I got the 1\\&quot; at Amazon</li>
            <li> Went back to professional products.</li>
            <li> My curls are soft and they last.</li>
            <li> but apparently they all are.</li>
            <li> I have only used this once so far.  </li>
            <li> I am going to send it back but have been too busy to do yet.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do any styling, just barely leaves a wave.  </li>
            <li> Barely warms up either .</li>
            <li> Barely any air comes out.  </li>
            <li> With this hot air brush I expected I could actually shorten the process and assure a smoother look.  </li>
            <li> Really nice and just like the expensive one.</li>
            <li> The secret to this one is no metal touching my hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re growing your hair out like I am, this tool is definitely a good one to help with those awkward in-between stages.</li>
            <li> I have very wavy hair that is getting worse with age, and this works very well to smooth it and get it to lay down.  </li>
            <li> I get it almost dry with a blow dryer then finish with this to smooth the frizz a little.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who has very fine blond hair quite thin for a woman only in her 60s</li>
            <li> I use this daily on my shorter, very fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li> ONLY buy if you have very fine thin hair</li>
            <li> and I use it probably more due to the handle size being a little smaller.</li>
            <li> started with complete bed head and dampened my hair then followed the directions to dry two inch sections of it at a time from underneath, then in the opposite direction occasionally since I wanted it straight, not curled.  </li>
            <li> The heat comes quickly and the rubber bristles are soft enough but firm enough.</li>
            <li> Sucking lint out with a vacuum cleaner fixed it.</li>
            <li> I have had several of these and am trying to extend the life of the current one by drying my hair first with a blow dryer and just using the styler when the hair is nearly dry.</li>
            <li> My wife tried several different types of  Hot Air Brushes, and all seem to have characteristic that did not meet her expectation.</li>
            <li> really like the way this allows me to dry and style my hair at the same time</li>
            <li> I use it to partially dry my hair, then I stick in the same diameter Velcro rollers and by the time I&#x27;ve finished my make- up, my hair is ready to style.</li>
            <li> it easily gets hot...which is not good for the hair.</li>
            <li> It died in less than three minutes the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought three other brands of similar dryers over the years when I couldn&#x27;t find this one, and they were all way too hot, even when used on the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li> I have thick straight hair and this brush dryer did not have the blowing power to dry my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> The Sassoon one dries gently enough on high setting, but you can still change to low as you finish up, or refresh the next day.  </li>
            <li> She was so happy as her old one she was still using was very dangerous as it was taped up and falling apart.  </li>
            <li> My hair is coarse and hard to curl, but the hot air brush really does the trick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually I allow my hair to air dry until it&#x27;s just damp and then finish it with the hot air brush, but in a hurry, I blow it nearly dry and then use the brush.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS THE ONLY STYLER THAT WORKED ON MY FINE, THICK HAIR.</li>
            <li> My hair slides through the other bristle types leaving my hair straight and fly-away.   </li>
            <li> I take very god care of my hair and this is extremely damaging.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavey hair, this is easy to use, it smooths out my hair , ive tryed alot of stuff, But flat irons dont do like this</li>
            <li> Do blow dry to damp, then style....and shipping a new one was a 2 day process.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li> My hair is not thick or long and I have only been using it for about 4 months.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really save me any time, as my hair is just below bra-strap length and quite thick, but by combining the brush with the dryer, it is easier to smooth the hair and is also less work.  </li>
            <li> I have found others in stores that are much more expensive and don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using it now for about 2 weeks and though better than the Conair, it still SUCKS unless I curl my hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> Creates big, soft curls that look like they took you all morning to do, but really only take minutes from beginning to end.</li>
            <li> I have permed short hair and I mainly use it to straighten out the some of the curl and to dry my hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One can create soft curls or waves by wrapping strands and holding for a few seconds, or create straight styles by brushing through from underneath.  </li>
            <li> After several years of daily use my old brush quit working.</li>
            <li> I bought this styler to replace a ten year old one that had finally started to wear out.  </li>
            <li> This is meant for finishing the style on your 75% dried hair or for touching up already dried hair.  </li>
            <li> I had been lusting after a far more expensive version of this brush and decided to go the cheaper route with this Vidal Sasson version.</li>
            <li> but I have thick hair and have to use my regular hair dryer to dry my hair most of the way before finishing off with this.  </li>
            <li> For those who are complaining this does not dry their hair, I don&#x27;t believe it was meant to do that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda getting sick of looking at my pride and joy (my hair) in the mirror and seeing a hot mess staring back at</li>
            <li> I ordered one a year ago and once the motor gets hot, you can&#x27;t turn it back on until it cools down...</li>
            <li> This is a nifty little thing that I first found in a thrift store for $2.</li>
            <li> it doesnt get hot enough to use on even slightly damp hair.</li>
            <li> But when I turned it on to high the blow is not strong nor hot enough to dry my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bad part is that I really liked how it styled my hair!  </li>
            <li> It smells when you first use it, but after a few times, it goes away.  </li>
            <li> First few times I used, I too, had tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> For $11, though, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the hassle of trying to send it in.</li>
            <li> The first few uses smelled like burning plastic, but that eventually fades.  </li>
            <li> to use, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be as harsh and hot as my hair dryer was.  </li>
            <li> The brush did exactly what I wanted it to, I no longer have to suffer through hand cramps using the blow dryer and round brush.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair which doesn&#x27;t dry very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This one leaves my hair very soft and shiny after I spray my hair with a heat protector (my perm always leaves my dyed hair very dry).</li>
            <li> have spent a few years and quite a few dollars trying to find a replacement as Conair doesn&#x27;t make this kind any more...and FINALLY I have found it!</li>
            <li> For the moment I use the thinner brush as my hair is not very long.</li>
            <li> My other goal was to puff up my hair on a non-shampoo day, but that really doesn&#x27;t work since it&#x27;s hard to dampen my hair just the right amount</li>
            <li> I usually use a blow dryer but this product adds great curls and bounce to my otherwise thin hair!</li>
            <li> Also not recommended if you like to dry your hair completely.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Relatively low temperature doesn&#x27;t get your hair so hot that it leaves your hair feeling dried out, frizzy and crispy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Five munites with the hot air brush and my hair looks tame.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin, so this dries it very quickly.  </li>
            <li> When my hair was a little longer, I used the Conair spinning hair brush (large barrel).  </li>
            <li> A pity this was not made clear in the write-up!</li>
            <li> I like it because it takes the place of holding the blow dryer in one hand and a brush in the other and the air is hot enough to dry my coarse/thick Sicilian short hair.</li>
            <li> Although I have the 1-inch roller brush, it is a little bit large for my short hair</li>
            <li> Works gret for fine thin hai.</li>
            <li> My hair (straight, fine-ish) has also gotten tangled in this as I&#x27;ve tried to release the curl, and not just a little tangled, but ripping-hair-out-by-the-roots tangled.</li>
            <li> I dry my hair until it&#x27;s just slightly damp and use the hot air brush to finish styling</li>
            <li> I dry my hair until slightly damp, use this hot air brush</li>
            <li> I like it because it has low heat and will not damage my hair as my hair is thin and fine.</li>
            <li> I usually just dry my hair and leave it slightly damp, pin up the top layers and start curling.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more forced air.</li>
            <li> So far, this one does not shut down due to over heating as readily as the last one.</li>
            <li> I wanted to but a hot air brush from a while now and was just researching on the internet about all kinds of hot air brushes and was little skeptical whether they really work or not so tried this one proper in my budget so that even if it dint work i could not cry over it.</li>
            <li> even on high it won&#x27;t dry my short, fine, thin hair and you can forget any curl!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is a good or bad product in and of itself.</li>
            <li> At least I only spent $10 on it, but honestly, I&#x27;d rather just use my round brush and regular hair dryer, then a curling iron or rollers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hoped to blow dry a little and then use this as a finishing tool to get more curl and shape my hair before my usual styling process.  </li>
            <li> This styler has the right amount of temperature for hard to manage hair and the rubber brush won&#x27;t burn your scalp or your fingers.  </li>
            <li> in fact, they&#x27;re the only brand I&#x27;ve found that can tame my thick, frizzy hair and make it smooth, soft and frizz-free.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair and towel drying, I blow dry it until its just barely damp.  </li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one, my other one was over 5yr.s old.</li>
            <li> Double or triple bristles and the hair could actually stay on the brush, but as is, it just falls flat.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and the very first time I used this my hair got caught and tangled and had to be cut off of it.</li>
            <li> Needless to say one needs to pretty much use this styler after actually drying your hair with a regular blow</li>
            <li> but I use it mainly for volume and to curl my bangs a little.  </li>
            <li> and when it&#x27;s damp, I use this brush - no static caused by brush bristles, no scratching the scalp, no irritation, and even tho the wattage is low, my hair dries in just a few minutes with smooth curls and body.  </li>
            <li> We first tried a different brand that had a metal barrel for the brushes and hard plastic bristles.  </li>
            <li> I love them while they&#x27;re working, but after a few months they start shutting down after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It works pretty much as other&#x27;s reviews said; definitely not for thick hair or for completely drying your hair.  </li>
            <li> My old one kept quitting after less than a minute of use, then took several minutes to re-set, only to quit again.</li>
            <li> I would say that it at least blows hot air, but because of a short in the cord where it attaches to the handle it shuts off any time it is bumped.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> they make the handles sooo big with a big long handles...</li>
            <li> It comes in 2 different sizes for long or short hair.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely meant for short and/or layered hair as it will still get quite tangled when used in long hair (just ask my daughter).  </li>
            <li> Head is not as long as an alternate product we found but it works well just the same.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair on the short side, but long enough that I can style it with this type of brush.  </li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t scratch your scalp and are spread far enough apart that whether one has thin or thick hair this styler should be able to give you the overall styling results your looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always used a hot air styling brush for my permed, short, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for over 6 yrs.(yes, it last that long!) and dropped it recently, it broke</li>
            <li> But this one is SUPER weak and feels like something purchased at the Dollar Store.</li>
            <li> but once the hair is partially dry it becomes more difficult to detangle.</li>
            <li> I can wash my hair in the morning and have it dry and styled at the same time in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I have short some what curly hair and this is what I use to dry it and style it at the same time.</li>
            <li> Even on the low setting it left my hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I promise you will see a difference) and I blow dry the roots only, on low.</li>
            <li> So of course I just went to Amazon and not only found it but for half the price of my old one.</li>
            <li> I do like that they are hard plastic, though, not the hairbrush-style softer kind that can pull and damage delicate, wet</li>
            <li> For the type of women who like low maintenance like me, don&#x27;t want to spend huge amounts of time on your hair and are horrible at handling most styling products, using this is a BREEZE.</li>
            <li> I have used this hot air brush for at least 8yrs</li>
            <li> I have had 2 of these in the past that I used so much, I burned them out.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that when I used it on the back of my head my hair tangles quite a bit and is difficult to free from the brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact product for at least 20 years.</li>
            <li> This Hot Air Brush is a lemon to say the least.</li>
            <li> I got the impression that this hot air brush rotated all the time it was on or at least had a way you could get it to</li>
            <li> I was very dissappointed for a while because I was not able to find it in any department stores.</li>
            <li> I use my hair dryer for a short time to get excessive wet out &amp; then go to the hot air brush.</li>
            <li> I find that I don&#x27;t need the flat iron if I use this brush.</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend it if you don&#x27;t have long hair.</li>
            <li> used the brush while my hair was short, and I use it still now that it&#x27;s long.  </li>
            <li> However, I thought that it would help me with straightening my hair with having to use a flat iron, but that wasn&#x27;t happening.</li>
            <li> Been using this tool for a really long time, and it finally died.  </li>
            <li> But, my hair isn&#x27;t quite long enough for the size of the barrel.  </li>
            <li> Does not last as long as it should.</li>
            <li> They do last a long time.</li>
            <li> It is not a bad product, but not a great one either.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this, my hair got tangled so badly on the brush right up to the scalp that I thought I would have to shave my hair all off.</li>
            <li> Second of all this thing took sooo freakin&#x27; long!</li>
            <li> had used another brand, but they didn&#x27;t last very long, maybe a year.</li>
            <li> The curls I get last for a very long time</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it doesn&#x27;t have enough power to curl my hair unless I hold it on each section for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> short, ear length bob in the morning, let it air dry as I do whatever needs to be done in the morning</li>
            <li> so she uses it to dry and style it at the same time.</li>
            <li> With my regular dryer, until it&#x27;s about 90% dry.</li>
            <li> The second time, I air-dried my hair for over 1.5 hours until it was nearly dry before using it</li>
            <li> and it still took over 30-40 min to fully dry and several run throughs for the curls to hold.</li>
            <li> This item is made for short hair--unless you&#x27;re just combing as you dry.</li>
            <li> There is not enough power to completely dry my hair....</li>
            <li> you want to style and dry at the same time</li>
            <li> I always keep a spare hidden away for the time that my old one gives up and</li>
            <li> I spray my dry hair with a small amount of water &amp; then use the hot air brush to dry &amp; curl the hair.  </li>
            <li> I looked EVERYWHERE for this product and could not find it, so I caved and purchased a DIFFERENT VERSION (with a metal center - yuck) from a local retailer; IT STOPPED WORKING AFTER ONE WEEK!!  </li>
            <li> Not as expensive as most, have spent up to 45.00 on others, and they turn off before I am done.</li>
            <li> It sounds like a loose wire due to the intermittent start &amp; stop action while using the brush.  </li>
            <li> Small fan that is built into handle blows heated air out of roller holes, does dry hair much quicker to help speed up styling time.</li>
            <li> The wig was human hair and it took just as long to dry</li>
            <li> I have used this brand-name Hot AIR Brush for several years and was disappointed to no longer to be able to purchase it at my usual source locally.</li>
            <li> Not hot enough and doesn&#x27;t  work for short hair at all.</li>
            <li> I run slightly damp hands through my hair, then, starting from the front, roll this thing through my hair to the back several times (all over my head).</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and it helps to tame it down to manageable  soft curls.</li>
            <li> similar brush styler only to have trouble with them shutting down within seconds of starting apparently over heating, i bought the second one because i thought the 1st one was just a defective product,</li>
            <li> Can use it to finish not quite dry hair or later with dry hair that needs some volume</li>
            <li> It works fine, but the adjustment switch from low heat to high heat is not ideal - a bit clumsy and rough to move.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the hard bristles.</li>
            <li> the high setting would be a low on hair dryers, which doesn&#x27;t cut it with hair as thick as mine&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I sent for 3 on a Friday and unfortunately that meant no arrival until Tuesday with free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I was so afraid I would not be able to replace it</li>
            <li> After soaking it in conditioner and cutting the spikes off of the spool it was finally free!</li>
            <li> The most disappointing thing i have ever bought from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s small and light, I&#x27;ve even brought it to work with me when I&#x27;m running late and spent four minutes drying my hair in my office, without bothering people in the next office.</li>
            <li> had a difficult time trying to find a hot air brush with soft tip bristles.  </li>
            <li> It has no power and was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this brush as long as I can find it.  </li>
            <li> The last time I needed a replacement I spent a lot of time looking for it</li>
            <li> I tried it with my med long blond hair and it got tangled</li>
            <li> I have long hair.</li>
            <li> From experience, because I have used these a long time, they do not make it through the warranty.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended it as she uses it in her salon and has for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> long</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how it works if you have no natural cur.</li>
            <li> Really not for short hair!!</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair and the hair kept getting stuck, wrapped around the wand, curl release or not.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for this at salons for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li> they will be offered again before long.</li>
            <li> but it takes a long time to do so.</li>
            <li> If your hair is two inches long, it might work great,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> how long you hold it.  </li>
            <li> I have a roughly chin-length, modified bob that is angled toward the front and textured in the back.</li>
            <li> but for longer, thicker hair, I think it would take you a long time</li>
            <li> depending upon how long you hold the curl...</li>
            <li> I usually resorted to using the cool setting, but it was not warm enough to curl well.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not to long.  </li>
            <li> I have semi-thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> so I get maximum fluff and styling for my very short hair.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and this thing got all tangled up.  </li>
            <li> It really made styling my long thick hair easier, but it breaks in about three-four months.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and straight and looks like a porcupine stuck</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, thick, straight hair and</li>
            <li> I hate it alot its not working good &amp; its hearts</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to having this item, to shorten my \\&quot;ready\\&quot; time, as my hair is thick and takes a long time to dry.  </li>
            <li> It takes less time than my prior method and looks terrific.</li>
            <li> Being a male with less hair than I had when I was younger</li>
            <li> Then, less than 2 weeks later, It DIED and wouldn&#x27;t come back on at all!!</li>
            <li> I have bought this in the past and needed a new one.</li>
            <li> I knew it wouldnt the minute it was switched on the air was barely lukewarm and not very strong.</li>
            <li> it takes long to dry my hair</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to dry my hair</li>
            <li> I have curly/wavy hair that is wild if I don&#x27;t tame it.  </li>
            <li> and I feel it has made drying my hair less of a hassle even though not exactly less time spent on the process.</li>
            <li> I had given up on finding a styling brush that wouldn&#x27;t burn my gray hair which is very fine and nearly impossible to curl.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE MEDIUM TO LONG HAIR!  </li>
            <li> I will not go back to any other hair brush styler.  </li>
            <li> I hope it will last a longer amount of time than the other 2 did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The other type, with the actual brush not these rubber prongs, stick in the hair and split and break the hair off!!</li>
            <li> but since this provides heat, air flow and a styling product held in one hand, allowing the other to select the specific hairs to be styled, it has worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> :  not hot enough to style my hair</li>
            <li> I use this every day and when my other one quit,  I looked everywhere in stores to find one like it and could only find one on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The one inch was a little big for my short hair.</li>
            <li> item works - however - not hot enough to hold the curl</li>
            <li> However, our local stores no longer carry the small barrel size, and larger ones only make my hair look</li>
            <li> I bought several other I thought would work, but didn&#x27;t like them.  </li>
            <li> I have seen other reviews that said the same</li>
            <li> I was always burning myself using a hot curling rod &amp; the results were not successful.</li>
            <li> I have tryed 3 other products but keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews stating the same thing</li>
            <li> It blows so weak and it does not get hot</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s going to take at least twice as long to dry your hair completely because of low output.</li>
            <li> This one is not hot enough to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> this item is hard to find I have an old one that has several years of use on it  </li>
            <li> I have used this type of styling brush for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry for about 4 minutes with a Sasoon ion dryer, then style with this brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it after letting my hair  air dry</li>
            <li> and when it&#x27;s almost dry</li>
            <li> I can dry and curl my hair with ease.</li>
            <li> In just a couple of minutes my medium length hair is dry and styled.  </li>
            <li> but it gets the job done if your hair is already mostly dry.  </li>
            <li> It straightens and gives body to the hair after I blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> not all dry looking like using a blow</li>
            <li> but it takes forever to dry your hair with it.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair  </li>
            <li> This is to style hair after it&#x27;s almost dry.  </li>
            <li> And there are some holes that the heat comes out and dry the hair.</li>
            <li> Hair definetly must be almost dry for this to work.  </li>
            <li> I have a torn  Rotator cuff and with this dryer brush I can easily dry &amp; style my hair with one arm.  </li>
            <li> and also I did notice that my hair looked shinier after using it to dry.</li>
            <li> It does dry</li>
            <li> I used it when my hair is almost dry.  </li>
            <li> but I have used it on dry hair to freshen up the style.</li>
            <li> It makes curls on almost dry hair.</li>
            <li> I can dry my curly hair with ease.</li>
            <li> I use it on dry and semi damp hair.  </li>
            <li> I let it air dry until it&#x27;s just damp, then I plug up my styler and finish drying and styling it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair at all</li>
            <li> Took time to dry my hair .I</li>
            <li> It wont dry your hair for you</li>
            <li> so you do need to dry almost all the way before using but does help with volume and curl</li>
            <li> My hair was dry before it began to be styled, and looked like straw.  </li>
            <li> Can use to Dry and curl hair all in one step.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry for awhile then use this to style my cut and give it some body.  </li>
            <li> Easiest way to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> and of course the brush doesn&#x27;t help at all on dry</li>
            <li> the brush doesn&#x27;t help at all on dry</li>
            <li> This curling brush works so well to dry my hair in an efficient manner.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to start blowing my hair dry</li>
            <li> just let it air dry for a bit and then use this to finish the job</li>
            <li> and then when almost dry, I can use this to style a bit.  </li>
            <li> no need to blow dry...</li>
            <li> towel-dry my hair, add a golf-ball-size amount of mousse, then use this to dry and curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it, as I&#x27;m a bit &amp;#34;challenged&amp;#34; when trying to use a hair dryer and a separate brush to dry and style my hair.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair dry to damp</li>
            <li> Hair must be partly dry to use this.</li>
            <li> seems to help straighten my hair and dry it.</li>
            <li> I dry my hair to just damp and then use it to style.  </li>
            <li> This one I was skeptical of because it was much cheaper than my old one</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ONLY BRUSH i HAVE FOUND T HAT WILL CURL AND DRY MY BABY THIN HAIR TO HOLD FOR THE WHOLE WORK DAY AND INTO THE EVENING.  </li>
            <li> If you have thin hair it might work better but med or thick, your asking for pain.</li>
            <li> This a a product that I can not live without.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t seem to last long - only about a year before the motor goes out.  </li>
            <li> The plastic brush doesn&#x27;t grip a single strand of hair.</li>
            <li> but I use it every single day.  </li>
            <li> I have limited mobility in my arm</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised due to the price point but this is basically a round brush and a hair dryer combined into one.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I wish they lasted longer - the average for me is two years</li>
            <li> Hint: to set the final curls, just let heat up with hair twisted around the wand, then turn off and let it cool down, then release.  </li>
            <li> I use it for loose curling.  </li>
            <li> but it comes loose again and is just a pain.</li>
            <li> I can dry my hair in less than ten minutes and recommend it.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that after a lot of use it will temporarily shut down which means the intake filter on bottom of wand needs to be cleaned.</li>
            <li> Shuts down misuse and does not come back on when shut off until it cools</li>
            <li> came across this as I was about to put down another hundred dollars for a similar gadget advertised on TV.  </li>
            <li> even though I don&#x27;t have that much hair, it is not able to give a little bit of style to my hair.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s just not strong enough for my thick, straight hair.</li>
            <li> This is not a high end product</li>
            <li> Other brands and models usually only last a few months, but this model and brand</li>
            <li> It was smaller than the previous one I purchased &amp;</li>
            <li> I use it on dry hair, but you can also use it on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> This was a replacement for previous purchase of same item.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is not real hot, so it does not burn your hair.</li>
            <li> I had looked online and locally for a hot air brush but was unable to find what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have quite severe damage from when I decided to go from dark brown to blonde to red and then back to dark brown, so I was getting a lot of breakage whenever I dried  my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is quite a reduction in time spent if you take into consideration that I used to blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> I think that the power is also different here, (less than sent from</li>
            <li> plastic barrel actually snapped in half in my luggage .  </li>
            <li> Other similar products tend to tear hair because of the sharp plastic bristles.  </li>
            <li> You have to have the teeth hard enough and long enough to grab your hair....</li>
            <li> It definitely dries my hair but, it leaves it in a puffy mess.</li>
            <li> I have to grab a thick &amp;#34;bunch&amp;#34; of hair and not a small amount.</li>
            <li> My hair is not easy to handle, it has some irregular strange looking tiny curls in them, and frizzy looking after wash.</li>
            <li> Mine is thick, curly and course, which this tool makes it possible to control; it tames down the natural curl, while giving it shine and manageability.</li>
            <li> not make the curls tight enough to hold the curl, it just gives body</li>
            <li> Awkward to use....large for my hand &amp; it does not grip fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have to wet my hair down for it to do anything at all, and it still takes just as long to get my hair dry again.</li>
            <li> A little bigger than I like.  </li>
            <li> Supposedly in India they shave little girls&#x27; heads to make it grow back thicker.  </li>
            <li> Head of brush as a little longer than I thought and my hair is short - could not use it.</li>
            <li> This little curler started overheating after I only had it about 2 months.</li>
            <li> Was a little dissapointed that the brush doesn&#x27;t actually rotate.  </li>
            <li> was a little bigger than I thought..</li>
            <li> These dry and tame the curl at the same time.  </li>
            <li> i would have many bad hair days without it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend  it for sure, and price isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> I refuse to lament all the lost bad hair years and will only look forward to the smooth, sculpted years</li>
            <li> I had an old Vidal Sasson appliance and hoped it would at least match the performance, but  it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It will not smooth your hair like an InStyler or similar heat straightener.</li>
            <li> As for the tax applied, just about equals the gas in the round trip from the store to back home,</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to use this on really wet hair, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> When I plugged it in the second time, it was totally dead.  </li>
            <li> The reason for me needing to return this brush is that the plug does not fit in to any standard electrical outlets and therefore cannot be used.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace one I had of another brand and really do not like this.  </li>
            <li> You wrap hair around it and hold for a bit, it does not get really not</li>
            <li> I feel like the bristles don&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; the hair well at all, because they are widely spaced.</li>
            <li> As it is, it&#x27;s not really usable for me.</li>
            <li> I had one and it broke after several yrs of everyday use.  </li>
            <li> Yes I would recommend it to anyone that has trouble getting the look they want with a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> This product was described as having rotating ability; it did not rotate and did not justify the money spent on it.</li>
            <li> 2 air speed settings both deliver what I would consider a minimal amount of air flow.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, just a curling iron w/ bristles.  </li>
            <li> ITS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED I BOUGHT IT</li>
            <li> heat is fine...need to be careful with the release sometimes.  </li>
            <li> Not much heat for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long dark hair which is always so frizzy and</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The oerfect thing to get the dust buildup out is one of those flexible green and white tooth picks.</li>
            <li> Still haven&#x27;t figured out what the manufacturer expected when this tool was produced.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this dryer to anyone who is trying to attain beach waves with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> This last one that I received a few days ago died within 30 seconds of using it.  </li>
            <li> be careful.  </li>
            <li> Only takes a few minutes to get it manageable.</li>
            <li> and I had to carefully take it out.</li>
            <li> So I have to carefully unroll.  </li>
            <li> Its not What i expected from Vidal Sasson.</li>
            <li> I user my cleanser (and have since learned never to brush my hair wet, so if you are having thinning problems, use a wide tooth comb, not a brush.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use this product with soaking wet</li>
            <li> I tried it again a few days later after it had cooled off.  </li>
            <li> It has some &amp;#34;air&amp;#34; in it, but did not curl the hair and made my job harder.</li>
            <li> It worked but died after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Operation as expected.</li>
            <li> I expected the item that I have always used for years.</li>
            <li> It does everything I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I do have to be careful with it tangling in the hair, even when I use the release button, but with care it can be untangled without damaging hair.</li>
            <li> AS I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> It give the same effect as a blow dryer and round brush but all in one for those of us that are not so coordinated.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it would save time from a hair dryer and round brush, because it&#x27;s so low power</li>
            <li> but it has absolutely no heating power.</li>
            <li> My husband spent 20 minutes RIPPING my hair out of the thing.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, coarse, short hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair do not waste your time.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products from drug stores and the handle is too large and heavy and hard to turn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to track down which one it is, since it&#x27;s clearly not this one.</li>
            <li> Not able to be sure of the results, I decided to try this less expensive option to see if it made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> COMPLETE waste of money!!</li>
            <li> It might work on someone with shorter than shoulder length hair, but certainly not any longer than that.</li>
            <li> My hair is of average thickness and in the time it took for this to dry 90% of my hair</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve returned it, but due to getting my bangs cut quite short soon after receiving it, I didn&#x27;t use it for a few weeks and missed my return window.  </li>
            <li> it didnt work at all, it glow air for like the fisrt 2 days i used it, but the air was not hot enough, then on the 3 day it stop working, waste of money</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is in a bad place and feels loose, so it gets turned off easily by accident.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful.</li>
            <li> You need to use this on slightly damp to dry hair</li>
            <li> I like the concept of adding body and slight curl as I dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is an essential styling tool, especially if you&#x27;re not good with a blow dryer and brush.</li>
            <li> I use it with towel dry hair (slightly damp.)  </li>
            <li> Even with short, thin hair, it would take an eon to dry using only this tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your hair is shorter, I would suggest you buy one that is less than 1 inch, especially if you want a little curl.</li>
            <li> Also, it claims that the brush &amp;#34;rotates,&amp;#34; but in actuality the brush rotates only when you move it in a round motion while your finger is holding down the &amp;#34;curl release&amp;#34; switch.</li>
            <li> I re read the instructions and just don&#x27;t see with long hair what keeps it from tangling, the release doesn&#x27;t if a little hair has flipped over the end during the roll.</li>
            <li> but if it gets a little too long (my hair length is to my shoulders)</li>
            <li> This stupid blowbrush barely got hot enough to make even the slightest curl in my hair.</li>
            <li> To make a long story short I had bad hair until my hot air brush arrived in the mail from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I cant find the other one anywhere in the shops.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands and they cannot match the performance of this one.</li>
            <li> I never even consider any other brand.  </li>
            <li> This has lasted longer than any other I have used.  </li>
            <li> Online at walmart for $ 12.00 home delivery with other items.</li>
            <li> It does the job, takes a bit longer than I would like which might be due to the strength of the power.</li>
            <li> I was either finding them too small or too big...</li>
            <li> Other stores don&#x27;t seem to be stocking them anymore</li>
            <li> and I had been looking at Target, Kmart and other stores for over a year.  </li>
            <li> This does work, but I personally believe that the barrel was too small for me.</li>
            <li> There were big and small barrels and there were brush like tips (which can get caught in your hair).  </li>
            <li> I tried to find one at other stores in my city, but no one carries them anymore.  </li>
            <li> However I found this brush/dryer combo to be subpar compared to other Vidal Sassoon products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because I normally love VS products.</li>
            <li> Eliminates the need for a blow dryer in one hand and a brush in the other.</li>
            <li> My hair is in a short bob, and I have a small wave that needs to be coaxed into loveliness.</li>
            <li> the other brands seem to have done.   </li>
            <li> I looked all over my home town and other cities that I visited and to my horror couldn&#x27;t find the air brush any where.  </li>
            <li> Have never styled well with curling irons or other devices</li>
            <li> Looking for a 1&amp;#34; brush styler, not a hot air styler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to use a brush in one hand and blow dryer in the other.</li>
            <li> Did not fully meet expectations due to the following:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> Other blowing air at your hair</li>
            <li> This product was listed in with other stylers that were ceramic but it isn&#x27;t ceramic.</li>
            <li> It smooths my hair quickly, is not excessively hot, and has a release function to keep hair from getting tangled.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a small as I have very short hair</li>
            <li> Not sure how to resolve getting my money back on the defective one.  </li>
            <li> you can only do one small piece of hair at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both Amazon and Vidal Sassoon were extremely helpful when I contacted them</li>
            <li> We tried this just because of other people&#x27;s reviews.  </li>
            <li> The wife likes this brush but it was smaller than she usually uses.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bother with any other stylers.</li>
            <li> I was so elated to find a 1 inch brush, I overlooked the other</li>
            <li> It is also small enough to carry and/or pack.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair please don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> The item randomly turns off when it doesn&#x27;t turn off its like a car ready to stall out!</li>
            <li> The styling stays with out using hair spray or other styling products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;ve bought other styles and gotten my hair tangled in my hair.</li>
            <li> Any problems I had was due to my inexperience rather than the styler.  </li>
            <li> I love this crazy thing!  </li>
            <li> At first, I used the brushy attachment, but it was difficult for me to maneuver (arthritis in shoulders).  </li>
            <li> Not hot at all.</li>
            <li> I have problems using any other type of styling tool because my hair will not stay on the roller.  </li>
            <li> It took a little longer to dry my hair</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your hair even a little and takes forever to curl it under.</li>
            <li> I usually air dry my hair until it is almost dry and then finish styling it with this product.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush itself are made of plastic, which was rough on my hair, and the large spaces in between each bristle make it difficult for the brush to hold onto my hair.</li>
            <li> The bristles are also thick, hard plastic that is very spaced out.</li>
            <li> but after few months of using it works only few minutes and stops.</li>
            <li> Not only did this product not do anything beneficial, it actually made my hair look worse than if I had used a blowdryer and brush.  </li>
            <li> I usually dry it with a round brush and a blow dryer</li>
            <li> I purchased this styler/dryer a few yrs back and used it everyday.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands with no success.</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong is that they don&#x27;t last as long as they used to.</li>
            <li> I dried my hair and have some loose curls as well</li>
            <li> Stick it in the little slots and roll then carefully pull out.</li>
            <li> and it would not curl or dry it properly without leaving it hard and damaged!</li>
            <li> Its hard enough to deal w/ the handle before u can even deal w/ the brush and focus on smoothing out your hair...</li>
            <li> Upon use, I found the barrel to be too short and the hard plastic bristles tangle and pull my bangs.  </li>
            <li> I purchased two of them, as I have found them to be hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  hard for me to handle a brush and a dryer at the same time,  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in regular stores.</li>
            <li> It was also really hard to gather enough hair onto the barrel without burning the scalp.  </li>
            <li> These are hard to find in my area, and I don&#x27;t care for the larger 1 1/2 or 2 inch sized one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Cheap brand and bad function.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> There were at least 3 or 4 similar items.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they used to come with both sizes of brushes, but now you have to buy a separate dryer for each size brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it does not worth the money</li>
            <li> Not worth a cent.</li>
            <li> 2 hours is absurd to get ready to go somewhere.     </li>
            <li> Not worth returning because the buyer has to pay the return postage.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> cannot see why it was sent to Spain from America, so now I am unable to use the product that cost me so much in Postage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not worth the effort to pack up and return.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least three years after Conair stopped producing the one I used for ten years before that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I would have is that the cooling fans are around the bottom of the handle</li>
            <li> Had to buy a transformer which made this an expensive exercise, really thought that it would have been noted somewhere.  </li>
            <li> Since having brain surgery, my hair has grown back thick and unruly.</li>
            <li> I like it, but took a few tries to understand it.</li>
            <li> Takes a few tries to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is short and thick.......</li>
            <li> Not enough heat or  air flow to handle thick hair.</li>
            <li> I get many hair wands and curlers and straighteners to review, and always hate all of them.</li>
            <li> They might have fixed the overheating problem, but they created a worse one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these types of brushes for decades, and this is by far the worse buy ever .</li>
            <li> Also wipe down handle with alcohol cotton ball.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s helped keep the cost down.</li>
            <li> Plus the amount of breakage has gone WAY down.  </li>
            <li> I try to tightened it down with almost every curl</li>
            <li> The down side is the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Down fall....</li>
            <li> That cuts down on the amount of heat I have to use on my hair.)</li>
            <li> , I have three of them, so if one breaks down, another is waiting to take its place.</li>
            <li> other buyers!</li>
            <li> propelled  and the brissel are little hard to use on short hair like mine</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble doing my hair due to hand eye coordination issues from eye problems.</li>
            <li> I noticed other reviewers stating dryer shuts off after a few minutes</li>
            <li> I had one previously</li>
            <li> Has an odd smell, almost like mildew.  </li>
            <li> Mostly it was just mediocre and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product previously but could not find it in a store.  </li>
            <li> After evaluating the situation I decided to switch hair dressers and the way I was taking care of my previously \\&quot;resilient to anything\\&quot; hair.  </li>
            <li> It gives my hair a slight bend.</li>
            <li> Less tangling.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller who couldn&#x27;t have cared less.</li>
            <li> I previously had one like this</li>
            <li> I bought this when I saw it to put away for when the one I have now goes out (which it is already shorting out and I&#x27;ve had it less than a year.)</li>
            <li> Difficult to catch short hair to make enough curls as well as lift.</li>
            <li> Could be for those with less thick/coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not open it and start using it until about four months after I purchased it, so when the problem began I was already outside the return period.  </li>
            <li> The amount of air that comes out is ridiculously small and not very hot.  </li>
            <li> Not too hot, not too cold</li>
            <li> Also, if you use hair products, after a long period of repeated use, the brush will get an icky build up on it, as would any tool.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to mess with my hair a lot</li>
            <li> I am not talented enough to use both a brush and a blow dryer, and I always burn myself with curling irons.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t suggest this for thick long hair</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use a curling iron without burning myself so this doesn&#x27;t give as tight a curl</li>
            <li> It turns my hair under adding volume and bounce to my cut without curling my hair too tightly.</li>
            <li> However, it takes me twice the time to dry them and it is hard to make any style..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I seem to need to order a new one every six or seven months.  </li>
            <li> Takes a while to dry my medium thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have previously been using a metal barrelled skinny round bristle brush.</li>
            <li> this product is very poor because it hardly blows any hot air so styling is a zero.</li>
            <li> maybe this can give a little volume to my roots.  </li>
            <li> so I was excited about getting it and was really disappointed with what I got.</li>
            <li> The power is weak and it gets tangled constantly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend but it does get a little getting used too.  </li>
            <li> Just not worth the buy !</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my hair to have a little bit of curl to my hair while drying my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Enter this little gem.  </li>
            <li> It took a LOT longer for hers, and it got a little tangled up from time to time, despite having a hair release button on the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a perm and it made my hair a little too frizzy.</li>
            <li> I encourage you to buy one if you are thinking of changing your blow drying routine a little bit.</li>
            <li> Overheated and the spring holding the comb release always needed a little restretching.</li>
            <li> This styled gives a little lift while drying hair.  </li>
            <li> This little powerhouse gives me curls, waves, or body, depending on my mood.</li>
            <li> It was dry, thin and just laid there not very pretty.</li>
            <li> I had surgery on my left shoulder and have been unable to dry or style my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin hair which is hard to style with a blow dryer and round brush alone, so I&#x27;ve supplemented the end of styling my hair with this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> the first one lasted 2 years but compare the price to other brand name, VS is not so bad.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair (thank you my Native ancestors), and this little wonder does wonders for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I HATED THEM - they snarled my hair, too hot, not hot enough and always even with care</li>
            <li> IT BEGAN GIVING ME A LITTLE TROUBLE</li>
            <li> It is one of the few hair appliances that does what I need.</li>
            <li> After a few months it begins to overheat.</li>
            <li> but when I contacted you again it was not available.</li>
            <li> It is dried and curled a bit all in one move.  </li>
            <li> I am not thrilled but it is about what I expected. . .Good</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> /wave on small sections of hair, but it&#x27;s not worth the hassle or the nauseating smell.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this.  </li>
            <li> Was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it often because I don&#x27;t need to have my hair styled everyday.  </li>
            <li> I use this one everyday and it lasts about a year.  </li>
            <li> I used them almost everyday for about 3 years.    </li>
            <li> I could have blown dried, straightened and curled my hair.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to wash everyday</li>
            <li> I had one for a few years, now my niece is using one too</li>
            <li> No messing with a round brush and hair dryer as this is all in one.  </li>
            <li> and I was heart broken when it finally died.</li>
            <li> IT ELIMINATES THE &amp;#34;PUTTING THE DRIER DOWN&amp;#34; EVERY TIME I HAVE TO PICK UP THE ROUND BRUSH</li>
            <li> A bit heavy for me</li>
            <li> If you want volume but, can&#x27;t handle a blowdry and round brush use this product.  </li>
            <li> Saves $ on hair care products because it&#x27;s not as harsh as a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it that wasn&#x27;t a curing iron, but like a hair dryer with a round brush attachment.</li>
            <li> Not great for short hair.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday to get my bed head under control.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s blow dried.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was also a dryer and can assist in styling my hair once completely dried.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It does overheat and if I turn it off, it will take a few minutes to work again.  </li>
            <li> round brush and a blow dryer to style my hair.</li>
            <li> It grew back in thin, in a lot of lengths.</li>
            <li> it works; but takes me longer than just using my dryer and a round brush.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few of these hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> It worked a few times and then gave up the ghost so its lay there</li>
            <li> waste your time or money on this.</li>
            <li> I had one a few years ago.</li>
            <li> This works well on short thin hair.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> The heat sets the &#x27;curls&#x27; once you&#x27;ve damp dried or dried your hair.</li>
            <li> The hair has to be towel dried.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have finally been let into the secret club of people that know how not to have fizzy hair, and this is it.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Please please don&#x27;t waste your money, don&#x27;t be fooled by the 4 start rating</li>
            <li> The blower is very weak and not hot enough.  </li>
            <li> With this, you can achieve that Brazilian Blow-dry effect in 15 minutes or less!</li>
            <li> From reading other reviews I see this is a common problem</li>
            <li> I prefer the stiff brush for my hair...</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t get any shine, probably because of the plastic stiff &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> so it was NOT more than the styler could handle and being as my hair was so thin, I only used it 10 or less minutes a day!</li>
            <li> Also not a strong hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I used to curl my hair with electric rollers every day to sort of tame my  curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have had hot air brushes/dryers before and this one is the worst one so far.  </li>
            <li> I is just what I needed to tame my hair.</li>
            <li> For the very reasonable price, how bad could it</li>
            <li> The brush does tame my awkward ends into place and offers slight waves.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this item for less, but was unable to find it in my local stores, therefore I purchased it on-line</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and weak - takes a long time to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> this product is NOT SAFE and a WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> It was always thick, but it has become very hard to manage especially in humid weather.  </li>
            <li> Help dry my very thick hair</li>
            <li> not a very effective dryer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too difficult for me to hold the round brush and dryer at the same time</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful not to catch the base of the strand you are curling or the styler will get very tangled and the release feature doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> end results are poor - leaves my hair dry, frizzy, and poofy.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Rather, as the air brush ages (and after LOTS of use)the motor(which is very small) may overheat causing the dryer to stop working until it cools down.</li>
            <li> That being said, I bought one because I have thick hair that I get tired of blow drying and then flat ironing.</li>
            <li> But when I accidentally pulled hair through the tongs a little wonky, I had to fight with it forever.</li>
            <li> Very little air blows through it.</li>
            <li> Very little heat and the spinning part did not spin.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, one quit working after only two days and the other is running slow two weeks late.  </li>
            <li> I have had several Helen of Troy dryers, but they are sooo expensive...</li>
            <li> But since this unit does not heat well enough to style my hair, it is totally useless to me.</li>
            <li> I think its sort of similar to the expensive one advertised on TV</li>
            <li> Was not sure about the size...</li>
            <li> The brush was too small for my hair.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone with hair much past their jaw use this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Currently it seems difficult to find smaller sizes about 3/4&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> Maybe it was the paltry heat setting (one setting only) that failed to set/hold the hair</li>
            <li> I have us in the past.</li>
            <li> I usually use a (1 in.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what \\&quot;rotating vented</li>
            <li> sadly it broke after just the second use.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can roll past the hair ends</li>
            <li> I am pretty disappointed with this thing.  </li>
            <li> (I usually let my hair air-dry for 15-20 minutes before using the brush, if I have the time.  </li>
            <li> My hair has unbelievable body and bounce after I use this styling tool.</li>
            <li> The old ones kept cutting out on me, but this one does not.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately it stopped spinning the 2nd time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Was unable to use the curler because it was on American voltlage.</li>
            <li> Not the usual quality.</li>
            <li> Works on thin hair as well as thick hair, shorter hair and long hair.</li>
            <li> On high there is almost no hot air coming thru, totally worthless.  </li>
            <li> but I was so tired of burning my hair off and have been looking for a lighter less harsh tool on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My problem is that sometimes the ends don&#x27;t want to cooperate and stick out in weird ways or some section falls too limply against my head even though I dry it bent over so the hair hangs away from my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unless you have a LOT of long, thick hair, this tool won&#x27;t work, and if you have thick hair, I&#x27;d expect the weak heat/fan would be a problem.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and other kinds get tangled up.  </li>
            <li> This might work for someone with very thin, short hair.  </li>
            <li> a second.&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is really weak and it smells like plastic when it&#x27;s on, and the big surprise is that it started to over heat and shut off after less than 1 minute!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is not very good for styling.</li>
            <li> On the negative, it did very little for</li>
            <li> I found it impossible to use in long, wet hair.</li>
            <li> I am not good at using a round brush with a hairdryer).  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t add any volume and actually gave me worst results than my regular tight bristle round brush.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is a sealed system, so it cannot be opened to inspect for loose wires.  </li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine &amp; thinning terribly as I age.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, I have such thick hair!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how hard it would be to style my hair without this.  </li>
            <li> My hair does not stay on the brush &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; which are hard plastic spikes that are incapable of grasping and holding onto hair.  </li>
            <li> This one hardly ever gets stuck in my hair</li>
            <li> While trying to grow it out into a bob, I had an especially hard time with some wiry hair especially on the sides.  </li>
            <li> This one is hard to find - so I bought a couple of them.  </li>
            <li> They are hard to find so get one now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to use</li>
            <li> My hand was cut twice as I tried to get it out of the hard plastic shell.</li>
            <li> They have hardly been used, and now I am looking for another brand because I do not have the time or patience to try to use these like-new irons.</li>
            <li> At almost 73 years of age I find it hard work to keep writing complaints, but, as you asked I thought I would</li>
            <li> The brush rolled and it was really hard to get the hair to stay in the brush.</li>
            <li> Hard to find a replacement for the one I have had for 10 yrs.  </li>
            <li> has been hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li> I exclusively use the hard bristle attachment and have figured out how to hold and move it</li>
            <li> I ordered two air brushes because they are hard to find in this size wand.</li>
            <li> Instead I sat there for at least 30 minutes pulling and ripping my hair out.</li>
            <li> If not he must be rolliing over in his grave to this his name is on this cheap peice of useless crap.</li>
            <li> I dislike giving negative reviews</li>
            <li> I have had at least 4 of them</li>
            <li> duh.</li>
            <li> This styler/dryer worked well for several weeks, then began cutting off while in use.  </li>
            <li> - MY HAIR IS WAY TOO THICK TO USE AS</li>
            <li> Might give it to my mom in law with thick shortish hair.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, people with thick, frizzy hair might want to consider another product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t move a lot of air so if you have thick hair, this is not for you.  </li>
            <li> I do have thick hair</li>
            <li> Am I missing something here or both are broken ?</li>
            <li> I have wavy, frizzy, semi thick hair</li>
            <li> I would recommend for shorter hair that is not too thick.</li>
            <li> Absolute crap.  </li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T ACTUALLY MEAN IT ROTATES.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I will do when they are gone , maybe have to shave my head !</li>
            <li> so I usually buy 2!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy / kinky hair that&#x27;s past my shoulders</li>
            <li> but this one is very thin, not much hot air blows out of it, nor it styles at all .</li>
            <li> This can be annoying and time consuming so to me, that&#x27;s when it&#x27;s time to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it burned out in less than two months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously thinking of returning them.  </li>
            <li> Brush #3 had serious electrical issues and quit working after about three months use.  </li>
            <li> The product works well on my hair and that is why I keep replacing it, however, the product quality has been seriously degraded.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles do not give the proper tension to put a definitive style in my impossible hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;1.  If you are expecting to dry your hair with the air brush styler, you will be unhappy.  </li>
            <li> very  weak dryer don&#x27;t waste ur money</li>
            <li> This did absolutely no good to frizzy hair but tangle it up.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good at hair, and this is the easiest tool I&#x27;ve ever got.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO GOOD  </li>
            <li> It was loud and made annoying sounds.</li>
            <li> Major piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and doesn&#x27;t matter how I used it tangled my hair so badly that I had to spend 10 mins untangling it hoping my hair won&#x27;t fall off or need to be cut from it.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when local retail stires quit stocking it.  </li>
            <li> The dryer is really weak and it smells like plastic when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> but the motor is weak-</li>
            <li> I have used hot air brushes for decades, and this was probably the worst.  </li>
            <li> However, I can see someone burning themselves if it were hotter and suing the company for their dumb mistake</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m doing something wrong</li>
            <li> /&gt;1-It blows so weak</li>
            <li> Seriously a piece of crap, I can&#x27;t believe Vidal Sasson actually put their name on this garbage!    </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always wavy/curly and  very thick.    </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and the styler doesn&#x27;t get stuck in it.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick</li>
            <li> hair is shoudler length, sometimes shorter and very thick.</li>
            <li> Saturday, we tried this on my daughter&#x27;s hair - she has a very thick head of wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have very very thick hair</li>
            <li> Issue might be just on those with very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use since you have to keep your arm elevated hard for me to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very bad item , it just aplastic stick , very low heat ,weak blowing ,Bad item not working properly</li>
            <li> Alas, it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> so she was not happy to see hair in the brush.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Worse than that</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this purchase at all.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> AND IT DOES NOT NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> It also gives lift to thin hair when used at the roots.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and get a perm every 3 or 4 months.  </li>
            <li> Not happy t all.  </li>
            <li> and you sent me a medium size brush Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> not a great product.</li>
            <li> It makes my thin hair seem thicker</li>
            <li> I just replaced my broken one.</li>
            <li> dissapointing, not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My hair was thin and shoulder length</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> and it needs to be styled in a sort of poofy way to disguise the fact that it&#x27;s so thin.  </li>
            <li> It is a poor inexpensive replica of the Connair  . .</li>
            <li> I would not buy it if your hair is really thin though.</li>
            <li> It was frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> This product lasted approximately one week before it broke - it will not turn on at all now.  </li>
            <li> I have the world&#x27;s frizziest, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I took 1 star off for the false advertising (rotating barrel, which it is not).</li>
            <li> the bad part is that I&#x27;ve gotten the frigging thing caught- seriously caught at least once</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst thing that has happened to me using any product I bought from any store.</li>
            <li> and I finally wore it out and purchased another brand that I absolutely hated.  </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with my money down the drain.</li>
            <li> AT LEAST ONCE!!</li>
            <li> It sucks!!</li>
            <li> what a waste :(</li>
            <li> in my opinion you can&#x27;t go wrong with this company.</li>
            <li> It does not curl well, and it&#x27;s difficult to get volume out of this.  </li>
            <li> It was so difficult to pull the styler out and my hair ended up getting tangled in it.  </li>
            <li> but a couple years ago it sadly gave out on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also gives off a nasty off-gassing smell even after using it multiple times.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I didn&#x27;t like this wand from the moment I opened the package.  </li>
            <li> and I was unable to find it in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> the bottom of the handle) with a toothpick every couple of months the unit will overheat and the motor fails.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with this baby.</li>
            <li> I was actually skeptical when I received this, but tried it anyway.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s useless to me with carpal tunnel syndrome.  </li>
            <li> I must have done something wrong because this was a disaster.</li>
            <li> My hair is notorious for tangling if someone even looks at it wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately within a&lt;br /&gt;Couple weeks of use the heating element stopped working.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we have purchased a number of these since they stop working after about a year.</li>
            <li> it is USELESS.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong size so will not be keeping this</li>
            <li> Its just useless it does not even heat up</li>
            <li> I called the company to find out whether they were both defective or if the description was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Therefore I am unable to use it.</li>
            <li> just a useless ornament.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this thing did not work at all.  </li>
            <li> Have been unable to find what I want in this item</li>
            <li> , then silly me decided to curl my hair around the brush the way it was intended to be used.</li>
            <li> Boy I was wrong.</li>
            <li> THE WORSE EVER !</li>
            <li> Worst thing I&#x27;ve ever spent money on!</li>
            <li> I would call it a cold air brush.</li>
            <li> eventually it will start cutting off when it overheats and that is when I have to order another one.</li>
            <li> I would have returned, but it comes in that horrible clamshell packaging that I had to destroy upon opening, so I didn&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I find this tool a bit awkward to work with.  </li>
            <li> I bought an adaptor to use, it kept cutting out so</li>
            <li> I had bought one about 5 years ago at a department store, and when it broke one morning I was so unhappy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m the awkward stages.</li>
            <li> This is a dangerous product and should be removed from the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to try it again.</li>
            <li> I was so wrong!</li>
            <li> makes it very difficult to have both my arms up to \\&quot;style and blow</li>
            <li> With this styler/dryer it is almost impossible for me to heat damage my hair</li>
            <li> Oops, my bad, it just overheated.  </li>
            <li> Bad bad quality</li>
            <li> Bad.</li>
            <li> but as the song goes &#x27;two out of three aint bad&#x27;.</li>
            <li> so bad</li>
            <li> Its bad quality .</li>
            <li> This is a bad brush because the brush does not stay hooked in the slots when you curl your hair...</li>
            <li> But getting your hair in the brush without it spinning is bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never written a bad review in Amazon before</li>
            <li> it is too bad</li>
            <li> and sometimes when it does it gets tangled and is painful to unwind.</li>
            <li> The air smelled and it made me sick.</li>
            <li> Hate the ones that have a THIN wire brushs on the roller there the worst...</li>
            <li> Very, very annoying to say the least!!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the performance of this hair tool.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed I was under the belief that the wand rotates which it does not.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, I bought another one.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and then I have to work to get it out.  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Totally disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed it did not have temperature control</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I Hate the ones like revlon-</li>
            <li> Annoying, and not at all what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> This brush/dryer helps make it presentable through my awkward awful hair stage.</li>
            <li> I have hundreds of dollars in my drawer of worthless, damaging hair styling tools that damage my hair and cause it to frizz.</li>
            <li> I would hate to go through that again.  </li>
            <li> and I hate it.  </li>
            <li> It is crap in my opinion and as a Salon owner, it could not be used in the Salon or at home.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed !</li>
            <li> So very disappointed.</li>
            <li> was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> but I am very disappointed not to have a rotating brush.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> am very disappointed</li>
            <li> The brush is like a plastic material which is horrible for styling the hair.</li>
            <li> the worst...</li>
            <li> Terrible...</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
            <li> The smell was terrible.</li>
            <li> If you try to use this for root lift or volume, it gets horribly tangled.</li>
            <li> The worst  dryer I bought</li>
            <li> Horrible product!</li>
            <li> When I turned it on it gave off a horrible burning smell.  </li>
            <li> This tool is the worst!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair appliance I have ever used.</li>
            <li> awful and then fell apart getting it out of my hair</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product. Can&#x27;t find it in stores around here. I always keep an extra one around.</li>
            <li> My wife always want this product (1 inch dia.) which it is not sold anymore in Canada.</li>
            <li> Wish I could give it a lower rating because I haven&#x27;t been able to use it once. as soon as it turns on and gets going it releases a really strong burnt smell and just shuts off. The brush is like a plastic material which is horrible for styling the hair. Worst thing I&#x27;ve ever spent money on!</li>
            <li> Love it..this is the second one I bought and it is easy to use for just my bangs and sides</li>
            <li> It is doing a great job</li>
            <li> These are my fav!  I used to buy them at Walmart, but they no longer sell them.  Thanks for making them available for me!</li>
            <li> I thought of returning it because I never use it since I bought it. So, I decided to use today, I was happy to give it a try.  I dried my hair and have some loose curls as well</li>
            <li> I would like to give 5 stars because I liked it so much but after few months of using it works only few minutes and stops. I need to buy a new styler. I can recommend this one only to somebody who is willing to buy a new one every half year.</li>
            <li> No complaints.  Chose this one since I had had such good experience with the previous one.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  It&#x27;s too difficult for me to hold the round brush and dryer at the same time and this solves the problem.  My hair is short and fine and this gives it a very smooth and healthy look.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t find this product in stores ,I have one or two in reserve, one for home, one for travel, and one for just in case. I have naturally curly hair and it helps to tame it down to manageable  soft curls.</li>
            <li> Am very happy with this item.</li>
            <li> Great value and excellent tool for your hair!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, styles well, but if you have thin hair than it&#x27;s better to pay more and buy smth with more options. it easily gets hot...which is not good for the hair. But again - for the price amazon offers -no complaints.</li>
            <li> My old vidal sasoon hot air brush overheated and the connecting parts of the brush melted off. I was happy with the results of it on my hair up until this point though. It was hot enough to straighten (like getting a good blowdrying at the hairdressers, I notice they always use a very hot setting on the hairdryer and it works great on my hair) and give volume to my hair. This one I was skeptical of because it was much cheaper than my old one and of course it did not work. I knew it wouldnt the minute it was switched on the air was barely lukewarm and not very strong. I would call it a cold air brush. I cant find the other one anywhere in the shops.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for !!!</li>
            <li> Okay, it has a smell like mildew, but I can get past that. This will dry your hair quickly and allow you some styling ability. It will not smooth your hair like an InStyler or similar heat straightener. My hair is straight but will get fuzzy sometimes with humidity. I have not yet used this as the sole styler. When I use it, I have to follow with the InStyler to smooth it. Having said that, it is not a bad product. It does not tangle the hair and is easy to use. It is inexpensive enough that if you don&#x27;t like it or don&#x27;t use it daily, you are not out much money. It is not a bad product, but not a great one either.</li>
            <li> local stores carry only the HUGE items&lt;br /&gt;lightweight&lt;br /&gt;does the job&lt;br /&gt;price was workable&lt;br /&gt;would recommend for home use&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, to replace an old one that died... same model, etc.  Was unable to find it locally, so very glad Amazon still carries this one.</li>
            <li> The best thing I like is that it doesn&#x27;t pull you hair. The release button allows the brush to release your curl easily.when you want it to. It has settings permitting a lower heat so fine hair isn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
            <li> Not only did this product not do anything beneficial, it actually made my hair look worse than if I had used a blowdryer and brush.  It has no power and was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE 2ND ONE I HAVE HAD OF THIS BRAND - I USE IT MAINLY TO STRAIGHTEN MY BANGS - MY HAIR IS WAY TOO THICK TO USE AS A DRYER - WORKS WELL</li>
            <li> This styling brush is a bit underpowered, but the far bigger problem is that the bristles are so far apart from one another hair just falls off of it!  Unless you have a LOT of long, thick hair, this tool won&#x27;t work, and if you have thick hair, I&#x27;d expect the weak heat/fan would be a problem.  Double or triple bristles and the hair could actually stay on the brush, but as is, it just falls flat.</li>
            <li> The best Hot Air Brush</li>
            <li> Our Walmart in this area, seemingly cannot stay stocked with this item, especially around the holidays...so I come right to Amazon which always has this product. As usual it is a gift for someone else, I am happy that I could get it for her, as she is in getting it. As for the tax applied, just about equals the gas in the round trip from the store to back home, so-why not. This year I have done 95% of my Christmas shopping online and probably 50% of it through Amazon...in my opinion you can&#x27;t go wrong with this company.</li>
            <li> Best if yer not hair stylist!</li>
            <li> this item is hard to find I have an old one that has several years of use on it  this is the only styler I use and was happy to purchase two more at a great price.  the seller was quick to send I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the order</li>
            <li> This Vidal Sasson Hot Air Brush stopped working right at 60 days.  It sounds like a loose wire due to the intermittent start &amp; stop action while using the brush.  Unfortunately, it is a sealed system, so it cannot be opened to inspect for loose wires.  This brand name appliance should last longer than two months.  Bought from Amazon, who has a 30-day return policy, which leaves us without recourse.  This Hot Air Brush is not worth buying. I would give it no stars, but the system only allows feedback of 1-5 stars.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a Vidal Sasson hot hair brush many years ago from a chain store and was very satisfied with it.  I was dismayed to find out stores in our area no longer carry this type of styler and dryer. I was glad to find it on amazon and it arrived and I am so happy with it once agaain. It is the easiest way for drying and styling my hair with no fuss. I plan on ordeing a few more to keep in my gym bag and travel bag.  I highly recommend this hot air brush and styler.</li>
            <li> Love this hot air brush! I&#x27;ve used this product for over five years.  When my local stores stopped carrying this model, I was elated to find that Amazon had it.  It works great on my above-the-shoulder, fine hair!</li>
            <li> Vidal Sasson VS433C Hot Air Brush and Styler broke 5 days after the return policy would have given a refund, before that I really loved it.  Oops, my bad, it just overheated.  It&#x27;s fine now since it cooled down.  Sorry, I have such thick hair!</li>
            <li> This was great while it worked. Unfortunately, it burned out in less than two months. I had read numerous reviews of this and similar products reporting that they didn&#x27;t last, but I hoped my experience would be different. Alas, it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have ordered 4 of these and will continue to order more, they are the best!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent it works exactly as is discribed and planed for. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Recommended if you want to easily straighten your hair, or keep it manageable. It&#x27;s easier and simpler than using a blow dryer and brush.  NOT recommended if you want volume or curl.  Also not recommended if you like to dry your hair completely.  It does not curl well, and it&#x27;s difficult to get volume out of this.  Also it&#x27;s going to take at least twice as long to dry your hair completely because of low output.</li>
            <li> I only used it once and it didn&#x27;t work as described...my hair is short maybe that&#x27;s why but I find that a regular hair dryer does a better job</li>
            <li> I like this styling brush better than any other that I&#x27;ve been able to purchase. It fits my needs exceptionally.</li>
            <li> I have never used a hot air brush before, so I cannot compare this to others on the market.  That being said, I bought one because I have thick hair that I get tired of blow drying and then flat ironing. I hoped this might combine the two tasks.  I am finding that it works very well.  After washing my hair and towel drying, I blow dry it until its just barely damp.  Then I use this brush to finish drying and smoothing it. I find that I don&#x27;t need the flat iron if I use this brush. I also find it very relaxing to just sit on the couch while I use this hot air brush to finish drying and smoothing my hair. Its very lightweight and so much easier to maneuver than a heavy blow dryer and brush.  It doesn&#x27;t really save me any time, as my hair is just below bra-strap length and quite thick, but by combining the brush with the dryer, it is easier to smooth the hair and is also less work.  Its also really easy to clean. You just unscrew the end and then pull the brush off. I squirt foaming hand soap on the brush and then scrub it with a tooth brush to get all the bristles clean.  For the price, I think this is a great product and I feel it has made drying my hair less of a hassle even though not exactly less time spent on the process.</li>
            <li> Here is the rundown.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short Hair- Perfect&lt;br /&gt;Medium Hair- Ok&lt;br /&gt;Long Hair- Doable&lt;br /&gt;Straight Hair- Perfect&lt;br /&gt;Curly Hair- Not a chance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have long, very straight hair and purchased this as an alternative to a curling iron to curl the ends of my hair under. (FYI- I am not good at using a round brush with a hairdryer).  Warm air does blow through the bristles, but by no means is this a replacement for a hair dryer.  You need to use this on slightly damp to dry hair otherwise you&#x27;ll be working on your hair all day.  Even on the warmest setting the air isn&#x27;t very hot.  I can keep my hand over the barrel to hold my hair and it is not hot to the touch (which is a good thing in my opinion).  So I thought, hey- maybe this can give a little volume to my roots.  So I put the bristles on my crown just under the roots, not wrapping the hair around it at all.  Well, BIG mistake.  It was so difficult to pull the styler out and my hair ended up getting tangled in it.  I was able to free my hair after some time and patience, but it was not easy.  DO NOT ROLL UP YOUR HAIR OR PUT THIS BY YOUR ROOTS IF YOU HAVE MEDIUM TO LONG HAIR!  I would say it would be ok for short hair.  I don&#x27;t think this product would be good for curly hair.  I think that it will just make it frizzy looking.</li>
            <li> The width of the barrel should have been mentioned.</li>
            <li> If you are good with your hands, it helps a litte bit. It does not entangle my fine hair, but the curls come up quite lose, and do not last long.</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted. Works quickly and well.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser, bless her heart, who is my friend as well as my hairdresser, gave me this hot air brush.  I love it.  Now I want to buy another one.  I highly recommend it.  It is the best.  I would highly recommend it for people like me who have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand-name Hot AIR Brush for several years and was disappointed to no longer to be able to purchase it at my usual source locally. I was delighted to find it on Amazon.com and bought TWO, a one-inch barrel and a 1 and 1/2 inch barrel and by the way, the barrels are inter-changeable. I find it to be an XLNT product!!</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these styling brushes about 2 years ago at Wal-mart. Went back. None. Looked in many different popular stores. Nowhere to be found. It is exactly the right size for my medium layered hair length. I blow dry for about 4 minutes with a Sasoon ion dryer, then style with this brush. Takes about 10 minutes. Love, love, love it. Tried Conair &amp; Revlon. Too big and not enough heat/air. I bought 2 this time so I wouldn&#x27;t have to hunt all over when one died. Lasts about 2 years for me. Why isn&#x27;t this model still available in stores? Oh well, with 2, shipping is free here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this brush/styler every day.  I cannot find another styler/brush that I like as much as I like this one.  I&#x27;ve gone through 3 of these over the last 10 years.</li>
            <li> I love this hot air curling brush&lt;br /&gt;Mine finally stopped working and I was thrilled to find another&lt;br /&gt;on Amazon.  It blows hot air while giving a soft curl,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very straight hair and need this kind of hot air brush&lt;br /&gt;for styling......I love it</li>
            <li> Love this and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and Amazon is the best place to shop for this tyhpe of product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve used a hot air brush - much harder to use than I remembered, tangles a lot and takes forever. I tried mostly drying my hair with the regular dryer then using this but still little luck.</li>
            <li> The product (Vidal Sasson VS433C Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush)is exactly as described.  I have been using this brush for many years.  It is one of the few hair appliances that does what I need. It is NOT a curling iron - It blows hot air while you wrap your hair around it to make curls. I always buy 2 at a time so I have a spare - NEVER want to be without it.  It makes hair styling quick and easy!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years!  My old one was beginning to slow down, so I thought it wise to have another one on hand.  I could not find it in any of our local drug stores or mega marts.  It is wonderful for me and my fine hair.  [[ASIN:B000PY17PI Vidal Sasson VS433C Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer, 1 Inch]]  For me it&#x27;s a 5 star product that I highly endorse!  Diane, Texas</li>
            <li> This is the third one I have purchased in 20-25 years. When you use something every day they have to be replaced every so often. I tried other brands and they cannot match the performance of this one. Purchasing from Amazon is the best way to purchase since it is hard to find in the stores and its mailed right to you.</li>
            <li> I have used something like this before, but i really like this one. My hair is very curly, so I use this after using the blow dryer with the round brush to smooth it out. I&#x27;ve also used it after letting my hair  air dry and when it&#x27;s almost dry I use it to help smooth out my curls. You don&#x27;t want to use this on really wet hair, it doesn&#x27;t work. It would take you an hour to dry your hair, so just use it more for smoothing your curls.</li>
            <li> This is the only hot air brush that works on my baby-fine hair.  I was so disappointed when local retail stires quit stocking it.  I tried other brands with no success.</li>
            <li> really like the way this allows me to dry and style my hair at the same time</li>
            <li> Bought it almost 2 years ago. Still works faithfully for me and I probably use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reviews -- I&#x27;ve used the Revlon and Conair Hot Air Brush for YEARS and LOVE how they work. But this one is SUPER weak and feels like something purchased at the Dollar Store. Seriously a piece of crap, I can&#x27;t believe Vidal Sasson actually put their name on this garbage!    RETURN!</li>
            <li> Glad  to see it&#x27;s still available to purchase. Goes to show the quality. I still own mine, and it&#x27;s still operational after three years. Great item.</li>
            <li> This product is not very good for styling. Good for drying your hair but does nothing for styling.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years; love it, but can&#x27;t find it in the stores. Arrived in a very timely manner. good service</li>
            <li> Works well for my short hair!</li>
            <li> Love this product. So easy to use. Uniform heat all over. Curl lasts along time. It is great for straighting hair as well as giving it body.</li>
            <li> Everyone was raving about this product so I was excited about getting it and was really disappointed with what I got. The dryer is really weak and it smells like plastic when it&#x27;s on. It is definitely not up to par with what it claims to be. If I hadn&#x27;t opened it the packaging, I probably would return it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, and just the right size brush... I prefer the stiff brush for my hair... I have had several Helen of Troy dryers, but they are sooo expensive... This one is very reasonable in price, and works exactly the same... Actually, it&#x27;s identical except for price and color... I bought two just in case.......</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, this brush attachment grabs the hair, curls it and holds the style. My hair slides through the other bristle types leaving my hair straight and fly-away.   My only problem with this brush is it has a very short lifespan. After a few months it begins to overheat. I really like this product and hope this problem can be resolved. I can&#x27;t seem to find it in any of the stores and glad I found it on your site. i would have many bad hair days without it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother who has short and thinning hair. She is very picky in general so if she LOVES this it must be great! :)</li>
            <li> I had one that quit running, I was so happy when I looked and found the same one, I really like this dryed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for this specific brush and finally found it on amazon. It&#x27;s the exact model I had and the only one I would buy. This is great for anyone with fine hair because it doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the barrel because they are plastic bristles.</li>
            <li> Great to curl thin straight hair.  The only problem is that it gets hot and shuts off.  Then I must wait 5 minutes before it will restart and I can finish styling. Straight hair may be in for some but for those of us who have straight, flat hair and need a bit of lift, this really does a good job. It dries and soft curls at the same time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who thought of a hot air brush styler, but they deserve awards.  It is so easy to use and performs perfectly!  I love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  It is the only tool that I use for my hair.  It does everything and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> The brush works as advertised, however, it is not for every kind of hair. I have very straight, very fine hair. I usually dry it with a round brush and a blow dryer so I was excited to try this. The problem, if you have my kind of hair, is that the bristles are simply too far apart and the hair slides right off. It didn&#x27;t add any volume and actually gave me worst results than my regular tight bristle round brush. I gave it to my mom who has a thicker hair and she likes it. I still like the idea but I&#x27;ll buy a different model to better suit my hair type.</li>
            <li> I love this hair styling too but it is getting more and more difficult to find.  I am so glad to find it available through Amazon.  Price was very good.  Delivery was quick.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love these hot air brushes. just wish they would not burn out so quickly. but I still love them.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the performance of this hair tool.  I had an old Vidal Sasson appliance and hoped it would at least match the performance, but  it doesn&#x27;t.  More money down the drain.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and was delighted to find them  on Amazon.  But they must have been packed away in a ship hold  somewhere before retailing as I have had two now that had the same strong smell of  mildew in their air output when 1st using them.  This has largely dissapated over time but causes me to rate a VERY useful tool with three stars.  2nd review - more than a year later! - Just bought two more of these through Amazon.  I can&#x27;t believe the smell that was there in the first order over a year ago is present in  my brand new brushes.  VERY STRONG MILDEW smell that infuses my hair/the whole room with that odor.  I&#x27;m seriously thinking of returning them.  Boo hoo! because it&#x27;s a great tool otherwise.</li>
            <li> I love this Hot Air Brush. It gets hot enough to style hair quickly without being too hot to handle. Quiet and efficient... really a great product!</li>
            <li> Fabulous tool for perfect styling. I am delighted with this tool. It is light weight, easy to manage, does what it claims, and has changed my morning routine. I used to just comb and hope. Now I spritz with a tiny mist and use the blow/brush to style. It takes less time than my prior method and looks terrific. No complaints on any factor.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and brushes with bristles pull and break hair.  The soft rubber bristles give me Soft curls that last all day.</li>
            <li> it takes long to dry my hair</li>
            <li> I have used this hot brush for years, replacing it when necessary.  I never even consider any other brand.  It is inexpensive and is a quality only found in much more expensive styling brush.  I will continue using this brush as long as I can find it.  The last time I needed a replacement I spent a lot of time looking for it so this time my first search was on Amazon and to my delight there it was.  I hope Vidal Sassoon will continue to make this great hot brush available.</li>
            <li> This has lasted longer than any other I have used.  I will be back for another at some point.</li>
            <li> this product is very poor because it hardly blows any hot air so styling is a zero. I can not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> Have used this styling brush for years and love it, but wasn&#x27;t able to find it at a local store where I usually purchase it. Great product for styling short to medium length hair.   Was happy to locate them at Amazon.com and received it quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for my first one which lasted many years. Looks and performs like the old one. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I can dry and curl my hair with ease. No tangles, no mess. I saw this at a friends place and wanted the same brand and I found it here.</li>
            <li> have used Vidal Sasson in the past and the products always gave good results.  the 1 inch barrel is a bit bigger than I needed, but works out.  Long hair may get tangled up, so it&#x27;s better for short to medium length hair. I have bought this item for less, but was unable to find it in my local stores, therefore I purchased it on-line</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and straight and looks like a porcupine stuck it&#x27;s finger in a light socket without taking a curler to it and being able to blow-dry at the same time is nice especially when I travel. No maker has ever been able to replace a curling iron and blow drier but this is better than the others I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. So much that I bought one to leave at my yearly travel destination and a spare at home for the day my first finally gives out.</li>
            <li> IF you want more body in your hair, this is the tool you need. There are so many ways you can use it, whether you want to straighten your hair, give it curl, or just give it lift at the roots!  It has two temp. controls and two fan speeds.  I always use the high fan speed because I have super thick hair but it&#x27;s great!  If you like to do your own hair, give this a try.  No curling iron needed!  Thank you Amazon for making this product available!  I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores! Great price too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who has very fine blond hair quite thin for a woman only in her 60s so she was not happy to see hair in the brush. I tried it with my med long blond hair and it got tangled and I had anxiety and lost hair as family members actually had to help me get it out. I re read the instructions and just don&#x27;t see with long hair what keeps it from tangling, the release doesn&#x27;t if a little hair has flipped over the end during the roll. It was great for my bangs and ends! Might give it to my mom in law with thick shortish hair.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at walmart.  It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t automatically spin. I have a longer pixie style and it works ok for me but I&#x27;m not really happy with it. Maybe it would work better with little longer hair. I can&#x27;t make my mind up if I&#x27;m going to take it back. Online at walmart for $ 12.00 home delivery with other items. Better luck than me!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have curly/wavy hair that is wild if I don&#x27;t tame it.  I usually air dry my hair until it is almost dry and then finish styling it with this product.  The curls and waves hold beautifully.  If my hair dries to much, i just brush through it briefly with a damp brush and then style.  I have never owned a hairstyling product I liked better.  However, it does overheat easily and turn off which is a real hassle if you are in a hurry to go somewhere.  I liked someone&#x27;s suggestion of buying two.  I can no longer find this product at my local department stores, so am happy to find it still available at Amazon.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush styler and dryer is perfect for doing my hair.  I can&#x27;t imagine how hard it would be to style my hair without this.  In just a couple of minutes my medium length hair is dry and styled.  I bought two as I can&#x27;t find these in the local stores.  Try it, I feel sure you will like it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> works like it says...</li>
            <li> I loved this tool. It really made styling my long thick hair easier, but it breaks in about three-four months. I bought a second one, and that brook in two months. I use it three times a week, and my hair is shoulder length. It really should last longer than this!</li>
            <li> Hair gets stuck in the brush</li>
            <li> I have been using this Hot Air Brush (this is my third one) years.</li>
            <li> This works well for my short hair.  It smells when you first use it, but after a few times, it goes away.  Doesn&#x27;t get too hot, so it won&#x27;t burn your head or ears.</li>
            <li> Based on other ratings I thought this would be great for my hair but unfortunately it did absolutely nothing and I have decided to stick to the curling iron.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this style hot air bruch for over 10 years and she has always been very pleased with the product. So much so that when she replaced it she order two in order to have a backup. Excellent product</li>
            <li> I have long hair. After drying my hair a bit I use this air brush to straighten my hair. It does the job, takes a bit longer than I would like which might be due to the strength of the power. For this low price I&#x27;m pleased with the results it delivers.</li>
            <li> Does not heat well at all. I purchased this because my hair is now very short and my other hot air brush is too large to use.  But since this unit does not heat well enough to style my hair, it is totally useless to me. So very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product does just what it is supposed to do. It is good value for the money It has been replaced every five years or so but is used every day. Will continue to buy the same item as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> Its THE best out there...YES&amp;lt; YES&amp;lt; YES... IT DOES WORK!!!!! OMG---...its the best out there--trust me ive tried all of the hot air brushes, i know what iam talking about!!!!!!......I have thick wavey hair, this is easy to use, it smooths out my hair , ive tryed alot of stuff, But flat irons dont do like this does!...&lt;br /&gt;I THINK MEN MAKE THOSE OTHER HOT AIR BRUSHES, they dont know what there doing!!!.......-- I swear ...lol....&lt;br /&gt;I Hate the ones that have a THIN wire brushs on the roller there the worst...THERE A JOKE!!! and there are some that wont even grab your hair to smooth it out, there a joke, and I Hate the ones like revlon- they make the handles sooo big with a big long handles...Its hard enough to deal w/ the handle before u can even deal w/ the brush and focus on smoothing out your hair...-there the worst...You have to have the teeth hard enough and long enough to grab your hair....I suggest the 1 inch instead of the 3/4 inch...it works the best!!!!!!....&lt;br /&gt;Iam telling you !!!!.......On the other hot air brushes you cant even get your hair in some of these hot air brushes to do what u want to do on some hot air brushes...TRUST ME!!!.....&lt;br /&gt;THIS HOT AIR BRUSH IT THE BEST OUT THERE!!!!........&lt;br /&gt;.....PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE---DONT STOP MAKING THIS...OK!!!!!!! THXS</li>
            <li> Great. Does not tangle hair when using it.</li>
            <li> It says \\&quot;rotating\\&quot; right on the package, but the only way it would \\&quot;rotate\\&quot; is by manually turning it around and around.  Annoying, and not at all what I was looking for.  If you&#x27;re looking for one that rotates for you this is not the one.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it rotated while using. Also not a strong hair dryer. Takes a while to dry my medium thick hair.</li>
            <li> Buying another, although my first one is still working.  I just want to have another on hand...makes it easier for travel to just keep one in my train case. This is a great styling brush and the price is excellent.  It will not deafen you as others I have tried, which the flipside of that is that it is not super powerful.  This is meant for finishing the style on your 75% dried hair or for touching up already dried hair.  It is easy to handle, lightweight, and my hair (slightly longer than chin-length) has never tangled in it.  I tried another hot air brush with higher wattage and could barely get my hand around the handle.  Just use the higher setting on this one and spend a few more minutes and you&#x27;ll get the same result -- worth it as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help me style my hair after arm surgery.  This is not a high end product but it gets the job done if your hair is already mostly dry.  It does not replace your blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It is always nice to buy a product that actually performs as advertised.  My wife had a previous unit that lasted &gt;10 years before becoming inoperable.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is as described. I think I&#x27;m going to enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> It was not what I thought it was. It was smaller than the previous one I purchased &amp; it tangles your hair. The 1st one I purchased was 1 1/2 inch but when I contacted you again it was not available.</li>
            <li> This is a necessary item in my house.  I can not manage both the hair dryer and a brush to turn my bobbed hair under.  Without this it just sticks out like a rag doll.  I could no longer find it in the stores here, so I went on an internet quest.  After a while it wears out and I need a new one.  I use it every day.  I don&#x27;t know what I will do if they stop making it.  I have used this for about 6 years.</li>
            <li> Use this one for years.  Perfect for my hair and lasts well too.  Don&#x27;t know what I will do if they discontinue it completely.  The rubber grips my hair good for a nice roll.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for my shortish fine hair.  It is dried and curled a bit all in one move.  In fact, over the years I have owned several Vidal Sasson dryers of this type.  If it matters to you, they are great when one has a shoulder injury or ache.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.works great.I have bought this in the past and needed a new one.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to having this item, to shorten my \\&quot;ready\\&quot; time, as my hair is thick and takes a long time to dry.  It worked great the first time I used it, although it did have a mildew smell.  When I plugged it in the second time, it was totally dead.  It never worked again, and it wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back.  Beware....................</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use a brush and a blowing at the same time so this is the greatest product for my short hair. I just love it! And I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.com you saved my life and my hair! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Its just what I have been looking for!!  Prior to this I had a conair hot brush (white handle with purple plastic barrel) that I used foryears and loved it...but a couple years ago it sadly gave out on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent a few years and quite a few dollars trying to find a replacement as Conair doesn&#x27;t make this kind any more...and FINALLY I have found it! I like the barrel because it&#x27;s plastic and I like the size...I was either finding them too small or too big...and this one is just right!! Yeah!!</li>
            <li> I like this hot air brush enough that I keep an extra one on hand. Have used this style for many years. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, did not work well in my short hair, gave it to my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> I am not thrilled but it is about what I expected. . .Good for the price  My hair is very short</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.  I have a torn rotator cuff and cannot hold my arm high enough to hold a regular iron long enough to make a nice curl.  It&#x27;s light weight and gives a nice soft curl to short hair.  I wish it came with a 3/4 inch barrel.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work at all. don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> This is the third or fourth one of these brushes I have purchased. I love them while they&#x27;re working, but after a few months they start shutting down after a few minutes. The time they are running gets shorter and shorter until now I&#x27;ve only got 45 seconds to get my hair done (unless I want to wait another 10 minutes for it to cool down.) So--even though they don&#x27;t last--I&#x27;m ordering another one. They are just right for my short permed hair. Other stores don&#x27;t seem to be stocking them anymore so I&#x27;m happy to have found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time. Never even worked.</li>
            <li> I had purchasd this hair dryer from Walmart three (3) years ago and it broke.  They no longer carry it and I had been looking at Target, Kmart and other stores for over a year.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon for a cheaper price than I had paid for it three (3) years ago.  The hair dryer came quickly and was packaged well.  Thanks again Amazon for finding the unfindable.</li>
            <li> This item is great.  There is no metal to fry your hair and your hair will curl with ease with warm air rather that hot metal.  Holds in your hand great.  From experience, because I have used these a long time, they do not make it through the warranty.</li>
            <li> Have used this hot air brush for years and love it.  Tames my hair to how I want it, not what it wants to do!  In the past they have had dual voltage (120 &amp;amp; 240)and been great for travelling over seas.  This one does not advertise that, but I hope it still does have dual voltage. My last dryer just died after 5 or 6 years.  I bought a Conair to replace it, but it almost pulls my hair out.  Have just thought to check the internet, and soo glad I did.  Vidal&#x27;s dryer is the best.</li>
            <li> This is light enough to keep at work for those times when your hair needs a little help.  It works pretty much as other&#x27;s reviews said; definitely not for thick hair or for completely drying your hair.  But the big plus is that it&#x27;s very lightweight</li>
            <li> The reason for me needing to return this brush is that the plug does not fit in to any standard electrical outlets and therefore cannot be used.  Worse than that, I had to pay a return fee for being sold a product made for use outside of the U.S.</li>
            <li> The Vidal Sasson Styler is the only curling iron type hot air dryer type I&#x27;ve been able to find.  It&#x27;s great for giving hair body and for quick styling.</li>
            <li> This product gets as hot as a hot air blower and makes for great loose curls.  Can also double as a straightener - just don&#x27;t curl the ends.  It&#x27;s lightweight too; I purchased 2 to keep one in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> This is my first Vidal Sasson hot air brush that I have owned and I don&#x27;t regret buying it. It is better than I thought is was going to be. It does a great job curling my hair without tangling it and it is affordable. I love it!!</li>
            <li> This is the third time that I have bought this product.  I use it everyday.  This particular model has lasted me the longest.  Other brands and models usually only last a few months, but this model and brand I can get to last at least a couple of years or more.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace one I had of another brand and really do not like this.  It does not slide through my hair nicely and gets tangled easily....my hair is only just below my shoulders.  Guess this is for shorter hair.  I&#x27;m stuck with it though since I had to cut it out of the package.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> it is working the way it should ... very happy with it...</li>
            <li> I ordered it on Amazon after I checked Wal-Mart&#x27;s website. Later I found the exact same item for $10.99 at Wal-Mart store. What a rip off!   Now here is the review for the product. It&#x27;s much simpler and lighter to use this hot air brush than to use a brush and a dryer, although it doesn&#x27;t deliver the same result. It makes the hair kind of fuzzy, not silky because the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; are too far apart. That&#x27;s why I knocked off one star. I have short hair. It makes the hair curve inward and gives it an extra body. Over all it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had long hair for many years and finally decided to cut it all off into a long bob. This brush works great for curling the ends under! I still use a round brush, but is a perfect addition..especially when styling the back. I recommend!</li>
            <li> I have used this model for years and could not find it in the stores anymore.  It straightens and gives body to the hair after I blow dry it.  I keep three - one at home, one at work, and one in the gym bag.</li>
            <li> Being a male with less hair than I had when I was younger I won&#x27;t be rating this product,my wife will. Let it be said that she wasn&#x27;t happy with the product for only one reason. The barrel was 1 inch and she wanted one with a smaller brush because she has short hair----------now how was a guy to know that??? So I sent it back and got her one with a 3/4\\&quot; barrel. That is the reason for only a 3star rating.</li>
            <li> This does work, but I personally believe that the barrel was too small for me. Plus I thought that this rotated but it didn&#x27;t. But I do still use it.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this purchase at all. The power is weak and it gets tangled constantly. I have fine hair that needs curl and body and the time it would take to get this brush to make that happen is twice that of the normal process of a hair dryer and roll brush. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I liked the curlng brush (iron) but whould have liked it to make smaller curls.  A little bigger than I like.  The drying was great</li>
            <li> I really like this product although like others have said it does overheat and if you turn it off you have to wait until it cools to turn it back on. So I just don&#x27;t turn it off. It works great for a few weeks then start to overheat. eventually it will start cutting off when it overheats and that is when I have to order another one. Maybe that is the manufactures way to keep selling them.THis is the best hot air brsh I have found. I can&#x27;t do the bristle type brushes. They just can&#x27;t hold my hair.</li>
            <li> this item is hard to find love it</li>
            <li> Dependable styling tool. I used to curl my hair with electric rollers every day to sort of tame my  curly hair. Basically, Every morning since I was 15 years old I plugged in the curlers, waited for them to heat up, set and wait for it to cool down. When I retired, i started playing around with my hair, I had one of these in the house possibly  for over a year and i hadn&#x27;t used it ( actually I hadn&#x27;t even taken the brush out of it&#x27;s plastic packaging). I started using it and I was astonished how easy it was to get my hair together . It allows me to style my hair very quickly. I wish I started using this when i was working, I  would have saved some time in the morning.  Just bought another one after giving the one I was using to a friend. It is sturdy, well made and inexpensive. This is my second one and I think i am going to purchase some for friends soon.</li>
            <li> I expected more from the Vidal Sassoon name. I really liked this styling tool until it started to over heat and shut off after about 3 minutes. My hair is not thick or long and I have only been using it for about 4 months.</li>
            <li> I have used this hot air brush for years...it is perfect for my hair and style...I hope it never goes put of production.</li>
            <li> It came quickly was well packaged.  I bought it for a spare as I have had my other one just like it for several years and love it!</li>
            <li> I have used one one for many years.  It just started wearing out I had to buy another one.   Don&#x27;t ever want to be without my brush</li>
            <li> Wife liked it. that&#x27;s all that matters............</li>
            <li> I love it. it does my hair the way I wanted. I would definitely recommend it. its the best hairbrush I have had</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have purchased this product four times.  Three purchases were at a retail store and the last purchase was through Amazon, since it was no longer available at any store.  I still have the first brush purchased with some cosmetic issues.  The next three have had critical defects.  Brush #3 had serious electrical issues and quit working after about three months use.  The present brush (purchased through Amazon) also seems to have electrical issues, indicated by static like clicking when in use.  The product works well on my hair and that is why I keep replacing it, however, the product quality has been seriously degraded.</li>
            <li> The brush barrel doesn&#x27;t rotate as I thought it would but it sure helps to dry and style the hairs without entangling it.</li>
            <li> I have used this hot air brush for at least 8yrs and it could be longer.  I liked it so much I bought 3 as a back up. My last one just gave out (and I had not replaced the back up)and so I had to use a regular heating iron or one with brush(not hot air). I HATED THEM - they snarled my hair, too hot, not hot enough and always even with care -tangles.  I looked at the store for the brush I had used without success.  I then checked Amazon- and of course they had them, I should have started there.  I sent for 3 on a Friday and unfortunately that meant no arrival until Tuesday with free shipping.  It was not hard to decide 1 day shipping at quite a cost. On Monday my brushes arrived - on Tuesday I was able to return to easy use of a hot air heating brush. YES I was right to pay shipping - it was well worth it. Not too hot, not too cold, just right and no tangles, though I know if this happened there is a release button to stop the problem. I never thought I would love a hot air brush - I love this one.  I hope that Vidal Sassoon makes this brush for ever - what a difference it makes on your mornings ready for work time. Thank you Amazon and Vidal Sasson - I recommend both of you.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000PY17PI Vidal Sasson VS433C Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer, 1 Inch]]</li>
            <li> Terrible... Bristles broke after one use</li>
            <li> I had this product for several years when it tried to die, but my husband fixed it w/duct tape.  This winter it gave up the ghost so I was on the hunt for another to puff up my short, straight, fine hair.  I looked in all the retail stores, but no one had a medium size barrel w/plastic tips.  There were big and small barrels and there were brush like tips (which can get caught in your hair).  Finally found my faithful product on Amazon and was excited the day it arrived!  I have always used a blow dryer to get most of the water out of my hair and then used this great airstyler to finish it off.  Takes me about 15 min. total.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the positive reviews and the price, but you definitely get what you pay for in this case. This dryer feels really cheap, like there&#x27;s hardly anything going on in the handle (on the positive side, it makes this really light), but it doesn&#x27;t put out a lot of air or heat. It also gives off a nasty off-gassing smell even after using it multiple times. My hair (straight, fine-ish) has also gotten tangled in this as I&#x27;ve tried to release the curl, and not just a little tangled, but ripping-hair-out-by-the-roots tangled. My husband even had to help me get it out of the back of my hair once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The few times I&#x27;ve been able for it to hold and release successfully, it does leave a decent curl/wave on small sections of hair, but it&#x27;s not worth the hassle or the nauseating smell. I would have returned, but it comes in that horrible clamshell packaging that I had to destroy upon opening, so I didn&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many, many years.  My hairdresser recommended it as she uses it in her salon and has for as long as I can remember.  Anytime we found them in the stores, we purchased two, one to use and one as a backup.  when the local stores Walmart and Target stopped selling them, we  panicked.  I found some for us online and bought them.  We couldn&#x27;t be happier. I have two put away for back up and will purchase two more just in case.  i do have to agree that they heat up way too fast and shut off.  that is its only flaw.  now that i have short hair, i don&#x27;t have that problem, but with my longer hair, yes.  my hairdresser uses her blowdryer on cool setting to cool it down faster and it works.  But, overall, I would rather go bald that not have it for styling.</li>
            <li> This tangles in my hair if I am not careful.  There is a handle release but once the hair is partially dry it becomes more difficult to detangle. When my hair is shorter it does okay with the curl but if it gets a little too long (my hair length is to my shoulders) then it does not style well. It does an okay job of drying.  Not the fastest but better than my other hot air brush.</li>
            <li> OK product, hard to get it to grip hair</li>
            <li> NOT tangle free, my hair gets catch up in it and hard to get free. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking all over to replace my old one that stopped working.  I like this model so much I bought 2 this time.  So glad Amazon had it - I trust them.  My order came quickly and at the best price on the web. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush, --as it truly is tangle-free,--works in the air just the way that you work it in with the hair,--AND,--so much safer to use than a hot curling iron.  I will not go back to any other hair brush styler.  I was delighted that I could find it on Amazon!!&lt;br /&gt;I use it on damp hair, --not wet,--just damp.  The hair dries as you work with the curling brush styler.&lt;br /&gt;Now I find that I no longer want to be without it.  I have two of them now, --as I wish to bring one along wherever I travel.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that Amazon continues to carry and stock this item.</li>
            <li> not as well made as the one it&#x27;s replacing ?</li>
            <li> I have used this type of styling brush for a very long time.  It helps give my fine hair a lift and helps take away the frizzy mess that I often get!</li>
            <li> One of the only places I could find this styler.  Just as described.  Good price ?</li>
            <li> Disappointed I was under the belief that the wand rotates which it does not. Difficult to use since you have to keep your arm elevated hard for me to do.</li>
            <li> I bought this last week, thinking for $10.00 and change, if it doesn&#x27;t work, no big deal.  Well, to my surprise it does work.  Better than John Freida&#x27;s brush, which I used to love, but too much use of the brush and the heat over the last six months was causing irritation to my sensitive scalp.  So I didn&#x27;t know what to try, and then - I saw all the positive reviews about this product.  My hair has become thinner with age, and more fine and drier - and it&#x27;s become evident to me that the less I do to my hair, the better.  This dryer/styler with its lower heat is exactly right for me.  I wash my curly, short, ear length bob in the morning, let it air dry as I do whatever needs to be done in the morning (drink coffee, mostly!) and when it&#x27;s damp, I use this brush - no static caused by brush bristles, no scratching the scalp, no irritation, and even tho the wattage is low, my hair dries in just a few minutes with smooth curls and body.  It&#x27;s really very nice, and the right styler for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might mention, too, that it is incredibly lightweight, something that I appreciate now more than ever, and I&#x27;m sure others will too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone with short to medium length, fine to medium fine hair.  I don&#x27;t think those of you with longer fine hair, or medium thickness would have much success with this great little tool, it&#x27;s just not enough power.  But for you others, for 10 or 11 dollars (with Amazon Prime), you ought to give this a try.  I think you&#x27;ll be, like me, surprised and delighted with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years and I have medium-long hair.  I cannot find anything that curls my hair like this hot air styler. I always get compliments on my hair and it is because of this product.  I recently went to 4 stores to find this and they no longer carry this brand in stores.  Thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite styling brush and I can&#x27;t find it in any of the stores anymore.  The barrel is the&lt;br /&gt;perfect size and it grips the hair without tearing it.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer to dry my hair but when I finished I could have walked out the door, no curling iron.  I used some spray gel for a little more body because my hair is so fine and when I was done it was shiny, not all dry looking like using a blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend but it does get a little getting used too.  You wrap hair around it and hold for a bit, it does not get really not so you can even put hands on bristles.  I think its sort of similar to the expensive one advertised on TV and it similar to the way you use it, curl, hold for a bit and keep moving on and styling as you go.</li>
            <li> Bad bad quality&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy it !!</li>
            <li> Love using this hot air brush!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair- it&#x27;s just really fine and hard to wrap around the wand... and sometimes when it does it gets tangled and is painful to unwind. But having said that... I love it. I&#x27;m still learning how to use it... but the results are great! Especially for the $15 price tag this this is great!    I would however recommend using a heat protection on your hair.</li>
            <li> This is my second hot air brush. Can&#x27;t live without it.  I have short (semi-wavy)hair and this product gives me lots of lift without being too curly.</li>
            <li> I had a Conair hot air brush that finally quit working after several years and I bought this as a replacement.  I normally air dry my hair and only use the brush dryer on my bangs, so it doesn&#x27;t have to do much.  Sadly, I didn&#x27;t like this wand from the moment I opened the package.  It&#x27;s made of plastic and is very light and cheap feeling.  It&#x27;s like holding a toy from the dollar store.  Upon use, I found the barrel to be too short and the hard plastic bristles tangle and pull my bangs.  Since it&#x27;s entirely plastic, the barrel doesn&#x27;t hold any heat to help with curling.  The amount of air that comes out is ridiculously small and not very hot.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this.  I would&#x27;ve returned it, but due to getting my bangs cut quite short soon after receiving it, I didn&#x27;t use it for a few weeks and missed my return window.  So tonight I&#x27;m ordering the $33 Conair Curling Brush 1.5&amp;#34; Hot Air Dual Voltage from Amazon hoping it&#x27;s a newer model of my old one that died.  This one will be thrown to the back of the cabinet as an emergency back up, given to Goodwill, or beaten to pieces.  It all depends on how much it pulls my hair over the next couple of days it takes for the new one to arrive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spend a lot of time on my hair.  This Product is great.  I use it on dry hair, but you can also use it on wet hair.  I have had 2 of these in the past that I used so much, I burned them out.  I could not find this item in any local store this time.  Thank you Amazon.com.  This was my first experience, and it was great.</li>
            <li> I cannot see this as ANY GOOD for short hair.  A blow dryer does the same thing.</li>
            <li> This item broke when I used it only two times.  Not good quality, and I probably need a larger roll, the brush was kind of flimsy and it would get tangled with my hair.</li>
            <li> I like the concept but it takes forever to dry your hair with it.</li>
            <li> Bad. Hair keeps getting stuck.</li>
            <li> I of course have to use a transformer adapter to use it in New Zealand as the above Conair products but the Air Brush is spasmodic in its output and becomes noisy and turns off.  Too risky to persevere with but as the song goes &#x27;two out of three aint bad&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Was not sure about the size...thought it might be too large, but it works wonderfully.  I also like the fact that the brush is removable for cleaning...great feature!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work that well, and the end is cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom.  She could not find it in the stores anymore.  It is exactly what she wanted.  She has short permed hair so she uses it to dry and style it at the same time.</li>
            <li> I love this air brush. It is the perfect size. Since I am not very good with curling irons this is perfect!</li>
            <li> Please keep this item in your inventory as I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Second time purchased. Particularly useful if limited hair styling skills like me. Gives nice fullness to thinner and fine hair when used with styling product. Easy to pack.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find this item in the store and was glad to find it at Amazon.  I love this product and received it within a few days</li>
            <li> About five years ago I was able to purchase this item in the store and it was a great tool for my hair.  It wore out and I was unable to find it in the stores.  I was thrilled when I saw it on your website.  It was a big life saver for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but I feel obliged to warn people. The very first time I used this, my hair got tangled so badly on the brush right up to the scalp that I thought I would have to shave my hair all off. Thankfully, my friend was able to cut the brush up into little pieces around the hair and save me from having to do that, but I still lost about two fists full of hair. This is by far the worst thing that has happened to me using any product I bought from any store. Just looking at its picture gives me nightmares.</li>
            <li> Finally, a hot air curler with a brush.  I love this product.  I need to buy another one just for a spare in case they quit making this product.  My hair is about 3&#x27;&#x27; long and it&#x27;s perfect.  It wraps and stays around the brush.  Thank you Vidal Sasson!</li>
            <li> My old Conair went out and I couldn&#x27;t find another one, then I saw this and love Vidal, works great!!</li>
            <li> When it works, it&#x27;s great.  However, after some use it quickly gets to the point where it begins to shut off halfway through styling.  That requires you to unplug it and let it cool off for several minutes.  I don&#x27;t have time to wait on the whole process when I&#x27;m getting ready for work, so the last time I bought two to have a spare when that happens.  Of course, they both eventually quit, and I have finally given up and bought a more expensive brand at a local beauty supply shop.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder problems and thought that since this was light-weight it would be easy to use. I was wrong. Went back to using my old one even though it is heavier.</li>
            <li> works well but I prefer the one I already have before I bought this one.</li>
            <li> I have used the Tangle Free Hot Air Bush on my hair for about 10 years.  When I fist started using it I had shoulder length hair.  now have short hair and it still works great for styling and lift.  I keep 2 0n hand at all times.  If you travel a lot, it is compact and weighs less than most hair dryers, and for me it curls better than a curling iron. It comes in 2 different sizes for long or short hair.</li>
            <li> Love the fullness I get</li>
            <li> I had one of these years ago, and finally it gave out.  I tried to find one at other stores in my city, but no one carries them anymore.  I found it here on Amazon, and was so glad.  I got it in record time and used it the day I got it.  It is the best styling brush I have ever used!!  Love it!!  And when this new one wears out, will get me another one..</li>
            <li> Was a waste of money.  Cheaply made and really doesn&#x27;t work.  I have naturally curly hair and the curls didn&#x27;t last two hours.  I have better curls without using this.  I can&#x27;t imagine how it works if you have no natural cur.</li>
            <li> Best hair appliance my wife has had.  Old one apparently gave out and couldn&#x27;t find a replacement in stores.  Amazon to the rescue.  Now she has a spare, as the problem with the old one was clogged vent slots.  Sucking lint out with a vacuum cleaner fixed it.</li>
            <li> Love this Curling Brush, Hard to find curling brush with hot air!!  It makes all the difference. I ordered two as back ups to the one I have now.&lt;br /&gt;When something works , its a wonderful thing !!!</li>
            <li> Unless you have very short, very wispy hair, this hot air brush isn&#x27;t going to do anything for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair and it is short so this airbrush dryer works really well.  I don&#x27;t use it often because I don&#x27;t need to have my hair styled everyday.  Yet, every time I have tried it it has worked well.  Definitely would recommend it if you don&#x27;t have long hair.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I have owned. After several years the first one gave out. The only thing I would like changed would be to add a medium heat. The high is too hot and tow is so cool it doesn&#x27;t get the job done. Other than that I love the product.</li>
            <li> I feel like the bristles don&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; the hair well at all, because they are widely spaced. I do like that they are hard plastic, though, not the hairbrush-style softer kind that can pull and damage delicate, wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the bristles were more tightly spaced, this would be an almost perfect product. As it is, it&#x27;s not really usable for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 15 years. I love it! I need to or a new  one once in a while. They don&#x27;t every\ die, it just gets old and used.</li>
            <li> I have been dependent on the styler for years and can not find it in stores.  The 1 1/2 inch barrel styler is available, but gives me a flat result.  The 3/4 in barrel styler is also available in stores, but gives me too much curl rather than the lift I am looking for.  I use this one everyday and it lasts about a year.  I can wash my hair in the morning and have it dry and styled at the same time in a short amount of time.  I ordered two so that I would have the next one ready to go.</li>
            <li> The brush was too small for my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great! Easy to style bangs!</li>
            <li> I rely on Vidal Sasson&#x27;s hot brushes. Smooth, shiny results.</li>
            <li> Like this curling brush very much.  I&#x27;d like to have one with a smaller brush to curl the shorter hair but this one works very well and isn&#x27;t as loud as my Conair curling brush and the softer brush bristles are more comfortable for the head.  It works very well.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much bigger and heavier than it looks. But the &amp;#34;curl release&amp;#34; feature is the best. I&#x27;ve actually had a curling iron roller stuck to my hair and thought I&#x27;d have to cut my hair off to remove it. It was a nightmare. The release button is a great thing to have. I&#x27;m not too good at using it-I think it takes patience and practice.</li>
            <li> I have 2 of these (3/4\\&quot; and 1.5\\&quot;) and they have the universal problem of shutting off after a curl or two. I used them almost everyday for about 3 years.    I have had many different hair lengths during that period. Mostly I keep my hair long and it&#x27;s always wavy/curly and  very thick.    With this purchase I&#x27;ll have 3 different size brush attachments to use with the styler. In case you never tried to take the brush of one size styler and put it on a different styler, they are interchangeable. It \\&quot;looks\\&quot; like the brush would work on any of the different brands, but I&#x27;m sticking with what I know.    I usually just dry my hair and leave it slightly damp, pin up the top layers and start curling. I guess I&#x27;m lucky to be able to get a great style with misted 2nd day hair and this styler.    I won&#x27;t be using this one as often, so I hope it will last a longer amount of time than the other 2 did. I got my first 2 from the grocery/mart stores. Couldn&#x27;t believe it when I needed to replace them and I couldn&#x27;t find one. Thank you Amazon.com for carrying these.</li>
            <li> I have used a Hot Air Brush for years and found this to be an excellent replacement for a worn out one. I have short, fne hair which I wear in a page.  It leaves my hair full with just the bend I want..  Very good product, I am very satisfied with this make.</li>
            <li> I had one of these years ago and I wore it out.  I could never find another one anywhere so I finally did a Google search and it led me to Amazon.  This styler has the right amount of temperature for hard to manage hair and the rubber brush won&#x27;t burn your scalp or your fingers.  It&#x27;s perfect for my short hairdo.  I can curl and style my hair in a matter of minutes.  It&#x27;s certainly worth the price.</li>
            <li> It dries your hair and adds soft curls (that hold) at the same time. I love it, it&#x27;s my second one I have had the first one for many years.</li>
            <li> THis does what it says for sure. Definitely cuts my routine time in half and gives an awesome finished look.</li>
            <li> I have already had to buy a new one. It did what it was supposed to do but It was not made well.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this airbrush. This is my second one in 10 years.  I find it really speeds up my hair routine. I blow dry my hair  With my regular dryer, until it&#x27;s about 90% dry. I then use this little wonder to give my hair the nice body and style that I want.  I cant understand why there would not  be better reviews for this. Perhaps people don&#x27;t know how to use it properly. If you&#x27;re trying to dry sopping wet hair with this you&#x27;re not gonna be happy. This is to style hair after it&#x27;s almost dry.  I&#x27;m going to buy an extra one in case they ever stop making this. This is a must-have for me.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it would do! Not happy with this product!&lt;br /&gt;I should have kept the packaging to send back!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  This hot air brush left my hair frizzy.  Didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I would return it except the shipping would be almost as much as the item itself.  Do not recommend at all.</li>
            <li> I normally love Vidal Sassoon hair appliances - in fact, they&#x27;re the only brand I&#x27;ve found that can tame my thick, frizzy hair and make it smooth, soft and frizz-free. However I found this brush/dryer combo to be subpar compared to other Vidal Sassoon products. The first time I used it, I had air-dried my hair for 45 min so that it was mildly damp but it was inefficient at drying and ineffective at curling altogether. The second time, I air-dried my hair for over 1.5 hours until it was nearly dry before using it and it still took over 30-40 min to fully dry and several run throughs for the curls to hold. The bristles on the brush itself are made of plastic, which was rough on my hair, and the large spaces in between each bristle make it difficult for the brush to hold onto my hair. My hair got tangled several times. There is a curl release button, which is great, but it didn&#x27;t work every time so I had to turn it off and pull the brush off the applicator to untangle. The handle seems alright but the motor is weak- the high setting would be a low on hair dryers, which doesn&#x27;t cut it with hair as thick as mine&#x27;s. I&#x27;m disappointed because I normally love VS products. If anyone has any tips on how to better use this brush, please let me know! Otherwise, people with thick, frizzy hair might want to consider another product.</li>
            <li> It is very practical, easy to use and curl the hair in a blink. Detangles your hair while styling&lt;br /&gt;An excelllent  product</li>
            <li> Not hot enough and doesn&#x27;t  work for short hair at all.</li>
            <li> I had another product similar to this for years and years and it finally broke.  I was so afraid I would not be able to replace it but I lucked out and found this on Amazon.  It is the perfect product for me - it styles great you can use it wet or dry!  Love it.</li>
            <li> I had given up on finding a styling brush that wouldn&#x27;t burn my gray hair which is very fine and nearly impossible to curl.  Glad I found this one.  I&#x27;m elderly, with Fibromyalgia and this one is very light weight, and easy for me to manage.  Takes only a little while and my hair looks better than it has in several years.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of hot air brush before and I like how easy it is to use and it gives enough curls where I want them.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I had one and it broke after several yrs of everyday use.  Couldn&#x27;t find one like it in the stores but found it on Amazon, thank goodness!!!  I have had this one for 3 yrs and its going strong.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery.  Does the job.  Doesn&#x27;t get overly hot</li>
            <li> I want to use it in China. But I didn&#x27;t make clear the elctric power before I order it. Well, it&#x27;s still a good thing.</li>
            <li> I get perms as needed and these are great to dry my hair and keep the curls from looking frizzy. After I shampoo, I use my favorite conditioner. I use them in the same direction that I would put hair rollers in.  These dry and tame the curl at the same time.  I do use a regular hand held dryer to get some of the wetness out before using the curling  brush.  Love them!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> Really like this item.  I have used the exact same Hot Air Brush Styler for a long time and bought this one as a replacement.  I like the concept of adding body and slight curl as I dry my hair.  My purchase through Amazon was a great deal and I have a great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hot air brush dryer after seeing the commercial for the much more expensive high end kind. I had my hair cut shorter than usual and thought this item would be good to dry and curl my hair under. I figured this way i could try it without spending sixty plus dollars. It did well drying my hair quickly, however to curl it you have to twist the whole thing and it didnt grab my hair very well. There were a couple times that it would get a little tangled but easy  to get out for the most part. It added tons of body, which i already have a lot of. All in all i think it did what it says it does, its just kinda a pain to get the back hair and i think a round brush is much easier.</li>
            <li> I want my money back. To begin with, tangle-free my a**. I almost had to cut the brush out of my hair. Instead I sat there for at least 30 minutes pulling and ripping my hair out. Second of all this thing took sooo freakin&#x27; long! My hair is of average thickness and in the time it took for this to dry 90% of my hair I could have blown dried, straightened and curled my hair. I wanted just a hot curling brush but I kept seeing these hot air ones and thought I would give it a try. Huge mistake, won&#x27;t happen again.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time to style my hair.  I have fine dry hair so I don&#x27;t have to wash everyday but I always need a touch up, this hot air brush is perfect for the touch ups.</li>
            <li> I have used this item for well over 15 years and love it. I have very fine straight hair and really need the body this Hot air Brush/Dryer provides.  Electric rollers make my hair way to puffy. I just LOVE this item and always buy two at a time (just in case). I do need to say I use it everyday and within about 12 to 18 months it just dies.. but not bad for the money! So I open my new one and place an order for two more... Please never quit making this item.</li>
            <li> For many years now, I have been using the Vidal Sassoon Curling Brush and I sure hope they continue to make this product. It is the best I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and I really like the way it works with my hair.  Yes I would recommend it to anyone that has trouble getting the look they want with a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THE SAME STYLER ABOUT 12 YEARS AGO AND INSTANTLY LOVED IT! IT BEGAN GIVING ME A LITTLE TROUBLE ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO AFTER LOTS &amp; LOTS OF USE. IT WAS THE ONLY STYLER THAT WORKED ON MY FINE, THICK HAIR. IT BLOW-DRIES &amp; CURLS AT THE SAME TIME WITHOUT THE HIGH HEAT OF A CURLING IRON. I LOOKED EVERYWHERE, BUT COULD NOT LOCATE IT IN A STORE OF ANY KIND. WHEN I FOUND IT ON AMAZON, I WAS ECSTATIC. BOTH MY HAIR AND I ARE VERY HAPPY.</li>
            <li> This product was described as having rotating ability; it did not rotate and did not justify the money spent on it.</li>
            <li> A hot styling brush that&#x27;s great and really works well...instant heat and not too hot...and you don&#x27;t forget to turn it off as it does make noise with the fan.  A nice size and weight to handle easily.  Great addition for easy hair styling!</li>
            <li> I finally found this item!  I used this exact product for years, until it recently broke (after using for over 10 years).  I looked EVERYWHERE for this product and could not find it, so I caved and purchased a DIFFERENT VERSION (with a metal center - yuck) from a local retailer; IT STOPPED WORKING AFTER ONE WEEK!!  ARRRGHH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found it on Amazon and ordered it!  This product is all plastic (gentler on my hair) and, if it&#x27;s as good as the last one like this that I owned, it will last a very long time!  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This makes styling my hair much easier and faster.  My hair has more body and shine than before.  I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this curling brush..keeps my hair frizz free, even on dry hair..the perfect curling brush...thank you..</li>
            <li> This hot air brush is way easier and faster than a curling iron, and it does a great job on my naturally curly hair. It straightens it just enough so I can style it, and gives great body to my hair. Can&#x27;t do my hair without it.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that this styler had an automatic gear driven self rotating brush roll. It does not, actually it has a brush roll locking release button that allows you to disengage the brush roll after manually curling your hair around it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2 air speed settings both deliver what I would consider a minimal amount of air flow. Needless to say one needs to pretty much use this styler after actually drying your hair with a regular blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are comfortable and flexible so they don&#x27;t scratch your scalp and are spread far enough apart that whether one has thin or thick hair this styler should be able to give you the overall styling results your looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a nice manual styler for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this hot air brush for about 5 years. Easy to use and adds a lot of bounce to your hair. Eliminates the need for a blow dryer in one hand and a brush in the other. Only criticism is that if you don&#x27;t clean out the air intake area(at the bottom of the handle) with a toothpick every couple of months the unit will overheat and the motor fails. Keep both intake areas clean and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used this Vidal Sasson Hot Air Brush for years.  When I wear one out, I just purchase another one.  I cannot do without it!</li>
            <li> Great!  Don&#x27;t use it as much as I thought I would</li>
            <li> Love this curling brush, only thing works on my baby fine hair, love this product</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a great price!  I have found others in stores that are much more expensive and don&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li> I recently broke my old VS \\&quot;blowbrush\\&quot; by dropping it on my cermamic bathroom floor. I immediately went and shopped for a new one, specifically VS. No luck! So I bought a Conair...SUCKS! I have very thick hair and I keep it short. This stupid blowbrush barely got hot enough to make even the slightest curl in my hair. Disappointed, I bought another one. This time a Revlon with the 2 barrels. I have been using it now for about 2 weeks and though better than the Conair, it still SUCKS unless I curl my hair when it&#x27;s wet. I&#x27;m kinda getting sick of looking at my pride and joy (my hair) in the mirror and seeing a hot mess staring back at me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to get my Vidal Sasson blowbrush!</li>
            <li> I really like this Hot Air Brush, however, I liked the previous model better.</li>
            <li> PERFECT PRODUCT, NOT FOUND IN LOCAL RETAIL STORES, PLUS VIDAL SASSON CUSTOMER SERVICE ANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT USE IN EUROPE&#x27;S ELECTRIC CIRCUITS THAT CAN NOT USE ELECTRONICS IN THE STYLER AND THIS ONE DID NOT...</li>
            <li> Really not for short hair!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this, and another brand, as a result of a new hair style.  The information provided lead me to believe this brush would spin.  The only spinning it does, is that of releasing your hair when you push a release switch.  My hair does not stay on the brush &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; which are hard plastic spikes that are incapable of grasping and holding onto hair.  It takes a lot to get any results with this product.  Trust me, it isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> great delivery time, as promised</li>
            <li> The only thing I find where it is not as good as my old Vidal Sasson is it does not heat quite as hot.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  Can dry and style quickly  my short hair.</li>
            <li> I had been lusting after a far more expensive version of this brush and decided to go the cheaper route with this Vidal Sasson version. My hair is in a short bob, and I have a small wave that needs to be coaxed into loveliness. This thing is perfect for that. I run slightly damp hands through my hair, then, starting from the front, roll this thing through my hair to the back several times (all over my head). My hair fluffs up and the wave becomes a loverly soft curl. I spritz a little soft hold hairspray, and my hair looks great all day long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so grateful I saved close to 85$ by getting this instead of the shopping network version.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe all the positive reviews.  I actually bought two based on that.  I have long curly hair and the hair kept getting stuck, wrapped around the wand, curl release or not.  I just dug it out of my hair for the last time.</li>
            <li> Needed more power..Not enough heat circulating thru it....For the price it was acceptable...</li>
            <li> This curling brush is worth its weight in gold!  It is easy to use, quick, and won&#x27;t tangle.  You twirl it yourself; it doesn&#x27;t rotate on its own, so you have complete control.  I have fine, straight hair, wear it in a flip, and it takes me about 5 minutes after drying my hair to be ready to go!  Not so hot the it causes split ends either, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!  I worry about it being discontinued.  Maybe I should order a backup?</li>
            <li> Small fan that is built into handle blows heated air out of roller holes, does dry hair much quicker to help speed up styling time. Release button on roller also is nice. Con: Thought it had a smaller diameter barrel when I ordered it, but was able to take barrel off of older one and switch it to this handle, WORKS GREAT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> easily glides through hair-lightweight-i quick dry just out of shower hair then finish drying hair and style also with this brush styler/ dryer- works great- why didnt i get this sooner</li>
            <li> Handle is smaller than the Revlon one and I use it probably more due to the handle size being a little smaller.</li>
            <li> This is great.  Just what I was looking for.  Not one of the local stores carried this type of hot air brush.  It has plastic bristles NOT the flexible regular brush bristles at the 1\\&quot; size.  I need the plastic rigid bristles to hold my ultra fine hair.  The brush bristles do not give the proper tension to put a definitive style in my impossible hair.  I am so grateful to Vidal Sasson for providing this type of hot air brush, hope they never quit making like the other brands seem to have done.   I highly recommend it especially for us of the fine hair variety.</li>
            <li> I have used the the Vidal Sassoon Airbrush for year, it was time to replace it.  I looked all over my home town and other cities that I visited and to my horror couldn&#x27;t find the air brush any where.  I went on line and found it on Amazon.  It is one of the easiest and finest hair implements I have ever used; I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not carried in a retail store.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I wash and style my hair. The rubbery bristles and wand are gentle on my hair and scalp.&lt;br /&gt;No burned fingers wrapping my short hair around it. I use it to partially dry my hair, then I stick in the same diameter Velcro rollers and by the time I&#x27;ve finished my make- up, my hair is ready to style. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great for women with fine hair. Works great....I am so happy with this. Well made at a great price on Amazon.com....you can&#x27;t go wrong with this baby. Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> I received this quickly but it didn&#x27;t rotate. I returned it to receive a replacement, STILL THE SAME PROBLEM. It may be my luck, but I am returning this second one for a full refund and will NEVER try buying this model again. I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I had a dryer brush that you could spin with your hair.  That is what I was looking for.  I don&#x27;t remember the brand of it, but it was an &amp;#34;as seen on TV&#x27; product.  The barrel of the brush was larger and this one tangles hair more easily.</li>
            <li> Major piece of crap.  Hopefully it&#x27;ll be taken off the market soon.  Is Vidal still alive?  If not he must be rolliing over in his grave to this his name is on this cheap peice of useless crap.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have bought a few of them in case they are ever discontinued!</li>
            <li> great for short fine hair. doesnt get too hot. perfect.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law loaned me her&#x27;s when I was visiting and I had to have one. Looked in sevral stores to no avail. Fowne it on Amazon and ordered. In the meantime my hair had ben cut shorter so I am not getting the curl tht I got with her&#x27;s but still get nice body. A 3/4 in. size would work better with my very short hair. So glad I found this one.</li>
            <li> This Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer works very well. I like it because it has low heat and will not damage my hair as my hair is thin and fine. It works perfect to add fullness and style to my hair.</li>
            <li> I was actually skeptical when I received this, but tried it anyway.  Boy was I surprised.  I like it because it takes the place of holding the blow dryer in one hand and a brush in the other and the air is hot enough to dry my coarse/thick Sicilian short hair.</li>
            <li> best hair dryer/ air brush styler ever   I had one for a few years, now my niece is using one too</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for previous purchase of same item.  Can use it to finish not quite dry hair or later with dry hair that needs some volume added.  Easy to take with you on a trip.  Better than hot curlers for smoothing the hair and adding volume.</li>
            <li> I tried this product several times, with varying dampness of hair, and it would not create many curls. I watched video tutorials and read your reviews. Perhaps it&#x27;s just not strong enough for my thick, straight hair. What&#x27;s more, my hair kept getting tangled in it despite my best efforts to cleanly handle it. A former stylist of mine used a brush similar to this and the curls stayed for days... I&#x27;ve been trying to track down which one it is, since it&#x27;s clearly not this one.</li>
            <li> This curling brush doesn&#x27;t spin, returning it. A dud!</li>
            <li> I thought it was a lot smaller barrel it really doesn&#x27;t work that good on my hair.</li>
            <li> It dose not work as the way that I think. The brush will not spin. And there are some holes that the heat comes out and dry the hair. I have long,thin hair. However, it takes me twice the time to dry them and it is hard to make any style..</li>
            <li> I like this item because  can get my hair done in a short amount of time. It curls and dries at the same time.</li>
            <li> I use this daily on my shorter, very fine thin hair.  I cant get any styler to make my hair look full so I tried this and it works great!  No messing with a round brush and hair dryer as this is all in one.  They do tend to burn out after a year or so of use.  Style your hair when its damp and start with a section from the bottom ( I count to 5 or 10) and work your way up.  I then use my favorite spray to hold my style and it keeps looking nice all day.</li>
            <li> I love this styler/dryer but it doesn&#x27;t hold up to daily use like regular hairdryers do--I have to replace it pretty much every year but I live in fear that Vidal Sasson will stop making it!</li>
            <li> Quick hair drying that adds volume as you dry.  Allows you to keep your arms lower that with standard blow-dryer-and-brush method of styling.  Very durable. Light weight. Low enough price to keep one for travel.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, just a curling iron w/ bristles.  Handle is quite fat, hair got tangled and the quick release didn&#x27;t work as well.  At one point, I had to pull the plug, and take off the brush portion to untangle my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Not using it very much.  Hair definetly must be almost dry for this to work.  Also quite noisy.</li>
            <li> I have layered hair and bangs. This gives you a great look and is easy to use. I reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a hair tool I have been using for years and it just works best for me. It is a replacement after many years of use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love, love this styler!  Uncomplicated to use and the price is incredible!!! Would highly recommend! I bought 3!</li>
            <li> Great Product, it is a direct replacement for one that lasted 10 years, until I dropped it and stepped on it.</li>
            <li> ITS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE IT SAID IT SPINS AND IT DOES NOT NOT HAPPY DOES NOT CURL MY HAIR EITHER</li>
            <li> This is my third time buying this air brush. I love how it gives soft curls. It also gives lift to thin hair when used at the roots. I often have to clean out the air intake to avoid overheating.</li>
            <li> Works well....heat is fine...need to be careful with the release sometimes.  Overall a good product.  Wished I&#x27;d bought a larger curl &amp;#34;end&amp;#34; but that was my choice.</li>
            <li> I would have liked a hotter heat setting in addition to the 2 that it has and it does not rotate as advertised.</li>
            <li> It was horrible. The air smelled and it made me sick. The smell was terrible. It was loud and made annoying sounds. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> This works great on my curly hair and the plastic bristles dont get tangled. Much better than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> great hot air brush ,i use it every morning  love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  nan.</li>
            <li> I used to get these at Walmart all the time and then a couple of years ago they stopped carrying them.  I was delighted to buy this on Amazon.  It works great.</li>
            <li> I love this curling hot air brush.  I have very curly/wavy hair and this styler/drying has really helped control my hair.  I had one previously and I finally wore it out and purchased another brand that I absolutely hated.  This one is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OK, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT.....WORKS FAIR. BUT NEXT TIME I&#x27;LL GO WITH A ROTATING BRUSH CURLER.YOUR HAIR KINDA GETS TANGLED UP WITH THIS ONE, ALTHOUGH IT HAS A RELEASE BUTTON ON IT, WHICH TO ME DOESN&#x27;T WORK VERY WELL &amp; I I HAVE SHORTER FINE HAIR</li>
            <li> My wife had one of these brushes that she used until she couldn&#x27;t even hold it together anymore.  She wanted a new one and couldn&#x27;t find one in a retail store.  When we found we could buy one through Amazon, we bought two.  She likes these brushes but I know she&#x27;d never write a review for it.</li>
            <li> This works and is the right size, but after wrapping my hair around the wand, the \\&quot;tangle free\\&quot; feature didn&#x27;t really work.  I took it straight back to the store.</li>
            <li> I stick with something when it works, and this styling wand does that.  My hair&#x27;s kinda funny--it has a mind of its own, but it cooperates nicely with Vidal.  I found the prior model of this hot air brush almost a decade ago and have been using them ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the brush while my hair was short, and I use it still now that it&#x27;s long.  My hair is rather coarse and is a mix of curly and straight with lots of cowlicks.  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair, the brush must be doing something right!  It&#x27;s good for smoothing down the frizzies and getting all the ends going in the right direction after a shampoo, and it&#x27;s good for touch-ups in between.  And is so much easier than hot curlers or the blow-dryer/roll brush combination method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I allow my hair to air dry until it&#x27;s just damp and then finish it with the hot air brush, but in a hurry, I blow it nearly dry and then use the brush.  With just a trace of dampness, my hair responds beautifully--it just gives up and behaves itself like an obedient child.  If I could I&#x27;d post a before-and-after picture here to show the marked difference this styler makes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time I walked into the beauty salon for a trim, my hairdresser looked up and exclaimed, \\&quot;My god, look at you!  You&#x27;re beautiful--your hair is just glorious!\\&quot; I had washed and styled it just before my appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my local merchant stopped selling Vidal Sasson&#x27;s Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush, I panicked and bought four more from Amazon just to have on hand in case the product was discontinued!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep one in my suitcase, on in our camper and one in each bathroom.  Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
            <li> had used another brand, but they didn&#x27;t last very long, maybe a year. Tried the Vidal Sasson and i&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vidal Hot Air Stylers for years.  I love the temperature, it&#x27;s perfect, and the 1 inch barrel is just right for me.  The blowing heat really sets the style.  My only problem is that they don&#x27;t last more than about 4 months if you use it every day.  Still, I think it is worth it and will keep buying them.</li>
            <li> I returned my first one because it did not rotate at all as advertised. The replacement came in 2 days, and it doesn&#x27;t rotate still! So I am thinking it is the way it is, it doesn&#x27;t rotate so ignore that on the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it a try since it is so cheap. My hair is not easy to handle, it has some irregular strange looking tiny curls in them, and frizzy looking after wash. This styler dryer does a decent job of taming the frizz, which is my main objective. It also adds some shine and some volume. So I am over all happy with it. I took 1 star off for the false advertising (rotating barrel, which it is not). I didn&#x27;t buy it to get curls but I suspect you are not going to get decent curls out of this because of the low heat. Overall, for the price it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> The first one received did not work at all so returned for replacement.  The replacement arrived.  On high there is almost no hot air coming thru, totally worthless.  Do not recommend that anyone purchase.</li>
            <li> love this brush. holds the hair in place while setting the curl and releases it easily. also use it to smooth frizzy hair days</li>
            <li> I have been looking for one of these for several months, just this kind, and when I found you had them I bought 2 right away!  These are the best of all that is out there and I just love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other type, with the actual brush not these rubber prongs, stick in the hair and split and break the hair off!!</li>
            <li> The handle needs to be smaller, to grip better&lt;br /&gt;Does not make the curls tight enough to hold the curl, it just gives body</li>
            <li> I bought this because one of the reviewers said it rotated.  Technically speaking, it does, but the rotation is not powered by the brush.  I have to rotate it to wind my hair on, then I press the release button which allows the barrel to rotate as I pull my hair out.  Not what I was looking for, but too cheap to pay return shipping.  This brush is going to the Good Will.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t work for my hair because my hair is to short. I also didn&#x27;t like the volume of heat was so low on it.  I am glad I didn&#x27;t pay more fore a fifteenth one and it would not of worked</li>
            <li> I received the Hot Air Brush within a day or two, and have been very pleased with it.  I purchased two of them, as I have found them to be hard to find locally.  Was very pleased with purchasing them online.</li>
            <li> excellentproduct wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and keep clean. It heats quickly and styles beautifully.  This is the only curling iron you really need.</li>
            <li> Have never styled well with curling irons or other devices but since this provides heat, air flow and a styling product held in one hand, allowing the other to select the specific hairs to be styled, it has worked well for me.  I broke my hand three months ago and could not hold a dryer and brush at the same time so this product was a life saver for me.  I could get some element of style using only one hand and it also did a good job of taming the &amp;#34;frizzies) on damp days.</li>
            <li> My last one lasted me over 8 years and I was heart broken when it finally died. Looked everywhere for the same model and couldn&#x27;t find it, until I was on Amazon one day and just happened to find it. I love this curler/dryer.</li>
            <li> I had a hot air brush some time ago and it stopped working.  I missed having one to use on my straight, fine, short hair.  I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with this one, it does a very good job.  I blow dry my hair to get most of the moisture out them finish up with the hot air brush to give me the style and volume.</li>
            <li> fast shipping,product was as stated, just what was ordered, my wife likes the 1 inch size&lt;br /&gt;to style her hair</li>
            <li> I was looking for this at salons for a long time. I had one for years and years but it wore out so I was happy to find this exactly like the old one,</li>
            <li> Great product! I love it! Works geat and Was delivered on time and in great condition. I am pleased with my purchase and will deal with again.</li>
            <li> I like easy to use as I don&#x27;t need a hair dryer this does it all so bought 2 and have had the first one for over a year</li>
            <li> This is not what I thought it was.. not looking for the air brush.. my mistake but had to return it. Looking for a 1&amp;#34; brush styler, not a hot air styler.</li>
            <li> This is a nice styler, dryer for short hair.  mM hair is pretty short.  I had it VERY short for years and I&#x27;m trying to grow it out right now.  This brush/dryer helps make it presentable through my awkward awful hair stage.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and too uncoordinated (LOL) to use a curling iron, so this is the best of both worlds.  Works great and doesn&#x27;t tangle the hair. I have been using this model for several years.  I can&#x27;t live with out it. I buy 5 at a time so I will not be without one.  Have them in all my travel and gym bags.  Great gifts.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This Brush Styler is Great it is light weight and does not pull hair. Tangle free.&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair and it styles with ease. Perfect for straightening and curls no&lt;br /&gt;matter what kind of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Great product would recommend</li>
            <li> Just what my hair needed!</li>
            <li> Not much heat for my hair.  I have a lot of hair (very short but thick--not coarse).  I also don&#x27;t get any shine, probably because of the plastic stiff &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t use it anymore.  When my hair was a little longer, I used the Conair spinning hair brush (large barrel).  Love that Conair brush!  I would get shine from that.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for a few years and liked it so much that when it started to make some noises I  thought, &amp;#34; I can&#x27;t live without this tool for my hair so I bought another 2 stylers just like it. It doesn&#x27;t tangle in my hair and it always drys it rapidly. I can&#x27;t do without it!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described! I use it daily and love it! The item is high quality and works very well. It arrived quickly, I wish I had ordered it much sooner! I cannot believe how hassle free it styles my hair.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to find this--the only thing that works well on my hair!  Since it seems to be out of production and unavailable in any store, I was SO happy to find it here.  Glad someone out there must have those taken off the shelves!</li>
            <li> Item works perfectly.  Has an odd smell, almost like mildew.  I bought two and my daughter noticed the smell too.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic.  Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is fine; this type of Hot air brush is perfect for giving it some volume and curling it at the same time</li>
            <li> I have used this style of hot air brush for several years, but then I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.  After deciding to look on Amazon.com, I found it!  I ordered two for me and one for my daughter, because she couldn&#x27;t find them in the stores either.</li>
            <li> I bought this hot air brush because I am spending some weeks in a place where there was no hairdryer. As I have two at home I didn&#x27;t want to buy another normal one. I tried another brand first which didn&#x27;t work for me although it had three accessories, which I liked (one was just a kind of a comb) but left my hair quite frizzy as I have a perm. This one leaves my hair very soft and shiny after I spray my hair with a heat protector (my perm always leaves my dyed hair very dry). My only problem is that when I used it on the back of my head my hair tangles quite a bit and is difficult to free from the brush. For the moment I use the thinner brush as my hair is not very long. Another problem is that the untangle button is very near the on and off button so I keep turning off the device. It lies well in the hand though...... After reading a lot of reviews about other products I find that this one is superb for the price I paid!</li>
            <li> I love this hot air styler. I&#x27;ve had one for years and have used it untill it fell apart. I dropped it too many times. It gives a nice smooth curl. Works great on my medium length hair. The bristles are flexable so it grips your hair. It gets warm right away, but not too hot so you can&#x27;t have it close to your head. I hope they never discontinue it or I&#x27;ll be lost. I&#x27;ve tried others but have never found one even close.</li>
            <li> Tangle-free? This item is made for short hair--unless you&#x27;re just combing as you dry. If you try to use this for root lift or volume, it gets horribly tangled. I found it impossible to use in long, wet hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone with hair much past their jaw use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also flimsy, and it broke as I was trying to dislodge it from my hair. Mostly it was just mediocre and difficult to use. But when I accidentally pulled hair through the tongs a little wonky, I had to fight with it forever. Getting it out of my hair was a nightmare.</li>
            <li> This is the best styling and drying brush I have owned, and it lasted forever.  So now that the first one is literally falling apart, I bought two more.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a great price. Dries hair quickly and gives a curl and body. I&#x27;ve used other products...this one is the best!</li>
            <li> THE PERFECT HAIR TOOL. I have long dark hair which is always so frizzy and always air dries way too poofy so I always need to use a heat tool but I was so tired of burning my hair off and have been looking for a lighter less harsh tool on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the same problem..TRY THIS PRODUCT!! AT LEAST ONCE!! You will not be disappointed. It works best if your hair is at least 50% dry. You take small sections and go over each piece a few times twisting and turning the brush if you want long beautiful waves. It makes the most beautiful natural looking curls with no frizz  and waves that look like you just stepped out of a salon. I promise all you Amazon buyers I have been asked multiple times where I get my hair done when all I use is this tool. After I use this i then use CHI 44 finishing shine spray which puts a light shiny gloss on my hair and the look is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful with this though because if you use too much hair it might get caught in the top part of the brush and get tangled. It is a fragile product but does wonders for your hair. PLEASE TRY .. IF YOU ARE QUESTIONING THIS PRODUCT..QUESTION NO .. MORE JUST GIVE IT A TRY!</li>
            <li> I have purchased several of the Sasson hot air brushes and am always very pleased with the price and performance.</li>
            <li> I love this.  First few times I used, I too, had tangled hair.  I think that was a learning process.  Once I figured out how to release the lock was able to get the tangle around the brush out.  I love it.  I have chin length hair, very fine.  This works great.  I recommend it.  I&#x27;m ordering another for backup. As mentioned in so many of the reviews, it&#x27;s best to let your hair dry up to a good 80%, then I finish it up with this.  great body, waves etc;  I do not use regular dryer at all, just use this to finish the drying.  I went to a wedding this weekend &amp; received 2 great compliments on my hair, NEVER has this happened before.  KEEPER</li>
            <li> Zero stars if I could.  The roller broke after two attempts to use it.  The  &amp;#34;prongs&amp;#34; caught in my hair and pulled it out even though there is a &amp;#34;curl release&amp;#34; button.  Very dissatisfied. Spend more money for a better product. I don&#x27;t know what that would be. I am finished with trying products like this.  I take very god care of my hair and this is extremely damaging.</li>
            <li> This product needs a hotter setting and a higher speed to adequately style and dry the hair. I have tried similar Vidal Sassoon stylers in the past that worked better than this one on my shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as I thought it would.  If you get your hair caught up in this, it&#x27;s just user-error - trust me, I speak from experience.  There&#x27;s a little learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it works great.  It&#x27;s really best for using when your hair is just damp - it&#x27;s not meant to blow your hair completely dry straight out of the shower.  I shower at night and then mist my hair in the morning with a water bottle and style it before work.</li>
            <li> This air brush was a replacement for my worn out brush,but it didn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> So easy to use &amp; does not tangle your hair. Also, it is not real hot, so it does not burn your hair.</li>
            <li> There were at least 3 or 4 similar items. I&#x27;ve used this curler by Sassoon for some 20 years. Amazon is the ONLY place I can get it. Happy</li>
            <li> Awesome little tool, as someone with a lot of hair, whatever can make the process simpler, I&#x27;m down for. Not having to hold up the brush and blow dryer has saved my so much effort. And this dries my hair faster, anyways. My only thing is that obnoxious clicking when it&#x27;s supposed to be turning. Also, it seems to be losing power. But, it was so cheap, I&#x27;ll probably just buy another.</li>
            <li> This curls hair quickly without getting tangled in the brush!  Hair wraps up easily around the brush and stays there during heating.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  I haven&#x27;t opened but am currently using one I&#x27;ve had for years and love it!</li>
            <li> This a great product.  Have never been able to produce good results with the brush and dryer, so gave up long ago.&lt;br /&gt;However after reading reviews about this product, I gave it a try..It works.</li>
            <li> I have short some what curly hair and this is what I use to dry it and style it at the same time. I need this size barrel to get the look I want. The brush part is soft plastic and doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp when I use it. I really don&#x27;t care for the ones you find in the stores right now with the hard bristle brush attachments. My hair gets tangled when I use them but not with this hot air brush. Just make sure u read the instructions and clean the vent.</li>
            <li> If I could give this a zero I would. It took me 40 minutes to get it untangled from my hair . If you have thin hair it might work better but med or thick, your asking for pain. I dislike giving negative reviews but that&#x27;s what happened.</li>
            <li> The best hot air brush on the market.  Really nice product!  Hope they never stop making it!!  I always buy it when I find it.</li>
            <li> A big NO NO ! Just not worth the buy ! Highly disappointed ! from my side no stars at all</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THAT ITS LIGHTWEIGHT, IT DRIES WELL, BUT I THOUGHT THAT THE BARREL ACTUALLY SPINS, SO&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;ROTATING BRUSH&amp;#34; DOESN&#x27;T ACTUALLY MEAN IT ROTATES. I STILL LIKE THAT IT ELIMINATES THE &amp;#34;PUTTING THE DRIER DOWN&amp;#34; EVERY TIME I HAVE TO PICK UP THE ROUND BRUSH WHEN I&#x27;M DRYING MY HAIR, MY HAIR IS SHORT SO IT WORKS WELL WHEN I&#x27;M TRYING TO GIVE THE BACK SOME VOLUME.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush is okay, but it&#x27;s not what I thought it would be. Basically, it&#x27;s just a blow dryer with a brush around it. It worked out okay for me because I don&#x27;t own an actually blow dryer. However, I thought that it would help me with straightening my hair with having to use a flat iron, but that wasn&#x27;t happening. Also, it claims that the brush &amp;#34;rotates,&amp;#34; but in actuality the brush rotates only when you move it in a round motion while your finger is holding down the &amp;#34;curl release&amp;#34; switch. Eh, it was alright, but I&#x27;m not that impressed with it.</li>
            <li> The bristles stay cool enough.  The barrel is just the right size.  The cord doesn&#x27;t tangle.  It has settings.  Good choice.</li>
            <li> A little cheaply made,  but works well.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It is the perfect hot air brush.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble doing my hair due to hand eye coordination issues from eye problems. But I don&#x27;t like asking for help. I decided to give this a try. So glad I did. I now do my hair with confidence knowing I can get it to do what I want. Thanks so much. I wish I had it years ago.</li>
            <li> This is not as advertised.  The packaging indicates a rotating brush. It does not rotate so it&#x27;s useless to me with carpal tunnel syndrome.  The blower is very weak and not hot enough.  This might work for someone with very thin, short hair.  Total waste of money.  It&#x27;s going back.  Only reason it has one star is because I have to give it something to write the review.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and this is the only place I&#x27;ve been able to find it.  The air brush works well and is a very good value.</li>
            <li> I must have done something wrong because this was a disaster. My hair is curly but straightens easily, so I figured this would be a nice way to mellow the curls after the shower and not have hair the shape of a mushroom cloud (it happens) but it did not work. My attempts only lead to tangles and the brush got returned. Better luck to you other buyers! I still believe in the potential.</li>
            <li> For the price, I love it and it works great. It styles my hair quickly and my curls hold for a long time.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do if Vidal Sasson ever quit making these hair dryers. I&#x27;m completely dependent on them and keep an extra supply at all times. Have recommended them or bought them for a number of friends who see me using it at the gym after swimming. My only complaint is that they used to come with both sizes of brushes, but now you have to buy a separate dryer for each size brush. I&#x27;d rather pay a little more and get both brushes again.</li>
            <li> This is the best blow curl iron ever made. I now own 3 because I am afraid it will be discontinued</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I have tried all types of hair styling products from hot rollers, to straightening irons to curling irons. I have very fine baby hair that is an absolute nightmare to style. Left to its own devices it would curl in some areas, be straight in others, frizz and puff up in others. It has a mind of its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only become aware of the hot air brush recently and did my research on you tube how to&#x27;s and read all the reviews. Got this in the mail and the first thing I tried was to go from bedhead and test how well it performed without damp hair and without styling products. I went from bedhead to going out hair in a matter of five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I love most about this is it doesn&#x27;t tangle in my hair. My hair is notorious for tangling if someone even looks at it wrong. I wrapped it up around the brush (its not too hot to wrap your hand around) and used the release button and it was that easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I like is it doesn&#x27;t make me shed, it doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair or my hands. With irons I would always have the occasional ouch when my hand went where it shouldn&#x27;t have gone, I&#x27;m really not good with most styling products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to my last point. For the type of women who like low maintenance like me, don&#x27;t want to spend huge amounts of time on your hair and are horrible at handling most styling products, using this is a BREEZE. Your hair comes out super smooth and salon quality.</li>
            <li> These last about 5 years, but at the price it&#x27;s well worth it. Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product! It gives nice volume to my fine (in thickness) hair. It doesn&#x27;t burn skin like a curling iron does, nor does it make kinks in my hair. It&#x27;s light-weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this curler/hot air brush. Don&#x27;t have to use a brush in one hand and blow dryer in the other. The curl release is an added bonus. Does not tangle in the hair  Best curler I&#x27;ve had in a long time. Should have purchased this sooner. Works on thin hair as well as thick hair, shorter hair and long hair.</li>
            <li> Like it very much, Curl release  is great!</li>
            <li> I have been looking in all the stores for this curling brush dryer, couldn&#x27;t find it any more, looked at Amazon and there it was I was so happy I ordered 2.</li>
            <li> Looked everywhere locally after my old one of five years broke after being dropped on its head too many times. No one carried it. Thank you, Amazon. You are my go-to first from now on!</li>
            <li> Very good, I am on my fourth one. The only problem is that after a lot of use it will temporarily shut down which means the intake filter on bottom of wand needs to be cleaned. The oerfect thing to get the dust buildup out is one of those flexible green and white tooth picks. Stick it in the little slots and roll then carefully pull out. Do this on every slot then it is good to go. Also wipe down handle with alcohol cotton ball.</li>
            <li> This is such a time-saver, being able to dry and curl hair at the same time. I use it to smooth the top of my hair and curl up the ends. I love it!</li>
            <li> I will never use this on my hair again! I was confident with the good reviews but this thing got stuck in my hair so bad I thought I was going to have to cut my hair! After soaking it in conditioner and cutting the spikes off of the spool it was finally free!</li>
            <li> with the hot air brush and styler.  I don&#x27;t like to fuss in the morning and this is the perfect dryer and styler.</li>
            <li> This is quite a handy tool.  I&#x27;m in one of the many phases of growing my hair out from super short to shoulder length.  This iron allows me to give my hair enough &amp;#34;flip&amp;#34; to it that it gives the appears of being longer and full of body.  It immediately begins blowing hot air, depending on your setting choice, so there is no waiting for it to heat up.  It&#x27;s a great plug and go!  The easy release button prevents my hair from getting tangled and it&#x27;s extremely light weight.  This product is definitely meant for short and/or layered hair as it will still get quite tangled when used in long hair (just ask my daughter).  The absolute only frown face about the product is the power button is located directly below the brush release button, so inevitably I am turning off my device when attempting to release the curl.  This is a great product and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> the first that happened was my hair was severely tangled and knotted.</li>
            <li> Product just as described! I thought it would be helpful with my short hair do...not working out quite as easily as I had hoped for!</li>
            <li> My favorite curling brush.  I ordered this one because it exactly like my old one.  IT has a been a great product.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I have one that is MANY years old and could not find a replacement in any store. So glad I found this online</li>
            <li> I have purchased several of these brushes in the past and they give a nice natural wave to my hair.  My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t seem to last long - only about a year before the motor goes out.  I use mine 2-3 times a week.  But, the price is okay so I don&#x27;t mind buying a new one.  If it would cost more (as some others do), I would probably not continue to buy them and look for something else.  Overall, I like how my hair looks using this product.</li>
            <li> If you are a child I would use this but not on an adult. It just doesn&#x27;t work for me. Save your money ladies.</li>
            <li> brush works quite well for the price.  A bit heavy for me but I use it.  It heats very quickly</li>
            <li> I start off drying my hair with a more powerful dryer, but finish with this. There is not enough power to completely dry my hair....but it does work well</li>
            <li> Was looking for one of these for some time and glad I found this one. I use it for touch ups after straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> It does the job well and my wife is very pleased with it. It&#x27;s good value for money. I haven&#x27;t used it myself!</li>
            <li> This idem works very good and I would recommend it to anyone.This idem works very good and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very little air blows through it.</li>
            <li> Love the brush. Unfortunately within a&lt;br /&gt;Couple weeks of use the heating element stopped working. I heard a pop and it smelled hot.</li>
            <li> This curling iron with the tangle free bristles/plastic is perfect for my thin sparse hair&lt;br /&gt;My hair dries quickly and this wand helps curl it on the low setting as the insert suggested</li>
            <li> I love this styler dryer.  I have fine hair and most curling irons don&#x27;t work well.  This one does.  I used to buy them at Walmart but last I looked I was no longer able to find this product there. I was grateful I was able to find them on Amazon. Thank you, Amazon!  The only drawback is they don&#x27;t last forever.  I have to replace mine about once a year.</li>
            <li> Works great. I have medium length hair baby fine. Really nice and just like the expensive one. I&#x27;m not sure how it would do for long hair but worth a try.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Curl release prevents tangles.  Swivel cord keeps it simple.  Temperaure choices provide comfortable drying.  Good for medium length hair styles.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t move a lot of air so if you have thick hair, this is not for you.  It seemed like a good idea but it doesn&#x27;t give a great curl if you have heavy hair so I&#x27;m back to my old blow dryer and electric rollers.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these quite a while ago and have used both now til they are worn out! The size of the barrel is just what I need and can&#x27;t find in the store. Now I have to order some more!!</li>
            <li> I have a torn  Rotator cuff and with this dryer brush I can easily dry &amp; style my hair with one arm.  This is my 2nd one, my other one was over 5yr.s old. I wore it out &amp; I just love it.</li>
            <li> Did not fully meet expectations due to the following:&lt;br /&gt;1) The brush does not revolve as described,&lt;br /&gt;2) No warning of US style plug and adapter is required for use here.</li>
            <li> Delighted w/ the speed at which it arrived! This product is not easy to find in the stores any longer so was glad to be able to obtain because it is my favorite hair product</li>
            <li> This a a product that I can not live without.  I have been using these stylers for going on 15 years.  The work GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> This product worked well but started hiccuping within 2 weeks of purchase.  Within two months the motor stopped. Although it states to clean the lint filter, there is no access to the lint filter.  Amazon&#x27;s return policy is within 1 month--so I&#x27;m out the $15 (Oct 2012).  Will go to brick and mortor store for next purchase, return policy is better for products that stop working before their time.</li>
            <li> I will say I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to but im sure there are better out there. with it being about $10 it does the job</li>
            <li> Awkward to use....large for my hand &amp; it does not grip fine hair.</li>
            <li> does a great job, nothing to complain about! I am glad i could find another one like my old one!</li>
            <li> It is not quite what I wanted but still does the job some. My other one I LOVED quit working. It was a Vidal Sasson. They quit making that style.</li>
            <li> I use this several times a week and like it</li>
            <li> This air brush is hard to find , so glad I could find it , this helps take the frizz out of my hair ! Not sure what I will do when they are gone , maybe have to shave my head !</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this hair dryer and I plan on ordering one to have in reserve.  I have thin hair and get a perm every 3 or 4 months.  I have tried the curling brushes that have bristles and my hair just doesn&#x27;t look smooth and I find them more difficult to use.  This one hardly ever gets stuck in my hair and I love the convenience of drying and curling at the same time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years and continue to buy them. This brush does everything I need to make my hair do what I want it to do.  I would recommend it to everyone.  It gives volume and just the right amount of curl. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love this thing for styling my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased a curling iron years ago and it being so old the name had worn off. I took a chance on this one hoping it was it. Glad I made the purchase because it is the exact one I had. Great price too. Nice doing business with you.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s old one quit working and bought these as replacements.  She is happy with their performance and use.  However the first one quit working after one use.  Dealer replaced it with no questions.  Paid for shipping both ways and had a new one in a week.  Everything&#x27;s working fine.  They are all plastic but that&#x27;s helped keep the cost down.</li>
            <li> I have used this styling brush for years and could not find one or even one like it.  So I got 2</li>
            <li> This may be the only brush with this size barrel and plastic tips on the brush. My wife loves how it works. Unfortunately, we have purchased a number of these since they stop working after about a year. For the price, it is still a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Still haven&#x27;t figured out what the manufacturer expected when this tool was produced. Other blowing air at your hair it is USELESS. The plastic brush doesn&#x27;t grip a single strand of hair. The lukewarm air blows doing absolutely nothing. Save your money.</li>
            <li> easy to use, my hair looks super/</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hot air brush.&lt;br /&gt;Really works for my short, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect curler...I always buy 2 at a time.</li>
            <li> It claims to dry your hair but it would take so much more time than blow drying and curling or straightening your hair. Its ok, but my instyler works better. I was.hoping to be able to curl the ends of my bob better with this.</li>
            <li> I have used this model of hairdryer for about 10 years. It is gentle on fine hair, it packs well for travel, and you only need one appliance for styling. My original burned out and I could not find anything that worked as well and did not fry my hair....then I found it with this seller, at a cheaper price than I paid 10 years ago for the first one! Super fast shipping, too!</li>
            <li> Does what it is designed for.</li>
            <li> i think it has factory defects. it turns off in certain spots. i wish it worked in the way it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> This is an okay hot air brush but it gets tangled easily in my hair and then I have to work to get it out.  &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t find this dryer very useful. It gets mildly warm at best, and the barrell is plastic--so it doesn&#x27;t heat up and provide additional styling power.  It was so cheap, it would cost more than it&#x27;s worth to return it--otherwise I&#x27;d send it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  not hot enough to style my hair</li>
            <li> Works great on damp hair for soft curl and lift. Easy to use and easy to clean the brush head.</li>
            <li> I thought wow what a great price for a device like this. Well it barely blows air, does not heat like a curling iron or at all for that matter, tangled up in my daughter&#x27;s hair and I had to cut it out of her hair within 5 min of use.&lt;br /&gt;It spun both directions, not rotating, and tangled up her hair.&lt;br /&gt;The end piece fell off every time you touch it!&lt;br /&gt;Total letdown for the brand, sent it back the day we got it.</li>
            <li> This product was listed in with other stylers that were ceramic but it isn&#x27;t ceramic. It&#x27;s plastic. Even on the low setting it left my hair dry and frizzy. I couldn&#x27;t use this for styling at all. I sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> I was so delighted to succeed in finding these appliances.  I have used it for years and dreaded the death of my current hot air brush.  The purchase process was a breeze!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Susan wise</li>
            <li> Since having brain surgery, my hair has grown back thick and unruly. It was always thick, but it has become very hard to manage especially in humid weather.  While trying to grow it out into a bob, I had an especially hard time with some wiry hair especially on the sides.  I learned this was a result of having head shaved.  Supposedly in India they shave little girls&#x27; heads to make it grow back thicker.  Who knew?  Anyway, I contemplated buying the Perfector Fusion Styler which was several times the price of this tool.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  It smooths my hair quickly, is not excessively hot, and has a release function to keep hair from getting tangled.  I&#x27;d say this was a great buy for anyone with thick or hard to manage hair.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I wanted but that&#x27;s my fault. I don&#x27;t like the plastic &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; and it doesn&#x27;t get very hot, but this is fine when I&#x27;m not putting much effort into my hair. I get it almost dry with a blow dryer then finish with this to smooth the frizz a little.</li>
            <li> This hot airbrush is a great styling tool.  It&#x27;s  hard for me to handle a brush and a dryer at the same time,  this makes styling my hair so much easier and it really is tangle free.</li>
            <li> My wife liked this model she&#x27;d had for years and asked me to order two more for home and the gym when the original wore out.  Unfortunately, one quit working after only two days and the other is running slow two weeks late.  Neither are the quality of the first one she owned.  Now we&#x27;re looking for one of this design but of a much better quality.  Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product previously but could not find it in a store.  I love the product, not wanting the tight curl of a curling iron.  The quality is great.  I use it for loose curling.  I&#x27;ve used a soft brush styler/dryer but it did not work as well for me.  I think it&#x27;s better for medium to short hair but works very well.</li>
            <li> If you want volume but, can&#x27;t handle a blowdry and round brush use this product.  It tends to last about two years.</li>
            <li> it has an american plug.  it turns off after 1 minuet of use and has to cool down before it will turn on again.</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied with this product.  It is easy to use and produces great results. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a brush dryer!!!</li>
            <li> I love this airbrush styler. It works wonders on my hair. I think it is the air/brush/curling iron combination at the same time that makes it work so great on your hair.</li>
            <li> i had Helen of Troy before, similar but much more power and better performance. this one is ok but weak.</li>
            <li> I had looked online and locally for a hot air brush but was unable to find what I wanted. Then I say this and it is just like the one that is kaput. Great for my short fine hair.</li>
            <li> I like it very much because it&#x27;s easy to use, it works, it&#x27;s gentle on my hair, and it&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li> i like this styler and it is just the right size for me.  it is easy to use and so far i have had not problems and the prize was good also.</li>
            <li> Love it.  This is my 4th maybe 5th one.  Used this type of curling brush for years. I use it almost every day,  Can&#x27;t find it in a store anymore.  My last one the handle came apart and I use a rubber band to hold it together-still works but thought it time for a new one. I can&#x27;t use a curling iron without burning myself so this doesn&#x27;t give as tight a curl but I don&#x27;t get burned.</li>
            <li> Have an old Vidal sassoon hot air brush and finally it stopped working and replaced it with another...great product</li>
            <li> this hot air brush is super light weight and easy to use. A must for finish work and touch ups.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it because it has an American connection.  I have had to return it.  A pity this was not made clear in the write-up!</li>
            <li> Not happy t all.  I ordered a small as I have very short hair and you sent me a medium size brush Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Best hot air brush ever!</li>
            <li> I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS BRUSH. I COULD NOT FIND IT IN THE STORES.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift, overheats in 10 seconds and won&#x27;t work in 5 minutes. Thankfully didn&#x27;t waste much money, but it indeed taught me to invest in quality.</li>
            <li> Great, work super.  Hard to find in regular stores.</li>
            <li> My wife made me order two of these for her because she couldn&#x27;t find them in the local stores anymore and you know some women and their beauty products!! Help me if they ever stop making this thing and the ones she has burn out.</li>
            <li> I love this. I have very thick hair and the styler doesn&#x27;t get stuck in it. It adds body and curl in a very attractive way. Good product.</li>
            <li> I like this hot air brush styler  very much.  Have had 2 before this one so I knew I would like it.  Does my hair well</li>
            <li> thank you, it works excellent, came in great condition.</li>
            <li> A great 1&amp;#34; hot air brush for longer hair. Mine is short and fine. Didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;Currently it seems difficult to find smaller sizes about 3/4&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Hope they will be offered again before long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this before and it works great.</li>
            <li> It works great.  Just what I need!</li>
            <li> Wife uses a couple per year.</li>
            <li> I love my Vidal Sasson Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer, 1 inch. It is perfect.</li>
            <li> It arrived on the day it said it would. Works great.</li>
            <li> I have only used this once since I received it, but I am happy with the way it operates and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am not he best at using this hot air brush!</li>
            <li> Very good product - this is the exact same product as the ones for 49.99 and up on other websites.  No problems with this.</li>
            <li> I have been using one my air brush for a while now and really like it. I use it for curling the ends of my hair inward and find that it does this effectively. It works best when you hold it in place for a few second and release it; then repeat until you get the desired curl.</li>
            <li> I really love this hairdryer it straightens your hair as well as curling.  And Amazon is the best company to buy from in the world!</li>
            <li> Bought 3 of these. One for home, the 2nd for the suitcase when traveling, and the 3rd for the gym.</li>
            <li> I have had a previous version of this styler with a 1.5&amp;#34; brush and absolutely loved it as it had a long cord. My old brush fits my new styler so now I can use both sizes.  This was a good deal and one of the best brush styler&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> It pulls my hair very easily and i never want to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it does not worth the money</li>
            <li> Have used this hot air brush for years and I couldn&#x27;t do without it.  Very professional results.Please don&#x27;t discontinue this item.</li>
            <li> Been using this tool for a really long time, and it finally died.  Went right to the same model for the replacement.  Good dependable hot air brush.</li>
            <li> The item they show here and the description they give are not what you get and it has no power, even on high it won&#x27;t dry my short, fine, thin hair and you can forget any curl!  I only gave it 1 star because you can&#x27;t give it zero!</li>
            <li> The best things about this hair curler/blow dryer:&lt;br /&gt;1. Its air temperature is very warm, so it does not require a lengthy amount of time to hold each curl.&lt;br /&gt;2. The price!!  At $11, I can afford two so our guest bathroom has one in the cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;3. The cord swivels easily so there is no untangling of the cord after use.&lt;br /&gt;4. Purchasing online was easy and I received it within 3 days. It used to be sold in the stores...but I looked at Walmart,  Walgreens, Sallys Beauty Supply and Ulta&#x27;s and could not find it.</li>
            <li> this is my 3rd styler</li>
            <li> My wife loves this styler/dryer. Nothing else works like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a similar product from a different company for many years without ever getting it caught in my hair.  when it died i went to buy another one, but found my local store no longer carried it (in fact it has been redesigned and essentially no longer exists anywhere).  i bought this brand because it looked similar and i really didn&#x27;t think it would be much different.  it does make my hair look every bit as good- sleek with good body.  the bad part is that I&#x27;ve gotten the frigging thing caught- seriously caught at least once EVERY time I&#x27;ve used it.  it takes a lot of time to untangle, it hurts, and it ends up breaking way too much hair.  as a result i rarely use.  i haven&#x27;t thrown it away because it does make my hair look great, and i haven&#x27;t seen anything that looks exactly like my old one (the barrel was longer, wider, and the bristles were shorter).  my hair hangs well below my shoulders- I&#x27;m guessing it would be fine if my hair was only shoulder length.</li>
            <li> Retired this. DO NOT LIKE THIS. Hair gets tangled.</li>
            <li> OK, I guess.  Wife uses, not me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this dryer to anyone who is trying to attain beach waves with minimal effort. Must have wavy/curly hair, but I use this brush every day and I get so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> Best hot air Brush I&#x27;ve owned. Curl button makes all the difference. Although it looks cheap motor works better than most.</li>
            <li> It does not have the soft bristle brush as my old one from Vidal Sasson that I loved. This one is rigid and breaks my hair off. Compared to the one I used to have from Vidal Sasson, I would rate this as a toy that can ruin your hair. Do not buy it. Not worth a cent. I finally bought one at Walmart, the Infiniti Conair with soft bristle brush that also rotates as you curl. I like it, but took a few tries to understand it. It is more expensive, a bit over $50, but worth the investment. Why would Vidal Sasson stop making the model I had????? It was perfect.</li>
            <li> The product description is kind of misleading. It says it can spin and has 2 speeds. I thought it can spin itself when turn on the power but it cannot.&lt;br /&gt;  It is a kind of cheap plastic tool and no powerful enough. I have short and straight hair. I wish it can curl my bottom hair but it takes a long time to do so. and the curve  only last couple hrs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at the advice of my sister but after receiving it, found that my hair was too fine and short to work. The brush is also to big.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  Easy on my hair and easy to use.  Saves $ on hair care products because it&#x27;s not as harsh as a blow dryer.  Do blow dry to damp, then style....and shipping a new one was a 2 day process.  OMG it was soon easy!</li>
            <li> I love this!!! It works great.</li>
            <li> That is the positive thing.  On the negative, it did very little for&lt;br /&gt;my hair.  It did not add volume, I really was expecting more&lt;br /&gt;from it</li>
            <li> I really have no opinion on this.  It did not work as good as I had hoped.  It takes a long time to dry my hair and I was looking for a faster way and curling at the same time.</li>
            <li> I love this product but they dont last very long before they burn up.  I have used them for years but always keep an extra on hand</li>
            <li> Max Alderman&#x27;s wife-I use my hot air brush daily as my primary hair styling tool.  I dry and curl my hair with this brush and am very satisfied with the product!</li>
            <li> The product look sturdy enough. But when I turned it on to high the blow is not strong nor hot enough to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;So I have to blow dry my hair with my original drier then styling with this one.&lt;br /&gt;Which is not the purpose of buying this. I but this so that I can styling my hair at the same time that I blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;Quite disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I used to own one that look similar to this but has a stronger air blow.</li>
            <li> This is my second bought it just in case my first burns out &amp; it was on sale too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these hot air sttler for many years, adds volume to my short fine hair. was so glad to see them on Amazon, was delivered to my house as soon as 10 days</li>
            <li> Works for what it is - but I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it that wasn&#x27;t a curing iron, but like a hair dryer with a round brush attachment. So I gave it away and bought a curling iron instead.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Great item! Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was using it for the second time when it actually started smoking and thankfully the outlet that it was plugged into tripped before it actually caught fire.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it along with another one that I had bought for a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair dryer that I use.  It works great for several months, however, as it gets older, it overheat and shuts off.  Nonetheless, I won&#x27;t trade it.  I buy several at a time to keep as backups.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush is essential to me!  First one I had for years before I dropped it and broke the end.  It still worked, but was cumbersome, so I ordered another.  This one I&#x27;ve had for a few years, but is starting to sound like it&#x27;s going to die, so ordered another one.  This last one that I received a few days ago died within 30 seconds of using it.  Sigh.  I&#x27;m chalking that up to a lemon and ordering another one... since I can&#x27;t live without it.  Not sure how to resolve getting my money back on the defective one.  For $11, though, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the hassle of trying to send it in.</li>
            <li> The pros of this curling dryer are:&lt;br /&gt;It has very low wattage 250w so uses much less electricity to get the job done than most blow dryers that are 1200watts or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relatively low temperature doesn&#x27;t get your hair so hot that it leaves your hair feeling dried out, frizzy and crispy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dries your hair....eventually&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does accommodate some styling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convenient for travel as you only have to take one appliance - this blow dryer - rather than a blow dryer, brush to use with the blow dryer and maybe hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The low wattage means it takes quite some time to get your hair completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to style and dry at the same time you can only do one small piece of hair at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also looks and feels chintzy - no substance to it to speak of.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most desirable thing about this dryer is that it&#x27;s very convenient to pack it in a suitcase and also I did notice that my hair looked shinier after using it to dry.</li>
            <li> The is a wonderful styler.   I have thick hair which doesn&#x27;t dry very quickly.  My hair tangles very easily and this one does a great job.  It really does not tangle.  The release button allows the hair to come out easily.  It shapes nicely; also adds body.  If your hair is shorter, I would suggest you buy one that is less than 1 inch, especially if you want a little curl.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair that just hangs there. Five munites with the hot air brush and my hair looks tame.  This is an essential styling tool, especially if you&#x27;re not good with a blow dryer and brush. It smooths, and/or gives your hair body depending on your preference. I keep one in my suitcase and one at home.</li>
            <li> This product is fair.  It will get Tangled in your hair be careful.  Does not hurt your hair and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> not a great product. The tips are all gone and does not heat up. Not great for short hair.</li>
            <li> Great for short hair. Especially for travel.</li>
            <li> Perfect answer instead of hot-rollers.</li>
            <li> Head of brush as a little longer than I thought and my hair is short - could not use it.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and in good condition.  It is easy to use, and it is quiet.  I like the temperature range.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I did not have high expectations for this product, but when I used it I was pleasantly surprised at how much it lifted and refreshed my hair. The price is great since I have seen products like this for much more.</li>
            <li> I saw a similar product on an infomercial and wanted to try an inexpensive model. I purchased this one with decent reviews for a low price on Amazon. I followed the instructions specifically and nothing was really happening.I tried to roll more and more hair onto the barrel to get it to style and my hair got completely tangled in it and would not come off. I thought I would have to cut my hair. Instead my brother was able to cut the spikes off of the barrel to get my hair out. What a nightmare!!</li>
            <li> We first tried a different brand that had a metal barrel for the brushes and hard plastic bristles.  It just didn&#x27;t work well - could not seem to get the hair to hold any style.  Maybe it was the paltry heat setting (one setting only) that failed to set/hold the hair well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS model is wonderful.  It has a softly rubberized barrel and widely-spaced &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; (more like soft tines) that grip well and a large barrel.  It also has two choices of heat - the higher heat setting (250 watt) really seems to work so much better on normal-to-thick hair (full bodied hair) than the lower (150 watt).</li>
            <li> The quality of this styler/dryer is really good. I like the size of the barrel for my hair. I have had at least 4 of them and they last for years. I cannot find them in stores locally anymore and was glad to find it on Amazon. Even though I have had several of them, they do last for years. I just use mine every day and it wears it out faster. Totally satisfied with my purchase and will order one again when I need a new one.</li>
            <li> I have used Vidal Sassoon hot brushes for over 10 years, and hope they are around for a long time!</li>
            <li> I use this every day and when my other one quit,  I looked everywhere in stores to find one like it and could only find one on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This does what it&#x27;s supposed to do but I have thick hair and have to use my regular hair dryer to dry my hair most of the way before finishing off with this.  This would be great on my mom&#x27;s thinner hair if it had a smaller barrel.</li>
            <li> I love this unit and have been using one like it for at least 20 years. The only thing I have against it is that it doesn&#x27;t last me more than about 6 months.  I order a new one after it quits working. It does my hair perfectly. and It feels comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this product but am pleased with it. I have a short haircut and this item gives a nice fullness.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd brush I ordered. The first one stopped working after using it twice.  This one seems fine.  I had an old brush that was 15 yrs old when it quit working.  I hope I can get alot of yrs out of this one.  It makes soft curls, which is what I want fr this brush.  It is not available in the stores anymore, so this was a great find!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, but it would have been nicer, if&lt;br /&gt;it had a couple of different size attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Still I am very pleased with product.&lt;br /&gt;A+++++++</li>
            <li> I like it very handy when I need it.</li>
            <li> i was able to use it for 3x only. after 4th usage there is no longer power...what a waste :(</li>
            <li> This purchase was a replacement hair dryer for my wife.  She really liked the one that she&#x27;d had for 4 to 5 years, and it just gave out.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL ITEM.  WORKS REALLY WELL.  I KEEP REPLACING THEM EVERY YEAR SINCE IT REALLY STRAIGHTENS AND SMOOTHS THE HAIR TO PERFECTION.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, couldn&#x27;t find one like it in the stores.  Easy to use and clean and I like that it doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, nothing to write home about. It does dry but it would take me hours to do so. It doesn&#x27;t seem very sturdy. I am going to try it on my daughters hair and see if it does any better.</li>
            <li> Makes drying and fixing my hair an easy, quick job.  I sent one to my sister and she loves it too.</li>
            <li> Shuts down misuse and does not come back on when shut off until it cools down.&lt;br /&gt;Works beautifully otherwise, great curls and dries well.</li>
            <li> I had one for years, before.....even bought second one and left with my parents in Europe, for mom and me, to use when I visited. Now my old one just &amp;#34; couldn&#x27;t take it anymore&amp;#34;. So glad I was able to get a new one. No other kind worked,for me. This one is the best. The brush is much better, then other brands. Like the fack that it can be removed and cleaned,washed. Works for me,great!</li>
            <li> I have owned this device in a smaller size and it lasted about 10 years.  When it gave out, I decided to go with one just a tad larger.  This one serves the needs I have.  So far, this one does not shut down due to over heating as readily as the last one.</li>
            <li> My old model died of old age.. I was pleased to find this one on line, great price.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing for my hair using this brush is No static friz which other brushes cause on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  I could not find one in stores. I&#x27;ve had one for years, same brand, and I knew mine was going to stop working soon because it was about 35 years old. I like it because it straightens parts of my hair that need taming.  I had a different brand as a back up but there wasn&#x27;t enough power to it.  I really should buy another just in case I leave this one someplace.</li>
            <li> I have used this very same brand hot air brush for years (in fact I&#x27;ve had it for so long I can&#x27;t even remember what year I started using it).  When the one I had started wearing out I ordered a new one from Amazon and received it yesterday. I have very thin hair which is hard to style with a blow dryer and round brush alone, so I&#x27;ve supplemented the end of styling my hair with this hot air brush.  It works beautifully, does not damage my wispy thin hair, and, as someone who is not a cosmetologist, it makes finishing styling my hair so easy.  I recommend this hot air brush 100%; do not know what I would do without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve using hot air brushes before and they work well on my hair (shorter, fine, curl resistant) to smooth and add volume and curve. Tried this one and it was doing a great job but must have had a short somewhere because it kept cutting in and out while I was using it. I guess there was a short in the wiring somewhere. Returning it and replacing with a Helen of Troy model. Hopefully I&#x27;ll have better luck with it!</li>
            <li> This is the best hot air brush mI have ever owned.  My hair is very straight and fine and it does a marvelous job finishing off the drying process for me.  Easy to use and great price.  If when I need another one, I will search for the same model and purchase it.  I cannot say enough positives on this hot air brush - I just love it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Everything as promised.</li>
            <li> Very good and portable dryer/curler for road trips. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted about a year and I had to order another one. It&#x27;s easy to use without burning myself like a curling iron.</li>
            <li> It sucks!! That&#x27;s exactly what you get for $10!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, exactly what I wanted, fast delivery &amp; price was good.  KW</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the brush in my hand and the way the bristles hold my hair.  However, the brush doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to provide much curl.  Even though the product suggests the warm setting for fine hair, I have to use the hot setting with heat protective spray  to get what curl it will give me or I am left with almost straight hair.</li>
            <li> Probably because my hair is short,  I really do not feel like I get very good results with this brush.  I wish I had stuck to the curling brush that works like a curling iron.</li>
            <li> The worst  dryer I bought it is do nothing even if u need to style ur hair  very  weak dryer don&#x27;t waste ur money</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected. It definitely dries my hair but, it leaves it in a puffy mess.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she says she loves it.  Product meets all expectations and it was received in a timely manner.  Would recommend this buyer.</li>
            <li> very good hot air brush. it&#x27;s easy to use and make your hair shiny and curly too. it&#x27;s very worth your money. the quality is more than the price!!!! love it.</li>
            <li> I thought this would rotate on its own. That is not the case. It took much longer for my hair to dry AND it still needed to be manually turned. I got it thinking it would rotate on its own.. Not the case.</li>
            <li> It only takes one hand, and it&#x27;s much easier than trying to hold a round brush and a dryer.  Don&#x27;t try to dry your hair with it, because the heat is pretty low. I&#x27;m sure it would dry it eventually, but I don&#x27;t recommend this styler for that! Anyway, I love it!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday to get my bed head under control.  It brings some shine, and smoothness to my hair after each shampoo.  This is my third purchase of this product.  I have been using one for many years.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product&lt;br /&gt;I wish there is a dual electric charge so I can use it when I travel&lt;br /&gt;I tried using a converter in the Philippines and the product burned</li>
            <li> Great for thin hair.  Dries and curls at same time. Hint: to set the final curls, just let heat up with hair twisted around the wand, then turn off and let it cool down, then release.  Takes a few tries to get used to it.  Trust me, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I had looked for this exact brush in mutiple stores, but couldn&#x27;t find anythinglike it. This  exactly what I wanted and I got a good price on it.</li>
            <li> This is not quite a hair dryer nor a curling iron.  If you want a little body after your hair is almost dry then this would be a good tool.  I do have thick hair so mine takes awhile to dry which is why I may not be satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Me and my daughter have used one for years.  Then the stores quit selling them, my cousin, who I got hooked on them too, found them online</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> replaced an old one just like it.  Glad I can still get it.</li>
            <li> I still have it.  It works amazing</li>
            <li> flimsy and cheap.  For my fine hair it did nothing.  I would not recommend, instead get the Revlon shine enhancing hot air kit.</li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush.i try to keep one on hand at all times.I have natural curly hair so this hot air brush smoothes out my hair.</li>
            <li> The one inch was a little big for my short hair.</li>
            <li> i had one of these for years and it quit,  looked extensively for one comparable in stores and could not find one so glad i found it on amazon.com</li>
            <li> It might work on someone with shorter than shoulder length hair, but certainly not any longer than that. COMPLETE waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I really like this styling brush. I have short fine hair and with the right styling product, this really gives my hair volume. Unlike a curling iron there is never a thought of &amp;#34;did I remember to unplug my curling iron?&amp;#34;.It dries my hair fast without getting too hot.The price was good to try something like this too.</li>
            <li> The Best Hot Air Styling Brush &amp; Dryer on the Market! Works much better that several other Name Brand ones I have us in the past.</li>
            <li> I love this item.  I used it when my hair is almost dry.  I can now style my hair with fullness without using hair dryer and hot curling iron.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.  It makes my thin hair seem thicker and I can have it done in 5 minutes from the time it&#x27;s blow dried.  Hope they never stop making these!</li>
            <li> This is the best for styling my permed, fine hair.  Only takes a few minutes to get it manageable.</li>
            <li> My hot air brush died and none of the big box stores had the one I wanted!  So I bought something else.  BIG mistake! To make a long story short I had bad hair until my hot air brush arrived in the mail from Amazon. Thank-you Amazon.  From reading other reviews I see this is a common problem and Amazon has come to the rescue.</li>
            <li> trying to get a tangle Free Curling Hot Brush compared to the Perfector and this works ok. The price was great, and so far I am happy with it and recieved it in ok time</li>
            <li> I had surgery on my left shoulder and have been unable to dry or style my hair.  I started wondering what I could do about that and googled this type of dryer (I didn&#x27;t know they even existed!). I was thrilled to see just what I had in mind and reasonably priced, too.  I used it for the first time this morning and was extremely pleased with how easily it was handled, and how well it dried with only 1 arm.  Definitely a keeper!  I feel I can go to work looking professional once again!</li>
            <li> The Vidal Sassoon Hot Air Brush Styler/Curler 1 1/2\\&quot; has been my only functional source of hair styling since the &#x27;90s.     I do not like hair dryers and a neck problem makes it very difficult to have both my arms up to \\&quot;style and blow dry\\&quot; at the same time.     I did replace this twice before. This one is not hot enough to dry my hair. My hair is thick with waves and a mind of it&#x27;s own. This low powered VS Hot Air Brush Styler/Curler takes me more than an hour to dry my hair. It looks great if I do that. 2 hours is absurd to get ready to go somewhere.     Thus, my search on Amazon to find the hot version of the only tool that works with body, my hair, and my patience level. 250 watts???????? Are we kidding? lol    I guess I will pout on this for a couple of days and order one. grumble, grumble    Note: switching to one with metal just burns up my hair. The secret to this one is no metal touching my hair. And, previously, enough heat to get me out the door in 15 minutes. That was really good. :)</li>
            <li> Easy to use curling stick.  Creates big, soft curls that look like they took you all morning to do, but really only take minutes from beginning to end. Was so grateful to buy this item on line because I can no longer find it in stores. Does not cause the same heat damage that regular curling irons do because it creates curls with hot air. If hair does get tangled on brush you simply turn off the brush which immediately cools down and then just simply push the release button and your hair can easily be removed. No Panicking Necessary!</li>
            <li> I use it every day and am very satisfied with it . I couldn&#x27;t be without it and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try !</li>
            <li> I wanted to but a hot air brush from a while now and was just researching on the internet about all kinds of hot air brushes and was little skeptical whether they really work or not so tried this one proper in my budget so that even if it dint work i could not cry over it.I used it for the first time and totally in love  with it. I know how to style with a dryer but then working with the dryer and brush leads to pain in my hand everything but with this product i love using it. I works so fast n saves my time of drying and then styling. When i used it for the first time the look was like as if i got a salon dry and looked similar to what my haircut was 3 months ago when i had one. I would definitely advice to start with this product but the only problem i had with it was the tangling part some how i could work out with that but as you start using it you will be comfortable with it(may be its because of my coarse hair) may not be same for everyone.</li>
            <li> I have used this hot airbrush for years, but can&#x27;t find it in the stores now, so I ordered on line and had to pay more for this item , but it works the best for me. Will order again on line if can&#x27;t find in stores again. Patty</li>
            <li> It does not work!!  It did not style my hair my daughter&#x27;s hair or the wig I bought.  It did not style anything.  It somewhat blow dried our hair after sitting there for more than a hour.  The wig was human hair and it took just as long to dry but it did not style anything.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these for my mom so she would have a spare! She loves them. We were ver pleased.</li>
            <li> Works great for drying and styling my hair.  A natural look.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and always return to it after trying something new on the market. This is the cheapest form of styler/drying tool that works on all types of hair. Mine is thick, curly and course, which this tool makes it possible to control; it tames down the natural curl, while giving it shine and manageability. Using it on damp hair works best but I have used it on dry hair to freshen up the style. I have hundreds of dollars in my drawer of worthless, damaging hair styling tools that damage my hair and cause it to frizz. They burn my hair and sizzle anytime I get near my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great value at this price so I got two of them, one for the RV and one for home.&lt;br /&gt;Still the best thing I&#x27;ve found, and more BANG FOR THE BUCK with less damage and room for error.</li>
            <li> item works - however - not hot enough to hold the curl</li>
            <li> Have short hair and this hot air brush really doesn&#x27;t work for short hair.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!  I purchased it after my hairdresser recommended a new way of drying my hair that entailed me needing two extra arms to complete.  I have quite severe damage from when I decided to go from dark brown to blonde to red and then back to dark brown, so I was getting a lot of breakage whenever I dried  my hair.  After evaluating the situation I decided to switch hair dressers and the way I was taking care of my previously \\&quot;resilient to anything\\&quot; hair.  Thankfully I haven&#x27;t experienced the issues other people have had with the heat being too high.  If anything, the heat on mine is very low.  This low heat ensures my hair is very shiny and soft when I&#x27;m done.  The curls I get last for a very long time and it&#x27;s quick / easy to use if I need to \\&quot;freshen-up\\&quot; my &#x27;do after a long day or a night of sleeping on it.  A big bonus for is the fact that it&#x27;s so quiet, I don&#x27;t bother anyone when I use it, unlike a regular hair dryer.  I have very thick, wavy / kinky hair that&#x27;s past my shoulders and if I briefly towel dry and then let my hair air dry for a bit, it only takes about 20 minutes more to complete the job.  This is quite a reduction in time spent if you take into consideration that I used to blow dry my hair (watch it break off), then use hot rollers (more breakage) then have to pull it back to smooth it out. Plus the amount of breakage has gone WAY down.  A+++ rating from me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this styling brush for 10 years now.  It is great because it doesn&#x27;t over curl your hair like a curling iron does.  It&#x27;s like giving yourself a blow dryer blow out but with an easier tool to manage than a hair dryer.  It just gives a nice shape with some smooth curls.  My hair is very thick so this tool is valuable because I can make my hair go in the direction I want with it!</li>
            <li> Does I nice job. Thank you</li>
            <li> does the trick -- I have short hair and this brush works fine.</li>
            <li> Have used this brush before and love it. I just replaced my broken one.</li>
            <li> love it! bought it because i was going to have shoulder surgery. had to do my hair one handed for several weeks. this would be great for women who have had strokes, etc.</li>
            <li> my super long hair gets tangled in the brissles</li>
            <li> This is a very nice little hair dryer.  Although I have the 1-inch roller brush, it is a little bit large for my short hair but it is still a nice brush for grooming hair after shampoo.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot. Should have kept the box and packing material so I could have returned this item. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> After 6 months when it gets too hot shuts off and won&#x27;t turn back on till it has cooled off.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and I get exactly the look I want with it.  I have used one of these for many years.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> ITS A GOOD PRODUCT  IT DOES ITS JUSB  MY LAST ONE IS STILL WORKING AFTER 5YEARS  HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product.  I&#x27;d really like to be able to get it with a 3/4&amp;#34; barrel.</li>
            <li> I have always used a hot air styling brush for my permed, short, thick hair. I needed a new one and ordered this.  The first time I used it, it didn&#x27;t even have time to get warm before it stopped working.  Of course I checked the power source and the connection. But it would never start working again. I sent it back immediately.  I have to say Amazon has a terrific return policy and service.  My account was credited even before they received the return.  I am re-ordering this item and hopping that the returned one was just a fluke.</li>
            <li> Meh. I have jaw-length fine hair. Didn&#x27;t do much for me. But it was cheap and worth a try just to know. I don&#x27;t think this is a good or bad product in and of itself. It all depends on your type of hair and what you want to accomplish as to whether this works for you or not. If I change my style and go longer or shorter or use different products, I will try it again and see if it works better for me.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I wanted.  Heats well and grips hair easily.  I dry my hair until it&#x27;s just slightly damp and use the hot air brush to finish styling and it does a great job.  My hair is coarse and hard to curl, but the hot air brush really does the trick.</li>
            <li> I uses this to blow my hair out  and it works great.I have used these for years and when&lt;br /&gt;someone see it they always want to know where did I get this air brush I have gotten&lt;br /&gt;them at one of the big boxes stores.I was very happy to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This one is hard to find - so I bought a couple of them.  I always burn myself when I use curling irons and I feel like they fry my hair.  This imparts a nice curl - I don&#x27;t use it to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; my hair (unless your hair is very short), but right after I blowdry it to add some curl.  Been using this for years.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews and have been mostly happy. It does not rotate but I did not expect it to. It makes curls on almost dry hair. I like the curl release feature. I do have a frustration with the curler that I haven&#x27;t seen mentioned in many reviews. The tip on the end of the barrel untwists and comes off when I hold it to roll the hair. I try to tightened it down with almost every curl but it comes loose again and is just a pain. I think I will have to glue it permanently. Otherwise it is a decent styling tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I increased the stars from 3 to 4 because I got this caught in my hair and had to disassemble the top to untangle. I had not glued the cap. After I reassembled it, the top stays on just fine. Wish I would have thought of taking it apart and putting back together sooner. I use this often and am very happy except I still turn it off accidently when using the curl release. Oh well I can work with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works for some people. I have thick long hair and the very first time I used this my hair got caught and tangled and had to be cut off of it. So I don&#x27;t suggest this for thick long hair</li>
            <li> I thought this was also a dryer and can assist in styling my hair once completely dried. This was not the case. Overall it does nothing for me instead it pulls out my hair and I had to carefully take it out.</li>
            <li> didnt do darn thing to my hair, not a bend at all</li>
            <li> This is perfect to give my fine straight hair a little body.  Also good for those of us too uncoordinated to have a blow dryer in one hand and the round brush in the other.</li>
            <li> Love this styler. Fewer tangles. Easy to use. this is my second one. Yes, as a previous custmer mentiioned, clean out the vent every couple of months. My first one last me for many years.</li>
            <li> Good hair styling tool, priced well.  My only regret is that it did not include a smaller diameter brush attachment.</li>
            <li> This is the second Vidal Sasson Tangle Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer I have owned. When the local store no longer carried it I turned to Amazon. Great product. Does what I want.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong size so will not be keeping this</li>
            <li> Love this hair tool!  Works beautifully!</li>
            <li> Got this for my sister, her old one finally gave out.  She really likes this style of brush and dryer in one.</li>
            <li> Love hot air brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a great product My hands do not work very well I can dry my curly hair with ease.Highly recomend this.</li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush...so much that I got two of them, just in case!  I have had one for years ... and it finally gave up.  I had been looking for a replacement for quite a while since I could forsee it giving up but I have not been able to find one like it in retail stores.  When I happened upon it on Amazon I ordered two.  I would hate to go through that again.  I love it.  It is so easy to use...alsmost one handed.  It does two things at once-  it dries while it curls!  Wonderful!  The ones with brushes do not work as well.  Thank you Vidal Sasson... and Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact product for at least 20 years. I have worn out about 4 and keep buying more.&lt;br /&gt; I Won&#x27;t use anything else. In fact, I always buy extra so I have a spare in the closet if mine wears out.&lt;br /&gt;My sister used mine and bought herself one. They are hard to find so get one now.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is shoudler length, sometimes shorter and very thick. This is so much better than&lt;br /&gt;the electric curlers I used for years.&lt;br /&gt;This is awesome!!! L Gregory</li>
            <li> This did absolutely no good to frizzy hair but tangle it up.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t purchase if you need a styler. Pay more for the &amp;#34;In Styler&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;like I did.  I Threw this in the garbage. Lou Tugwell</li>
            <li> I wanted a air brush styler so i could do my hair faster once I  have washed and conditioned.  I have had this product for about a month and the first time I used it my hair got tangled and there was not enough air coming out of it to dry my hair,,, I am AA with 4A transitioning APL (arm pit length) hair. Its light weight and i really wish I had saved my money and not buy this dryer brush. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Its made cheap and my hair got so tangled with first use, I never used it again... It went to the heaven closet where all the products I don&amp;#34;t like live.  lol&lt;br /&gt;Well God Bless and enjoy your day,,</li>
            <li> I was looking for a smaller size styler/dryer that I could easily pack for trips. This seems to fit the bill ok. Not a lot of power or heat, but for traveling it&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li> I love the Vidal Sasson curler brush..I&#x27;ve worn out several..was happy to find it on Amazon...I ordered one a year ago and once the motor gets hot, you can&#x27;t turn it back on until it cools down...So, I ordered another one, and this one the cord doesn&#x27;t make good connection, so each time and turn the handle, it cuts off...I&#x27;m so disappointed.  Why can&#x27;t I buy one that&#x27;s working properly?</li>
            <li> Works like the one I had 20 years ago and still does the job for a very desirable price!  So glad I found one again... This is number 2 in the 20 years I&#x27;ve been using them. Great value!</li>
            <li> not a very effective dryer</li>
            <li> dissapointing, not happy with this product. I can do better waves/curls with my straightner. This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I really, really did try.  Within 60 seconds of use, I had a burn on my hand and scalp.  I followed all directions and recommendations here in the reviews.  I am a gadget person and have several different types of hair styling devices.  This one just does not work properly.</li>
            <li> When you use the hot air brush, it works fine for 5 minutes, it suddenly stops, then will not turn back on. It doesn&#x27;t matter which outlet, I have tried multiple... There must be a short or glitch in the electrical system because it will turn on again after about 30 minutes. And, no it is not a breaker because other items electrical items will work just fine. Very, very annoying to say the least!! I would return it, but the shipping would cost me more money and I won&#x27;t put another penny into anything related to this product.</li>
            <li> My wife says it is the best dryer she has used in years!!!</li>
            <li> Did not like at all.  Hard to use</li>
            <li> Got tangled in my hair the first time I used it.  It took me an hour to get it out.  I had to pull out hair one strand at a time and then cut the rest.  Horrible product!</li>
            <li> I received the Vidal Sasson tangle free hot air brush in a timely manner and it is working perfectly - it is my favorite type of hot air brush styler and dryer that I have found that helps my naturally curly hair that frizzes in hot humid weather</li>
            <li> Recieved product in good condition and working order.</li>
            <li> It could work for certain hair type. Just not mine</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I expected it to do and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It worked for awhile but not as i would like. Its ok.</li>
            <li> great , have used this model for years !</li>
            <li> The Vidal Sasson Hot Air Brush styler and dryer has almost no power. It does not do the job. I do not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This Hot Air Brush is a lemon to say the least. I only used it 4 times and it will not spin now. The dryer still works but not the spin action.</li>
            <li> The best hair tool I have ever owned.  I can&#x27;t be without it.  I have one in my summer home also.  I ordered this one because the other one I have started to sound funny after 2 years.  I had to have a replacement just in case.  I use it on dry and semi damp hair.  It works great.</li>
            <li> I love it. The price is right.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and the barrel was not rotating. So returned it and ordered another one. and this one is not rotating either . Am I missing something here or both are broken ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New update : supposedly the barrel is not supposed to rotate. But the description says rotating barrel.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000PY17PI Vidal Sasson VS433C Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer, 1 Inch]]I have used this for a couple of years and it is awesome.  It does overheat and if I turn it off, it will take a few minutes to work again.  I just purchased a new one to put in my suitcase for travel or if my original goes on the fritz.  I have hair that hangs 4-5 inches below my shoulders and this curls and dries my hair for a soft curl look.  Make sure you dry your hair some first and it is only damp when you begin.  I don&#x27;t have problems with any frizz and I like that.  I recommend it except for the overheating problem.</li>
            <li> I find this tool a bit awkward to work with.  The teeth of the brush do not catch hair which is a plus!  However, I believe there are better similar products out there!</li>
            <li> I had one of these for over 6 yrs.(yes, it last that long!) and dropped it recently, it broke and I went searching for another.  However, they are NOT to be found in stores anymore.  I ended up buying a different type and I hate it.  So, I did what I should have did from the start, I looked on Amazon and there it was!!  Thank you AMAZON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this styler/dryer!  I have shoulder length, thick, straight hair and nothing else works like the Vidal Sasson on my mane.  After I wash my hair I let it air dry until it&#x27;s just damp, then I plug up my styler and finish drying and styling it.  It curls beautifully and I can finish my hair quickly.  The bristles are great for holding onto your hair without tangling!  I love my VS styler!</li>
            <li> I love this, but with the caveat that it&#x27;s good if you&#x27;re not looking for a hair-dryer per se. Yes, it blows warm air, but pretty much like a dryer on the lowest setting. However, for me it is perfect since I generally let my hair air dry until it&#x27;s damp-- and then this finishes it off beautifully. It&#x27;s lightweight, very easy to use, and the sound is low (I think it&#x27;s quieter than my electric toothbrush!). Because it&#x27;s small and light, I&#x27;ve even brought it to work with me when I&#x27;m running late and spent four minutes drying my hair in my office, without bothering people in the next office.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  This is the second one that I have purchased through Amazon.  It works great for finishing touches on my natural curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Good little appliance. It is my second. The down side is the packaging.  My hand was cut twice as I tried to get it out of the hard plastic shell. Had I known of this type of wrapping I would not have bought the driver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought and used this air brush for a number of years now.  It&#x27;s the easiest hair styling tool to use.  The best part is no curling iron burns or dried out hair from every day use. It can be used on different lengths of hair too.</li>
            <li> Really great product!</li>
            <li> works well, saves using two hands  and fluffs hair,  Heat is not too strong so it take longer but feel better about less heat</li>
            <li> Not enough heat to really curl the ends of your hair.  Ok as a hot air brush.</li>
            <li> Does what I wanted it to do.  Help dry my very thick hair</li>
            <li> better than I expected.....luv luv luv it!!</li>
            <li> This device has no power.  If your hair is two inches long, it might work great,&lt;br /&gt;but there is no blow to it.  It&#x27;s more of a whisper.  I also bought the Frieda&lt;br /&gt;blow brush, and it is better.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and thought it would be.  Perfect for finishing off my medium length straight hair.</li>
            <li> Worth the money. Pleased with the results! Head is not as long as an alternate product we found but it works well just the same.</li>
            <li> I usually use a (1 in.) round brush and a blow dryer to style my hair. I bought this to use on my hair to have a little bit of curl to my hair while drying my hair. I&#x27;ve been working on getting use to this new all in one hair dryer and curling tool. I haven&#x27;t quite gotten the hang of using this tool yet. It takes time to learn how to utilize something that you have never used before. BUT I think I will get the hang of it pretty soon. So for now I will only give it a 4 star to start. Once I have gotten to the point that I can do my hair with this tool on a daily basis I will come back and add to this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the concept that I will only have to use this tool instead of two tools to get my hair done each morning. When I am adept at using this tool I will have cut down on the time it takes me to style my hair each morning. So that&#x27;s my goal! I won&#x27;t give up until I reach this goal. I&#x27;m all about saving time. I just have to put up with the learning curve. I&#x27;ll be back when I&#x27;ve accomplished getting to my goal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Vidal Sassoon 1\\&quot; Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer features a 1\\&quot; barrel and soft, tangle-free bristles that gently grip and hold to enhance body and volume. There are 2 heat settings and 2 speed settings. The rotating vented barrel prevents tangles. There are 250 watts to provide ample power. It also features a cool tip for easy styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s worth the time and the efforts to learn to utilize this Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer.</li>
            <li> Its just useless it does not even heat up</li>
            <li> This is the second Vidal Sasson VS433C Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer (1-inch) I&#x27;ve owned, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I&#x27;ve tried other kinds, but this one works perfectly for me...and the price is right too!</li>
            <li> I love this, I&#x27;m not good at doing my hair but this hot air brush makes it easy.  I actually can make my hair look decent, I&#x27;m so happy I purchased this.  Easy to use and at a reasonable price, I highly recommend!  I love it.</li>
            <li> easy to use with my naturally wavy hair.  a good brand too at a good price.  prompt service.</li>
            <li> Have used for years and could not find. Someone at work said to check online.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very loud, did not curl hair.. was very disappointed in this product. Would not recommend .. Wish I could get my money back. Price was cheap, so  I guess it;s the ya get what you pay for. Save yourself the aggravation and look else where.</li>
            <li> I like it. I bought new this one when my old destroyed.</li>
            <li> it looks good, but I didn&#x27;t use it yet, when I use it I will give you a 5, depending on how it works, and give me the curls it promise.</li>
            <li> I purchased a different brush and had to go back to this as you can remove the brush and clean the hair product gook out. Easy to handle and good air flow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but I feel obliged to warn people, if I can even score zero I would not hesitate a second.&lt;br /&gt;The dryer is really weak and it smells like plastic when it&#x27;s on, and the big surprise is that it started to over heat and shut off after less than 1 minute!!!! I didn&#x27;t even get the chance to check if its effective on the hair or not.&lt;br /&gt;I was really fooled big time, ill threw this away because it will cost me more to return it to the shipper. BUT HEY AMAZON, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE SELLING TO THE CUSTOMERS!!!</li>
            <li> I have had hot air brushes/dryers before and this one is the worst one so far.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair at all and when I roll my hair up, it doesn&#x27;t release my hair.  So I have to carefully unroll.  I have given up on doing this because I am worried that I won&#x27;t be able to get my hair unrolled.  I would never recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have bought several and this is the best one I have found. Good price. My first one lasted over 2 years. Others might last longer don&#x27;t know but ones I have paid more for have a harder brush and the ones with metal shafts get to hot.</li>
            <li> The description for this product is completely misleading.  The brush doesn&#x27;t rotate at all.  I&#x27;m not sure what \\&quot;rotating vented barrel\\&quot; refers to since nothing moves.  I received one brush which didn&#x27;t rotate so I contacted Amazon.  They were very helpful and sent me another brush which also doesn&#x27;t rotate.  I called the company to find out whether they were both defective or if the description was wrong.  I was told that the brush does not rotate.  Both Amazon and Vidal Sassoon were extremely helpful when I contacted them but I am very disappointed not to have a rotating brush.  That being said, the brush does work on my hair if I manually roll it on.  I have very fine hair.  I do turn the brush on a few minutes before I plan to use it since it takes a few minutes to warm up.</li>
            <li> I have had this model for years and when it wears out I get another one!  And, friends and family always request another one!  Great buy! Hair does not get tangled in this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because i wanted to play with curls and just the style of my hair..sadly it broke after just the second use. material is cheap</li>
            <li> As many reviewers have commented, this product tends to have a short life because it overheats.  It works wonderfully at controlling curly hair.  I have had several of these and am trying to extend the life of the current one by drying my hair first with a blow dryer and just using the styler when the hair is nearly dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for over 15 years. I buy a new one every year, but lately haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores. It is the perfect styling tool for shorter hair styles. Gives volume that lasts.</li>
            <li> I had previously had the same product approx 10 yrs and \\&quot;thanks\\&quot; to&lt;br /&gt;Amazon I was able to purchase the exact same hot-air/style brush.  Depending on the length of my hair or a perm, this is \\&quot;all\\&quot; I need.  It is tangle free, can dry &amp; style at the same time and do \\&quot;not\\&quot; need a curling iron.  I can be ready to go in 10-15 min. tops.  I hope this brush is not discontinued in the near future, for me, its all I need.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite blow dryer, for my short hair.</li>
            <li> I love these. It&#x27;s the only thing i can comb my hair with.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money. Good for thin hair ,and up to chin length.can dry and style at the same time.</li>
            <li> Not as hot. Took time to dry my hair .I still use my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Item was defective and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> this is the onley hot air brush my wife will use.Don&#x27;t stop making them.</li>
            <li> This did not wprk for me and some of the plastic brissels broke off.</li>
            <li> SASSOON HAS THE BEST ELECTRIC HAIR PRODUCTS THAT I HAVE FOUND.  PRICE WAS VERY REASONABLE.  LOVE THE WAY IT CURLS THANK YOU</li>
            <li> We tried this just because of other people&#x27;s reviews.  For the very reasonable price, how bad could it be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, let me tell you - if you have fine hair or shorter hair, this thing is AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;I have baby fine hair, and it is hard to get any sort of curl or body into it without a perm.  I have previously been using a metal barrelled skinny round bristle brush. The barrel heats up from the blow dryer, creating a curling iron effect with just the brush. However, our local stores no longer carry the small barrel size, and larger ones only make my hair look straighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this little gem.  I was dubious trying something like this - it looks really cheap and feels really cheap.  But try to ignore that, because it gets the job done!  The first few uses smelled like burning plastic, but that eventually fades.  You do have to watch blocking the air vents at the bottom of the handle with your hand, but that is something you get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord doesn&#x27;t twist as freely as one might hope. I found myself wishing the cord had a way to untwist itself, and looked at it - it DOES have that twisting/untwisting cord tip, but it doesn&#x27;t work very well for me.  No biggie, and not a reason to not get this item though.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles make it easy for me to grab a chunk of hair and blow it dry around the bristle brush and have a nice curl.  Since my hair is fairly fine, it doesn&#x27;t take me a long time to complete the job.  Saturday, we tried this on my daughter&#x27;s hair - she has a very thick head of wavy hair. It took a LOT longer for hers, and it got a little tangled up from time to time, despite having a hair release button on the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am super pleased with this one, and will probably get another one just to have for a spare.  All thumbs up!</li>
            <li> It makes a lot more noise than anything. it doesnt get hot enough to use on even slightly damp hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone it is easy to use and blows hot air out as it curls and you get your hair done in a very short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Love this hot air brush.  Received on suggested time.</li>
            <li> I am not one for knowing how to style my hair so this tool helps a lot. It wont dry your hair for you so you do need to dry almost all the way before using but does help with volume and curl</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I expected of it.  I have extremely thick, coarse, short hair.  It gives my hair a slight bend. (all I want) and semi dries it if I towel dry first and let it rest awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Glad to have it</li>
            <li> Works great with my short hair.  It curls quickly and is easy to use. I would buy it again happily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this type brush for several years; when my old one stopped working I was glad to find an exact replacement.</li>
            <li> The Barrel does not work properly.TheQuality of the product is low.Its not What i expected from Vidal Sasson. Dont make the mistake of reading all the good reviews and buy this.This Product is one Junk</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this hot air brush.  It is true to its word.  It is tangle free. I bought three this time.</li>
            <li> Love this styling brush, can&#x27;t do my hair without it! My old one kept quitting after less than a minute of use, then took several minutes to re-set, only to quit again. When I couldn&#x27;t find any in the local stores, I began to panic! Amazon saved me! Purchased 2, just to have a spare on hand.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use hair styler that works just great on my thinning and fine hair.  I don&#x27;t  have a lot of strength in my hands and wrists, and this unit is lightweight and easy to use.  I have tried many stylers over the years, and I think this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> My hair gets caught in it easily and the release doesn&#x27;t really work. It&#x27;s cheap. I recommend spending more money and getting one of higher quality.</li>
            <li> its very low heat. i have very fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t work. Cheap brand and bad function.</li>
            <li> Great replacement for my wife&#x27;s favorite styler. This model was no longer available locally. Her original lasted about ten years, so hoping this one will also.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I purchased the last one at my local discounter but they no longer carry them.  I was so glad to find it at Amazon I bought two.  I have medium length hair that I blow out until almost dry then finish with tis product that puts a nice bend or curl depending how long you hold it.  I&#x27;m finished in about 7 to 8 minutes.  I hope this styler remains available.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush is exactly what I needed for my short curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have never been coordinated enough to hold a curling brush and a hair dryer.  This solves that problem for me!  I have short hair, so it has never gotten tangled.  My hair is thin, so this dries it very quickly.  I love that, unlike a curling iron, I can touch it and not burn my fingers.  Wouldn&#x27;t change a thing about it.</li>
            <li> When I turned it on it gave off a horrible burning smell.  I tried a couple of times just in case there was some dust that was burning off, but the burning smell persisted.  Therefore I am unable to use it.</li>
            <li> Have used this dryer for years but can&#x27;t find it in stores. Very reasonably priced so I usually buy 2!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought three other brands of similar dryers over the years when I couldn&#x27;t find this one, and they were all way too hot, even when used on the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting.  My hair was dry before it began to be styled, and looked like straw.  It was also really hard to gather enough hair onto the barrel without burning the scalp.  The Sassoon one dries gently enough on high setting, but you can still change to low as you finish up, or refresh the next day.  The plastic pegs don&#x27;t tangle like brushes do, either.&lt;br /&gt;I just bought two of them so I won&#x27;t get caught without a working dryer again. They actually last pretty well, especially considering the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The body to hold during use is a nice size to fit petite hands. Also like because the hot air barrell is smaller for short hair, and I like the plastic comb instead of bristles. Less tangling.</li>
            <li> The 1 inch Vidal Sasson dryer/styler I had had for years finally fell apart.  I had searched everywhere for a replacement one, but could only find the styler with the larger barrel.  I bought several other I thought would work, but didn&#x27;t like them.  I finally decided to try Amazon.com and was thrilled to find one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hot air brush for years; it&#x27;s an essential tool for me. I have a roughly chin-length, modified bob that is angled toward the front and textured in the back. After blow drying with a round brush to mostly-dry my hair, I use this tool to shape and smooth and it does an excellent job. It&#x27;s light-weight and very easy to use and gives you much more control with one hand than you may be able to achieve with both hands using a blower and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hot air brush is not meant to be the only tool used to completely dry a full head of soaking wet hair; it&#x27;s much better suited for finishing. If you have extremely thin/delicate hair, you may be able to completely dry your hair with it but for longer, thicker hair, I think it would take you a long time and you&#x27;d likely wear out the dryer fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with the life-span of this inexpensive but oh-so-handy tool. I&#x27;ve never had one actually die on me. Rather, as the air brush ages (and after LOTS of use)the motor(which is very small) may overheat causing the dryer to stop working until it cools down. I&#x27;ve not had it stop running while using it. Instead, if I turn it off momentarily, I can hear a click (the internal, automatic shut-off) and the dryer won&#x27;t run again until it has safely cooled off. This can be annoying and time consuming so to me, that&#x27;s when it&#x27;s time to get a new one.  Also, if you use hair products, after a long period of repeated use, the brush will get an icky build up on it, as would any tool. There&#x27;s a screw-off cap at the end of the barrel which allows you to remove the brush to clean it. I found that warm water, a soft nail brush and liquid soap provide great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is an excellent tool at a very low price, one which I&#x27;ve not been able to find anywhere except Amazon. I recommend it to anyone with short to medium length and fine to medium thickness hair.</li>
            <li> This is probably my smartest purchase on Amazon. I love it. I used to have a very short pixie haircut and grew it out for 3 years. It grew back in thin, in a lot of lengths. Once I got a good trim, my hair looked better, but it needed a little something. It was dry, thin and just laid there not very pretty. So I started using Wen and this Styler together. It has made ALL the difference. I now have soft hair that has ringlets at the bottom. I user my cleanser (and have since learned never to brush my hair wet, so if you are having thinning problems, use a wide tooth comb, not a brush. I promise you will see a difference) and I blow dry the roots only, on low. Then I take the Styler and brush it through my hair, gently making curls at the ends. I do the crown for a bit of lift there as well and it makes the back hang very prettily. It doesn&#x27;t tangle at all. I am very happy with my purchase. However, when I put it on my wish list it was around $10 bucks. I couldn&#x27;t get it until around Christmas and it had doubled. But that&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault. Everything is more expensive at Christmas. :)  I don&#x27;t mind. I&#x27;m just glad I have it.  EDIT EDIT  EDIT!!!!!!!:  I just had to come back and edit my review. This little curler started overheating after I only had it about 2 months. My hair was thin and shoulder length so it was NOT more than the styler could handle and being as my hair was so thin, I only used it 10 or less minutes a day! But it would over heat and not come back on for over an hour. Then, less than 2 weeks later, It DIED and wouldn&#x27;t come back on at all!! I contacted the seller who couldn&#x27;t have cared less. So whatever positives I said about this product at first, I TAKE IT ALL BACK!! I wouldn&#x27;t encourage anyone to buy something that won&#x27;t even last 3 months--especially when you take very good care of it and only use it once a day!! I have recently gone back over the latest reviews and saw many ladies talking about overheating. They weren&#x27;t exaggerating! Do NOT waste your time and money on this POS!!!!!</li>
            <li> This air brush is so easy to use, doesn&#x27;t tangle up in your hair at all.  It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The wife likes this brush but it was smaller than she usually uses.  Now she uses the 1-1/2 size as it works better</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold my hair which slips right through the brush.  My hair nis fine and about six inches long on top.  I wish I hadn&#x27;y bought it.</li>
            <li> I have used these Sasson styling brushes for MANY years.  I always keep a spare hidden away for the time that my old one gives up and dies.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t be without one!!</li>
            <li> it didnt work at all, it glow air for like the fisrt 2 days i used it, but the air was not hot enough, then on the 3 day it stop working, waste of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and was unable to find it in the store, so happy to have found it here! I have very fine straight hair, this is the perfect answer for me!</li>
            <li> My original Vidal Sasson Hot Air Brush styler finally gave out after 10 years.  I used it for travelling.  When I went to replace it I saw that it was $50!!!  Two much for a travel device so I purchased the one above for $11.  Great deal.  It&#x27;s plastic  but works fine and is light and is perfect for your overnight bag.</li>
            <li> LOVE it. What more can I say?&lt;br /&gt;Well, since I have to say more, I&#x27;ll say it works wonderfully and styles beautifully.</li>
            <li> She LOVES IT. EVERY MORNING !</li>
            <li> I had one many years ago and have looked and looked for a replacement. Found this one on Amazon, ordered it, and love it. I like the fact that you can roll past the hair ends and this prevents hair getting caught with the brushes, and curls the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> Its the BEST!!!  I bought three in case they stop making it!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this and have wondered why I can only find it online these days.  I used to buy it locally, but now, I can only find it online.  I bought 2 the last time so that when the first one breaks, I won&#x27;t have to worry that I will be without one!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. It&#x27;s my second one. Had first one for many years.</li>
            <li> It gave my hair a soft natural wave and was easy to handle</li>
            <li> I have had two or more which I rarely use because I have my hair done at the shop.  Both of these stay on for about 30 seconds and then turn off.  They will not come back on for about 1/2 an hour.  They have hardly been used, and now I am looking for another brand because I do not have the time or patience to try to use these like-new irons.</li>
            <li> I do not use a blow dryer on my hair -- it makes it frizzy.  I use this hot air brush instead.  i LOVE it.  It not only dries&lt;br /&gt;my hair but it prevents the frizzes and it styles it -- all at the same time.  Result is a good, casual hair style.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s hair has never looked so good!  Best hair styling product on the market.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Vidal Sasson hot air brush styler to anyone who wants to add soft curls to their hair without the worry of burning your fingers.  It is great - I now have two of them</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years.  It is durable &amp; lasts for years. I have purchased one for a friend.  I have short hair and the hot air brush styler is the only way to get a soft lift to my hair.  This Vidal Sasson unit has a slim handle and is easy to hold in one hand and style.  I have tried other products from drug stores and the handle is too large and heavy and hard to turn.</li>
            <li> It does a great job on styling my hair</li>
            <li> Can use to Dry and curl hair all in one step.  Good for travel usage.  Saves on packing for road trips.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this model and we will purchase it again when needed.</li>
            <li> Works well enough good price</li>
            <li> My hair is short and thick.......this brush styler doesn&#x27;t work too well for me.........it works; but takes me longer than just using my dryer and a round brush.</li>
            <li> After reading the buyer reviews and noticing the high ratings on this product, I decided to purchase it.  It is lite weight and heats up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note that I use this Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer for my synthetic wigs and one day I will try it on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now - I made a great purchase - hIghly satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Dried my hair quickly. I have a perm and it made my hair a little too frizzy.</li>
            <li> The only one I use. I don&#x27;t bother with any other stylers. This one is quick and easy. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good at hair, and this is the easiest tool I&#x27;ve ever got. The handle and the tip do not heat up so I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning my face off. Curling irons probably are more efficient, but if you&#x27;re clumsy like me, this is the right tool.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job. I have permed short hair and I mainly use it to straighten out the some of the curl and to dry my hair quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I do think it works best on wet hair. If your hair is like mine, it will not straighten out your hair like they would at a hair salon but it straighten it out enough that makes dealing with hair manageable. It&#x27;s super helpful if you&#x27;re away to college and there aren&#x27;t reliable hair salons around.</li>
            <li> I really love this, better than all the titanium, ceramic , ionic other stuff that cost so much and do so little. This is not a dryer. It&#x27;s a styler and it works.</li>
            <li> A pleasure to deal with.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted. My old one like it broke after many years of good service. The heat comes quickly and the rubber bristles are soft enough but firm enough. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning this because it advertises as \\&quot;rotating,\\&quot; but it does not. You can unlock the brush to release curls made in a fixed poition, which is not the same thing as rotation. When I think of rotation, I think of a 360 degree rotation while running. That is what I wanted, and that&#x27;s what I thought I was getting. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD A VIDAL SASSON HOT AIR CURLING BRUSH FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER! I&#x27;M SO GLAD I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEM OVER THE YEARS! WORKS LIKE A DREAM!</li>
            <li> I did not realize it was a blow dryer as well as a brush styler. I was so elated to find a 1 inch brush, I overlooked the other feature.&lt;br /&gt;It is ok and does good, but it is loud and it takes longer to get the hair dry than if one just blew it dry , but it saves time with the two steps in one, just use ear plugs.</li>
            <li> to be honest, this one is good among all the air brush dryer products, but i wanted a iron one, so i returned it .</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised due to the price point but this is basically a round brush and a hair dryer combined into one. I had thought it had a barrel that automatically rotated but it doesn&#x27;t. If you do curl your hair around the barrel, it has a button to help release your hair but mine still gets tangled. I don&#x27;t like spending much (if any) time on my hair so I had hoped this would be a quick and easy styling tool but it doesn&#x27;t have me impressed. I have to wet my hair down for it to do anything at all, and it still takes just as long to get my hair dry again.</li>
            <li> I have used hot air brushes for decades, and this was probably the worst.  The curl release would not stay locked and kept clicking and releasing the hair.  I can&#x27;t believe that Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s name is attached to this product.</li>
            <li> It is the second one like this I have bought and I use it eery day.  It is all I need to keep looking my best.</li>
            <li> The air brush does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It&#x27;s very easy to clean and very easy to use to style hair and release longer hair so that it doesn&#x27;t pull out any hair.</li>
            <li> Was thrilled to find the Hot Air Brush was still around.  Have used one for years &amp; works perfectly with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to write a review for a product I don&#x27;t use, but I can say my wife loved this brush, which lasted two-plus years of daily use, so we have bought two more for about $14 each—an excellent price for an excellent product sold by an excellent vendor through an excellent company (Amazon)!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great styling tool and it works best for air-dried hair. If you are like me who loves hair styling but does not want anything permanent then this is a definite must-have! With this, you can achieve that Brazilian Blow-dry effect in 15 minutes or less!</li>
            <li> This is just what my brand new pixie cut needed to get that bit of oomph on the crown.  It was much more affordable than a comparable one for sale in the salon and works just as good.  I let my hair air dry for awhile then use this to style my cut and give it some body.  I have very thick, coarse hair (thank you my Native ancestors), and this little wonder does wonders for my hair.  I am very pleased with the quality also.  I encourage you to buy one if you are thinking of changing your blow drying routine a little bit.</li>
            <li> I have bought this stly several times.  Works gret for fine thin hai.</li>
            <li> works great!  Use for 15 minutes max at a time then let it cool off.  I ruined my first one for running for longs periods of time although it lasted 2 years.</li>
            <li> Loved it. I like the tangle free button , it makes the curl easy to roll out my hair. I told all my friends.</li>
            <li> Easiest way to dry my hair.  I use it for curly styles and straight styles.  I purchased two since I never want to be without it!</li>
            <li> It came on time and it was exactly what I wanted.  Thank you so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cathleen Dallmann</li>
            <li> Did not work after 2nd use....</li>
            <li> This does a great job with my hair which is all I need.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it doesn&#x27;t have enough power to curl my hair unless I hold it on each section for a very long time.  Would be better for someone with strong arms, but I&#x27;m glad I have it just in case.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, was pleased to find this since I&#x27;ve been using this for 13 years and I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked about this order was that it only took a day to get here! Down fall.... DOES NOT work for all kinds of hair. I have very very thick hair and it would not curl or dry it properly without leaving it hard and damaged! I have returned it and getting something worth my money. ONLY buy if you have very fine thin hair</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is the best kind for my short, thin and fine hair.  It dries and curls it quickly and gives it some body.  I have purchased a few of these hair dryers.  I just wish they lasted longer.  I have to keep replacing them.</li>
            <li> This is a great hot air brush for when you need a fuller look to your bob haircut.  It turns my hair under adding volume and bounce to my cut without curling my hair too tightly. I love it. I am so happy to find it on Amazon because not all retail outlets carry the one inch brush.  Thanks Amazon for the vast variety of products you offer!</li>
            <li> I previously had one like this but it burned out. This is a great product &amp; does a great job.</li>
            <li> It does a great job, it heat up higher than most, and it curls my hair too. What more could you want for the price?</li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to use.  I have thin hair and this is the perfect tool for giving it body, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> It works well on my hair and is probably the 4th exactly like it I have bought.</li>
            <li> Great price, works very effectively. I usually use a blow dryer but this product adds great curls and bounce to my otherwise thin hair!</li>
            <li> I buy these about 1 or 2 a year.  They&#x27;re an inexpensive way to blow and curl my hair.  However, they quit working after 6 to 9 months.  But, I like them better than some of the more expensive ones.  The rubber bristles help grip my hair without poking my head.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect tool for my length of hair. It is also small enough to carry and/or pack. Very handy.</li>
            <li> Love this hard to find hot air styler. I usedto purchase at retail chains and could no longer find it; replaced with inferior more expensive.</li>
            <li> I love using this type of device for drying and styling my hair, to avoid using a hot iron as well.  Unfortunately, I seem to need to order a new one every six or seven months.  I suppose I am glad that they only cost $15...I can&#x27;t seem to find another blow brush that has these solid plastic bristles that don&#x27;t make my hair full of static.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  So after reading other reviews, I saw that one person suggested using a toothpick to clean out the vent at the bottom of the unit, and now the dryer works perfectly.  I wish I tried this before I purchased a new one!</li>
            <li> I keep my hair in a short bob because chemotherapy totally changed the texture of it.  I bought this product to help style and control my hair and it works beautifully for it.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, good price for a very good hot air brush.  Love the release feature.</li>
            <li> These are excellent hair curling or straightening tools.</li>
            <li> 1. You can&#x27;t use this product with soaking wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;2. If you&#x27;ve got a lot of hair, this product probably won&#x27;t work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product at a very reasonable price.  It gives a nice curl and does a decent job at helping to keep the frizzies at bay.  I would recommend provided you don&#x27;t intend to use this as a blow dryer.  It&#x27;s easy to use and if used properly, doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair.  I would be sure to keep hair sectioned just to be sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a curler and dryer all in one! This works wonderfully when I use it to straighten out my wet hair after washing it. It has two settings: one for heat, and one for cooler air. This works out great for especially my curly hair, and makes it easier for straightening out before using the hair straightener. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product! Really gives body and makes your hair feel light.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ONLY BRUSH i HAVE FOUND T HAT WILL CURL AND DRY MY BABY THIN HAIR TO HOLD FOR THE WHOLE WORK DAY AND INTO THE EVENING.  i ORDERED TWO FOR TOTAL PROTECTION FROM OUR RAINY SEASON. JUST TRY IT.&lt;br /&gt;I AM CERTAIN THAT YOU WILL LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> It died in less than three minutes the first time I used it.  It just went from a normal motor sound to a high whine and died.  I tried a different outlet, alternately resetting the red and white circuit breaker buttons, etc., whatever I could think of.  (Another hairdryer I have works find in the same outlets.)  I tried it again a few days later after it had cooled off.  This time it started, but just emitted the high whine and then again quit  immediately.  Not worth returning because the buyer has to pay the return postage.</li>
            <li> Great product. Could it be more powerful? Yes. However, I can see someone burning themselves if it were hotter and suing the company for their dumb mistake so smart choice not to make it too hot. I have thick curly hair and this gets it pretty straight for the most part.</li>
            <li> First one of these I ever used, wish I could have found it long ago.</li>
            <li> The most disappointing thing i have ever bought from Amazon.  Absolutely NO GOOD  FOR SPAIN.  I bought an adaptor to use, it kept cutting out so in the end my husband put a Spanish plug on it.  It worked a few times and then gave up the ghost so its lay there just a useless ornament.  I tried to complain to the supplier and they told me they had sold that part of the business to another company and to complain to them.  At almost 73 years of age I find it hard work to keep writing complaints, but, as you asked I thought I would ive you my feedback.  Not even worth the one-star I have given it.</li>
            <li> I use this and it helps a little, but there seem to be as many disadvantages as advantages.  It&#x27;s okay and the price is right if you&#x27;re a patient person.  My hair is about 4&amp;#34; long, pretty straight and it needs to be styled in a sort of poofy way to disguise the fact that it&#x27;s so thin.  It blow dries quickly and generally can be combed into a pretty good style, then sprayed and hand adjusted.  My problem is that sometimes the ends don&#x27;t want to cooperate and stick out in weird ways or some section falls too limply against my head even though I dry it bent over so the hair hangs away from my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My expectations for this tool weren&#x27;t high and that is a good thing.  I&#x27;d hoped to blow dry a little and then use this as a finishing tool to get more curl and shape my hair before my usual styling process.  With this hot air brush I expected I could actually shorten the process and assure a smoother look.  I found right away that the air that blows out of the wand to encourage drying and curling is barely warm and quite weak.  If I turn the thing on and let it sit for a bit the air does warm up some, but I have to use an outlet in a  different room since both this and my blow dryer can&#x27;t use the same outlet without blowing a fuse.  Even with short, thin hair, it would take an eon to dry using only this tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found using the brush takes a lot of getting used to but I worked at it so I could use the &#x27;release hair&#x27; button and not accidentally turn the unit off (the buttons are very close to one another), although I didn&#x27;t see that that release button was very helpful anyway.  My short hair still gets caught up some.  The brush does tame my awkward ends into place and offers slight waves.  It also helps with volume, but patience is a virtue here and sometimes I just don&#x27;t want to take the extra time.  My other goal was to puff up my hair on a non-shampoo day, but that really doesn&#x27;t work since it&#x27;s hard to dampen my hair just the right amount and of course the brush doesn&#x27;t help at all on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I keep it handy for special occasions when I&#x27;m willing to take extra time, but don&#x27;t bother with it at all for regular styling.course the brush doesn&#x27;t help at all on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I keep it handy for special occasions when I&#x27;m willing to take extra time, but don&#x27;t bother with it at all for regular styling.</li>
            <li> This curling brush works so well to dry my hair in an efficient manner.  It saves a step by smoothing out my hair as it dries.  I luv it!</li>
            <li> Not enough heat or  air flow to handle thick hair. I ended up taking this to work for the community basket of products we give to charity</li>
            <li> simple and easy to use.  this is my second one.  the first one lasted 2 years but compare the price to other brand name, VS is not so bad.  I like it.</li>
            <li> After using this hot air brush for 10 years, my hairdresser dropped it and it cracked.  I was very happy to find the exact replacement for it.  How lucky for me.  Works great for smoothing out hair, styling it, and reviving it in the morning.</li>
            <li> GREAT - If you like ONE HANDED styling without worrying about getting burned, this is it!</li>
            <li> This is the third brush of this model that  I&#x27;ve owned.  I like it very much for my naturally curly hair  ... wish it would last longer but maybe I need to do a better job of cleaning it ... I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It works great and does not tangle the hair. I am letting my hair grow out and was reallt worried if it would work.  The last one I had worked fine on short hair but s soon as it stared to grow it would become tangled in the brush.  A real improvement.</li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush styler.  I have very fine hair, and this gives my hair lots of body.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  Just what I wanted for my short hair.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Dries and adds lift and curl all in one!  I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, and love it because it doesn&#x27;t burn you like a curling iron does!</li>
            <li> I purchased this styler/dryer a few yrs back and used it everyday. When it quit working I could not purchase this particular one in any stores. I found it on Amazon.com and bought 2 of them.  It works just as great as the first one I purchased 3 yrs ago. I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what the Wife wanted. She had one that I had been repairing almost every time she used it. (its already old and used by 5~6 Young Ladies). Overheated and the spring holding the comb release always needed a little restretching. Still works but the new one will take over now.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I&#x27;m going to order another one for my upstairs and in case this one wears out.  It curls my hair and gives it great body.  I don&#x27;t have to start blowing my hair dry just let it air dry for a bit and then use this to finish the job and it works great.  I have seen other reviews that said the same and I fully agree.  I have short hair.</li>
            <li> I always buy this brand in this size.  It does exactly what I need it to do.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for 20 yrs and was happy to find it on amazon, could not find it in a store I bought 4 hope they serve me for many years, it is as it says tangle free, easy to use does great job, don&#x27;t burn by fingers and my long hair is in excellent shape for a 69 yr. old.</li>
            <li> I am pretty disappointed with this thing.  It gets stuck constantly in my (long, straight) hair, creates static (seriously), and has crappy drying power.  It barely gets hot, and maybe it&#x27;s me, but the &amp;#34;styling&amp;#34; part of this styling tool eludes me.  At least I only spent $10 on it, but honestly, I&#x27;d rather just use my round brush and regular hair dryer, then a curling iron or rollers.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to mess with my hair a lot so this is just enough to give it some form and body without a lot of work.  I know it will get more use as my hair grows longer.  My hair is still a tad short for the 1&amp;#34; brush, but I&#x27;m growing into it.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone interested in something easy to use that does a nice job.  When my hair gets longer will do a follow up review and will probably give it a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> A great curling brush - unlike regular curling irons, the danger of getting burned is minimal.  Good for soft curling - unsure if tight curls could be achieved.</li>
            <li> Best curling iron/brush I have ever used!!!  I have fine hair and this appliance allows me to have a fuller head of hair with little effort.</li>
            <li> best product out there  dry and curl hair at the same time . but i do not use on long hair only shoulder length or short love it</li>
            <li> I must say that I&#x27;m very pleased with this hair dryer. I is just what I needed to tame my hair. My hair wants to curl naturally, but at the same time it tends to be frizzy. When I let it air dry, I just don&#x27;t get the full curls as I do with this unit. I am now using it all the time and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. My hair looks shiny, bouncy and full again. My only complaint is that it feels cheaply made. The on/off switch is in a bad place and feels loose, so it gets turned off easily by accident. Could have a more powerful motor, but for the price I guess you can&#x27;t complain, really.</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair which is fine yet slightly wavy.  The brush get tangled very easily.  I have to blow dry my hair with a blow dryer and brush first and then when almost dry, I can use this to style a bit.  I think a hot curling brush would be better for me.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this product. It is crap in my opinion and as a Salon owner, it could not be used in the Salon or at home. I donated it. The brush rolled and it was really hard to get the hair to stay in the brush. It has some &amp;#34;air&amp;#34; in it, but did not curl the hair and made my job harder. Sorry. Would suggest &amp;#34;Instant Heat Brush&amp;#34; 1 1/4&amp;#34; by Conair. It works.</li>
            <li> Having fine, thinning hair, I needed a brush I could manage well. I was always burning myself using a hot curling rod &amp; the results were not successful. This lightweight brush is so light &amp; easy to manage without tiring my arms. I recommend this brush to all who are seeking all of the above mentioned.</li>
            <li> Was a little dissapointed that the brush doesn&#x27;t actually rotate.  Otherwise a good buy and will work well for travel.</li>
            <li> Love this item.  Can&#x27;t find in store so I&#x27;m glad you have it</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years now and it is one of the few that works well for my type hair.  Also, the price is reasonable for what you get and lasts beyond what you would expect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this before and it does the job.  The only thing wrong is that they don&#x27;t last as long as they used to.</li>
            <li> this hot air brush is ok. However, it could be a bit hotter to straighten the hair. The heat on the hot side is just minimal</li>
            <li> I bought this one to use for when I had shorter hair.  It worked but died after only a few uses.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as ordinary curler...depending upon how long you hold the curl...but definitely almost as good as the &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; one as seen on T V...</li>
            <li> Broke before one use....Plugged it in to the outlet heard a &amp;#34;Pop&amp;#34; and then it didn&#x27;t turn on...Wasn&#x27;t worth trying to return for the price, but will NEVER buy this product again.</li>
            <li> barrel is too large &amp; it isnt hot enough. curls/waves dont last</li>
            <li> drys hair pretty good, not complaints.</li>
            <li> oh wow, do I love this, I who, don&#x27;t like wasting time on hair can finally curl. I use everyday, totally awesome product, doesn&#x27;t snag or pull hair out, love this.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised. Package and appearance good. Operation as expected. Good value.</li>
            <li> Hard to find a replacement for the one I have had for 10 yrs.  This works like it should.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Vidal Sassoon hot air brush for years and years.  I had used the 3/4\\&quot;, but could not find in stores; apparently the 3/4\\&quot; size is not made by Sassoon any longer, but I got the 1\\&quot; at Amazon and it&#x27;s great now that my hair is a bit longer.  I did buy a Salon Edition brand in the 3/4\\&quot; size, but it is not as good a product as Sassoon. It works fine, but the adjustment switch from low heat to high heat is not ideal - a bit clumsy and rough to move.  All in all, though, I&#x27;m please to have found a product at Amazon I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere else. My old Sassoon was SO old it started melting and left black flecks in my hair, but I got a good twenty years out of it, so no complaints here.</li>
            <li> I had one just like it for several years and used it until I wore it out. For the price, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I expected the item that I have always used for years. but, it came from America, and the 4 plug is not compatable with the plugs in Spain not even with an adapter. I ordered the item from Spain with Amazon, expecting it to come from the UK. I think that the power is also different here, (less than sent from America.)&lt;br /&gt;I cannot see why it was sent to Spain from America, so now I am unable to use the product that cost me so much in Postage.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed, I should have gone to England to get what I wanted. Now I am stuck with it, not using it, and cannot afford&lt;br /&gt;to return it.&lt;br /&gt;I will be reluctant to do this again, not knowing where it will come from. The product is a good one, but now no good to me.&lt;br /&gt;Anita Redmond</li>
            <li> Cheap and a piece of junk.  Threw it in a donation pile for my local thrift store.  Went back to professional products.</li>
            <li> Received very fast.  Exactly what was wanted.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have bought and it is perfect for my short hair. The first one worked beautifully for about 4 years. You will have to be careful to keep the lint filter free of buildup or it will stop working if it gets too hot--but it will run on high heat for quite a long time. Switching to low heat periodically seems to keep this from happening. It is compact and blows hot and fast! I can dry my hair in less than ten minutes and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This tool is the worst!! I have long hair and doesn&#x27;t matter how I used it tangled my hair so badly that I had to spend 10 mins untangling it hoping my hair won&#x27;t fall off or need to be cut from it. If you have long hair please don&#x27;t waste your money on this. I am really disappointed with my money down the drain.</li>
            <li> It does everything I expected it to.  Drys and soft curls.</li>
            <li> Needed the brush but it was too large for short hair.  Gave to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have used several different brands of stylers (conair, revlon, helen of troy)  This is the one that has worked the best and lasted the longest.  Last one I had lasted about 5 years.  I bought this when I saw it to put away for when the one I have now goes out (which it is already shorting out and I&#x27;ve had it less than a year.)</li>
            <li> I bought two of these because I dropped and broke mine and I couldn&#x27;t find one in the stores. You do have to be careful not to catch the base of the strand you are curling or the styler will get very tangled and the release feature doesn&#x27;t help. But I still think this is the best product for one-handed styling of fine hair. Others I tried had a very large handle which was uncomfortable in my hand or had so much power that my hair would blow all over the place and the style would blow right out. With practice I&#x27;ve learned not to get it tangled and I couldn&#x27;t style my hair without it.</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine &amp; thinning terribly as I age.  My other hot air brush had 1100 watts of power &amp; it caused my hair to frizz.  The heat was very damaging to my hair.  I usually resorted to using the cool setting, but it was not warm enough to curl well.  This hot air brush has the perfect amount of wattage for fine hair. I use the lowest setting on this brush.  It curls my hair without any frizz &amp; adds volume.  It would probably be better if it was the 3/4 inch size as my hair is so short, but it still works well.  My hair has just been cut so it is at it&#x27;s shortest length.  This brush would probably not be ideal for thicker &amp; longer hair if you wanted it to dry the hair as well as curl.  I spray my dry hair with a small amount of water &amp; then use the hot air brush to dry &amp; curl the hair.  I have not had a problem with my hair getting caught in the brush.  Overall, I am very pleased with this brush.  It was priced very reasonably also.**************** UPDATE****I have been using this brush daily for over 2 1/2 years &amp; it has not failed me yet!  I like it so much that I am ordering a back-up brush in the event that this one dies on me.</li>
            <li> I have used these for 10 years and nothing compares to how easy it is to do your hair.  Great for travel, too.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for the last 10-15 years. I&#x27;m on #3, so I think the product holds up well. I absolutely love the look of the soft curls this air brush provides.. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have reordered this item many times. Will not go off automatically like some I have used. Good size with 1 inch barrel. Not as expensive as most, have spent up to 45.00 on others, and they turn off before I am done.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I like the way it curls my hair. I have tryed 3 other products but keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> I have never been good at styling my hair.  Several years ago I got a bob haircut.  I tried this product and it made styling my hair easy.  I blow dry first then use it.  I get compliments all the time on my hair now.  I wore out my first one (that I purchased at a store) and couldn&#x27;t find another one so I found them on Amazon.  I ordered 2  because I would be lost without it.</li>
            <li> I could use a smaller barrel on it, but, all in all it is very good product and would recommend it as a purchase.</li>
            <li> The idea has merit I will give it that but it still does not replace a brush and hair dryer. It honestly took me more time to use the Hot Air Brush than it normally does to simple blow dry and style. It&#x27;s not a bad product if you have the time and effort to put into it, but until it is improved some more I will stick to a simple brush and dryer.</li>
            <li> I Have  arthritis in my hands and shoulders. AMAZON is the only place I can find this HOT AIR BRUSH. It dries and styles my hair and ZIP I&#x27;M out of here .</li>
            <li> I need a lower heat because my hair shafts are very fine and very easily  heat damaged. With this styler/dryer it is almost impossible for me to heat damage my hair and I love it because of that. My curls are soft and they last. But if you need or like high heat in your styler/dryer this is not the one for you.</li>
            <li> This is my third one over the last ten years, love it</li>
            <li> This is a great styling tool at a great price. I have bought so many much more expensive styling tools that I took back in a hurry due to the fact that they did not work.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised and was a quality product.  I searched for this product in five local retail stores and could not findthis anywhere.  Found it immediately when I searched on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I greatly appreciated that the product was of great quality, delivered as expected and there were no hassles or inconveniences in receiving the product. Would definitely recommend. this product.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m on my second one.  I love it solo much, I wanted a spare (just in case) first one goes out! Its so convenient...no need to blow dry...I use it with towel dry hair (slightly damp.)  Perfect!</li>
            <li> THEY WERE EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED  CAME PROMPTLY  WOULD RECOMMEND AS I HAVE USED THIS PARTICULAR ONE FOR YEARS  THANKS</li>
            <li> This was exactly as described….easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be as harsh and hot as my hair dryer was.  Very easy to control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years.  This is my favorite one.  they last for about a year and then need to be replaced and I keep buying them over and over and over.</li>
            <li> Best suited for use with long hair rather than short. Difficult to catch short hair to make enough curls as well as lift.</li>
            <li> All of the air brush stylers and dryers have the same construction.  The wire going into the end rotates.  That&#x27;s good for convenience but the wires inside break because of the twisting.</li>
            <li> I had gone through 2 helen of troy similar brush styler only to have trouble with them shutting down within seconds of starting apparently over heating, i bought the second one because i thought the 1st one was just a defective product, but apparently they all are. I purchased this one because it seemed to have the same brush which i love and for the price i figured if it didnt work out -- no big loss. Best purchase ever it does exactly what i want and has never shut down!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted an air brush that I could use on my thick shoulder length hair and this is perfect. I liked it so much I bought one for my mom as well. She has short thick hair and says it is great for styling. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for longer hair though. But short to shoulder length - this is a nice styling tool.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have kept the receipt on this item didn&#x27;t think I would have issues!  The item randomly turns off when it doesn&#x27;t turn off its like a car ready to stall out!</li>
            <li> Works very good, soft curl, easy  to use, light weight. I been using it for the last 14 years. Great product</li>
            <li> Its an a stopped item I hate it alot its not working good &amp; its hearts my hear dont bye it</li>
            <li> I am not talented enough to use both a brush and a blow dryer, and I always burn myself with curling irons. This is my second one and I love them. I use a regular blow dryer to do the main drying after I wash my hair, then use this brush/dryer to finish. The styling stays with out using hair spray or other styling products. My daughter has tried one, and is amazed at the results. I may have to buy another one, just to keep in case they&#x27;d quit making them. Totally recommend these...</li>
            <li> I love this dryer styler!  Its gentle on the hair.  It really works!  I bought the extra one for my mom.</li>
            <li> heats quickly, easy to use and swivel cord keeps from getting it tangled. Longer bristles help for a smoother hair style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and weak - takes a long time to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The end results are poor - leaves my hair dry, frizzy, and poofy.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this. Invest in a quality styler/dryer even if costs a bit more.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I wish they lasted longer - the average for me is two years but I use it every single day.  It&#x27;s made my life so much simpler, no curling iron, no straightening implements, etc. etc.  I dry my hair until slightly damp, use this hot air brush and I&#x27;m finished!</li>
            <li> Love this product, my mom and I both Order this one,  I would recommend  it for sure, and price isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> I have limited mobility in my arm and hand,- this all in one devise is a big help with this problem</li>
            <li> I wanted something to use to help style my hair. I found this very easy to use as well as saving time.</li>
            <li> It is a great product that I have been using until it broke down and I needed a new one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this thing did not work at all.  Very little heat and the spinning part did not spin.  Not worth the effort to pack up and return.  I guess there is a reason why it was so much cheaper than similar products.</li>
            <li> This is the best dryer/curler combo anyone has ever come up with.  Works great on every hair type...thick, thin, fine or course.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I got the impression that this hot air brush rotated all the time it was on or at least had a way you could get it to but it does not. Have been unable to find what I want in this item</li>
            <li> On my first try, I got so tangled that I spent 2.5 hours ripping hair out of the brush and still had to cut the thing out. If the product hadn&#x27;t been ruined by all this, I STILL wouldn&#x27;t dare to use it again. I had a similar brush for years and never once had a similar problem. Stay away!</li>
            <li> This may be a very good styler,however it does not do a good job of drying the hair. Could be for those with less thick/coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom she loves this one and could not find it in stores thank you for having it available!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is to use and it&#x27;s easy to release hair.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve bought other styles and gotten my hair tangled in my hair. I have fine hair and I&#x27;ve never had anynproblems. Yas, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I truly love the ease of using this air brush, but I have shorter hair and I learned that a 1&amp;#34; brush is really too big.  It heats quickly and was easy to use -- just too large.</li>
            <li> I like the was the product is made. that it comes apart to wash.  But, my hair isn&#x27;t quite long enough for the size of the barrel.  I&#x27;m trying to grow it out but it is nice having it short.  I had one a few years ago. but, you couldn&#x27;t take it apart to clean.  It got all gummy from hair products and I threw it away.  This one should be much easier to clean..Good price, too.</li>
            <li> I have tried for years to make my fine hair  have body and form and this is the item that worked for me.</li>
            <li> good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I returned this item. I have thick straight hair and this brush dryer did not have the blowing power to dry my hair quickly. I&#x27;m still using my blow dryer and a curling brush.</li>
            <li> I have had this same item for about 20 years and I have been looking for another one before mine dies, but still works.  I have not found one of the same model in any stores in my area. I do plan to order another one just like it but a smaller size since I now wear my hair much shorter. The one I had and this new one are both 1 inch in size. The product number is VS433C.</li>
            <li> My fine hair is thinning (age!!) and this brush provides just the &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; and wave my hair needs to add volume and somewhat disguise the thinning.  Sometimes I do have to be careful with it tangling in the hair, even when I use the release button, but with care it can be untangled without damaging hair. It has just about totally replaced my hair dryer.  (I usually let my hair air-dry for 15-20 minutes before using the brush, if I have the time.  That cuts down on the amount of heat I have to use on my hair.)</li>
            <li> EXACTLY AS I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> I never knew a product like this existed. Now I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very curly, and I used to just let it dry. Now I can style it just like a professional would.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has 2 controls. It ti so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Every woman/man should have one.</li>
            <li> My short, straight, grey hair needed a &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;, so I had high hopes for this brush.  It took a bit to get the knack of using it correctly, and drying my hair to just the right state of dampness, but, now, I&#x27;ve got it.  One great help in using the brush is being able to use two hands and hold the tip - which stays cool.  My curling iron was burning me half the time, so I feel that this brush is much safer, and, if you spend the time to figure how how to get the best result on your hair, you&#x27;ll be pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It is a poor inexpensive replica of the Connair  . . plastic barrel actually snapped in half in my luggage .  Glued it together but it isn&#x27;t a great product.&lt;br /&gt;The Connair has a metal barrel which gets slightly warm and helps dry and very much smoothes the hair.  Great reviews on this may be because others haven&#x27;t tried a better one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several conners over the years - all smooth and curl ALMOST dry hair perfectly.  As i now have shorter hair - i bought this for the smaller barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a good choice.</li>
            <li> Great product, I bought one at a store years ago &amp; I just repaced it with this one.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It powers off on it&#x27;s own after a few minutes and does not want to switch back on for another 15 minutes. Product works well when it does work, but it&#x27;s simply too unreliable.</li>
            <li> I had used this hot air type of curling iron for years. Mine finally died- but I couldn&#x27;t find one like it anywhere. So of course I just went to Amazon and not only found it but for half the price of my old one. I like it because it gives you soft looking curls- not the really defined ones that you get with a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> Love the way this styler works on my hair, but it overheats and won&#x27;t turn back on.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews stating the same thing and I will keep cleaning the filter on mine and am thinking of buying a second one as backup like they did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get beautiful curls and flips in my shoulder length hair with this tool and it&#x27;s easy to use.  The release button near the top of the shaft lets the brush part turn so you can just pull it out of your hair instead of &#x27;unrolling&#x27; it.  I prefer the thicker plastic bristles to the natural boar bristles because they don&#x27;t get tangled in my hair.  I just with they&#x27;d fix the overheating problem!</li>
            <li> I have only used this once so far.  I have never used any kind of curling irons or brushes, so this is a whole new experience for me.&lt;br /&gt;For not knowing what I am doing, my first attempt at styling my hair did not turn out too bad, except over the top of my head I could not get the curl to stay.  I think I need a smaller barrel brush for some of my hair.  Any problems I had was due to my inexperience rather than the styler.  This Vidal Sasson product seems to be well made and for the price I don&#x27;t think I am out much if I never am able to get the hang of using it on my hair.</li>
            <li> This works well on short thin hair. It give the same effect as a blow dryer and round brush but all in one for those of us that are not so coordinated.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand and model of Air Brush for years.&lt;br /&gt;It has been hard to find in the stores so I have purchased others.&lt;br /&gt;None of them work as good as this one.&lt;br /&gt;Great price and great product.</li>
            <li> The cord is too short to use comfortably in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this produce. Curls and drys my hair quick and easy. Does not get super hot but certainly does the job to which it is intended.</li>
            <li> This is great for those of us who can&#x27;t seem to get the round brush and the dryer working in unison.</li>
            <li> Not so much.  Easy to use but my fine hair gets caught it in all the time.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> it was not working properly</li>
            <li> Where has this styler/dryer been all my life? I have fine, medium-short hair that wants to curl always in the opposite direction of what I want, and lots of cowlicks that make it really hard to style. Because it isn&#x27;t super curly or thick, my hair just kind of goes &amp;#34;blah&amp;#34; after I blow it dry. I was ready to scrap growing it out and cut it ultra-short to avoid the headache of messing with it, but I bought this in a last-ditch attempt to find a cute way to style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I towel-dry my hair, add a golf-ball-size amount of mousse, then use this to dry and curl my hair. I get big, soft, pretty curls that make my hair super easy to style. My hair has unbelievable body and bounce after I use this styling tool. Before I used this, people were telling me I should probably just cut my hair short again, and since I started using this, those same people are saying how much they like how my hair looks. If you&#x27;re growing your hair out like I am, this tool is definitely a good one to help with those awkward in-between stages.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product, speedy delivery!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is of highest benefit when drying and styling my hair.  This is the second one I have owned as I had a larger one when my hair was a bit longer.  Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it, as I&#x27;m a bit &amp;#34;challenged&amp;#34; when trying to use a hair dryer and a separate brush to dry and style my hair.  Would highly recommend this drying/styling brush.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like my 1970&#x27;s hot comb, and this is it but so much better.  I let my hair dry to damp then  blow the rest dry with Sasson hot air brush.  so much faster styling time and my hair looks full, shiny and amazing. Thank you for selling this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent styling tool, especially for fine hair.  Have been using this particular brand for years, I always have a spare for backup.  Reasonably priced, Will purchase more.</li>
            <li> This styler doesn&#x27;t burn your hands or your head.  Adds a lot of body, easy to use.  My hair is relatively short (3-4&amp;#34;), but this size styler works really well.  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Product worked well for one week and then it would not turn on. I tried the reset button several times. Totally disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, it holds my hair without tangling, has just the right amount of airflow. Easy to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been very talented in doing my hair; holding a brush and blow drying at the same time. This neat, very handy, light-weight appliance is the answer. It dries and styles simultaneously. The size is just right for my medium length hair, and would be great for short hair as well. Love this appliance.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl my hair to well and it gets tangled.I though it was more of a mist to it.</li>
            <li> I WAS HOPING THAT THE BRUSH WOULD BE MORE SLENDER. IT IS NOT. IT DOES TANGLE THE HAIR. I USE IT SOMETIMES, BUT IT IS NOT THE IDEAL TOOL FOR MAKING YOUR HAIR BEHAVE. I&#x27;M LOOKING FOR A MORE SLENDER BRUSH.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very bad item , it just aplastic stick , very low heat ,weak blowing ,Bad item not working properly</li>
            <li> it needs more power  but its ok</li>
            <li> OK, not thrilled with it</li>
            <li> This brush dryer is great for lifting  and taming cowlicks. It has an AC cord, which is not shown.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my hair was too short, may e, so I gave away.</li>
            <li> This hot hair brush is just OK .. it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my liking and I also would prefer if the barrel was metal or ceramic to retain the heat.  I will probably give this one away to someone how has smoother hair. I have wavy, frizzy, semi thick hair so it just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me.</li>
            <li> For the price great size and ease of use.  Still have to use two hands.  Still tangled even short hair.  But great for travel and no pre-heating necessary</li>
            <li> Not very powerful. Doesn&#x27;t dry your hair even a little and takes forever to curl it under. And it isn&#x27;t exactly tangle-free either. I thought it was just okay.</li>
            <li> My hair was not going smooth when i Brush using this and Getting frizzy soon compare to when i dint style with this Brush. May be this is not Suited for my Hair type. Overall ok</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for years.  This is my third.  They never tangle your hair.  The cord never tangles.  Styles my hair quickly and effortlessly.  Curves and lifts the hair.  Smoothes while enhancing natural waves. Best when used to style almost dry hair dried with a regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This styled gives a little lift while drying hair.  Hair must be partly dry to use this. My hair is not to long.  I would recommend for shorter hair that is not too thick.</li>
            <li> I like this insert because it fits perfectly in the crocheted bags I make for my friends.  They have multiple pockets for all the things ladies like to carry.  I will order more as I need them.</li>
            <li> have used this product for over 10 years and love it! Would recommend it to anyone. Quick dry as i have short hair</li>
            <li> My wife tried several different types of  Hot Air Brushes, and all seem to have characteristic that did not meet her expectation. This Vidal Sasson was one she had before and really liked it. Problem was, none of the stores carried this model. So she found it on Amazon and bought. She will probably purchase another so she can have a back-up.</li>
            <li> This Air Brush did not work as promised.  It is not tangle-free and the curls do not hold!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of all styling tools. Cant live without it, I have three of them, so if one breaks down, another is waiting to take its place. Couldnt pay me enough to part with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying hot air brushes for nearly 25 years and for the price, this one cannot be beat. My last one kept on blowing for over 2 years of daily use after suffering with inferior ones twice the price.</li>
            <li> Great product I will buy another one</li>
            <li> Like low setting. works well with short hair. Does not last as long as it should.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find in my area, and I don&#x27;t care for the larger 1 1/2 or 2 inch sized one&#x27;s are they don&#x27;t work as well for my hair.  Thanks Amazon for always having what I need.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair appliance I have ever used. It&#x27;s advertised as tangle free, but it took me 20 minutes to untangle my hair from the brush AND it pulled a bunch of my hair out. My hair is shoulder length, but I would not even recommend it to someone with short hair. It is cheap plastic and does not unwind properly.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom for christmas and it work great on her shoulder length hair. Creates great curls with little frizz and keeps hair super soft. I used it on my elbow length hair and it curled the ends of my hair wonderfully, giving it some extra style.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon tangle free hot air brush styler is an awsome product. I &#x27;ve been using this product for 15 years now. I absolutely love it. I was very dissappointed for a while because I was not able to find it in any department stores. I am very glad to be able to get this product at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy this item locally.  The old ones kept cutting out on me, but this one does not.  They have improved this item and now it works wonderful.</li>
            <li> im so happy i found this product..it is exactly what i was looking for..i couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else. awesome</li>
            <li> I used an adaptor, plugged it in and BOOM huge sparks every. this product is NOT SAFE and a WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> I had a hot air brush similar to this for many years and it had quit working.&lt;br /&gt;When I went to replace it, I could not find another one in the stores. I bought 3 or 4 different styles trying to find something to replace my original, but was not satisified with any of them. They were either too large, too small, or did not have hot air.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this one on line, it looked very close to the one I had, so decided to try 1 more time to purchase a product that I liked. I was so pleased when I tried this one out for the first time. It was what I was looking for!&lt;br /&gt;It works great, the price was reasonable and I received it quickly.</li>
            <li> use it every day......love it !!!</li>
            <li> This is the only Air Brush that will work well with my fine hair. I tried many and did not like them as well. And my first one lasted for many years before I had to replace it.</li>
            <li> This works best on my hair and I can no longer find it in local stores.</li>
            <li> It kind of works - not powerful, but that is okay for finer hair. It seems rather flimsy and generates a funny smell when it is being used.</li>
            <li> Works well. I would not buy it if your hair is really thin though.</li>
            <li> This tool does what it says. It&#x27;s very low power and so you would not be able to actually dry your hair this way. Also, it over heats after 2 minutes of use and will not turn back on for 5-10 more minutes. It was frustrating to use. I don&#x27;t know how it would save time from a hair dryer and round brush, because it&#x27;s so low power I think this would actually take much longer. I would have given it one star but it&#x27;s cheap so I gave it another star. I returned this after one week.</li>
            <li> Gets tangled in my hair. Not sure if I&#x27;m doing something wrong but I have straight fine hair. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a good curl for long.</li>
            <li> Cheap, didn&#x27;t work.  I ordered 2 accidentally but ended up trying them both.  The first one stopped working immediately after plugging it in and the motor got really hot and smelled like burning plastic.  The second one worked intermittently at best and wasn&#x27;t worth keeping.  On the bright side, amazon was great about fast returns and I was refunded.  Save yourself some time and spend a little more for a better product.  I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
            <li> My hair is too short to use it, so I gave it to my granddaughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Have been using this air brush for many years and like how it works for my hair</li>
            <li> Bought this because of all the rave reviews of how fast you can get your hair styled. It does do a good job. The description doesn&#x27;t tell you about the curl release button, but it is a button that releases the hair from the styler without it getting tangled. That is a huge plus. The downside is that the wattage is so low, I have just gone back to my curling iron. To get desired results, you need plenty of time. Of course, my hair is longer so it may be great for shorter hair. I had one by another brand that blew as strongly as my hair dryer which is loud. You can even hear the phone ring when you are using this one. The curl release button is great but what I need is power.</li>
            <li> waste of money. I have semi-thick, long hair. It gets tangled and doesn&#x27;t curl. duh.</li>
            <li> Only for baby or toddler hair.</li>
            <li> Not as well made as I would have hoped for this brand name.</li>
            <li> Easier than using a brush &amp; a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Works ok.  Glad I did not spend a fortune on it.</li>
            <li> It is okay, but my short hair needs to grow out, before I will know if it serves the purpose or not.</li>
            <li> Absolute crap.  Died after using it twice, and I&#x27;ve only got fine, chin length hair.</li>
            <li> use it every day. very nice product.</li>
            <li> I love this crazy thing!  I have very wavy hair that is getting worse with age, and this works very well to smooth it and get it to lay down.  I wear my hair on the short side, but long enough that I can style it with this type of brush.  Styling fo rme works best when my hair is about half dry and then I can brush it from underneath.  This works excellent for that purpose!  I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 or 4 weeks now, and my average number of good hair days has increased tremendously!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Vidal Sasson hot air brush - love it</li>
            <li> This product works fine, my only complaint is that this product was shown when I searched for a revolving dryer/styler, 1&amp;#34; diameter, soft bristols. This revolves.... But only to &amp;#34;release&amp;#34; the hair from the rod.  I was searching for a styler/dryer like the infinity.... But in an 1&amp;#34; size curling rod.</li>
            <li> For those who are complaining this does not dry their hair, I don&#x27;t believe it was meant to do that. I believe it&#x27;s a styling tool, not a hairdryer. The heat sets the &#x27;curls&#x27; once you&#x27;ve damp dried or dried your hair. It&#x27;s good to lift the roots and curl the ends. I&#x27;ve been using this for at least three years after Conair stopped producing the one I used for ten years before that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it takes the place of what professional hair stylists do -- i.e., use a real brush/hand held dryer to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, it&#x27;s wonderful for people who want to use it to &#x27;style&#x27; their hair, not dry their hair.  For this, it&#x27;s excellent. Glad someone invented this tool. More than happy it&#x27;s available to purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product has not one good thing going for it. I would say that it at least blows hot air, but because of a short in the cord where it attaches to the handle it shuts off any time it is bumped.&lt;br /&gt;Upon that, it also doesn&#x27;t rotate, but instead has a &amp;#34;release&amp;#34; button to let the Barolo roll around once to help let the hair slide from the barrel. The bristles are also thick, hard plastic that is very spaced out. Being as such they don&#x27;t properly help guide hair through.&lt;br /&gt;No, just no.</li>
            <li> Stop to work after 2 times. ...after use 2 times the hot air brush not turn on any more  .</li>
            <li> This is a nifty little thing that I first found in a thrift store for $2. I was really happy to find it available here and put this one away as a spare!</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people have liked it and only after reading those reviews i bought it, i wanted a dual voltage air brush, and my hair is short,so i didnt need a thicker styler. but this one is very thin, not much hot air blows out of it, nor it styles at all . Its bad quality . so I returned mine</li>
            <li> This is the second one that was purchased. The first was about 10 years old when it broke.  Loved it so much found another one two replace it.</li>
            <li> This absolutely the best styler/dryer ever.  Hair becomes shinier.  One can create soft curls or waves by wrapping strands and holding for a few seconds, or create straight styles by brushing through from underneath.  Other similar products tend to tear hair because of the sharp plastic bristles.  Get this one!</li>
            <li> Works great.  I just wish they would last longer.  Overheats and shuts off after awhile.</li>
            <li> I love this curling brush.  I wish it lasted a bit longer however!</li>
            <li> I love this product, however, like many other customers I have to keep ordering it since it overheats and the motor gives out. I have faithfully cleaned the thing out time and time again. I wish the motor could be upgraded.</li>
            <li> I think it is the best hot air brush, because of the brush that does not have any bristles that helps to grab the thin hair much better than the ones that have them. It is not so hot , even in the highest position  and for my type of thin hair it is great. Having at the same time the curler and the dryer is one of the best ideas because you don&#x27;t get tired holding the dryer and the brush at the same time. It saves a lot of time.</li>
            <li> Loved it until it tangled in my hair about 1/2 around and had to yank out a big section of my hair!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me and It tangled my hair.so, had to return it. It really depends on ur hair type..</li>
            <li> This my 8th one!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This item works better than others I have used, even of the same brand.  Although I have combo fine brown hair and coarse white hair, this dryer does its work quickly.  At first, I used the brushy attachment, but it was difficult for me to maneuver (arthritis in shoulders).  I exclusively use the hard bristle attachment and have figured out how to hold and move it so I get maximum fluff and styling for my very short hair.  I would buy this model again.</li>
            <li> It works great, but the top keeps popping off and so the brush part likewise falls off. It&#x27;s light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This brush works so well for my short hair. I love the way it styles and dries all in one. I have others that were more expensive and I did not like them. I own 3 of these now. One is always in my travel bag. The brush gives body to my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Works well, glad I was able to replace a broken one.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a timely manner. I like the ease of using this product. The hair has to be towel dried. I have a short to medium length hair and it takes about 10-15 min to use his on my hair. I have natural curls on my hair. It does not make my hair stick straight which is fine as long as it straightens it some. It still leaves some volume on my hair but not puffy. The one inch barrel is just fine on using this on my hair.</li>
            <li> Best tangle free iron out there.  This is my 3rd one.  They do last a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the hard bristles.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I have bought several of them. You cannot fine them in any store. do wish that they had a bigger brush.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t reach hot setting after a month.</li>
            <li> The brush did exactly what I wanted it to, I no longer have to suffer through hand cramps using the blow dryer and round brush. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> This is a bad brush because the brush does not stay hooked in the slots when you curl your hair... it just spins forward without connection to the unit.  There is a release for the curls that works.  But getting your hair in the brush without it spinning is bad.</li>
            <li> Have been using for several years.  My favorite styler ever.</li>
            <li> HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS, AND WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND REPLACEMENT WHEN I WORE MY OTHER ONE OUT!!  CAME IN GOOD TIME</li>
            <li> My friend was looking everywhere for this product to no avail, she couldn&#x27;t find it.  I found it online and ordered it and gave it to her as a gift.  She was so happy as her old one she was still using was very dangerous as it was taped up and falling apart.  She was so glad to throw the old one away and get started on the new one!!</li>
            <li> This product lasted approximately one week before it broke - it will not turn on at all now.  I am going to send it back but have been too busy to do yet.  The bad part is that I really liked how it styled my hair!  But it is clearly junk.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed it did not have temperature control</li>
            <li> i just used it for 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not working&lt;br /&gt;after the first use it never worked&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000PY17PI Vidal Sasson VS433C Tangle-Free Hot Air Brush Styler and Dryer, 1 Inch]]</li>
            <li> I use this when traveling. If you have long hair it can get tangled pretty easily. I&#x27;ve had several of these &amp; they last fairly well. This is not a hair dryer. It works best on damp not wet hair. I wish it were stronger but for the price it&#x27;s okay. It is fairly noisy.</li>
            <li> they should take &#x27;tangle-free&#x27; off the description title.  I&#x27;ve used hot air brushes daily for years. This is the first one that tangles my hair EACH time I use it.  I would not recommend this</li>
            <li> I have had several of these over the years and am never disappointed, it is one of the most reliable</li>
            <li> This blow dryer curling iron has been my favorite for years.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this air brush for awhile. I love it. I should have purchased two of them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quick and easy way to dry my hair and style it at the same time.  The size is good for medium length hair. I have not been able to find this product in a retail store.&lt;br /&gt;Also, they only seem to work for a couple of years before they need to be replaced, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the brush that I have been using for years.  It cannot be found in any retail chain.  Thank you, Amazon!  It is perfect for those of us who cannot handle a brush and hairdryer at the same time and want a salon look.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I have had one for years and I finally wore it out. I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere/  I have fine, just below the shoulders length hair and it dries and adds body.</li>
            <li> I must have a defective brush?  It doesn&#x27;t rotate, or is there something I don&#x27;t know about it??  I&#x27;ve read the instructions, such as they are, and did not use it while sleeping, or placed it in water or even my coffee, or while bathing, or outside.  I&#x27;ve pushed all the buttons, let it cool between button pushing - well, I had no choice.  It wouldn&#x27;t turn back on.  Can&#x27;t find any more buttons than two to push..  The barrel IS supposed to rotate, right?  I think I&#x27;ve done everything to make it work, but no dice.  Return?  Exchange?  Recommendations on a different one?</li>
            <li> Not too sure if like... have rarely used</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and works great!</li>
            <li> Absolutely great. Easy to handle. Quite a change from what I am used to. i.e., learning how to hold the unit and curl at the same time but we will continue to try. I am sure I will conquer it. Rose</li>
            <li> I like this. I use my hair dryer for a short time to get excessive wet out &amp; then go to the hot air brush. Does a good job!</li>
            <li> Purchase this all the time.  Always satisfied.</li>
            <li> The brush works well for the price.  The only thing that would have made it better would be the dual wattage switch that would give it more widely scattered use in US as well as in Europe.  However, it does what the ad says it should.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found this product on Amazon!  I had bought one about 5 years ago at a department store, and when it broke one morning I was so unhappy. I have long hair and have tried other kinds of hot air brushes, the bristles on this one work the BEST. Hair doens&#x27;t get caught in the bristles at all. (No other company makes one like this that I can find.)  I searched on line and Amazon was the only place I could find it.  The shipping was right on, came when they said it would. The price was super!  And the hot air brush is exactly like the one I had.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> I have the world&#x27;s frizziest, thin hair.  Think Larry of the Three Stooges.  Nothing worked to smooth my hair more than a few minutes before this amazing gadget.  I have spent hundreds of dollars on fancy products, oils and the ever popular \\&quot;what-not\\&quot; only to end up with soft, nice smelling, frizzy, thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this as I was about to put down another hundred dollars for a similar gadget advertised on TV.  Not able to be sure of the results, I decided to try this less expensive option to see if it made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with complete bed head and dampened my hair then followed the directions to dry two inch sections of it at a time from underneath, then in the opposite direction occasionally since I wanted it straight, not curled.  I kept waiting for the top layer to make its Bozo fluff, but it never happened.  Not only that, but two hours later, my hair was still not frizzed up.  And it was humid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I feel like I have finally been let into the secret club of people that know how not to have fizzy hair, and this is it.  I refuse to lament all the lost bad hair years and will only look forward to the smooth, sculpted years ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, It&#x27;s so lightweight that at first I thought I just got a case with no insides, but it is really just lightweight.</li>
            <li> I love this styler. I guess it&#x27;s been around for years, but I&#x27;ve never heard of them!! I am in the process of growing out a pixie and I&#x27;m the awkward stages. I do have enough hair to use this so I&#x27;m happy. It&#x27;s nice that it gives volume. The only complaint that I would have is that the cooling fans are around the bottom of the handle so I often find myself grabbing the bottom and blocking the fans. It has a nice swivel for the cord at the bottom which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in combination with &amp;#34;Remington S5500 Digital Anti Static 1 Inch Ceramic Hair Straightener&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m just so happy. I used to have a tiny straightener since that was all that was needed, but this combination is perfect!</li>
            <li> It works great on my fine long hair!!</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> was a little bigger than I thought..doesn&#x27;t really blow that much air and just didn&#x27;t work for me..air could have been warmer.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it but unfortunately it stopped spinning the 2nd time I used it.  Going to inquire at VS if there is something that can be done.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live w/o this hair styler. My hair is very fragile and I can bend my hair under, w/o scorching my hair.</li>
            <li> I knew the one I have was going to burn out some day so I went ahead and bought two new ones so they would be available when the other ones finally go out.</li>
            <li> This blew up in my hand the first time I used it.  I emailed and heard nothing back.  This is a dangerous product and should be removed from the market.</li>
            <li> Was unable to use the curler because it was on American voltlage. Had to buy a transformer which made this an expensive exercise, really thought that it would have been noted somewhere.  The curler didn&#x27;t get quite hot enough so was very disiappointed, it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Very nice for a quick and easy hair style.</li>
            <li> This styler/dryer worked well for several weeks, then began cutting off while in use.  Unfortunately, I did not open it and start using it until about four months after I purchased it, so when the problem began I was already outside the return period.  Product should not have started having this issue since it had only been used such a short time.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product for quite some time now  It lasts a long time.  I replace it about every 5 years.  Every time I try to buy something different. I am disappointed.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I ordered two air brushes because they are hard to find in this size wand. LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;This wand style does not tangle or break the ends of your hair. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> After several years of daily use my old brush quit working. Purchased same product and love it. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice thought but it has absolutely no heating power. I have shoulder length hair and I need to use a hair dryer first and then this one. And forget trying to use the curl release - all that does is tangle my hair to the point that I was terrified I would never get it off me.</li>
            <li> As I can&#x27;t buy the one I have always had, this was a great replacement.  So far so good - it has performed perfectly.</li>
            <li> I bought this styler to replace a ten year old one that had finally started to wear out.  It works great!</li>
            <li> Dries and curls hair quickly, very quiet. Small enough to fit into a suitcase for travel.  Would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice brush styler. I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This one cuts out all the time. As if it has a short in the cord.  Not the usual quality.</li>
            <li> his item works the best for me i hope they never stop making them. You cannot buy them in stores i always have to order them T</li>
            <li> Please please don&#x27;t waste your money, don&#x27;t be fooled by the 4 start rating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-It blows so weak (it blows the same way you blow you hot coffee to get colder and I am not joking at all because I am so upset from this product).&lt;br /&gt;2- After being on for about 3-4 minutes it starts to smell like burning plastic.&lt;br /&gt;3- even though I don&#x27;t have that much hair, it is not able to give a little bit of style to my hair. I am going to give it to my little 7 years old niece who is interested to style her hair to play with it as a toy. It blows so weak and it does not get hot so it is ok for a little girl to play with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never written a bad review in Amazon before but I had to write this review because I am so so upset from my purchase and I don&#x27;t want others to do the same mistake.</li>
            <li> Love this tool. It keeps my hair from being frizzy. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Over all does a good job. Could be slightly smaller for my short hair.</li>
            <li> The best part of my hair routine, you can blow out a voluminous look in less than 10 minutes, I love this thing!!</li>
            <li> It thought the barrel would be smaller because I have a shorter hair, but over all, works good</li>
            <li> Great hair tool!!!! Gets the job done and cannot beat the price! I recommended it to all my friends!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought it would spin,, doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Great dryer!!!  This is my second purchase.  The first one lasted almost 5 years and I used it daily.  You dry and style your hair all in one easy step!  Best results when used on towel dried slightly damp hair. Best dryer/iron I&#x27;ve ever used on my baby fine hair.  I noticed other reviewers stating dryer shuts off after a few minutes but I&#x27;ve never had that problem.  Issue might be just on those with very thick hair.</li>
            <li> seems to help straighten my hair and dry it.</li>
            <li> I would have to disagree with the &amp;#34;tangle free&amp;#34; statement! It tangles my hair almost everytime I use it.Since I&#x27;ve used one of the brush stylers before, I do know how to use one. I have to grab a thick &amp;#34;bunch&amp;#34; of hair and not a small amount. But, I&#x27;ll figure it out.</li>
            <li> I get many hair wands and curlers and straighteners to review, and always hate all of them. This is the one I actually buy for myself and use. It straightens just enough and curls just enough without going to extremes or having to change attachments. Turns my bedhead into my hair do every morning and gets me out the door.</li>
            <li> right where the brush attaches it broke in half. I put tape on it to hold it together so I can use it longer. It broke within 3-6months since I purchased it but I rarely used it. So probably on my 20th day of using it broke. Its not expensive (i paid about $17) but I probably would have purchased a more expensive one had I known it easily breaks.</li>
            <li> I have had a Vidal Sasson hot air brush before and absolutely loved it so when I needed another one I ordered this one.  I was using it one morning and heard a loud click and the brush no longer worked.  I had it just over 30 days so it cannot be returned.  My recommendation is do not buy this.</li>
            <li> this brush is pretty good for touching up volume in my short and thinning hair.  it does not take the place of a curling iron but I use it mainly for volume and to curl my bangs a little.  nice to have and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Same problem as all of these that I&#x27;ve got. They all eventually stop working and burn out. I now went with a different type from bed bath and beyond that is like ionic curler like this. Like that one a lot more.. Doesn&#x27;t have a loud blower like this and this one only lasted me about a month.</li>
            <li> Burns out in a few months if you use the &#x27;high&#x27; button, but I still love this curler.</li>
            <li> I guess this is good if you know how to use it.  I have long hair and this thing got all tangled up.  I have to unplug it and call for my husband&#x27;s help.  I&#x27;m afraid to try it again.</li>
            <li> Not hot at all. Just warm. Doesn&#x27;t do any styling, just barely leaves a wave.  A bar dryer and brush work better !</li>
            <li> Giving it only one star, because after only a few uses, it made a loud popping sound &amp; quit working. Sounded like something broke off inside it. I loved it while it worked!</li>
            <li> Where was this item in the 60&#x27;s when I really could have used it instead of rollers? If you have naturally curly hair, and you like the smoother looks, this hot air brush is for you! Great price, and the ONLY place I can find it is on Amazon! I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> This is my third one. It is a must have for my hair. I do not do well with curling irons. This is better for your hair and safer.</li>
            <li> I have had many of these in the past, and the most recent one I purchased had poorer quality. It does not get as hot, so it doesn&#x27;t really seem to style my hair very well. They might have fixed the overheating problem, but they created a worse one. Back to the drawing board, Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li> This type of styler works better than any other for me.  I have very thick hair and other kinds get tangled up.  I don&#x27;t need the dryer part but that is the only way I can get the plastic brush with a 1&amp;#34; barrel.  I&#x27;ve used this model for years.</li>
            <li> This air drier is very good and is easy to use. Works very well and dries my hair and lets me style it very easy. Will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I had one previously and love it so much I looked all over for another one when mine died on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Worked just like advertised; price was excellent.</li>
            <li> tangle free, my butt...this thing almost had to be cut out of my hair...awful and then fell apart getting it out of my hair</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length thin soft curly hair and thought this would be a great product for me. I was so wrong! I took a 2 inch section of hair and pulled down straight - worked ok, then silly me decided to curl my hair around the brush the way it was intended to be used. Boy I was wrong. My husband spent 20 minutes RIPPING my hair out of the thing. It was either that or cut it out.</li>
            <li> my wife loves these. says works better than way more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> THE WORSE EVER ! Just had to cut 7 inches of my hair. I don&#x27;t who does the reviews but I will be thinking twice in the future even reading reviews ... I&#x27;ve been using these types of brushes for decades, and this is by far the worse buy ever . Barely warms up either . Check my picture and see my hairs still attached to this brush ! Big mistake.. Now got to cut my hair !</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my shorter hair. Quick dry and style. I wore out an earlier model. Tried some others but none had the power of the vidal sassoon.</li>
            <li> Great tool for those of us too clumsy to hold a brush in one hand and a hairdryer in the other and point them in the same place at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;But can overheat if you wrap your hair in it instead of keeping it moving.</li>
            <li> I like this Tangle Free Hot Air Brush, I like the way it feels I like the price! it is too bad I can not find it at any store.</li>
            <li> The Good:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The hot air brush has the right kind of bristles - soft tip rather than bristle brush, so you won&#x27;t have hair/bang breakage;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The brush does a good job of setting a curl in your hair;&lt;br /&gt;3.  This is not a complicated brush - 2 settings only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;1.  If you are expecting to dry your hair with the air brush styler, you will be unhappy.  The brush has very little blow power/force, thus making the styler only good for setting a curl, not drying a curl in place (unless you have hours to dry your hair);&lt;br /&gt;2.  There are only 2 settings - high &amp; low.  Since the brush doesn&#x27;t have much power to begin with, I&#x27;ve never tried the low setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a difficult time trying to find a hot air brush with soft tip bristles.  This one will do, but it wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice if there were real choices out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way better than a straighten iron. Does not damage my hair at all. Using this leaves my hair looking great and easy to use. I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about burning myself. Highly Recommended!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement item so I was already aware of it&#x27;s capabilities and wanted another like it but couldn&#x27;t find it at a local store.</li>
            <li> IT DOES A GOOD JOB DRYING AND CURLING BUT I THOUGHT THE BARREL ROTATED.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Tip of barrel falls off. Doesn&#x27;t warm to full capacity.</li>
            <li> This little powerhouse gives me curls, waves, or body, depending on my mood. It works great on wet or dry hair. I get compliments on my hair often, and asked what type of tool that I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the motor goes out on it often. I have to replace the curling brush yearly..even with keeping it clean and well maintained.</li>
            <li> The brush no longer rolls and the plastic brush part feels loose.&lt;br /&gt;it worked well the two times i used it.</li>
            <li> I thought the barrell automaticly turn and it doesn&#x27;t.  you have to twist it your self not self propelled  and the brissel are little hard to use on short hair like mine</li>
            <li> Barely any air comes out.  Takes forever.  If you have thick hair do not waste your time.  does not spin and gives a very frizzy curl.</li>
            <li> Just like using big curlers, but much faster!</li>
            <li> Love this drying brush. Hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> This works great with longer hair, mine was a little short but I will keep it while my hair grows out. I can only use on the longer back part right now.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time.  In fact I order them through Amazon when I need one.  Last time, I ordered 3 of them at once and 1 of them had a short in it right off the bat.  I didn&#x27;t return it because it wasn&#x27;t worth paying the shipping but usually, I can&#x27;t do anything with my hair without this Hot Air Brush.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This one is for me. Works great. Love it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more forced air. But it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I have used this hot air brush for several years now.  This was a replacement.  It works well on my fine hair.  I have problems using any other type of styling tool because my hair will not stay on the roller.  The plastic combs help to hold my hair on the curling brush to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> I really like it - I dry my hair to just damp and then use it to style.  It is nice to take on trips.</li>
