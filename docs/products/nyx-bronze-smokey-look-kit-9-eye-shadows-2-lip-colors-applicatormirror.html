            <li>I got it on the cyber Monday sale for $7.20, which is a fair price for 5 usable shades.  </li>

            <li>She liked it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the shades in this kit are all beautiful and complimentary.</li>
            <li>The shades are good, but the pigmentation is light.  </li>
            <li>Love the colors and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more form NYX.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products by NYX.</li>
            <li>Love it, all the colors I need for Gold and Bronze Look.</li>
            <li>I use eye shadow couple times a week, so I am happy with this pallet, it is  true to the color, decent pigments, use a primer which always helps!</li>
            <li>Also the mirror is soo clear and works great.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Good beginners eyeshadow and a decent price</li>
            <li>Easy to apply - super easy to store and take on the go.</li>
            <li>right most corner of the kit) to my lid.</li>
            <li>I still think it is worth it for the eyeshadows!</li>
            <li>I love NYX products and this one really delivers!  </li>
            <li>The shadows are nicely pigmented, so it&#x27;s not hard to build up intensity or blend.</li>
            <li>I like that I can create many looks with this very travel friendly product.</li>
            <li>and I personally feel this set gives me as good as the pigments as MAC.</li>
            <li>The kit is tiny and it&#x27;s good for travel or for keeping in the purse.  </li>
            <li>I love the eyeshadows of this pallet but the lipsticks didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and you wear proper eye makeup only on special occasions, then this kit is perfect for you.</li>
            <li>When used over an appropriate pencil, they give decent color payoff.    </li>
            <li>Initially I was impressed with this pallet before having actually used it.</li>
            <li>I find the 2 gold and 3 bronze shades to be useful.  </li>
            <li>the lip gloss isn&#x27;t worth $0.02</li>
            <li>The bronze colors eye shadow are nice, just so tiny, I&#x27;ve never seen any eye shadow</li>
            <li>It is alittle bigger in life but overall very nice as a gift.</li>
            <li>Even when I blended very lightly all of the colors homogenized together  on my lid and came out to be one big unattractive shimmery gold color.  </li>
            <li>good pigments, I have few MAC eye shadows</li>
            <li>Kat Von D comes close with her bronze and green palette (and kicks butt with her gorgeous packaging), but they don&#x27;t give quite the \\&quot;pop\\&quot; that these colors do.</li>
            <li>This NYX Bronze Smokey Palette contains a good  selection of quality highly pigmented golden tan neutal eyeshadows in a very compact black container</li>
            <li>big - tiny - but good for the purse for touch ups during the day.</li>
            <li>These colors are brilliant, especially for green or hazel eyes - or any color eye with gold specs or rim.</li>
            <li>Nice colors, well pigmented, average</li>
            <li>Just the only problem i faced was that the slot on the bottom of the palette opens up quite easily, just be carful.</li>
            <li>I took the center light color and applied that as a high light just under my brow.</li>
            <li>I noticed immediately that they are very powdery.</li>
            <li>Other then that im IN LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice but they dont last long and crease alot if you dont use primer underneath.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize my IT makeup brush was almost bigger than the color square, be aware of that.</li>
            <li>One, the colors are amazing, so vibrant and they last for a very long time, also, the delivery was 3 days EARLY then its expected date of delivery.</li>
            <li>If you want the light   look to the heavy look.</li>
            <li>and also there isn&#x27;t much color difference between the golds when they are actually applied to the lid.</li>
            <li>So that 9 shadows really come out to be about 3 possibly 4 different shades.  </li>
            <li>Was really surprised this was so \\&quot;tiny.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>This shadows are very tiny, but looks well on my sister, was a gift, she has a little bit white skin, and it&#x27;s fine to wear.</li>
            <li>The dark brown has too much gold shimmer in it for my liking.  </li>

            <li> The lip gloss was in a very thin layer/weird.  </li>
            <li> However, the shades work well over a Nyx eye pencil used as a base.  </li>

            <li> The colors are nice but they dont last long and crease alot if you dont use primer underneath. You have to reapply by afternoon as the color fades. I dont think I will purchase make up from here again.</li>

            <li> I love this! The colors are so nice and warm. I havent tried the lip colors but the eye shadows are really nice. I thought this kit would be a lot bigger but it&#x27;s the size of my palm.</li>
            <li> Love it, all the colors I need for Gold and Bronze Look. good pigments, I have few MAC eye shadows and I personally feel this set gives me as good as the pigments as MAC. I use eye shadow couple times a week, so I am happy with this pallet, it is  true to the color, decent pigments, use a primer which always helps!</li>
            <li> I bought it based on steller reviews.  The shades are good, but the pigmentation is light.  However, the shades work well over a Nyx eye pencil used as a base.  There are 6 metallic shades, and 3 matte ones.  I find the 2 gold and 3 bronze shades to be useful.  When used over an appropriate pencil, they give decent color payoff.    I got it on the cyber Monday sale for $7.20, which is a fair price for 5 usable shades.  The kit is tiny and it&#x27;s good for travel or for keeping in the purse.

            <li> Nice bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyeshadows-Nice colors, well pigmented, average last wear.&lt;br /&gt;Lipgloss-I can&#x27;t imagine these colors would look good on anyone. I&#x27;ll only be using the eyeshadows-the lip gloss isn&#x27;t worth $0.02</li>
            <li> I love the eyeshadows of this pallet but the lipsticks didn&#x27;t work very well. I still think it is worth it for the eyeshadows!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good palette. I got this product for my daugther.She liked it.</li>
            <li> This shadows are very tiny, but looks well on my sister, was a gift, she has a little bit white skin, and it&#x27;s fine to wear.</li>
            <li> I love NYX products and this one really delivers!  The colors are awesome for smokey eyes and the lip color/gloss is great!  A must have in all make-up bags!</li>
            <li> I love these colors with a tan (fake of course!) The only thing is that this compact is small!! I would totally recommend this but just know that it&#x27;s 2 1/2 by 2 1/2 inches big - tiny - but good for the purse for touch ups during the day. Great staying power with an eye primer.</li>
            <li> Shaddows are really nice, i love them!! there colors are very nice and bronzy,&lt;br /&gt;lipsticks are bad, but i bought it anyway for the shaddows!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my younger sister as a starter pallet because she is just starting to use makeup and  the colors online appeared to be neutral and non offensive. I also got one for myself so that we could practice makeup together. Initially I was impressed with this pallet before having actually used it. I loved that the pallet has 9 shadows.  However once I applied the shadows to my lids I noticed immediately that they are very powdery. This to me is a determent because the shadows get every where and also there isn&#x27;t much color difference between the golds when they are actually applied to the lid. So that 9 shadows really come out to be about 3 possibly 4 different shades.  The shadows don&#x27;t  blend very well and every single one of the nine shadows is heavily shimmered.  This includes the dark brown. The dark brown has too much gold shimmer in it for my liking.  This NYX Smokey Look Kit would be nicer if one or two of the shadows were matte for the crease. One of the looks I tried rather unsuccessfully was to apply the gold  (that is located in the bottom right most corner of the kit) to my lid. There was very little color pay  off from that shade.  I then used the darkest brown in my crease and blended and last I took the center light color and applied that as a high light just under my brow. Even when I blended very lightly all of the colors homogenized together  on my lid and came out to be one big unattractive shimmery gold color.  I will try and continue to work with this pallet but for now I can only give 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Good beginners eyeshadow and a decent price</li>
            <li> Was really surprised this was so \\&quot;tiny.\\&quot;  The lip gloss was in a very thin layer/weird.  The bronze colors eye shadow are nice, just so tiny, I&#x27;ve never seen any eye shadow this small but some of the color go well with brown eyes and it only takes a very little.</li>
            <li> Okay, i have a couple of great things to say about this product. One, the colors are amazing, so vibrant and they last for a very long time, also, the delivery was 3 days EARLY then its expected date of delivery. Also the mirror is soo clear and works great. I totally recommend buying this. Just the only problem i faced was that the slot on the bottom of the palette opens up quite easily, just be carful. Other then that im IN LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li> These colors are brilliant, especially for green or hazel eyes - or any color eye with gold specs or rim. They are also a blend of sparkle and matte - fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the pigmentation is a bit lack luster, so staying power is not 5 star.  I am almost through my pallate, and will probably buy another because I have not found another like it. Kat Von D comes close with her bronze and green palette (and kicks butt with her gorgeous packaging), but they don&#x27;t give quite the \\&quot;pop\\&quot; that these colors do.</li>
            <li> This NYX Bronze Smokey Palette contains a good  selection of quality highly pigmented golden tan neutal eyeshadows in a very compact black container</li>
