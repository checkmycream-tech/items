            <li>Good for first timers since it is inexpensive and does a nice job.</li>
            <li>This is a nice curling iron - it heats up very fast, has a comfortable handle and produces great results.</li>
            <li>I used the top heat setting but it is adjustable.</li>
            <li>even though Im paying more this time.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace this $20 Vidal Sassoon gold plated one and this one is SOOO much better.</li>
            <li>Now, I get nice smooth</li>
            <li>I had to make sure, after each curl, to check the number on the dial.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the design seemed OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to do a couple more test runs</li>
            <li>It heats up really quickly and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this iron is more for styling than curling</li>
            <li>and the curl stayed without uncurling the whole time I was doing my hair!!!</li>
            <li>This baby heats up real fast and has heat settings!</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good curling iron.</li>
            <li>It did however style my hair quite easily, cute, and fast.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is awesome because it has a long shaft so you can fit a good amount of hair in it if you want, it&#x27;s got a big enough tip</li>
            <li>but i wasn&#x27;t really convinced it was going to work because i have bought so many styling products and non of them ever really worked, so when i got the conair curling iron and tried it i was amazed with the results my hair looked exactly as if my hairdresser did it and the curls lasted for three days, so i recommend this for every girl out there, ENJOY !</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t seem like it got very hot, even at the highest setting..</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I have been searching for.  </li>
            <li>I did too much research on trying to find a curling iron that was dual voltage and in the end, this one wasn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>More like just flipped the ends up and left dents in my hair.  </li>
            <li>This was the first ceramic iron I used.</li>
            <li>so that your fingers don&#x27;t get burned, the heat setting can be as hot as hot</li>
            <li>&amp; I curled my hair on a very humid day, it didn&#x27;t get frizzy stayed soft all day &amp; the curls stayed!!!!</li>
            <li>My curls fell out very soon after I used the vidal sassoon one even if I used hair products.  </li>
            <li>Not something you can really work with either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, I had a little problem with a ridge from the clip, but with some practice I was able to adjust the angle of the iron in order to eliminate that.</li>
            <li>I broke my first the other day trying to cool it off fast with water.  </li>
            <li>But beyond that fact, I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to curl with this particular curling iron.</li>
            <li>I love the 60 second instant heat-up &amp; that it has 30 temperature settings.</li>
            <li>Decent price.</li>
            <li>sucker heats up fast and I love that feature.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as some, and doesn&#x27;t heat any faster than a regular iron.</li>
            <li>Usually curls don&#x27;t last very long on my straight hair, but with this one it lasts me a full day!!!</li>
            <li>I have fine limp hair and this would curl it and hold.</li>
            <li>After nearly 3 months of use, the curler quit heating completely.</li>
            <li>I have thick, coarse, curly hair that looks a heckuva lot better blow-dried straightish, then curled with a curling iron.</li>
            <li>can be for a quick curl, IT&#x27;s PURPLE, it will turn off automaticly if left on by accident, but not so soon that you find yourself with a cold rod, it comes with a heat resistant cover so that if you must leave it cool, you can cover it so it won&#x27;t burn anything,</li>
            <li>Which it normally does with other curling irons.</li>

            <li> The ONLY complaint, which isn&#x27;t that big of a deal</li>

            <li> I have thick Asian hair so that might have been another reason why my curls never stay.  </li>
            <li> The only real problem I can see is that the heat setting dial is in a bad location.</li>
            <li> , I wish the cord was a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> I do have relatively thin hair, but I had a problem with it not holding my hair tight enough when trying to curl it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes turns off or takes a few times to turn on.</li>
            <li> I went back for another test run 11/26/11 and still am very unhappy about the MAJOR crease</li>
            <li> no easy returns on something over 30 days!</li>
            <li> I have hard to tame,hard to curl, frizzy/dry hair.</li>
            <li> hard to find for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too thick.</li>
            <li> But only because I&#x27;m a clumsy little moron.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t let this touch your head, ( as I did several times, oooh that is painful and takes awhile to heal)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not so hard to do for the price!</li>
            <li> By this time, all the packaging material has been discarded and your return policies seem confusing and difficult...</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick (very thick!!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not impressed.</li>
            <li> This curling iron has done nothing wrong.</li>
            <li> This one does it bad!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased the Infiniti 1-1/4 Inch by Conair MI29R Ceramic Hair Curling Iron. After nearly 3 months of use, the curler quit heating completely. By this time, all the packaging material has been discarded and your return policies seem confusing and difficult... no easy returns on something over 30 days!</li>
            <li> I have hard to tame,hard to curl, frizzy/dry hair. My hair is thick (very thick!!) I curled my hair with this and the curl stayed without uncurling the whole time I was doing my hair!!! Which it normally does with other curling irons. I didn&#x27;t have to spray each section that I did after, I was so Happy. &amp; I curled my hair on a very humid day, it didn&#x27;t get frizzy stayed soft all day &amp; the curls stayed!!!! I&#x27;m sooooo veryy happy that I bought this curling Iron, it&#x27;s the best iron I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Good iron. Sometimes turns off or takes a few times to turn on. Overall it&#x27;s a good curling iron. Happy with my choice. The barrel width is a little bigger than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I have been searching for.  Does a great job and is very easy to use. Shipping was great.</li>
            <li> did the job great price</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it, so I guess it was a very nice gift.  the item works perfect for her hair, good quality.</li>
            <li> I did too much research on trying to find a curling iron that was dual voltage and in the end, this one wasn&#x27;t! But beyond that fact, I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to curl with this particular curling iron. I have thick, coarse, curly hair that looks a heckuva lot better blow-dried straightish, then curled with a curling iron. I don&#x27;t need to use any styling products to get curls to stay in my hair, but this curling iron compared to the one I use at home in Italy, which isn&#x27;t ceramic tourmaline but metal, was immediately donated to a friend. Oh well.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in, turned up the heat setting and waited about 5 minutes.  I have curled my hair numerous times in the past with other irons, but this iron did NOT curl my hair.  More like just flipped the ends up and left dents in my hair.  NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This was the first ceramic iron I used. Good for first timers since it is inexpensive and does a nice job. It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as some, and doesn&#x27;t heat any faster than a regular iron.</li>
            <li> Im back here 20 months after I bought this, because it broke and I want another one. &lt;br /&gt;This sucker heats up fast and I love that feature. Just don&#x27;t let this touch your head, ( as I did several times, oooh that is painful and takes awhile to heal) I used the top heat setting but it is adjustable. I have fine limp hair and this would curl it and hold. &lt;br /&gt;Very hard to find for me. Im getting another one, even though Im paying more this time. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace this $20 Vidal Sassoon gold plated one and this one is SOOO much better. My curls fell out very soon after I used the vidal sassoon one even if I used hair products.  I have thick Asian hair so that might have been another reason why my curls never stay.  But with this curling iron I can sleep on my curls and my hair still stays relatively curly the next morning.  The 1 1/4 creates beautiful curls too.</li>
            <li> I love the 60 second instant heat-up &amp; that it has 30 temperature settings. At first, I had a little problem with a ridge from the clip, but with some practice I was able to adjust the angle of the iron in order to eliminate that. Now, I get nice smooth curls.&lt;br /&gt; The only real problem I can see is that the heat setting dial is in a bad location. With every curl, my thumb would accidentally change the dial. I had to make sure, after each curl, to check the number on the dial. That&#x27;s not so hard to do for the price!</li>
            <li> Great Curling Iron! This baby heats up real fast and has heat settings! And the Curls look amazing, they are lose and stylish!&lt;br /&gt;However you do need t have long hair since the iron it&#x27;s too thick. My hair is cut in layers and this didn&#x27;t work for a while on my shorter ones. Usually curls don&#x27;t last very long on my straight hair, but with this one it lasts me a full day!!!</li>
            <li> Great curling iron. Decent price. Heats up immediately and it doesn&#x27;t singe your hair (as long as you know how to use a curling iron). Long lasting too!!! I love it...</li>
            <li> Why I have bought this curling iron twice now.  I broke my first the other day trying to cool it off fast with water.  This curling iron is awesome because it has a long shaft so you can fit a good amount of hair in it if you want, it&#x27;s got a big enough tip so that your fingers don&#x27;t get burned, the heat setting can be as hot as hot can be for a quick curl, IT&#x27;s PURPLE, it will turn off automaticly if left on by accident, but not so soon that you find yourself with a cold rod, it comes with a heat resistant cover so that if you must leave it cool, you can cover it so it won&#x27;t burn anything, lastly my hair NEVER gets caught in the handle like it will with some others  The ONLY complaint, which isn&#x27;t that big of a deal, I wish the cord was a little bit longer. &#x3D;) This is a great buy!!!</li>
            <li> I sent this item back after using it only one time- I&#x27;m just not impressed. I do have relatively thin hair, but I had a problem with it not holding my hair tight enough when trying to curl it. It also didn&#x27;t seem like it got very hot, even at the highest setting.. Otherwise, the design seemed OK.</li>
            <li> To tell you the truth i ordered it but i wasn&#x27;t really convinced it was going to work because i have bought so many styling products and non of them ever really worked, so when i got the conair curling iron and tried it i was amazed with the results my hair looked exactly as if my hairdresser did it and the curls lasted for three days, so i recommend this for every girl out there, ENJOY !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to do a couple more test runs but so far this is an epic fail. You know that crease that you DON&#x27;T want from a curling iron?! This one does it bad! I have hair down my back and I won&#x27;t for long if I use this. It does the worst creases I&#x27;ve ever seen a curling iron do. Not something you can really work with either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made this review on 11/25/11. I went back for another test run 11/26/11 and still am very unhappy about the MAJOR crease this iron makes. I&#x27;m pretty sure this iron is more for styling than curling so if that&#x27;s what you looking for this probably isn&#x27;t the iron for you. It did however style my hair quite easily, cute, and fast. Not sure yet If I&#x27;m going to keep it and risk the major creasing or not.</li>
            <li> This is a good curling iron for the price. It does a good job curling my hair with appropriate size of curls. However, I find my hair doesn&#x27;t stay for long and falls straight, but that is typical for my hair type. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice curling iron - it heats up very fast, has a comfortable handle and produces great results.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent curling iron. I bought it two years ago and it&#x27;s still working great. It heats up really quickly and is very easy to use. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it. This isn&#x27;t to say I haven&#x27;t burned myself a couple times - because i have. But only because I&#x27;m a clumsy little moron. Don&#x27;t let that prejudice you against this curling iron. This curling iron has done nothing wrong.</li>
