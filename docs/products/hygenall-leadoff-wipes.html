            <li>Great product, excellent price... fast delivery</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>and they come in handy for wipeing my hands and face off.</li>
            <li>Nice to throw in the car when going to the range or throw on the bench where your reloading.</li>
            <li>Great for an outdoor gun range where you cannot quickly wash up when finished.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re working on five-to-ten guns at a time (think armorer duty or gunsmithing, or an annual spring cleaning of the gun safe), these wipes do a nice job of cleaning up your hands afterward.  </li>
            <li>It gets into your body mostly by being inhaled or eaten.</li>
            <li>I want to say slimier, but maybe smoother is a better description...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t say that about many things.  </li>
            <li>However, you&#x27;re going to pay over 3x more (per wipe) for the convenience.  </li>

            <li>There are studies that say that using special wipes is more effective in removing lead than washing with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Works great and there&#x27;s plenty of soap/fluid in the plastic can, meaning the wipes stay nice and wet for the life of the can.</li>

            <li>kit than having to deal with a huge container,</li>
            <li>This wipe gives me peace of mind &amp; clean hands and is convenient to carry along on my plein air excursions.</li>
            <li>These wipes clean the copper tarnish off your hands from loading magazines as well as the lead from firing.</li>
            <li>My hands are clean when I get in the truck to drive home from the range.</li>
            <li>We have our gun cleaning area set up in our basement, and having these wipes nearby helps to clean any residual lead from our hands.  </li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>kind of like maybe the LeadOff wipes have some sort of hand lotion built into them, but it&#x27;s a different feeling than that.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These wipes are pricey (IMO), but I think they&#x27;re worth it.  </li>
            <li>These wipes are pricey (IMO), but I think they&#x27;re worth it.  </li>
            <li>It cleans nicely and helps reduce the exposure to lead our instructors experience on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>The same is true after several hours of training at the range, which is especially important before eating lunch.  </li>
            <li>does the job just right.</li>
            <li>I had a long day at the range most of the fingers wiped off pretty easy, had to scrub a bit to get everything off my thumb from loading magazines</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware that there was a product like this on the market.</li>
            <li>Seems to do a better job than regular wipes and doesn&#x27;t leave hands sticky.</li>
            <li>Cleaning up your hands AND face - the two parts of you most exposed to lead fumes/ GSR at the firing range - is essential.</li>
            <li>but I use the wipes first.</li>
            <li>Clearly this item (i.e. the canister) is your best value for the wipes.a regular Wet Wipe (cleaning) and Purell hand sanitizer (removing germs).  </li>
            <li>These come in smaller packaging that you can easily keep in your range bag so that it&#x27;s always with you when are done shooting.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t describe the feeling...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Total lead removal confirmed with lead tester.</li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>15 September 2012 -- I recently discovered that the these wipes use technology licensed from the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to trap lead, and that the CDC considers this specific technology, and these wipes, to be effective.  </li>
            <li>In the original review above, I said that these were pricey.  </li>
            <li>In the original review above, I said that these were pricey.  </li>
            <li>You can get totally clean by using a wipe, then washing with soap and water, and finally using another wipe.</li>
            <li>If nothing else, though, I at least feel better (psychologically) using a product claiming to be designed for lead removal. :-)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ideally, I should be using something that gets the lead dust off of my face and can wipe down more than just my hands.</li>
            <li>As soon as you&#x27;re able to wash with regular soap &amp; water everything is back to normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The dispenser mechanism leaves a little to be desired, but it is OK.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know why I even mentioned it, but it is a unique characteristic of this product.  </li>
            <li>Normally, when I go to the range, I just wash may hands with the provided soap after I&#x27;m done shooting.</li>
            <li>I use them right at the range before getting back into my car (and contaminating my steering wheel and shift knob).  </li>
            <li>The wipes are easy to access, easy to use - like a wash cloth - and do not leave a sticky residue on your skin or dry it excessively.</li>
            <li>product description says these wipes also remove dirt, grime, and most common germs.  </li>
            <li>However, at present they are only available from Marketplace sellers, not direct from Amazon, and you have two options: $13.37 for a 5-pk or $29.99 for a 25-pk (both prices include shipping).  </li>
            <li>I always use these with the kids, especially the five year old.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tested for how well they remove lead, but they leave my hands freaky clean feeling after use, so it at least feels like they work.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, lead is a potentially significant problem.</li>
            <li>I still think they&#x27;re a little expensive (compare to a 40-count cannister of Wet Wipes @ $5.74), but the new lower price is more reasonable.  </li>
            <li>It would certainly be a lot easier to pack a few individual wipes into a range bag or armorers</li>

            <li> For some reason, these don&#x27;t seem to clean the little crevices between your fingernails &amp; skin as well as, say, a plain Wet Wipe; but you can still get the job done with a little extra effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At the time of that review this item was going for $11.99/canister, so the price has actually come down a couple bucks now.  </li>

            <li> Due to working in a lead shop, I use them on my skin and keys anything that has been in work with me</li>

            <li> I was not sure of these lead wipes but bought it based on the feedback here on Amazon.</li>

            <li> No more dried out hands!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While these wipes might do a great job of removing crud from your hands, I was disappointed that they didn&#x27;t also remove the nasty solvent smells as well.  </li>
            <li> had* changed to a less expensive brand, but I&#x27;m throwing them away and re-ordering these.  </li>
            <li> This is probably not a good thing.</li>
            <li> after blasting through 22&#x27;s until your tired, then this is it.</li>
            <li> Alas, the hands still smell like gun cleaner for hours after cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> This is a great product. I wasn&#x27;t aware that there was a product like this on the market. I do alot of target shooting and they come in handy for wipeing my hands and face off.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t swabbed my hands and analyzed the lead levels before and after, but if you don&#x27;t have any other options for hand washing and don&#x27;t want to touch all your stuff, steering wheel on the way home, etc. after blasting through 22&#x27;s until your tired, then this is it. Seems to do a better job than regular wipes and doesn&#x27;t leave hands sticky.</li>
            <li> I was not sure of these lead wipes but bought it based on the feedback here on Amazon. This stuff works. I had a long day at the range most of the fingers wiped off pretty easy, had to scrub a bit to get everything off my thumb from loading magazines but it got all the lead and powder residue off. So much better driving home from the range and not gumming up the steering wheel of my car with dirty hands from the range.</li>
            <li> Seriously, lead is a potentially significant problem. It gets into your body mostly by being inhaled or eaten. Cleaning up your hands AND face - the two parts of you most exposed to lead fumes/ GSR at the firing range - is essential. IF this product performs as advertised it is a great addition to your range bag. The wipes are easy to access, easy to use - like a wash cloth - and do not leave a sticky residue on your skin or dry it excessively. I still wash with soap and water whenever possible but I use the wipes first.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am an oil painter who paints with lead paints &amp; cadmiums. This wipe gives me peace of mind &amp; clean hands and is convenient to carry along on my plein air excursions.</li>
            <li> Use it and I think it works.</li>
            <li> The Wipes are Great! The only thing that kept it from receiving 5 Stars is the dispensing lid. Come on, Hygenall...make an improvement on the lid and we&#x27;ll all give it the 5 Stars it deserves.</li>
            <li> Use these wipes as you&#x27;re putting your gear away at the range. Good for hands &amp; face. There&#x27;s lots of liquid on these wipes!</li>
            <li> does the job just right. i like the fact that you can use it on your face too. and i like the after smell</li>
            <li> I use these everyday! Due to working in a lead shop, I use them on my skin and keys anything that has been in work with me</li>
            <li> Great product. Nice to throw in the car when going to the range or throw on the bench where your reloading.</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent price... fast delivery</li>
            <li> Works great and there&#x27;s plenty of soap/fluid in the plastic can, meaning the wipes stay nice and wet for the life of the can.</li>

If nothing else, though, I at least feel better (psychologically) using a product claiming to be designed for lead removal. :-)  Plus they&#x27;re endorsed by the CDC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re working on five-to-ten guns at a time (think armorer duty or gunsmithing, or an annual spring cleaning of the gun safe), these wipes do a nice job of cleaning up your hands afterward.  Everything comes off (grease, oil, solvent, and hopefully lead).  The same is true after several hours of training at the range, which is especially important before eating lunch.  For some reason, these don&#x27;t seem to clean the little crevices between your fingernails &amp; skin as well as, say, a plain Wet Wipe; but you can still get the job done with a little extra effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While these wipes might do a great job of removing crud from your hands, I was disappointed that they didn&#x27;t also remove the nasty solvent smells as well.  Alas, the hands still smell like gun cleaner for hours after cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned Wet Wipes earlier.  My hands feel &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; after using these wipes than they do after using a Wet Wipe.  I really can&#x27;t describe the feeling... I want to say slimier, but maybe smoother is a better description... kind of like maybe the LeadOff wipes have some sort of hand lotion built into them, but it&#x27;s a different feeling than that.  Like maybe there&#x27;s a chemical film left behind.  It&#x27;s no big deal and I don&#x27;t know why I even mentioned it, but it is a unique characteristic of this product.  As soon as you&#x27;re able to wash with regular soap &amp; water everything is back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product description says these wipes also remove dirt, grime, and most common germs.  If I&#x27;m interpreting that correctly, then not only do these remove lead from the skin, but you also get the added benefits of a regular Wet Wipe (cleaning) and Purell hand sanitizer (removing germs).  Not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wipes are pricey (IMO), but I think they&#x27;re worth it.  I don&#x27;t say that about many things.  These are now a staple of my gun cleaning supplies.  I wish they would come packaged individually like a Wet Wipe, though.  It would certainly be a lot easier to pack a few individual wipes into a range bag or armorers kit than having to deal with a huge container, not to mention worrying about whether I have to keep the container in an upright position to avoid leaks/spills or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 8/1/16&lt;br /&gt;1. In the original review above, I said that these were pricey.  At the time of that review this item was going for $11.99/canister, so the price has actually come down a couple bucks now.  I still think they&#x27;re a little expensive (compare to a 40-count cannister of Wet Wipes @ $5.74), but the new lower price is more reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I also said that I wished these wipes came individually wrapped.  My wish was granted (hooray!).  However, you&#x27;re going to pay over 3x more (per wipe) for the convenience.  [[ASIN:B01B858WM8 A 25-pack of individually wrapped LeadOff Wipes]] currently goes for $16.99.  Clearly this item (i.e. the canister) is your best value for the wipes.a regular Wet Wipe (cleaning) and Purell hand sanitizer (removing germs).  Not bad.

I also said that I wished these wipes came individually wrapped.  My wish was granted (hooray!).  However, at present they are only available from Marketplace sellers, not direct from Amazon, and you have two options: $13.37 for a 5-pk or $29.99 for a 25-pk (both prices include shipping).  Do the math... if I thought THIS product was pricey at 22 cents/wipe, what does that make the individually wrapped options?  Ouch!  This item is your best option for these wipes.</li>
            <li> These wipes clean the copper tarnish off your hands from loading magazines as well as the lead from firing. My hands are clean when I get in the truck to drive home from the range. I don&#x27;t worry about any contamination. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Our firearms instructors use this when cleaning firearms and equipment after sessions at the range. It cleans nicely and helps reduce the exposure to lead our instructors experience on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Great for an outdoor gun range where you cannot quickly wash up when finished.</li>
            <li> Used these in my range bag, and they are great. Have a very nice scent to them as well and great for going to the range</li>
            <li> Great way to remove lead from your hands and face after shooting at the range. There are studies that say that using special wipes is more effective in removing lead than washing with soap and water. You can get totally clean by using a wipe, then washing with soap and water, and finally using another wipe.</li>
            <li> I always use these with the kids, especially the five year old.  She loves to shoot, but we certainly don&#x27;t want her paying a price later in life with neurological damage from heavy metal poisoning!</li>
            <li> I work in an environment where I am constantly washing my hands and they are very dry and chapped. I tried these wipes and they clean my hands well and leave them feeling great! No more dried out hands! I use them at home as well. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Total lead removal confirmed with lead tester.</li>
            <li> We have our gun cleaning area set up in our basement, and having these wipes nearby helps to clean any residual lead from our hands.  Of course, we wash our hands afterward, but this is an excellent precaution.</li>
            <li> They work very well. Terrific for the shooting bag to remove lead from your hands.</li>
            <li> These are great.  I haven&#x27;t tested for how well they remove lead, but they leave my hands freaky clean feeling after use, so it at least feels like they work.  The dispenser mechanism leaves a little to be desired, but it is OK.</li>
            <li> Not sure it it is removing the heavy metals but I hope it is. Smell good.</li>
            <li> These are great for wiping your hands and face after you shoot.  I use them right at the range before getting back into my car (and contaminating my steering wheel and shift knob).  They&#x27;re pleasant to use, and they leave your skin feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: 15 September 2012 -- I recently discovered that the these wipes use technology licensed from the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to trap lead, and that the CDC considers this specific technology, and these wipes, to be effective.  Check out the CDC comments here: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That clinches it for me. I *had* changed to a less expensive brand, but I&#x27;m throwing them away and re-ordering these.  Definitely.</li>
            <li> Normally, when I go to the range, I just wash may hands with the provided soap after I&#x27;m done shooting. The one thing I&#x27;ve not done is get the lead off my face. This is probably not a good thing. So I decided to take a closer look into something to help get the lead off of me when I am done shooting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideally, I should be using something that gets the lead dust off of my face and can wipe down more than just my hands. There are a number of products out there, but the one that I came across that I like is Hygenall LeadOff Wipes. These come in smaller packaging that you can easily keep in your range bag so that it&#x27;s always with you when are done shooting.</li>
            <li> These do the trick when getting carbon and lead off from reloading ammo or shooting!</li>
