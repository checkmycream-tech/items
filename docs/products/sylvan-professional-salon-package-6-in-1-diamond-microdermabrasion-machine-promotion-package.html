            <li>Introducing our latest innovation\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;First of all...</li>
            <li>I came across this 6 in 1 microdermabrasion machine when I had my non surgical lift of my face in my favorite salon.</li>
            <li>Who could have thought that we can now have our own microdermabrasion machine right in the comfort of our own home?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the 6 in 1 microdermabrasion machine.</li>

            <li>I loved it so much that I recommended it to another aesthetician</li>

            <li>\\&quot;Month of May Promotion - Authentic SYL-09XLT Sylvan Microdermabrasion Machine with free SYL-356 Photorejuvenation Machine and Free Shipping</li>
            <li>I have been able to learn the multiple functions of the machine and believe I will be happy with its performance.</li>

            <li>Free Support.</li>

            <li>I have had this machine for a few moths already and it has worked perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>The effects of this set is indeed great - my wife now looks younger than ever!</li>
            <li>I was quite hesitant in buying it but upon learning how much I will save in the future if I have this great machine in the comforts of my own home, I didn&#x27;t think twice after that.</li>
            <li>And so far, its giving good results.  </li>
            <li>To the sellers credit, they were very nice and sent videos demonstrating the use and assembly of the various implements.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 6 in 1 machine and to have those services in one machine is so convenient and very economical for me.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m super excited to try this out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doing to much microdermabrasion over time can actually do more damage to your skin if you are not trained in skin care.  </li>
            <li>This does not give you enough instruction on how to operate the machine with all its functions or recommendations on how to use it to its best potential for your clients.  </li>
            <li>My mom never thought twice in buying this beauty machine and I feel lucky to have the chance of using it too in the comfort of our home.</li>
            <li>I was excited about getting this multifunctional machine but have been so turned off by the lack of communication that it has not been the fun and exciting experience</li>
            <li>Early on I was interested in learning more about being a wholesaler for the company and someone by the name of \\&quot;Deb\\</li>
            <li>of the greatest things I like about this product is the fact that unlike other diamond microdermbrasion machines, Sylvan&#x27;s 6 and 1 Diamond Microdermbrasion Machine has a lot of other cool features such as micreocurrent, LED therapy,Ultrasound and a lot more.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this technology!</li>
            <li>The quality is amazing featuring high grade diamond tips ensuring the best results, avoiding dangerous and abrasive Chinese knock offs.  </li>
            <li>Now I can use the LED Therapy at home to minimize my fine lines, heal my unsightly acne scars, and overall improve the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>There is so much you can do with this one machine--you can achieve results without going under the knife.  </li>
            <li>and I can say that this product really works for me</li>
            <li>You will always receive an answering machine and will get a return call only 20% of the time.&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, Sylvan&#x27;s website indicates that Amazon will offer the product for $797 with free shipping, although when you go to Amazon, they offer it for $979.  </li>
            <li>It is not an inexpensive item and if a company wants to stay in business, they need to earn it by providing some reasonable level of custom service.  </li>
            <li>My whole process from trying to order to date has been approx.</li>
            <li>This has been the machine of the salon where my wife really loves to go.</li>
            <li>As long as your machine functions fine</li>
            <li>My machine has been working fine; however, my business partner&#x27;s diamond tip seems to have worn out early - the rep said it should last a year or 500 uses</li>
            <li>I feel i got lucky when I bough this microdermabrasion machine which has multiple functions and got even luckier when I got it at $100 off.</li>
            <li>It is truly a state of the art invention which is really useful and helpful especially to treat beauty and body wants and desires.</li>
            <li>It has multiple functions which would definitely help us save money and get results we want to get injust one machine instead of three or more microdermabrasion machines are used.</li>
            <li>Really helps with the skin, the microcurrent helps treat sagging or severely wrinkled skin, remove cellulite and fat, cleans impacted pores and blackheads, resets muscle tension to natural, stimulates circulation and increases blood flow to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Before this product, I actually purchased another off of ebay, and the item literally fell apart after opening the box--indeed proving there are numerous cheap imitations.  </li>
            <li>I have recently opened my own beauty salon in May and my beauticians tell me that there have been a lot of people asking if we offer cellulite, fat removal, collagen production, sun damaged skin rejuvenation to name a few.</li>
            <li>This is truly an original product which has multiple functions and is just simply anazing.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little suspicious about ordering online, however, this product was much better than expected.</li>
            <li>, my face and skin have never felt so alive and young before.</li>
            <li>Then I heard about Sylvan&#x27;s 6 and 1 Microdermbrasion Machine, which can give me the same treatment anytime I want without having to shell out so much money to go to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> ALTHOUGH, you receive the machine with only a poor photo copy hand stapled print out written in broken English.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how this will play out but will keep you updated.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a hard time operating it.</li>
            <li> I have my salon for 2 years now but was quite hesitant in entering the aesthetics business as I know how expensive their machines are until I came across the Sylvan 6 in 1 microdermabrasion machine.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> At first I was a little suspicious about ordering online, however, this product was much better than expected. The quality is amazing featuring high grade diamond tips ensuring the best results, avoiding dangerous and abrasive Chinese knock offs.  Before this product, I actually purchased another off of ebay, and the item literally fell apart after opening the box--indeed proving there are numerous cheap imitations.  Usually I go to my dermatologists for all my needs, however, the visits were definitely adding up, forcing me to look elsewhere.  Now I can use the LED Therapy at home to minimize my fine lines, heal my unsightly acne scars, and overall improve the look and feel of my skin. I can now, finally, leave the house without make-up and feel proud of my skin. The product paid for itself in two weeks, allowing me to stop using the pricey dermatologist offerings. There is so much you can do with this one machine--you can achieve results without going under the knife.  I can see myself using this product for years and years to come!!  5/5 stars!</li>
            <li> Im am so happy with my machine, and have used it on my clients and have seen some amazing results.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed aesthetician and have had this product for over a year and a half.  It is absolutely wonderful.  To be able to do so many types of modalities/services from one machine is great.  It has definitely paid for itself in the services rendered.  I loved it so much that I recommended it to another aesthetician and she bought one too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is to Meow Meow Kitty and any others that are purchasing for home use. This is a professional product and to be very careful when trying to do some of these services on yourself at home.  Doing to much microdermabrasion over time can actually do more damage to your skin if you are not trained in skin care.  Be careful.... please always also wear SPF and a hat or visor if out in the sun for any prolonged amount of time!</li>
            <li> I have recently opened my own beauty salon in May and my beauticians tell me that there have been a lot of people asking if we offer cellulite, fat removal, collagen production, sun damaged skin rejuvenation to name a few. I came across the Sylvan Professional Salon Package 6 in 1 Diamond Microdermabrasion Machine and knew this was the perfect machine for us. The fact that it has so many functions has enabled us to save money and offer our customers quality services.</li>
            <li> I have been considering buying a microdermabrasion machine to answer some hopes of some customers in my salon. I have my salon for 2 years now but was quite hesitant in entering the aesthetics business as I know how expensive their machines are until I came across the Sylvan 6 in 1 microdermabrasion machine. I feel i got lucky when I bough this microdermabrasion machine which has multiple functions and got even luckier when I got it at $100 off.</li>
            <li> This is truly an original product which has multiple functions and is just simply anazing. I have never thought that the 6 in 1 microdermabrasion machine used in my microcurrent therapy is the same machine used for my cellulite and fat removal. I was thinking  that in every beauty therapy there is a corresponding machine that goes along with it. It is truly a state of the art invention which is really useful and helpful especially to treat beauty and body wants and desires.</li>
            <li> After struggling with aging skin and wrinkles for years, I finally tried Sylvan&#x27;s Professional Salon Package 6 in 1 Microdermbrasion Machine Package and I can say that this product really works for me, my face and skin have never felt so alive and young before. My very busy schedule makes it hard for me to visit the salon to get the treatment my face and skin deserves and since going to the salon costs me a lot of money, I would only go to the salon for the same session only once or twice a month.Then I heard about Sylvan&#x27;s 6 and 1 Microdermbrasion Machine, which can give me the same treatment anytime I want without having to shell out so much money to go to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the greatest things I like about this product is the fact that unlike other diamond microdermbrasion machines, Sylvan&#x27;s 6 and 1 Diamond Microdermbrasion Machine has a lot of other cool features such as micreocurrent, LED therapy,Ultrasound and a lot more. I love this device and I will definitely recommend this to all my friends</li>
            <li> I bought this 6 in 1 microdermabrasion machine for my Spa.  And so far, its giving good results.  My customers love it!  It is perfect for business at a very affordable price. Thank you so much for this technology!</li>
            <li> Who could have thought that we can now have our own microdermabrasion machine right in the comfort of our own home?&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the 6 in 1 microdermabrasion machine. Is has multiple functions which can rejuvenate sun damaged skin, treat sagging and severely wrinkled skin, minimize fine lines or wrinkles to name a few of what it can do. This is a state of the art microdermabrasion machine which can give us the simple pleasures out hearts desire with our beauty and body.</li>
            <li> I agree with Marci L on this. This is truly a multi modality type of unit which is great, however in the wrong hands it can be very dangerous. I hope that those people using it at home are patient and careful, and remember that Rome was not built in one day. So PLEASE approach dermabrasion in the same way.

Hey Hon, bought you a microdermabrasion machine!&lt;br /&gt;just kidding, we actually both talked about its uses and the 6 in 1 caught my eye. Ill keep you posted on results!</li>
            <li> There is only one person in the entire company that takes calls.  You will always receive an answering machine and will get a return call only 20% of the time.&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, Sylvan&#x27;s website indicates that Amazon will offer the product for $797 with free shipping, although when you go to Amazon, they offer it for $979.  Sylvan would not honor the price nor did they fix it on Amazon. It ran for two months in error after I alerted them. Sylvan now offers the product for $1097.&lt;br /&gt; On their site they claim:&lt;br /&gt;  Sylvan Company Offers Hard Core Support with Video Lessons; Aesthetic Trainer, Phone Support, and Trained Mechanical Technicians Mon-Fri 10am-6pm. Free Support. Free Spare Parts (within the 2-year warranty period).  ALTHOUGH, you receive the machine with only a poor photo copy hand stapled print out written in broken English.  This does not give you enough instruction on how to operate the machine with all its functions or recommendations on how to use it to its best potential for your clients.  There are no video&#x27;s, no local reps, no tutorials etc..  My machine has been down for 1 month while waiting to get a return call back from the single employee that mans their call center.  I was going to return the machine but was finally contacted and provided an email address to ask technical questions.  I am not sure how this will play out but will keep you updated.  I was excited about getting this multifunctional machine but have been so turned off by the lack of communication that it has not been the fun and exciting experience I was hoping for. Early on I was interested in learning more about being a wholesaler for the company and someone by the name of \\&quot;Deb\\&quot; was to call me back on two separate occasions, but this has still not happened to date. And there are no other extensions or numbers to call within the entire company aside from the one listed on the website. I have never ever taken the time to write a bad review on anyone or anything.  In this situation, my frustration has fueled my desire to protect others who are considering this product and be forewarned.  It is not an inexpensive item and if a company wants to stay in business, they need to earn it by providing some reasonable level of custom service.  My whole process from trying to order to date has been approx. 3 months!</li>
            <li> My sister owns a clinic and she&#x27;s offering these type of services using this microdermabrasion machine. She&#x27;s very happy with the results in her clients and we also get to enjoy the product for free. You&#x27;re skin feels awesome after the procedure.</li>
            <li> This is a very sophisticated skin care machine, and best purchased by those with experience. To the sellers credit, they were very nice and sent videos demonstrating the use and assembly of the various implements. Some of the videos are in Chinese, but Google can translate the written material. I have been able to learn the multiple functions of the machine and believe I will be happy with its performance.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome machine! I have had this machine for a few moths already and it has worked perfectly for me. I don&#x27;t have a hard time operating it. It&#x27;s a 6 in 1 machine and to have those services in one machine is so convenient and very economical for me. Best machine on the market so far. I am just concerned about some limitations of this product circulating around, just make sure you buy the original product.</li>
            <li> Really helps with the skin, the microcurrent helps treat sagging or severely wrinkled skin, remove cellulite and fat, cleans impacted pores and blackheads, resets muscle tension to natural, stimulates circulation and increases blood flow to the skin.  It works!</li>
            <li> The effects of this set is indeed great - my wife now looks younger than ever! Wrinkles, age spots, and blemishes where almost gone. This has been the machine of the salon where my wife really loves to go. It&#x27;s just simply amazing. Maybe, sometime soon, she will be planning to have this one too. With the comparison of its price to the features, its very cost effective!</li>
            <li> My business partner and I each purchased a machine directly from Sylvan back in February so we didn&#x27;t get the price or bonus at Amazon which is understandable.  My machine has been working fine; however, my business partner&#x27;s diamond tip seems to have worn out early - the rep said it should last a year or 500 uses but it&#x27;s only been 6 months and not near 500 uses. It has taken 3 phone calls and numerous emails and still no resolution.  As long as your machine functions fine and you know how to use it this is a great product.  If you need to utilize the warranty or have questions or want a video to help you learn all the various functions, well, this company does NOT understand customer service.</li>
            <li> This 6 in 1 microdermabrasion machine is not like any other microdermabrasion machines. It has multiple functions which would definitely help us save money and get results we want to get injust one machine instead of three or more microdermabrasion machines are used. My mom never thought twice in buying this beauty machine and I feel lucky to have the chance of using it too in the comfort of our home. Now, I can try the microcurrent therapy to treat my wrinkled skin.</li>
            <li> I came across this 6 in 1 microdermabrasion machine when I had my non surgical lift of my face in my favorite salon. My beauty consultant told me that it has multiple functions which can be purchased online and even has an ongoing promo which is $100 off if I buy it today. I was quite hesitant in buying it but upon learning how much I will save in the future if I have this great machine in the comforts of my own home, I didn&#x27;t think twice after that.</li>
