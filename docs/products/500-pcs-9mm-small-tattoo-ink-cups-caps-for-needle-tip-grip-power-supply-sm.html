            <li> Great deal, good product</li>
            <li> Does what it should do,</li>
            <li> Too many holes on the seams</li>

            <li> whats not to love.. bunch a little inc caps :)</li>
            <li> Perfect for doing small tattoos. I love these little caps because they help on wasted ink. And I got them super fast</li>
            <li> Just as described. Good item. Good Seller.</li>
            <li> For starters every cap has a nub on the bottom of it so unless you like your caps tipping over when you dip you have to trim each on before using or you have to use a big ole wad of a&amp;d to stick it to your tray. Second I would say 30 of them were cracked or had some sort of hole in them which I assume is from how they get released it from the mold but had probems. Long story short pay a few extra bucks and buy from a known tattoo supply shop unless you have allot of free time and low standards on the quality of products you use.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend. He had no complains.</li>
            <li> just what it was supposed to be</li>
            <li> Item just as described</li>
            <li> Just as expected - great quality and arrived in a timely manner.  Thank you.</li>

            <li> My order arrived on time but it was 37 short...not a big deal but I weigh everything like that and was a bit disappointed when I discovered this.</li>
