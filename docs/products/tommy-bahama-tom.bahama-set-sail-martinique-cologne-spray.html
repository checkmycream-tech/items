            <li>still smell good</li>
            <li>I ordered it for my husband on the thought that if the others smell good on him this one will too.  </li>
            <li>I had a gift set for Christmas(Cologne and After Shave Balm) loved it.</li>
            <li>but I think it smells really good.</li>
            <li>Guys have you ever been in a place and a woman walked by who smelled so good</li>
            <li>I was looking for a fruity type cologne in a fragrance store called Perfumania, and I smelled this one and loved it</li>
            <li>does it smell good..</li>
            <li>Product arrived ahead of schedule in good condition.</li>
            <li>Neat bottle shape makes for a good addition to reach for in the summer.</li>
            <li>There price is a really good price.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s really unique and wonderful..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say Tommy Bahama is lighter than both of those, but has a more...pleasant smell (not to say the others aren&#x27;t pleasant, just this one is MORE pleasant).</li>
            <li>Authentic , smells great, not overpowering but still get asked what cologne am I wearing.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the Tommy Bahama Martinique Cologne in price, scent, condition it arrived in and shipping time.</li>
            <li>Ordered some of this fragrance without trying it first and was really impressed.</li>

            <li>I LOVE THIS!  </li>
            <li>Bought as a gift, was told it smells amazing</li>
            <li>I really liked this when I smelled it in the Tommy Bahama store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>every colonge I ever had had a strong scent that you could get a good smell of.</li>
            <li>Price was good and delivery was fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Tommy Bahama Martinique cologne for years and it&#x27;s by far the best cologne I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>But this one is one of the best one so far.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for the perfect blend of freshness and masculine in a colonge and this is it.</li>
            <li>Its just good stuff to wear ...as a summer cologne for guys...Was shipped in a very quick manner, and Aqua Gio is also a Favorite.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff and in my opinion is great for pretty much any occasion.</li>
            <li>but I found a great deal at Amazon, just $19.99 for the large size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the smell, Love the company</li>
            <li>I love Tommy Bahama and have had almost all the colonges</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Replaced a cologne I had for many years.</li>
            <li>It is ok but it could be better.</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me more of detergent which is why I would not get it again.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cologne...</li>
            <li>Your girlfriends will love it...</li>
            <li>Had to use more</li>
            <li>I love this colonge on my spouse.</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing scent that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>My spouse was well pleased with this colonge spray.</li>
            <li>I saved 50 % in costs and everything went perfectly smooth and my husband loves it!</li>
            <li>So for me this is a bit fruity, however there&#x27;s a leathery scent over the top of that fruit smell that I like a lot.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>My grand sons love this</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I get the most compliments when I wear this one from Tommy Bahama.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more when I run out</li>
            <li>Very Cool is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In contrast, St. Bart&#x27;s, Very Cool, Set Sail, and the others in the Tommy Bahama line cannot be counted upon.</li>
            <li>Very Cool, set sail Saint Martinique, set sail saint</li>
            <li>have had great feedback from women so far.</li>
            <li>I always liked Tommy Bahama cologne they are all fresh to me.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and safely, super satisfied!</li>
            <li>Martinique struck me pretty immediately as a nice clean men&#x27;s scent that didn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;powdery\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instead it fades out to a light, mild and still very clean smelling scent, and I like that because it doesn&#x27;t feel overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the other Tommy Bahama fragrances smell good</li>
            <li>Good Light Nice and Half the store price</li>
            <li>My new favorite!</li>
            <li>Too rich for my blood...</li>
            <li>I get great long hugs from my wife and daughters when I wear this one!  </li>
            <li>It smells so clean but is not overpowering</li>
            <li>I have had so many compliments and it lasts a whole 10 hrs.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the real deal</li>
            <li>Great price for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>So fresh and clean, like I&#x27;m sitting on a beach somewhere.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery,item as described.</li>
            <li>Has a very pleasing bergamont odor to it- smooth quality without being too acrid or cloying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now to me, after I apply it it does have a fresh, outdoorsy, aquatic type of smell, if you can imagine that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; smell can call up memories and powerful responses</li>
            <li>The scent (what there is of it) has a distinct &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>Fruity fresh smell</li>
            <li>I was right.</li>
            <li>Martinique is right up there with it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is good but not very strong.</li>
            <li>This is a very mild scent as far as mens colognes go.</li>
            <li>Such a clean ... fresh and sweet smell to it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t overpower you when you first spray it on, but, it sticks with you all day.</li>
            <li>I bought it a discount store for 15 bucks without trying it on first.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly the same as the tester that was given to me, so I have no doubt this product is authentic and not a knock</li>
            <li>I first tested this cologne at a Tommy Bahama store in December of 2010.  </li>
            <li>The scent is definitely tropical and I love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure everyone experiences colognes a bit differently.</li>
            <li>but it was I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more thank you.</li>
            <li>My husband is an avid Tommy wearer</li>
            <li>and I used it for a long time as one of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>sure if this is a flaw with the bottle of the condensation and humidity from taking hot showers with the door closed.</li>
            <li>Thanks I always do the his and hers</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Was not sent the real thing.</li>
            <li>This is not the real product.</li>
            <li>Also, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This summer this could very well be my signature scent.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always tolerate their cologne very well.</li>
            <li>I associate Martinique with freshness more so than the other fragrances in the Tommy Bahama line-up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But, now after it fades, and it doesn&#x27;t take long, the residue is just sort of a cheap chemically smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Such a smooth clean scent last pretty long all day and get a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li>As with all Tommy Bahama products the price is high</li>
            <li>Hard to find; wasn&#x27;t even sure what it smelled like but enjoyed the other Tommy Bahama Set Sail scents.</li>
            <li>More alcohol and less natural</li>
            <li>so I thought I would get him this to try something new</li>
            <li>Their fragrances are underwhelming overall though since first introduction.</li>
            <li>Tommy Bahama retail stores sell this exact same bottle of cologne for $65!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>am pretty sure I have had this in the past also, but this ahas very little smell which is rare for a Tommy Bahama product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit weak and has a sweet, alcohol scent that quickly fades.</li>
            <li>so naturally I thought this one might as well</li>
            <li>My 20 year old son didn&#x27;t care for it either.</li>
            <li>Shipped pretty fast and its bigger than i expected.</li>
            <li>For the price, give this as a gift to your boss or other people you don&#x27;t highly favor...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Martinique, even if you are not a fan of their other fragrances.</li>

            <li> /&gt;But, now after it fades, and it doesn&#x27;t take long, the residue is just sort of a cheap chemically smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Such a smooth clean scent last pretty long all day and get a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> As with all Tommy Bahama products the price is high</li>
            <li> Hard to find; wasn&#x27;t even sure what it smelled like but enjoyed the other Tommy Bahama Set Sail scents.</li>
            <li> More alcohol and less natural</li>
            <li> so I thought I would get him this to try something new</li>
            <li> Their fragrances are underwhelming overall though since first introduction.</li>
            <li> Tommy Bahama retail stores sell this exact same bottle of cologne for $65!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> am pretty sure I have had this in the past also, but this ahas very little smell which is rare for a Tommy Bahama product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit weak and has a sweet, alcohol scent that quickly fades.</li>
            <li> so naturally I thought this one might as well</li>
            <li> My 20 year old son didn&#x27;t care for it either.</li>
            <li> Shipped pretty fast and its bigger than i expected.</li>
            <li> For the price, give this as a gift to your boss or other people you don&#x27;t highly favor...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Martinique, even if you are not a fan of their other fragrances.</li>
            <li> Definitely a summer scent though, not really a Fall/Winter fragrance.</li>
            <li> and I would like to smell it all day long.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say besides my wife loves it</li>
            <li> certainly is not that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviews on this product talk sort of negatively about the fact that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the first time I bought it I bought it at the Tommy Bahama store and paid four times the price that I paid from Amazon</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d check out some other fragrances.</li>
            <li> complaint is that the glass bottle the cologne is stored in appeared to be a clear glass wrapped/tinted green by a translucent paint/spray/wrap.</li>
            <li> The smell lasts a long time but is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> so did I get a watered down version?&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Hands down ...</li>
            <li> Water and slight scent is all you get.</li>
            <li> Subtle and just enough for the ladies to pick up on.  </li>
            <li> If the price keeps going down it&#x27;ll make it an ever-improving steal!</li>
            <li> The other thing that sucks is that you cannot return it since it&#x27;s opened and and not sealed anymore.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much less expensive than Acqua Di Gio (not that they smell remotely similar).</li>
            <li> The wife seems to like it and she usually hates every cologne that I buy.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering but perfectly subtle.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about the appearance of the bottle, but the flakes stick to my hands and clothes, making it difficult to remove these green flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s weak</li>
            <li> What was sent was a fake item.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this color coating has since begun to flake off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Martinique is a weak, watered down fragrance that smells terrible and disappears in about 30 minutes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Tommy Bahama Martinique cologne for years and it&#x27;s by far the best cologne I&#x27;ve come across. It doesn&#x27;t overpower you when you first spray it on, but, it sticks with you all day.</li>
            <li> Ordered some of this fragrance without trying it first and was really impressed. Very nice fragrance that I find myself wanting to use all the time !! Great deal on Amazon also !!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, Love the company</li>
            <li> Its just good stuff to wear ...as a summer cologne for guys...Was shipped in a very quick manner, and Aqua Gio is also a Favorite.</li>
            <li> Water and slight scent is all you get. For the price, give this as a gift to your boss or other people you don&#x27;t highly favor...</li>
            <li> I love Tommy Bahama and have had almost all the colonges Very Cool is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty sure I have had this in the past also, but this ahas very little smell which is rare for a Tommy Bahama product every colonge I ever had had a strong scent that you could get a good smell of. This takes a lot of spray&#x27;s to get that smell so did I get a watered down version?&lt;br /&gt;It still smell good but it&#x27;s weak so I only gave it 3 stars</li>
            <li> Smells great. Not overpowering but perfectly subtle.  I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This is the newest scent and I have never smelled it before. I ordered it for my husband on the thought that if the others smell good on him this one will too.  I was right. This is perfect for summer and if your man wears it, you will have to fight the women off him.  Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Snapper soup was tterrible</li>
            <li> Not much to say besides my wife loves it and it&#x27;s much less expensive than Acqua Di Gio (not that they smell remotely similar).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product before and I love it.Unfortunately the first time I bought it I bought it at the Tommy Bahama store and paid four times the price that I paid from Amazon</li>
            <li> Smells awesome! My girlfriend Loves it.</li>
            <li> I really liked this when I smelled it in the Tommy Bahama store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to me, after I apply it it does have a fresh, outdoorsy, aquatic type of smell, if you can imagine that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, now after it fades, and it doesn&#x27;t take long, the residue is just sort of a cheap chemically smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is Eau Du Cologne, which is the cheapest form.  More alcohol and less natural oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use it but I won&#x27;t buy it again.  Definitely a summer scent though, not really a Fall/Winter fragrance.</li>
            <li> I had a gift set for Christmas(Cologne and After Shave Balm) loved it. This is just the same fragrance. I have had so many compliments and it lasts a whole 10 hrs. 5 star, would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Was a gift. Very nice fragrance. Replaced a cologne I had for many years.</li>
            <li> Thanks I always do the his and hers</li>
            <li> It is ok but it could be better. The smell reminds me more of detergent which is why I would not get it again. I liked the other Tommy Bahama fragrances smell good so naturally I thought this one might as well (oh well).</li>
            <li> I bought it a discount store for 15 bucks without trying it on first. Big mistake! Martinique is a weak, watered down fragrance that smells terrible and disappears in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I always liked Tommy Bahama cologne they are all fresh to me.  But this one is one of the best one so far.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> good,low price.hight quality,</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance! Subtle and just enough for the ladies to pick up on.  only thing I would add is it doesn&#x27;t last all day or all night. Saw this at a mall for 49.99!!! Decided to look on amazon for S&amp;Gs and found this for $20 only! Yeah I&#x27;m gonna go with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t lie, I am a fan of basically all that I Tommy Bahama. Their fragrances are underwhelming overall though since first introduction. I was hoping for a fragrance to associate with the experience of a beach-front Tommy Bahama storefront and/or clothing location since the inception of their fragrance line. I find that this, the Martinique, as well as the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; (http://www.amazon.com/Tommy-Bahama-Cologne-Spray-Ounce/dp/B00CSY9KAW/ref&#x3D;sr_1_5?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1399754795&amp;sr&#x3D;8-5&amp;keywords&#x3D;tommy+bahama+cologne) are the two colognes I can count on. In contrast, St. Bart&#x27;s, Very Cool, Set Sail, and the others in the Tommy Bahama line cannot be counted upon. I highly recommend Martinique, even if you are not a fan of their other fragrances. I associate Martinique with freshness more so than the other fragrances in the Tommy Bahama line-up.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my dad. Haven&#x27;t given it to him yet but I think it smells really good. Shipped pretty fast and its bigger than i expected.</li>
            <li> Such a smooth clean scent last pretty long all day and get a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Nice, very good....Thank You....!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not that great smelling</li>
            <li> Guys have you ever been in a place and a woman walked by who smelled so good you cant forget that moment in time or that fragrance?? ever dated a girl that wore a specific perfume and that perfume just doesnt smell the same on anyone else? This does it for the ladies!! among others I never leave the house with out Tommy Bahama!! Very Cool, set sail Saint Martinique, set sail saint barts!!&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;A smell can bring on a flood of memories, influence people&#x27;s moods and even affect their work performance. Because the olfactory bulb is part of the brain&#x27;s limbic system, an area so closely associated with memory and feeling it&#x27;s sometimes called the \\&quot;emotional brain,\\&quot; smell can call up memories and powerful responses almost instantaneously.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Got ripped off on this one. Was not sent the real thing. What was sent was a fake item. I have bought this before at Macy&#x27;s and the cologne I bought there could last all day with one spray. The cologne purchased here doesn&#x27;t even last 45 seconds after spraying twice. The other thing that sucks is that you cannot return it since it&#x27;s opened and and not sealed anymore.</li>
            <li> Authentic , smells great, not overpowering but still get asked what cologne am I wearing. Spring/ summer cologne only though.</li>
            <li> Smells great, always getting compliments.</li>
            <li> Good Light Nice and Half the store price</li>
            <li> This is not the real product. The smell fades within &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34; of application. The scent (what there is of it) has a distinct &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34; smell. I would never purchase from this supplier again......BEWARE!</li>
            <li> Solid product.  This scent is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  So fresh and clean, like I&#x27;m sitting on a beach somewhere.  Also, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Tested the cologne in the store, saw the price and was turned off. Came home and checked amazon and found it for 1/2 the price the brick and mortar Tommy Bahama was asking for. Smells exactly the same as the tester that was given to me, so I have no doubt this product is authentic and not a knock off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that the glass bottle the cologne is stored in appeared to be a clear glass wrapped/tinted green by a translucent paint/spray/wrap. Unfortunately this color coating has since begun to flake off. I don&#x27;t care about the appearance of the bottle, but the flakes stick to my hands and clothes, making it difficult to remove these green flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if this is a flaw with the bottle of the condensation and humidity from taking hot showers with the door closed. But enough to deduct -1 star.</li>
            <li> I first tested this cologne at a Tommy Bahama store in December of 2010.  It was the newest in the TB line at the time.  I had Set Sail St. Barts and it is one of my all-time favorites.  Martinique is right up there with it.  The scent is definitely tropical and I love it.  As with all Tommy Bahama products the price is high but I found a great deal at Amazon, just $19.99 for the large size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with both Set-Sail colognes is that on me they just don&#x27;t last and I would like to smell it all day long.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this fragrance whatsoever. It&#x27;s a bit weak and has a sweet, alcohol scent that quickly fades. This one was not for me. My 20 year old son didn&#x27;t care for it either.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne... I was looking for a fruity type cologne in a fragrance store called Perfumania, and I smelled this one and loved it but it was about $50 there... Too rich for my blood... Low and behold I look here on Amazon and %50 cheaper.... And&lt;br /&gt;man does it smell good.. Fruity fresh smell, that&#x27;s really unique and wonderful.. Not at all overpowering, but very pleasant... Your girlfriends will love it...</li>
            <li> The smell is good but not very strong. Had to use more then I wanted to obtain the strength I desired. Price was good and delivery was fine.</li>
            <li> Product arrived ahead of schedule in good condition. Has a very pleasing bergamont odor to it- smooth quality without being too acrid or cloying. Projection is 1/2 - 1 arm length- you won&#x27;t overpower anyone, even after overspraying a bit. My only knock against product is that I get 2, maybe 3 hours longevity tops with this. Neat bottle shape makes for a good addition to reach for in the summer.</li>
            <li> I love this colonge on my spouse. It has a refreshing scent that lasts all day. My spouse was well pleased with this colonge spray.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and safely, super satisfied!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the Tommy Bahama Martinique Cologne in price, scent, condition it arrived in and shipping time. I saved 50 % in costs and everything went perfectly smooth and my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> I brought it for my ex but it smells great</li>
            <li> I had a bottle of Tommy Bahama, St. Barts and I used it for a long time as one of my favorite colognes. So when the bottle started getting low I figured I&#x27;d check out some other fragrances. Martinique struck me pretty immediately as a nice clean men&#x27;s scent that didn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;powdery\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews on this product talk sort of negatively about the fact that it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I haven&#x27;t noticed that myself, in fact I can smell it all day, it just doesn&#x27;t smell like I just sprayed the bottle. Instead it fades out to a light, mild and still very clean smelling scent, and I like that because it doesn&#x27;t feel overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure everyone experiences colognes a bit differently. So for me this is a bit fruity, however there&#x27;s a leathery scent over the top of that fruit smell that I like a lot. To me this leaves the impression of a tropical scent but without smelling \\&quot;girly\\&quot;. This is great stuff and in my opinion is great for pretty much any occasion.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. The wife seems to like it and she usually hates every cologne that I buy. I like all the Tommy Bahama products.</li>
            <li> It smells like Hawaiian paradise</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect blend of freshness and masculine in a colonge and this is it. It is not over powering at all.  When i pass a woman I know i will smell pleasant. This is way better than the expensive bottles i have.  This summer this could very well be my signature scent.  Guys get a bottle of this, you can&#x27;t go worng.</li>
            <li> This is a very mild scent as far as mens colognes go. The smell lasts a long time but is not overwhelming. It is a beachy smell that&#x27;s not fruity. Great price for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> My grand sons love this and I don&#x27;t mind the smell which is wonderful.  I don&#x27;t always tolerate their cologne very well.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery,item as described.</li>
            <li> Got this from Amazon at $26.39 on Nov 23 2013. I see it is currently listed at $25.50 on Dec 26 2013. If the price keeps going down it&#x27;ll make it an ever-improving steal! Tommy Bahama retail stores sell this exact same bottle of cologne for $65!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had great feedback from women so far. It is a cologne that suits younger males (I&#x27;m 30 years of age). I&#x27;ve tried &amp;#34;older men&amp;#34; cologne, and those same women know quite well that it is &amp;#34;older men&amp;#34; cologne, and this certainly is not that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. I have both Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren basic colognes. I&#x27;d say Tommy Bahama is lighter than both of those, but has a more...pleasant smell (not to say the others aren&#x27;t pleasant, just this one is MORE pleasant).</li>
            <li> Hard to find; wasn&#x27;t even sure what it smelled like but enjoyed the other Tommy Bahama Set Sail scents. This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have about 6 different colognes.  Hands down ... I get the most compliments when I wear this one from Tommy Bahama.  Not an overkill smell.  Such a clean ... fresh and sweet smell to it.  Almost of a smell after a rain up at the lake in the spring.  (if that made any sense!!)  Lasts a long time.  I get great long hugs from my wife and daughters when I wear this one!  On my fourth bottle.  Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved it!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the real deal but it was I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more thank you. Amazon is the best</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, was told it smells amazing</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for fathers day... I LOVE THIS!  My husband is an avid Tommy wearer so I thought I would get him this to try something new, He loves it as well and says he gets tons of compliments when he wears it. It smells so clean but is not overpowering and I can still smell it on him at the end of the day even though he put it on in the morning!  My new favorite!</li>
            <li> Very nice island fragrance and good standby for the summer but not as divine as St. Bart&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance at a great price!</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than mall prices.  I am very happy with the cologne.  I will buy more when I run out</li>
            <li> Cologne smells great it is the same cologne that I smelled in the Tommy Bahamas&#x27; store. There price is a really good price.</li>
