            <li>Knowing AMAZON has this offer is awesome.</li>
            <li>For my skin, this version seems to have the best balanced of medicine and sensitivity.</li>
            <li>This product is very good for my daughter’s condition.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, great texture, and doesn&#x27;t make you oily, but keeps away those pimples!!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Great value compared to buying in the store.  </li>
            <li>Product does a great job for me.</li>
            <li>Product works great for what it is intended for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it all--but this stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of clearing up acne.  </li>
            <li>Buying a 3-pack lotion from amazon saves me $40+ every 4 months which is amazing.</li>
            <li>i really love it</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>my face is substantially more oily and prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>It is also more drying and leaves the skin without that shimmering effect often found in moisturizers that Proactiv leaves.  </li>
            <li>is probably better for the skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>than these differences this product seems a worthwhile replacement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent product but make sure you know how to use it properly.</li>
            <li>This was the best deal I&#x27;ve found yet on multiple bottles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li>item was shipped fast, and customer service was amazing!</li>
            <li>I finally found Proactiv which worked great</li>
            <li>A friend told me about Acne Free</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cheaper by far than Proactive and just as good.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really irritate the skin, it just sits on top, it&#x27;s easy to put makeup or moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li>It seems to heal breakouts quickly without causing tightness or redness.  </li>
            <li>I would give it five stars if price was similar but the fact is that the price here is about 40-50% more than you can get at most places.</li>
            <li>It is a light lotion that does not irritate my sensitive skin and it goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, make sure you have sunscreen on before applying the lotion.</li>
            <li>Choose the one that is right for you.</li>
            <li>Thus, I love that I can buy three of the same quality from this seller.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this for the first time and arrived as promised.  </li>
            <li>make sure to rub this lotion in well, if you dont it can leave a white residue on your face that has been pointed out to me before</li>
            <li>Also, many time I want to use a different toner and face wash.</li>
            <li>I first started using these in the acnefree severe kits that come with the four bottles and are much like proactiv in their treatment system.</li>
            <li>I will definitely come back for more as needed!</li>
            <li>We have so much stock in the wash but not the toner and repair lotion.  </li>
            <li>wish you could buy this stuff separately at the drug store at a reasonable price, but one bottle lasts me for a while.</li>
            <li>I used to use the AcneFree Kit, but found that I didn&#x27;t really need the cleanser or toner.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really cleared off my pimples, but it helped it decrease.</li>
            <li>Like many others have stated here, the lotion get depleted before the other two item.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll just grow out of it, or eventually find a regular non-acne fighting lotion when acne becomes a thing of the past, but for now this lotion keeps my face fresh and clean, so fresh and so clean clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The repair lotion has benzoyl peroxide, and this particular brand has not been drying on my skin, at all.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the Acne Free set--I only buy the repair lotion on its own, since I think the entire regimen would be too harsh for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and usually buy it in the drugstore along with the toner and cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Acnefree since I was in middle school and it has worked pretty well for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get the exact same results from Acne Free that I did from Proactiv for much less money.</li>
            <li>So now I just use a regular facewash (the icy biore facewash, has a nice tingle) and use this lotion afterwards and acne is pretty much a thing of the past.</li>
            <li>I already stopped using this product because it doesn&#x27;t really clear my face from pimples.</li>
            <li>Although you can get this item much cheaper elsewhere, you cannot buy it individually package like this elsewhere.</li>
            <li>There is also a sensitive skin and a severe version of this product.</li>
            <li>I was buying the 3 lotion kit AcneFree from my usual store but this 3third bottle was always finishing long before other two; so, I am happy with my buying.</li>
            <li>Although I often use this with sunscreen and lotion, I still wind up with an empty lotion bottle first.</li>
            <li>(Probably due to the higher level of Benzoyl Peroxide-3.7% vs 2.5% w/Proactiv)  </li>
            <li>However, I go through the repair lotion MUCH faster than I do the other two products.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i don&#x27;t go a day without using this it is a staple in my skin care routine i really love it</li>
            <li> Love this product and usually buy it in the drugstore along with the toner and cleanser.  However, I go through the repair lotion MUCH faster than I do the other two products.  Thus, I love that I can buy three of the same quality from this seller.  I will continue to buy from them.</li>
            <li> Many years ago I had a terrible time getting acne under control.  I finally found Proactiv which worked great but it was so expensive.  A friend told me about Acne Free so I tried it.  I get the exact same results from Acne Free that I did from Proactiv for much less money.</li>
            <li> You cannot buy this product separate in stores.  We have so much stock in the wash but not the toner and repair lotion.  Knowing AMAZON has this offer is awesome.</li>
            <li> I use this product and it works like magic....literally! I use to buy the kit but always ended up throwing away the toner and wash. I only use the lotion and then I found amazon. Buying a 3-pack lotion from amazon saves me $40+ every 4 months which is amazing. Thank you amazon!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, great texture, and doesn&#x27;t make you oily, but keeps away those pimples!!!&lt;br /&gt;This item was shipped fast, and customer service was amazing!</li>
            <li> This has been one of the only products that has worked for my acne in over 4years. The only downfall is that it is so expensive for such little bottles. I&#x27;m trying another product now, Dr.song, because it&#x27;s a lot cheaper and comes with 4x the amount than these and is working okay so far but not great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all--but this stuff is amazing!  I don&#x27;t use the Acne Free set--I only buy the repair lotion on its own, since I think the entire regimen would be too harsh for my skin.  The repair lotion has benzoyl peroxide, and this particular brand has not been drying on my skin, at all.  It does a good job of clearing up acne.  I tend to get cystic type acne on my jaw line that I am having issues getting cleared up (and it tends to happen post partum for me, so I&#x27;m still trying to get the hormones under control).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish you could buy this stuff separately at the drug store at a reasonable price, but one bottle lasts me for a while.</li>
            <li> This is a life-saver for me.  It is a light lotion that does not irritate my sensitive skin and it goes on smoothly.  It seems to heal breakouts quickly without causing tightness or redness.  I used to use the AcneFree Kit, but found that I didn&#x27;t really need the cleanser or toner.  I&#x27;m relieved to find that I can purchase the repair lotion separately from this source since I was not able to find it separately in the store.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for the first time and arrived as promised.  Great value compared to buying in the store.  Plan to buy this product again.  Product does a great job for me.</li>
            <li> Product works great for what it is intended for. 5 stars on the product itself. Zero star for seller not delivering correct amount I paid for. I only got 2 bottles instead of 3.</li>
            <li> I first started using these in the acnefree severe kits that come with the four bottles and are much like proactiv in their treatment system. Those kits are pretty stupid because you always end up running out of one bottle (lotion, facewash, toner) before the other. Eventually I realized that the lotion was the only thing that was helping me, the other products just dried my face out. So now I just use a regular facewash (the icy biore facewash, has a nice tingle) and use this lotion afterwards and acne is pretty much a thing of the past. The only question now is whether or not itll come roaring back when i stop using the lotion. my face seems to be hooked on it now, i notice that if i forget the lotion for a day (like when i run out) my face is substantially more oily and prone to breakouts. Hopefully I&#x27;ll just grow out of it, or eventually find a regular non-acne fighting lotion when acne becomes a thing of the past, but for now this lotion keeps my face fresh and clean, so fresh and so clean clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. make sure to rub this lotion in well, if you dont it can leave a white residue on your face that has been pointed out to me before</li>
            <li> I use this product at night before sleep. Have been using it for several years. It&#x27;s a little expensive, but works!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a cheaper alternative to Proactiv.  I believe it works but for those that also might be considering this as an alternative to Proactiv???  This product is \\&quot;harsher\\&quot; on the skin than Proactiv.  (Probably due to the higher level of Benzoyl Peroxide-3.7% vs 2.5% w/Proactiv)  It is also more drying and leaves the skin without that shimmering effect often found in moisturizers that Proactiv leaves.  (I like the less greasy look of AcneFree but Proactiv is probably better for the skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than these differences this product seems a worthwhile replacement.</li>
            <li> 1. I&#x27;ve been using Acnefree since I was in middle school and it has worked pretty well for me.&lt;br /&gt;2. I only like using step #3 and sometimes step #2, and I hate step #1 - buying step #3 only is saving me a lot of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;3. Doesn&#x27;t really irritate the skin, it just sits on top, it&#x27;s easy to put makeup or moisturizer over it. Does not pill.&lt;br /&gt;4. It dries clear.&lt;br /&gt;5. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too bad. It&#x27;s rather mild.&lt;br /&gt;6. No offensive odor.</li>
            <li> Used with Acnefree toner and cleanser you will not have acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper by far than Proactive and just as good.</li>
            <li> I was buying the 3 lotion kit AcneFree from my usual store but this 3third bottle was always finishing long before other two; so, I am happy with my buying. This product is very good for my daughter’s condition.</li>
            <li> Although you can get this item much cheaper elsewhere, you cannot buy it individually package like this elsewhere. This is typically sold in a set that includes a wash and toner. Like many others have stated here, the lotion get depleted before the other two item. Although I often use this with sunscreen and lotion, I still wind up with an empty lotion bottle first. I don&#x27;t know why this company don&#x27;t just increase the size of it&#x27;s lotion because every time I have plenty of the others left with no more lotion. I would give it five stars if price was similar but the fact is that the price here is about 40-50% more than you can get at most places. Although it&#x27;s more expensive, it is cheaper than buy 3 individuality lotion than to buy 3 sets when you only needing the lotion. Also, many time I want to use a different toner and face wash. Buying the 3 piece set does not allow me to mix and match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product but make sure you know how to use it properly. If you have sensitive skin, make sure you have sunscreen on before applying the lotion. There is also a sensitive skin and a severe version of this product. Choose the one that is right for you. For my skin, this version seems to have the best balanced of medicine and sensitivity.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find by itself without having to buy the whole kit.  This was the best deal I&#x27;ve found yet on multiple bottles. I will definitely come back for more as needed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product. It didn&#x27;t really cleared off my pimples, but it helped it decrease. I already stopped using this product because it doesn&#x27;t really clear my face from pimples.</li>
