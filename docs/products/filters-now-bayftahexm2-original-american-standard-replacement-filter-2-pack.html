            <li>These filters fit my Trane air handler.  </li>
            <li>These are fantastic.</li>
            <li>no question they fit.  </li>
            <li>I HAD TO SKIP 2 SLOTS OVER THE EXPANSION OF THE FILTER TO GET THE THING TO FIT.  </li>
            <li>BECAUSE I MANAGED TO MAKE IT FIT.  </li>
            <li>so far does what is was supposed to do and in today&#x27;s world that is a good thing.</li>
            <li>The part number was identical to the original filter in my system.</li>
            <li>Quality of the product equals original manufacturers.</li>
            <li>Since these are the original equipment</li>
            <li>Like the original that it was replacing, this filter had no instructions for installation.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, but it works.  </li>
            <li>They fit great and do the job for less.</li>
            <li>These filters fit as advertised and are the exact replacement filters as original.</li>
            <li>these look and fit the original filters exactly.</li>
            <li>Perfect fit and was exact same original filter, not a similar replacement.  </li>
            <li>Fits my American Standard perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping as well.</li>
            <li>Super quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Filtration is superb; these are authentic filter replacements; you can&#x27;t go wrong here--highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Got them inexpensively and quickly.</li>
            <li>Throw my own filter in and save on a service call to clean the coils when it&#x27;s not needed and an overpriced filter from the local AC guy.</li>
            <li>Work great, takes a few minutes to install, and done.</li>
            <li>Ordering the double pack was a nice savings and the way to go.</li>
            <li>No cutting or modifications required.  </li>
            <li>Factory fresh.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly and are half as much as me buying them from my local air conditioning contactor.</li>
            <li>People commented that the punched holes were not in the right place.  </li>
            <li>exactly right.</li>
            <li>the price was right and it is</li>
            <li>very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Fit correctly, decent price, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Getting the filter into the plastic frame was a bit tricky the first time.  </li>
            <li>Would love to find the solid one that I could use without the rack.</li>
            <li>Once that was done, it fit just like the old one.</li>
            <li>Will likely re-order when i need more filters.</li>
            <li>I am ordering two more filters for next service.</li>
            <li>ANYWHERE, which only makes you defy them thru the magic machine, online, and find this company.</li>
            <li>and they last for many months unlike 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Will certainly order again.</li>
            <li>I did receive the correct order for which I paid and it came to me in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li>i have found this product available on several sites.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was much quicker than driving to the dealer, and 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li>The filter number I purchased is exactly the same as original number, but are NOT exact Trane filter fit in ANY way!</li>
            <li>very efficient product that works really well.</li>
            <li>As a reminder these are just the filter elements not the whole plastic enclosure.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>These are the real filters.  </li>
            <li>fast ship came as described</li>
            <li>But this filter from Filters-Now appears to be the same as my original Trane furnace filter.</li>
            <li>The key here is ORIGINAL.  </li>
            <li>Yes there is better more expensive filters on the market</li>
            <li>filters fit and function as expected.  </li>
            <li>If your HVAC uses this plastic frame and all you need is the new filter</li>
            <li>I had to make new holes.</li>
            <li>Needed new filter.</li>
            <li>long as you order the correct ones, you are good to go (I say this because I originally ordered the wrong filter.  </li>
            <li>We needed to replace our filter at home and this is the only place we could find it for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>local dealer wants this much for 1 filter and this is a 2 pack original from American Standard, buy it here and let the locals know like I did.</li>
            <li>Since then every year i have ordered this two pack and they are exactly the same as what was installed orginally (looks, size, etc).</li>
            <li>You basically un-snap the plastic enclosure, take out old filter, place new one in and snap close.</li>
            <li>The filters worked perfectly and they are much less expensive than letting the AC service company provide them.</li>
            <li>Removed my old filter from my Trane unit.</li>
            <li>2) pay attention to the direction of airflow when you remove the filter from the air handler and which the end the arrow points on the filter when you remove the old one; 3) when removing the old filter from the frame notice how the plastic frame parts insert into the cardboard</li>
            <li>But also, there are holes in the cardboard ends that are used to snap filter security into your frame--at one end, those weren&#x27;t drilled through the filter material and it took me awhile to make the holes myself since I don&#x27;t have the tools to cut through that nearly indestructible stuff.</li>
            <li>I never opened them yet to try them because it is not time to replace my old one.</li>
            <li>The delivery from the Vendor was complete and timely.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS COMPLETELY UNSATISFACTORY.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPATABLE.  </li>
            <li>Had been paying twice as much through my local AC contractor, saved money and was no problem installing.  </li>
            <li>Store handled my exchange professionally and without question.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect to spend much more than a few minutes replacing the filter in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor shipped the order promptly, and even with standard shipping I they were delivered in two days.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>there are too many pleats for the available frame space, seems like an unnecessary waste?</li>
            <li>so you can install the new filter the same way.</li>
            <li>Solid one is already put together and is made of cardboard, just throw it away and install new.</li>
            <li>I have never had a problem installing them though I do recommend wearing gloves because the ends of the metal supporting mesh is qiite sharp.</li>
            <li>site offers the exact same product for $15 less than anyone else</li>
            <li>The metal is sharp that holds the filter in haha.</li>
            <li>A little getting used to, yet after the first filter change the ones from now on should be a cinch.</li>
            <li>These are the very same filters my A/C company wants to charge me double the price for half the quantity (in other words, this 2 pack, shipped, costs me half the price of what the local company wants for 1 filter); you simply have to fit the pleats into your frame properly.  </li>
            <li>A little extra work was worth the big difference in price over having to get an a/c service company to do it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see such loose ends in my old filter, otherwise the replacement seems the same.</li>

            <li> the price was right and it is</li>
            <li> very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Fit correctly, decent price, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Getting the filter into the plastic frame was a bit tricky the first time.  </li>
            <li> Would love to find the solid one that I could use without the rack.</li>
            <li> Once that was done, it fit just like the old one.</li>
            <li> Will likely re-order when i need more filters.</li>
            <li> I am ordering two more filters for next service.</li>
            <li> ANYWHERE, which only makes you defy them thru the magic machine, online, and find this company.</li>
            <li> and they last for many months unlike 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Will certainly order again.</li>
            <li> I did receive the correct order for which I paid and it came to me in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li> i have found this product available on several sites.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was much quicker than driving to the dealer, and 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li> The filter number I purchased is exactly the same as original number, but are NOT exact Trane filter fit in ANY way!</li>
            <li> very efficient product that works really well.</li>
            <li> As a reminder these are just the filter elements not the whole plastic enclosure.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> These are the real filters.  </li>
            <li> fast ship came as described</li>
            <li> But this filter from Filters-Now appears to be the same as my original Trane furnace filter.</li>
            <li> The key here is ORIGINAL.  </li>
            <li> Yes there is better more expensive filters on the market</li>
            <li> filters fit and function as expected.  </li>
            <li> If your HVAC uses this plastic frame and all you need is the new filter</li>
            <li> I had to make new holes.</li>
            <li> Needed new filter.</li>
            <li> long as you order the correct ones, you are good to go (I say this because I originally ordered the wrong filter.  </li>
            <li> We needed to replace our filter at home and this is the only place we could find it for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> local dealer wants this much for 1 filter and this is a 2 pack original from American Standard, buy it here and let the locals know like I did.</li>
            <li> Since then every year i have ordered this two pack and they are exactly the same as what was installed orginally (looks, size, etc).</li>
            <li> You basically un-snap the plastic enclosure, take out old filter, place new one in and snap close.</li>
            <li> The filters worked perfectly and they are much less expensive than letting the AC service company provide them.</li>
            <li> Removed my old filter from my Trane unit.</li>
            <li> 2) pay attention to the direction of airflow when you remove the filter from the air handler and which the end the arrow points on the filter when you remove the old one; 3) when removing the old filter from the frame notice how the plastic frame parts insert into the cardboard</li>
            <li> But also, there are holes in the cardboard ends that are used to snap filter security into your frame--at one end, those weren&#x27;t drilled through the filter material and it took me awhile to make the holes myself since I don&#x27;t have the tools to cut through that nearly indestructible stuff.</li>
            <li> I never opened them yet to try them because it is not time to replace my old one.</li>
            <li> The delivery from the Vendor was complete and timely.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS COMPLETELY UNSATISFACTORY.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPATABLE.  </li>
            <li> Had been paying twice as much through my local AC contractor, saved money and was no problem installing.  </li>
            <li> Store handled my exchange professionally and without question.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect to spend much more than a few minutes replacing the filter in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor shipped the order promptly, and even with standard shipping I they were delivered in two days.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> there are too many pleats for the available frame space, seems like an unnecessary waste?</li>
            <li> so you can install the new filter the same way.</li>
            <li> Solid one is already put together and is made of cardboard, just throw it away and install new.</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem installing them though I do recommend wearing gloves because the ends of the metal supporting mesh is qiite sharp.</li>
            <li> site offers the exact same product for $15 less than anyone else</li>
            <li> The metal is sharp that holds the filter in haha.</li>
            <li> A little getting used to, yet after the first filter change the ones from now on should be a cinch.</li>
            <li> These are the very same filters my A/C company wants to charge me double the price for half the quantity (in other words, this 2 pack, shipped, costs me half the price of what the local company wants for 1 filter); you simply have to fit the pleats into your frame properly.  </li>
            <li> A little extra work was worth the big difference in price over having to get an a/c service company to do it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see such loose ends in my old filter, otherwise the replacement seems the same.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s because the fat end of the filter is pressed flat for shipping, and needs to be squared up, creating an open rectangle (about 1/4\\&quot; deep) on the sides for the frame pins.</li>
            <li> Getting it in is a little tricky, which is why I rated it 4 stars but that may or may not be a reflection on this particular product.</li>
            <li> Although installation is a little more difficult than the typical AC Filter it was not complicated and only took about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It is much less expensive to buy your own than purchase it from the A/C people.</li>
            <li> when it came time to change the filter i removed the old filter the trane instaler put in and wrote the part number down.</li>
            <li> With a lot of lost blood, I was able to cut the wrong filters down to size.</li>
            <li> Replacement can be a little tedious when taking out new filter, but worth it.</li>
            <li> When I got the these filters, the sleeve looked the same, but the AHEX is 21&amp;#34; wide and the FREX is 27&amp;#34; wide.</li>
            <li> THIS FILTER DOES NOT PROPERLY FIT THE AMERICAN STANDARD /TRANE FILTER FRAME.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 6 of these so far and have never encountered the other reviewer&#x27;s experience of having too few pleats.  </li>
            <li> Watch out for loose metal ends, I ended up with a couple finger slices.</li>
            <li> I tried to get them to come down some on the local price</li>
            <li> Amazon is only one of two places that sell this filter but for half the price</li>
            <li> Seems to filter well I have bougth a few of these over the last five years.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about HVAC filters.  </li>
            <li> The ones that I got did not fit despite having the same part # as the filter that is in my HVAC unit.</li>
            <li> and I would not have wasted my money trying to send them back.</li>
            <li> the metal lathe-like covering can cut your fingers/hand up if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li> The Amazon web page shows the right part, but the link to Filters Now goes to the wrong part.</li>
            <li> This filter is half the price of the local dealer, and I can change it myself in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> So prior to discovering the warning one can install the filter wrong based on the main included document.</li>
            <li> OTHER CUSTOMERS WOULD NOT OR COULD NOT.  </li>
            <li> The sharp screening support cuts me every time I change the filter.</li>
            <li> I would recommend looking over the used filter very carefully before removing it from the frame</li>
            <li> Be very careful ordering these.  </li>
            <li> Be careful installing, metal lattice is very sharp.  </li>
            <li> My house stays dusty as I live in FL.</li>
            <li> Was a little worried based on some of the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> highly suggest people  check numbers very carefully as this number was in the order for the wrong product</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing this product and was slightly apprehensive about replacing the filter.  </li>
            <li> I saved about half from what my AC company charges for these filters.</li>
            <li> Also the price is half what my a/c installer wanted to charge.</li>
            <li> Installed in less than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> If you are reading this, I got your attention with the subject line.  </li>
            <li> Gently lifting where the bottom of the rectangle meets the cardboard base squared up the rectangle as intended, and then the punch holes were almost where they were on the old filter.</li>
            <li> Installation is a little aggravating but so is weeding the flower bed.</li>
            <li> Too many folds,but worst part is  holes will not align with plastic filter holder (which is not included)and</li>
            <li> Also metal webbing on one side of filter ruined my knuckles trying to assemble something that does not fit!</li>
            <li> I needed to order this Replacement Filter as I was unable to purchase it locally.  </li>
            <li> WEAR GLOVES, those thin metal bands are sharp;  </li>
            <li> new holes are almost impossible to punch thru.</li>
            <li> I checked multiple searches, and this is the least expensive place to purchase these.</li>
            <li> I too was hesitant because of the negative comments.  </li>
            <li> I would give it the highest mark if not for the confusing installation instructions supplied with the filter that call for incorrect installation.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s a replacement filter...</li>
            <li> No more sneezing and runny nose for me!</li>
            <li> Not good Business to me, they should have stated no returns</li>
            <li> Unfolding the media and placing on the frame can be a little tedious, but not too difficult.</li>
            <li> They do a poor job at filtering.</li>
            <li> IT IS DEFICIENT IN THE NUMBER OF FOLDS THAT MATE INTO THE FILTER FRAME.  </li>
            <li> Was a little shocked when I received the Filters.</li>
            <li> I just lifted the base halfway out of the slot as I eased the pins into the cardboard, then firmly pushed the base back in the slot.  </li>
            <li> These are just as advertised but why are they so expensive?</li>
            <li> These filters are expensive anywhere else.</li>
            <li> order the wrong product to begin with, lost the return slip and then could not find the box which got packed up with</li>
            <li> and i ordered the wrong one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Winner, winner, chicken dinner.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> very fast shipping.  Just as promised.</li>
            <li> I did receive the correct order for which I paid and it came to me in a very timely manner.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Seems to filter well I have bougth a few of these over the last five years. I have never had a problem installing them though I do recommend wearing gloves because the ends of the metal supporting mesh is qiite sharp. They seem to be a bit pricy, but I only have change them every 6 mo.</li>
            <li> i have found this product available on several sites.&lt;br /&gt;this site offers the exact same product for $15 less than anyone else i could find.&lt;br /&gt;same great product, save $15.&lt;br /&gt;i am constantly amazed by amazon</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s a replacement filter...It was a good price (lower than trying to buy it at lowes or from an HVAC guy.  It was convenient to order and sent in a timely manner.  It was exactly what I expected.  Nothing fancy.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about HVAC filters.  These filters fit my Trane air handler.  Getting the filter into the plastic frame was a bit tricky the first time.  I don&#x27;t expect to spend much more than a few minutes replacing the filter in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor shipped the order promptly, and even with standard shipping I they were delivered in two days.</li>
            <li> Good price. this type filter is not the best. Would love to find the solid one that I could use without the rack. More dust in my home than ever, this filter is the one that with train.</li>
            <li> I ordered BAYFTAHEXM2 in August, 2010, and received BAYFTFREXM2. Now I know why. The Amazon web page shows the right part, but the link to Filters Now goes to the wrong part. Two years later, the web pages still have the problem! With a lot of lost blood, I was able to cut the wrong filters down to size. They do a poor job at filtering. Cheap 30-day filters did much better.</li>
            <li> Takes a minute to put together. The metal is sharp that holds the filter in haha.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before purchasing this product and was slightly apprehensive about replacing the filter.  It turns out replacing was very easy,  I finished it in under 5 minutes.  I would recommend looking over the used filter very carefully before removing it from the frame so you can install the new filter the same way.</li>
            <li> These are great filters, and rap a lot of dust. I checked multiple searches, and this is the least expensive place to purchase these.</li>
            <li> This filter is half the price of the local dealer, and I can change it myself in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I too was hesitant because of the negative comments.  But this filter from Filters-Now appears to be the same as my original Trane furnace filter. People commented that the punched holes were not in the right place.  I think that&#x27;s because the fat end of the filter is pressed flat for shipping, and needs to be squared up, creating an open rectangle (about 1/4\\&quot; deep) on the sides for the frame pins. Gently lifting where the bottom of the rectangle meets the cardboard base squared up the rectangle as intended, and then the punch holes were almost where they were on the old filter. I just lifted the base halfway out of the slot as I eased the pins into the cardboard, then firmly pushed the base back in the slot.  Watch out for loose metal ends, I ended up with a couple finger slices. I didn&#x27;t see such loose ends in my old filter, otherwise the replacement seems the same. It was much quicker than driving to the dealer, and 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li> A little getting used to, yet after the first filter change the ones from now on should be a cinch. It does a good job at trapping dust.</li>
            <li> The filter number I purchased is exactly the same as original number, but are NOT exact Trane filter fit in ANY way! Too many folds,but worst part is  holes will not align with plastic filter holder (which is not included)and new holes are almost impossible to punch thru. Also metal webbing on one side of filter ruined my knuckles trying to assemble something that does not fit!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to 1&amp;#34; filters again. These are fantastic. I use this for two 3 ton Trane units and they last all 6 months without a problem. Replacement can be a little tedious when taking out new filter, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Great price. I saved about half from what my AC company charges for these filters.</li>
            <li> Be very careful ordering these.  The ones that I got did not fit despite having the same part # as the filter that is in my HVAC unit.</li>
            <li> Fits my American Standard perfectly.  Was a little worried based on some of the other reviews.  The part number was identical to the original filter in my system.</li>
            <li> product was a described, great transaction</li>
            <li> workeded great price was right required some effort to install but not bad would purchased item again when needed very good product name brand made in USA</li>
            <li> very efficient product that works really well. Installation is a little aggravating but so is weeding the flower bed.</li>
            <li> Quality replacement filter.  If your HVAC uses this plastic frame and all you need is the new filter this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of these filters and from the same vendor.  Although installation is a little more difficult than the typical AC Filter it was not complicated and only took about 10 minutes.  Quality of the product equals original manufacturers.</li>
            <li> These filters fit as advertised and are the exact replacement filters as original. As a reminder these are just the filter elements not the whole plastic enclosure. They are very easy to install. You basically un-snap the plastic enclosure, take out old filter, place new one in and snap close. Your done.  Also the price is half what my a/c installer wanted to charge. No problems with the ordering process either. Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Removed my old filter from my Trane unit.Follow directions on the&lt;br /&gt;new filter process took about 10 minutes excellent product.</li>
            <li> Since these are the original equipment there;s no question they fit.  When installing them into the frame 1) WEAR GLOVES, those thin metal bands are sharp;  2) pay attention to the direction of airflow when you remove the filter from the air handler and which the end the arrow points on the filter when you remove the old one; 3) when removing the old filter from the frame notice how the plastic frame parts insert into the cardboard filter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sells them for about a third of what the local A/C shops want.</li>
            <li> Throw my own filter in and save on a service call to clean the coils when it&#x27;s not needed and an overpriced filter from the local AC guy. Work great, takes a few minutes to install, and done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a furnace filter, pull out and put in.  Perfect fit for my Trane whole house filter box.  Quick shipping as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and quick delivery</li>
            <li> Easy, Good Quality and Timely! I would purchase again..</li>
            <li> These are just as advertised but why are they so expensive?</li>
            <li> Direct replacement -  Nice product at good price</li>
            <li> Would definitely order again when needed.  The key here is ORIGINAL.  Ordering the double pack was a nice savings and the way to go.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good shape and promptly. Like the original that it was replacing, this filter had no instructions for installation. I had to finagle a bit to get it into place exactly right. This was partly my mistaken assumption that it could be flipped end-for-end without it making a difference--it does. But also, there are holes in the cardboard ends that are used to snap filter security into your frame--at one end, those weren&#x27;t drilled through the filter material and it took me awhile to make the holes myself since I don&#x27;t have the tools to cut through that nearly indestructible stuff. Once that was done, it fit just like the old one. A little extra work was worth the big difference in price over having to get an a/c service company to do it.</li>
            <li> great product, great service</li>
            <li> Ordered these before and they are great</li>
            <li> Was a little shocked when I received the Filters. They were made in a way that you have to expand them and kind of put them together. I never opened them yet to try them because it is not time to replace my old one. I will update my review when I open one to use it. Price was great.</li>
            <li> The filters worked perfectly and they are much less expensive than letting the AC service company provide them.</li>
            <li> Came with easy to understand instructions and I was able to install in minutes.</li>
            <li> They work great and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 5 stars because I know the seller will help me out of a mistake. I want to warn you of that mistake. I&#x27;ll try to upload a picture to warn others two. The sleeve that this files come wrapped in has two part numbers BAYFTAHEXM2 and BAYFTFREXM2, with a checkbox by each. I had one of these filters at home, so I thought that either part number described this filter because the checkboxes were both unchecked. When I got the these filters, the sleeve looked the same, but the AHEX is 21&amp;#34; wide and the FREX is 27&amp;#34; wide. Not the same at all.</li>
            <li> Fast shipper and great value price</li>
            <li> Great buy and a perfect fit.  Installed in less than 10 minutes.  No cutting or modifications required.  You must have the plastic frame as the filter is replacement insert.</li>
            <li> so far does what is was supposed to do and in today&#x27;s world that is a good thing. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> These filters are expensive anywhere else. They fit great and do the job for less. I&#x27;m glad I found this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I needed to order this Replacement Filter as I was unable to purchase it locally.  The delivery from the Vendor was complete and timely.  No problems.  Will likely re-order when i need more filters.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Super quick delivery. Will certainly order again. Best price I&#x27;ve ever seen on these filters. Happy</li>
            <li> We ordered BAYFTFREXM2 on the website and BAYFTAHEXM2 popped up.  We thought it was a substitute.  It was not the correct size.  We returned it and have not received the correct filter as of 7/23/2013.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Trane replacement filters for my furnace/AC unit. They work fine. It saved me some money since I can&#x27;t find the filters locally and ordering through my furnace installer is much more expensive. When placing these filters within the plastic frame, (you must already have the frame, the frame does not come with the filter order) there are too many pleats for the available frame space, seems like an unnecessary waste?</li>
            <li> We use these on our air conditioner, for our air purifier. Price is good!! We will be buying more, when needed.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these for 3 years (a pack a year) and am very happy with my purchase.  These are the very same filters my A/C company wants to charge me double the price for half the quantity (in other words, this 2 pack, shipped, costs me half the price of what the local company wants for 1 filter); you simply have to fit the pleats into your frame properly.  I&#x27;ve used 6 of these so far and have never encountered the other reviewer&#x27;s experience of having too few pleats.  I had one extra pleat once, and simply nestled it in the edge of the frame--no problem at all.  Filtration is superb; these are authentic filter replacements; you can&#x27;t go wrong here--highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Factory fresh. Perfect fit.</li>
            <li> these look and fit the original filters exactly.</li>
            <li> THIS FILTER DOES NOT PROPERLY FIT THE AMERICAN STANDARD /TRANE FILTER FRAME.  IT IS DEFICIENT IN THE NUMBER OF FOLDS THAT MATE INTO THE FILTER FRAME.  I HAD TO SKIP 2 SLOTS OVER THE EXPANSION OF THE FILTER TO GET THE THING TO FIT.  THIS IS COMPLETELY UNSATISFACTORY.  I AM A TRANE / AMERICAN STANDARD CONTROLS DESIGN ENGINEER.  I KNOW THE PRODUCT.  THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPATABLE.  I HAVE TRIPLE CHECKED THE PART NUMBER AND THE MARKINGS ON THE FILTER.  ALL MARKINGS MATCHED THE ONE I REPLACED.  I COMPROMISED BECAUSE I MANAGED TO MAKE IT FIT.  OTHER CUSTOMERS WOULD NOT OR COULD NOT.  FIX THIS PROBLEM!!!!  IS THIS A CHINESE COUNTERFEIT????</li>
            <li> These are perfect replacements at a great price.  I have ordered them several times and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> A great deal on filters that helped me a lot during the allergy season. No more sneezing and runny nose for me!</li>
            <li> The incorrect size was ordered. Because of that error, no review can be  done on this product at this juncture.</li>
            <li> WHAT CAN I SAY THEY ARE MADE FOR THE FURNACE/AC.</li>
            <li> Turntable was given as a gift to my son, a musician with a good ear for music quality, and he tells me that playing his old 33s has been very enjoyable. The price was good and the quality excellent.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and was exact same original filter, not a similar replacement.  I am ordering two more filters for next service.</li>
            <li> Most of the filter fit well on the frame, but one side had holes that did not match up. I had to make new holes.</li>
            <li> Great delivery, very good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I order the wrong product to begin with, lost the return slip and then could not find the box which got packed up with Christmas wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest people  check numbers very carefully as this number was in the order for the wrong product and i ordered the wrong one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mistake.</li>
            <li> It was easy to purchase, and easy to install. I&#x27;ll purchase it again next year. Shopping on line is easy.</li>
            <li> Good price quick ship</li>
            <li> These are great products.  They fit perfectly, and allow for our A/C unit, which has moisture control as well as temperature control, running through it.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered the incorrect ones. I e-mailed them and informed them I would order the correct ones, they stated they would take the incorrect ones back. I paid $11.00 to send them to the address that they supplied and they didn&#x27;t accept them. They were returned to me as undeliverable.  Not good Business to me, they should have stated no returns and I would not have wasted my money trying to send them back.</li>
            <li> local dealer wants this much for 1 filter and this is a 2 pack original from American Standard, buy it here and let the locals know like I did. I tried to get them to come down some on the local price but they refused so they lost my business to teh internet.</li>
            <li> Great product and service.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Good deal, fit great in my Hvac system.  This is the second time I purchased my filters from them.</li>
            <li> I have not used these filters yet. However, upon inspection they appear to be of good quality material and should function as advertised..</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because it&#x27;s just a filter.  My house stays dusty as I live in FL. I change it twice the amount of recommended frequencies, and it seems to be the only one that fits.  Nothing special, but it works.  We constantly dust and change our filters.  Yes there is better more expensive filters on the market but when it comes to cost per filter, this is probably the better buy.</li>
            <li> This are the best filters, they last long and are cost effective! I would recommend these filters to anyone. They work better than the one month filters!</li>
            <li> Best price found and fast/free shipping to boot.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Service people will tell you, NO, you can&#x27;t buy the filters for your central air ANYWHERE, which only makes you defy them thru the magic machine, online, and find this company. Great.</li>
            <li> Good filters and they match the original. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I feel these will do the job and filter properly.  One caveat - the metal lathe-like covering can cut your fingers/hand up if you aren&#x27;t careful.  Recommend wearing gloves when installing this.</li>
            <li> Had been paying twice as much through my local AC contractor, saved money and was no problem installing.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Since in the past I had purchased the exact filter locally, I ordered it online with a savings of about $12.00/filter.  When placing it in the frame, be sure to follow the instructions.  If you encounter issues, a demonstration can be found online.  With the help of my daughter, i think it took us about 10 minutes to get it in the frame.  Being observant when you take out the one you are replacing will also be helpful. Getting it in is a little tricky, which is why I rated it 4 stars but that may or may not be a reflection on this particular product.</li>
            <li> This product works well.I have had no complaint.fit the unit easily</li>
            <li> 3 years ago i had a new trane furnace installed with a perfect fit frame. when it came time to change the filter i removed the old filter the trane instaler put in and wrote the part number down. Since then every year i have ordered this two pack and they are exactly the same as what was installed orginally (looks, size, etc).</li>
            <li> This is a nice replacement filter for our Air Conditioner.  And we get 2. It is much less expensive to buy your own than purchase it from the A/C people. Will use them again.  Thank you.*****</li>
            <li> Be careful installing, metal lattice is very sharp.  Unfolding the media and placing on the frame can be a little tedious, but not too difficult.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The filters came on time , in good condition, and as described.&lt;br /&gt;I had no purchase or billing issues.&lt;br /&gt;I gave them a four star rating only because the pictures and description could be clearer that the product does not come assembled.</li>
            <li> Even after reading others post on how to assemble I still has to take it apart one time, and put it back together. I will be looking for a solid air filter when these are done. Solid one is already put together and is made of cardboard, just throw it away and install new.</li>
            <li> Easy to install - meets factory specs</li>
            <li> I would give it the highest mark if not for the confusing installation instructions supplied with the filter that call for incorrect installation. Though a correction is included with the product but it is not placed to catch your attention. So prior to discovering the warning one can install the filter wrong based on the main included document. All the rest worked out just fine.</li>
            <li> Best deal around, good quality filter and they last for many months unlike 1&amp;#34; filters. I will be buying them again.</li>
            <li> Needed new filter. Got them inexpensively and quickly. Fit tightly in vacuum, which is great!</li>
            <li> Amazon is only one of two places that sell this filter but for half the price</li>
            <li> We needed to replace our filter at home and this is the only place we could find it for a very reasonable price. They fit perfectly did not have to do any adjusting at all. Will be ordering from this company again.</li>
            <li> These are the real filters.  They fit perfectly and are half as much as me buying them from my local air conditioning contactor.</li>
            <li> The sharp screening support cuts me every time I change the filter.</li>
            <li> If you are reading this, I got your attention with the subject line.  People, these are filters.....nothing more, nothing less.&lt;br /&gt;As long as you order the correct ones, you are good to go (I say this because I originally ordered the wrong filter.  Filters-Now did an exchange for me without question - thanks!).&lt;br /&gt;The filters fit and function as expected.  I can ask for nothing more.  Well, I guess I could ask for something, and I did, but the filters simply will not respond to my request.....&lt;br /&gt;Nice product.  I will buy again. Store handled my exchange professionally and without question.  Winner, winner, chicken dinner.</li>
            <li> Fit correctly, decent price, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Item meet my expectations happy with it</li>
            <li> fast ship came as described</li>
            <li> the price was right and it is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;definitely will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to buy it from the place where I got my unit at and it was twice the price</li>
