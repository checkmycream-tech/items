            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with the result.</li>
            <li>As I wrote for the face serum, this is a wonderfully hydrating serum, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to see you were selling the item and at that price.</li>
            <li>It feels wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Works wonderful for bags and swollen eyes.</li>

            <li>LOVE IT!!!  </li>
            <li>Will order again love it!!!</li>
            <li>These items are very good but don&#x27;t pay that exorbitant prices at the Kiosks.</li>
            <li>The Good - This eye serum works, and if it comes to you in pristine condition, then you have nothing to worry about!</li>
            <li>If this product works as I was told, it is probably great, but I&#x27;ll never know.</li>
            <li>Great product, visible difference.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>It is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>please let me know if you&#x27;ve experienced this.</li>
            <li>the products make your skin look and feel great.  </li>
            <li>This works great...</li>
            <li>This is a great product when used with the eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Great price for this item.</li>
            <li>Great product tons of value.</li>
            <li>Any benefit you get immediately is great, but don&#x27;t expect any long-term benefits.</li>
            <li>HA is great for lines and lifting and vitamin C is great for skin texture and tone.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>great item..</li>
            <li>I found it cheaper, this product honestly removes wrinkles before your eyes, and keeps the fine lines away ALL DAY!!!!</li>
            <li>finding on me is that it works great on the lines around my mouth but makes my eyes puffy.</li>
            <li>It keeps moisturizing throughout the day and works great with the replenishing eye cream.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy with this</li>
            <li>The two together do a great job of moisturizing the eye lids and under the eyes.</li>
            <li>This is a great product without being think or greasy-</li>
            <li>Tried this product today and have experienced blurry vision.</li>
            <li>I did love the immediate results and am impressed as I have used the product for about a week.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, and this is the best, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying a lot more gratiae products and have been very happy with them.</li>
            <li>I Love them both and am very happy with the service, price etc.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re amazing, everything smells great and feels great.</li>
            <li>THE BEST EVER PRODUCT MADE FOR FINE LINES AND</li>
            <li>Make sure if you do buy, you do from someone with very good customer service.</li>
            <li>Amazon price at $23,if for the authentic product, is obviously very good by comparison.  </li>
            <li>When I started using it, I realized I loved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but now way over priced.</li>
            <li>Clinique makes an eye serum just as good,</li>
            <li>Was delighted to find them on Amazon and they are now on clearance.</li>
            <li>This is a really good eye serum.</li>
            <li>&#x60;I have just returned from Fair Oaks mall in Fairfax Virginia, the store name is Premier Store, I think opened since one month or two...</li>
            <li>the product she loved in Vegas was Oro</li>
            <li>The salesgirls are really good, they do one eye</li>
            <li>and soooo good for your skin.</li>
            <li>Loved the eye serum.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so my question is, would you support a company like this, even if their products are good?</li>
            <li>These guys know they are charming and use it to their advantage.</li>
            <li>It was a good product.</li>
            <li>the Replenishing Eye Serum doesn&#x27;t seem to improve wrinkles but it does make my skin feel good and softer.  </li>
            <li>Why would some of the most beautiful hotels and resorts in the world, allow these crooks in their lobbies and malls?</li>
            <li>I was introduced to the product at my hotel in Vegas and was super impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>It nothing exceptional.</li>
            <li>I love it, it smells great, good ingredients, but I get bumps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>I love using the products every day knowing it is organic and makes me feel great.</li>
            <li>Even so I am glad to have found it &amp; so happy Amazon has it avaailable @</li>
            <li>I thought it amazing how good they were.</li>
            <li>But I have been very satisfied with this serum.  </li>
            <li>there are so many great products out there.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love Gratiae&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li>I love this eye serum!</li>
            <li>I have to say I am pretty happy with this product!</li>
            <li>It does something magic to the skin around your eyes and helps the eye cream absorb into the skin giving a smoother appearance!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Have been using it for many years and keep watching the price go up!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It is great at reducing the look of fine lines around your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Simply amazing.</li>
            <li>and she also said I look amazing.</li>
            <li>This serum is amazing.</li>
            <li>Its in a catagory of its own.</li>
            <li>my boss.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer, but so are the Olay</li>
            <li>What a nice eye serum.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that on nows days people use this kind of sales approach.</li>
            <li>but I honestly like the product</li>
            <li>I really liked the scent of the soap</li>
            <li>I was startled by that and liked the compliment at that time.</li>
            <li>My wife really liked Gratiae Organics Replenishing Eye Serum because it met your expectations!Comfortable handling the package.</li>
            <li>These Gratiae products are nicely packaged, smell nice, feel nice, and so on, but I feel like taking them to a lab for analysis.  </li>
            <li>When I returned home I ordered my own supply.</li>
            <li>The Eye Serum was so effective though (before/after effect in minutes) that I&#x27;m buying it on this page.</li>
            <li>AND AM LOVING</li>
            <li>But lets face it, this product is worth $75!!!</li>
            <li>I first bought his item in Las Vegas and loved it, then ran out, found it on amazon and a happy camper again</li>
            <li>It feels amazing after a nice cleansing wash (whatever cleanser you use), and my eye area has never looked and felt better.</li>
            <li>Love it - will be ordering more items - thank you!</li>
            <li>I enjoy using Gratiae products they always work well and are made with ingredience that I feel good about using .</li>
            <li>she asked me which one I liked better (she had 2 kinds), I picked one</li>
            <li>By far, this is the best Gratiae product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Non oily good for dry skin excellent product,have used it for three years I am seventy eight.</li>
            <li>Love it, Love it, Love it!</li>
            <li>Combining these two is smart and a great combination.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but it m not going to pay $90.00 for the eye serum.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it</li>
            <li>This Gratia product is my favorite.</li>
            <li>When I got home and looked most of the serum had leaked out</li>
            <li>I was so impressed I was almost willing to pay the $170 they were charging there but knew I had to check around online first.</li>
            <li>I love the eye serum.</li>
            <li>I have been using it about 5 months and have never had better results</li>
            <li>I think it is OK.  </li>
            <li>It is interesting that they sell in tourist areas where people leave.  </li>
            <li>so can you make sure you ship them for me?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I am sure that they know there is no risk for them...</li>
            <li>I LOVE this SERUM.  </li>
            <li>Now ladies, I do love the products and have seen a difference in my  lines around my eyes...</li>
            <li>Love this serum.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product before and have paid much more for the product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I have used it twice</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find out</li>
            <li>Anyone who pays any more than 20.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products for my eyes and after using this for one week I already saw results.</li>
            <li>Love the product and so do my eyes, you need to also use some eye cream too.</li>
            <li>they told me so many lies like &amp;</li>
            <li>HOWEVER I think you&#x27;ll find most skin care</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is OK as a makeup primer in the daytime.</li>
            <li>days most hairdressers advise clients not to use dimethicone because it dries out your hair (from not breathing).</li>
            <li>Oz Naturals has a more creamy feel like this product but without silicon.</li>
            <li>more I look at the ingredients and</li>
            <li>the more</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>more I look at the ingredients and</li>
            <li>the more</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than retail and works great.</li>
            <li>now for this price you would think the customer service would be a bit better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>they all love them.</li>
            <li>Only applied to one eye and the difference in the two eyes was shockingly wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Target products uh as Aveeno delivers better results for the cost of the tax alone that was paid on the Gratiae products.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and am pleased with the serum&#x27;s perfomance.</li>
            <li>Love this serum.  </li>
            <li>and she said \\&quot;ok</li>
            <li>I had no problems with that - I love beauty products and the store looked lovely.</li>
            <li>their product is not terrible, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1</li>
            <li>But found it here and purchased 2 more for my mother and a for a friend.</li>
            <li>It is  a great serum and much cheaper than buying it from the mall.</li>
            <li>Surely will buy again.</li>
            <li>She showed us how much better we looked after using the eye cream.</li>
            <li>After reading these reviews I&#x27;m sure complaining will get me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 56 and have tried all kinds of products to keep my skin looking healthy, but these 2 products seem to work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but when I received it the package had leaked.</li>
            <li>but he was also charming and fun.</li>
            <li>After using these products for 5 days my cracked hands have healed and are in better shape than they have been in 20yrs.</li>
            <li>Ooh, I love this serum.  </li>
            <li>Felt like an unnatural film just sitting on top of my face.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the texture and the way that it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>Simply the best eye serum, wonderfull.</li>
            <li>Love Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>I love the serum can see the-difference by my eyes.</li>
            <li>He then began to apply a mask to one side of my face and said the mask sells for $599 in Neiman Marcus, but if I purchased the eye and the lifting serum for $350, he would throw in the $599 mask for free!</li>
            <li>Because in 69 yeas I have tried them all, and found that most will \\&quot;sit on top of my skin\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are safe.</li>
            <li>So many eye creams make my eyes tear, burn, itch and peel.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will surely be buying more off Amazon.</li>
            <li>Wrinkles a disappearing and putting make up on over it is so smooth!  </li>
            <li>Gratiae  replenishing eye serum lovely to use..</li>
            <li>br /&gt;skin feels better.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I love the eye serum.</li>
            <li>I bought this product in hopes of it reducing the not so lovely puffiness that has appeared under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m satisfied and can rocommend to the others.</li>
            <li>Maybe they put something better on my face and were trying to sell me Gratiae.</li>
            <li>(I take good care of my skin using \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; products) and to be honest, they don&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the products, but no too happy with the high pressure tactics.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend if you are looking for a great eye serum.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this product, I loved it.  </li>
            <li>It has been one of the best investments either one of us have made in a long time.  </li>
            <li>At 50 the wrinkles around the eyes are becoming more noticable.</li>
            <li>The eye cream is ok, but has no affect on my fine lines.</li>
            <li>Okay.. let me start by say that those who bought and paid huge prices, these reviews are for the product, not buyer guilt.</li>
            <li>Have used this for many years, it&#x27;s fabulous for under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to a lot of product but this one (with the eye cream) is great.  </li>
            <li>It goes on silky smooth and love how it feels.</li>
            <li>It is a great price and truly makes a clear difference on the diminishing of lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The top doesn&#x27;t fit  </li>
            <li>So imagine my joy when I found I could get this line far more cheaply on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m so upset right now!!  </li>
            <li>so I saved my original packaging to make sure it was....</li>
            <li>One tub of eye cream came in perfect condition, while the other was already opened and used, with contents oozing out over the aluminium foil that is supposed to air-seal its contents.</li>
            <li>first I thought she was giving it for free, she had everything wrapped up and then charged me $100!!</li>
            <li>Ladies, take it from one who was shammed and feels embarrassed to have been taken in (by the friendly sincerity of the seller), these products need to be shut out from any more purchases.  </li>
            <li>I really liked it, and even contemplated going in to buy more when it was gone, but luckily checked Amazon first!  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without this product made for mature skin and absolutely the best eye serum I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I ordered it and it came very quickly</li>
            <li>I am 49 and fortunate not to have many wrinkles so someone with more wrinkles or deeper ones might not notice a difference as quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used their products for a year now and highly recommend their line to anyone who likes to pamper your skin and feel good about how you look.</li>
            <li>Pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is the best, I already notice a difference on my dark circles and lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Okay, just bought the serum and eye cream today in a cool downtown NYC boutique, THEN did my research here and realized I overpaid by about 300%.</li>
            <li>This product is hands down the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>They do half of your face, and I could see a difference and it felt wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Rec&#x27;d order in less than a week, awesome.</li>
            <li>serrum is fine, packaging not</li>
            <li>but since this absorbs quickly I must have more dryness in the eye area than I thought</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly nothing amazing.</li>
            <li>Thanks again for this amazing product.</li>
            <li>a fraction of cost with Free shiping yet.</li>
            <li>then insisted that I get the eye products and that I will get a range of free products if purchased</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, they&#x27;d be worth even more than that.  </li>
            <li>SMOOTH:  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s goes so smoothly on my skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>face feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Always does a fabulous job on my eyes.</li>
            <li>You see instant results and great price.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and make your skin feel like silk</li>
            <li>Instead of being upset that I paid too much in Vegas, I&#x27;m THRILLED</li>
            <li>She said she was going to get me some free samples and dragged me along to the shop.</li>
            <li>Their website says not to buy these products cheaply or you&#x27;re getting ripped off.  </li>
            <li>when the salesperson claims that the product actually sells for $500 online, so you&#x27;re getting a great deal.</li>
            <li>Eyeshadows go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll give one to you for free through my account \\&quot;she</li>
            <li>I am much too nice and polite and I should have walked away.</li>
            <li>Also if it is such a great product, why do they have to grab people walking through a mall?</li>
            <li>I gave it one star because that is the lowest rating available in order to write a review.</li>
            <li>This eye serum makes your skin feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>they charged me $290 for the serum, then then gave me the eye cream for free \\&quot;because</li>
            <li>I have not found it to be a wrinkle miracle cure but seems to be working good so far</li>
            <li>I was also informed that Gratiae is an national company, that the eye serum is a good product, that the product on Amazon (as far as known) is NOT a knock-off, but that the kiosk sales people are indeed commissioned, but should not to be so aggressive, like moving out from the area of the kiosk, or engaging with people walking by.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Someone is getting really rich on selling these pitiful combinations of cheap ingredients and yet making it look like some luxury brand.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure this is cheap gelatin based stuff.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this product anytime, it is very good for dark circles and combating fines lines in the eye area.</li>
            <li>I originally started using this for around the eyes but started spreading it over my face as I like the feel of it</li>
            <li>It worked wonders on the area under my eye and the saleslady even put it on my laugh lines around my mouth and you couldn&#x27;t even see the lines anymore!</li>
            <li>It is worth every cent!</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;The original price is 700(!)&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a unique eye treatment.</li>
            <li>How I see it is never spend more than you are willing to lose.  </li>
            <li>I, too, was originally sucked in at a kiosk in a mall.  </li>
            <li>worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I bought this for the first time at a salon and paid 3X more over a year ago.  </li>
            <li>THAT&#x27;S why it felt familiar.  </li>
            <li>she buffed my nails with this rectangle thing, leaving my nails looking shiny, wet and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>I am glad i spent it on good product.  </li>
            <li>Best eye serum by far that I have used in the last 20 years.  </li>
            <li>I and thrilled to be able to purchase what I was at such a bargain price.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews from people saying they are concerned purchasing these products from another source might not be smart as they might be bogus...</li>
            <li>the eye serum and cream were on special for \\&quot;buy</li>
            <li>/&gt;It absorbs and you can go right on with the make up!</li>
            <li>He put it on my right eye, then added the eye cream, and I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference!</li>
            <li>I spent close to $1000 on their products and although the price made me shudder, the product made me happy.  </li>
            <li>The product is as expected so happy about my purchase.</li>
            <li>NEVER GAVE ME MY FULL REFUND</li>
            <li>I love the product and it works very well and is all organic.</li>
            <li>Glad it&#x27;s at a reasonable price here.</li>
            <li>Works much better than very pricey serums on the market.  </li>
            <li>Here on Amazon you can find it more reasonably priced.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I  was previously using oil of olay which is also a good product, but for me this eye serum worked better for bagges under the eyes.</li>
            <li>After the famous \\&quot;trial on one side of your face\\&quot; and feeling good about the difference, I was offered a package deal of products for about $ 399.00  to begin, and then after telling them we do like the products , but the price is too high, they suddenly dropped the price to $199.00 and even threw in a \\&quot;free\\&quot; bottle of face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Both of those ingredients  actually do lift the skin, even skin town and reduce fine lines and are effective anti-aging products.</li>
            <li>Great, just like all the other womens&#x27; reviews, I&#x27;ve been ripped off.</li>
            <li>Luckily for me I can afford it.  </li>
            <li>A very pushy kiosk sales person approached me claiming my face makeup wasn&#x27;t good nor natural.</li>
            <li>The serums I mentioned on Amazon have those two ingredients at the best possible price and it is only my skin care product addiction that caused me to buy the Gratiae serum just to</li>
            <li>I took the time to write this review because I suspected fraud and sleazy business tactics and could not let that stand.entioned on Amazon have those two ingredients at the best possible price and it is only my skin care product addiction that caused me to buy the Gratiae serum just to</li>
            <li>Item was received quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>But it won&#x27;t provide any long term benefits &amp; isn&#x27;t good for continuous use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, avoid the super hot Israeli guys at the Vegas mall kiosks!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>In reality, none of the extra items were free and I knew that, however, she made it seem like I was getting such a great deal and</li>
            <li>I paid 500 for the serum and the cream, what&#x27;s all the whining, it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>A nice guy followed me to my car, took all the boxes I had and headed back to his store.  </li>
            <li>As for the Gratiae website and the prices there -- it makes me laugh.</li>
            <li>By the time I was done, I had purchased over 500 worth.</li>
            <li>Wait another minute after eye cream has absorbed into skin before applying concealer.  </li>
            <li>If it were miraculous these products would be worth the hundreds of dollars that the Kiosk people charge.  </li>
            <li>but they were nice enough to give my daughter a tube of skin cream worth about 15us...</li>
            <li>It is well worth buying.  </li>
            <li>And most importantly, it did not deliver the same results.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>the sales guy thinks I&#x27;m worth the deal</li>
            <li>The eye serum is very rich and soft around the eyes.</li>
            <li>It is the exact same product, and I do love it, but don&#x27;t be swindled by these crooks!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product that treats &amp; diminishes lines &amp; wrinkles leaving under eye skin soft, smooth &amp; wrinkle free!</li>
            <li>good if you used with other Gratiae products</li>
            <li>I was so excited about the much lower price points, but soon came to learn the price to pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To that I say, in a day in age of smart phones and free wireless everywhere if you can&#x27;t take 5 minutes to do a quick internet search to see if the price is reasonable</li>
            <li>I am so upset right now.  </li>
            <li>THEM DISAPPEAR RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES</li>
            <li>Obviously everything in Vegas is crazily marked up and Amazon has an amazing price!</li>
            <li>I was very worried but this product came and when I tried it, it felt soooo silky smooth exactly what the seller said it would do.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this in Vegas, I am so glad amazon offers it at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>Great product for very little cost.</li>
            <li>Very little is needed and the results are great.</li>
            <li>but if the puffiness under my eyes continues to decrease I would say it is worth the higher price.  </li>
            <li>High pressure sales and ingredients like dimethicone are highly suspect  and not the way a reputable company does business.</li>
            <li>High pressure sales and ingredients like dimethicone are highly suspect  and not the way a reputable company does business.</li>
            <li>Well, when something looks too good to be true it usually is, and this case is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin and the moisturizing/hydrating effect lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work very fast.</li>
            <li>I was leaving a San Diego mall right at closing one night, and got handed a sample by an attractive young lady, who got me to sit down</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product in Miracle Mile in Vegas, salesman on the kiosk was pushy and rude, I agreed to purchase some product and furnished credit card details, he then proceeded to try and push more product which would have cost over £1000.I threatened to call security and he backed down, however this said the product is exceptional , it is a great pity that Gratiae adopts this style of selling, I recently visited Malta, and in Valetta found a store which approached the whole procedure differently ,I was happy to spend £300.</li>
            <li>First mistake.</li>
            <li>you will find that their first listed ingredients (which means they are the majority ingredients) have neuro- and endocrine toxicity.</li>
            <li>and I think one of the reasons is consistent use of this product.</li>
            <li>they have very agressive sales people, they say they are from Israel !</li>
            <li>recently ordered the product (Oro Instant Firming Serum) that made my sister squeal in Vegas, I will review it - honestly - after I give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;Until then -- save your money!</li>
            <li>It really works and people comment how I look great and usually ask what creams I am using.</li>
            <li>I first was introduce to this product in Las Vegas in the mall.  </li>
            <li>I actually fell in love with all the products.</li>
            <li>and I really do love the products, however, I will buy from Amazon in the future.  </li>
            <li>The actual salesperson I spoke with admit that he had told me that, but was so sure that I would love the products that he tried to make a deal with me that if I used it for 2 weeks and brought it back, he would refund me.</li>
            <li>I also noted that there are virtually no reviews by reputable beauty reviewers such as Allure magazine editors.</li>
            <li>me say FIRST: These ingredients are NOT TOXIC and have been approved by the U.S. FDA (a governmental agency) for use in beauty products.</li>
            <li>The Ultimate Swiss has a more watery texture and soaks in and contours and lifts.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I bought something like this on the internet.  </li>
            <li>I think I have got allergy to the product that was the first time I ever had the allergy to any cosmetics or skin care products.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>The first one I purchased from a Mall store for a lot of money.</li>
            <li>I first saw the eye cream when I was in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>They should make sure how they package it next time.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day the Gatiae side looked a tiny bit better</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t even get it off with hot water and soap...</li>
            <li>I had the same experience as most of the commentators.</li>
            <li>And since they only did one eye, and the effects lasted overnight, I was able to compare.</li>
            <li>First things first: This eye serum is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>even though I paid way too much, I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>problem is the pretty bottle  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not spending that kind of money\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product in Las Vegas 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>So I now have 2  bottles on top of the one I am presently using.</li>
            <li>I am amazed, and hear it works even better with the eye cream, which I hope to purchase next.</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;m a guy at age 50.</li>
            <li>I hope this works, because during my demo at the store, the product feels natural and comfortable on my skin, and I did see an immediate difference.</li>
            <li>The price was substantially higher in Las Vegas, so there must be a reason.  </li>
            <li>This is the same product I got sucked into buying for way more $$ at the shipping mall at Caesar&#x27;s in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>Honestly, because if my results in less than a week of use, I would recommend the full line at full price to anyone with problem sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>to be honest I had some doubts to buy it, because my skin around the eyes is really very sensitive, but finally I decided</li>
            <li>This is the most effective eye cream I have used, it firms the skin around the eye and definitely reduces appearance of dark circles.</li>
            <li>My eyes are so soft and completely wrinkle free, the skin is full and you cant see my pores on my cheeks anymore</li>
            <li>Been using this product for two years, wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind</li>
            <li>We were convinced by a very nice jewish girl that this was only sold in high end salons.</li>
            <li>I appreciated it very much.</li>
            <li>I am putting it on my eye wrinkles and small scars on my face, and it is amazing at how quickly they are disappearing.</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s pretty much your fault for wasting your money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>when my husband saw me after I used it the first time (not knowing what I had done), he said \\&quot;you look really good\\</li>
            <li>A monkey could have done a better job.</li>
            <li>Everywhere I went in Vegas, they were there, same pitch same young attractive people from Israel.</li>
            <li>The company isn&#x27;t practicing good business so not sure if I will buy from them again, but if I do, I will buy through amazon.</li>
            <li>What high quality product is sold in Las Vegas at kiosks with super high pressure sales people?</li>
            <li>What high quality product is sold in Las Vegas at kiosks with super high pressure sales people?</li>
            <li>\\&quot;the buffer is made out of pure diamonds and silk and your nail will stay like this for 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I like the product and certainly think this is the way to purchase it versus at retail outlets.</li>
            <li>and she certainly wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;losing</li>
            <li>I do not have \\&quot;wrinkles\\&quot; but am starting to get fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li>It actually does diminish the look of the fine wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I just started using Gratiae lifting serum after buying it from Amazon and thought it was a decent product at first</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over a year and recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li>I love even more the fact that the price has gone down!!!!</li>
            <li>It really makes the skin around the eye area smooth and younger looking.</li>
            <li>I purchased the eye cream and the mask at Mission Viejo California, for a huge price of over $500.00 which now I know that is even bigger ripe off</li>
            <li>and it really seems to make my skin glow.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product in Las Vegas from a mall huckster and paid way too much.</li>
            <li>I told them I need to check online the real price and reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a gentle cooling effect around the eyes.</li>
            <li>I did really think about buying product but thank goodness</li>
            <li>The salesmen are very pushy and get very hateful when you do not buy....  </li>
            <li>This product by Gratiae makes the skin around my eyes very moist.</li>
            <li>It feels like velvet, is so gentle but really works.</li>
            <li>and my eyes are very swollen and itchy.  </li>
            <li>and you really see the difference.</li>
            <li>This eye serum really works and when I massage it into my crow&#x27;s feet, they almost disappear.  </li>
            <li>I thought it might not be the real thing</li>
            <li>Works really well under make up...</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product and the shipment was as expected.  </li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>Very neutral feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li>It took a couple months but was hassle free and now I have their product and my money back.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I can really notice a diffrence with this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Very dissappointing.</li>
            <li>It really does work around the eye lines.</li>
            <li>This bottle lasted me a whole year..</li>
            <li>I was in a rush at the mall, but there was a girl holding a bunch of free soap samples standing outside asking passerbys if they would like one.</li>
            <li>( I really was) and had to go home.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really pay attention to it and just kept on walking and talking to my partner.</li>
            <li>She began talking (high !)</li>
            <li>I found it on Amazon MUCH cheaper and was hoping it would help my puffy bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in the eye area.</li>
            <li>This makes me think that the whole company is a scam.  </li>
            <li>I would not find myself without it and highly recommend anyone try it and see for themselves!</li>
            <li>I will purchase more of the same products and more different ones by the same manufacturer....but from AMAZON.com</li>
            <li>I have find this product to work very well.  </li>
            <li>forward to this product.&lt;br /&gt;After my mall experience, I googled the product and was ecstatic to find it so much cheaper here.</li>
            <li>In almost every review that I have read about Gratiae serum products, everyone seems compelled to mention how much cheaper they are on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The serum goes on really nice,but it does absolutely nothing for the puffiness.</li>
            <li>I will never pay that much again</li>
            <li>It goes on greasy feeling but absorbs and keeps your eyes very hydrated</li>
            <li>This is a manufacturer issue and not so much Amazon, but still.</li>
            <li>It was very pricey.  </li>
            <li>prices and said that I should buy at least the two products she just applied on me because they would do so much good.</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of other brands of skin care you find at high-end department stores and have not been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product, along with the eye cream, from a kiosk in White Plains.  </li>
            <li>I could not believe that it was only a fraction of the original price.  </li>
            <li>As mentioned in many of the other reviews, I also purchased this product from a kiosk at an upscale mall, where they offered the &amp;#34;deal of the century&amp;#34; for 3 products.  </li>
            <li>was excited to try this and the eye cream - the two products I tried in the store.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not the same.</li>
            <li>The top doesn&#x27;t sit well on the bottle due to the manner in which it was packaged.</li>
            <li>Still use it for the long lines and get compliments on how young I look :)</li>
            <li>thank God I was strong enough to refuse all their offers and checked on internet.</li>
            <li>I use it on the fine skin around my eyes and it makes my skin feel velvety instead of dry.</li>
            <li>Skin under my eye looked different for the whole day after I tried serum under my right eye.</li>
            <li>In just a few weeks all the fine lines around my eyes were gone!</li>
            <li>I was highly pressured by a sales girl named Nikki, in the hotel Paris in Las Vegas.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I did not like the extremely high price at the store</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s a high Pressure sales, high margin, high cost gemic.</li>
            <li>For $300 I walked away with a great selection of scrub lotion and facial system (final price about same as would have paid for same products from amazon).</li>
            <li>The products are high end, and just what one would expect from a mall.</li>
            <li>Their prices are way too high compared to Amazon.</li>
            <li>I also found out about the product from the high pressure sales at the Miracle Mall in Las Vegas</li>
            <li>After a moment, of course that led to checking out products that are supposedly not available anywhere except the most high end stores.  </li>
            <li>It has a special feel of softness under the eyes to keep the facial tissue soft without drying out the skin.</li>
            <li>The salesperson was very pushy and charged me $300 for the eye serum and the eye cream and acted like she was throwing in the following for free; multi-use lotion, toner and facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I had been burned with some resin that my husband coats concrete floors with and</li>
            <li>Telling him how much better he would look after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Not everyone responds the same way to anything, but these are worth the try.</li>
            <li>Normally eye treatments take a while.</li>
            <li>Many have complained of paying a higher price for this product at the mall</li>
            <li>The products are so good that I ask myself, why do they keep on playing the deceitful game?</li>
            <li>Other ingredients like jojoba oil and a trace amount of retinol are fine</li>
            <li>Other ingredients like jojoba oil and a trace amount of retinol are fine</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t particularly feel like my 28 year old skin needs $170 worth of products to make look younger.</li>
            <li>Then I read many Amazon reviews by customers who said they&#x27;d first learned of the product via high pressure kiosk sales (never a good sign).</li>
            <li>and they told me there were no refunds even though all our products were still brand new and unopened.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item at an upscale mall in New York.</li>
            <li>I came back to the UK with numerous skin care aids and all are fantastic</li>
            <li>I am convinced that this stuff is a sham, I believe someone decided they could substitute dimethicone (cheap) for hyaluronic acid which is the real thing.</li>
            <li>I am convinced that this stuff is a sham, I believe someone decided they could substitute dimethicone (cheap) for hyaluronic acid which is the real thing.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t allow your skin to breathe and instead layer it with a thin layer of plastic that will dry out your skin and in my opinion also prevent any good ingredients from being absorbed into your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am truly obsessed with this product and as long as you can acquire it for a good price on the internet or somehow from a mall kiosk than it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I believe Gratiae&#x27;s plan all along was to have a website with super expensive prices that make it seem like the product is high grade and high quality while then making most of their sales at prices like Amazon charges</li>
            <li>I believe Gratiae&#x27;s plan all along was to have a website with super expensive prices that make it seem like the product is high grade and high quality while then making most of their sales at prices like Amazon charges</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Very much like the replenishing facial serum.  </li>
            <li>He was young, polite and friendly, full of tactics, so much that I didn&#x27;t know whether it was scary or funny.</li>
            <li>Long story short, I was strong and not let them rip me off.</li>
            <li>That explains the low price - as this definitely seems to be an original product.</li>
            <li>This has got to be the exact same stuff that is in the Gratiae Lifting Face serum.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s going some on a 63 year old woman!  </li>
            <li>I am not usually a person to complain on line, but I do not want this happen to anyone else.</li>
            <li>No product works exactly the same on everybody, but let me tell you if you follow Gratiae instructions</li>
            <li>This is the exact same product Gratiae sell but a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>What a big surprise to find the exact items on Amazon for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I find this produce to be on irritating,  it  absorbs quickly, and  works beautifully on fine lines around the eye</li>
            <li>I paid outrageous prices for this and several other Gratiae products, but the good part of this is that I learned about these wonderful products.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t fit tightly, so leaks.</li>
            <li>The area around my eye is tighter and the fine lines became softer after a few dabs.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy a product from a vendor that I am certain of its authenticity , especially for a product thats applied so close to the eye.</li>
            <li>At nearly 70 years I don&#x27;t suppose anything can really make a big difference</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t go near them.  </li>
            <li>I am  a 53 year old business woman, and all I can say is that I wish I had these sales people in my business.  </li>
            <li>Over the next few days I Googled what I had bought and realized I paid too much, but they gave me soooo much free</li>
            <li>Oh much cheaper than what those kiosks in the malls sell the same product for.</li>
            <li>I have bought 3 times so far and plan on buying again.</li>
            <li>FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This serum is very moisture but at the same time your face absorbe it inmediatelly</li>
            <li>But on a packaging point-of-view, the bottle was open as the lid doesn&#x27;t really close.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and this product has never burned or irritated me.  </li>
            <li>I looked up the ingredients and told the guy there was almost nothing organic or natural about the serum.</li>
            <li>I was grabbed by a young woman at the hotel I was staying at.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow.</li>
            <li>directly contacted the mall management</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain as far as the delivery.  </li>
            <li>While I am annoyed that the company resorts to duping customers into overpaying for the product, i definitely think it is worth the amazon price and more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using it on other areas on my face where I&#x27;m noticing fine wrinkles, like above my lip.</li>
            <li>Later I realized that my right eye is not as puffy as the left one.</li>
            <li>I do not believe it does much in the long run, but short term, you can absolutely see the difference.</li>
            <li>the more I read the ridiculous claims on the company website</li>
            <li>the more I read the ridiculous claims on the company website</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend, and especially so at this price!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t harass me but definitely gave the high pressured sales pitch, and the discounted price (two products for $199 vs or).</li>
            <li>It was very convincing but too expensive.</li>
            <li>Feels smooth and one of the VERY FEW items I can use around my eye area without it burning my eyes or skin if I apply immediately after using facewash on my face or an exfoliant.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s too many other eye products for less.</li>
            <li>makes the skin under the eye very soft, can lead to puffyness left on over night</li>
            <li>I have been using the same bottle twice/day for 5 months and it is still half full.</li>
            <li>You use so little of it at a time - it lasts forever and therefore extremely economical.</li>
            <li>I will not buy it again as long as the prices are this high.</li>
            <li>but it is not and absorbs into your skin leaving the delicate tissue of your eyes feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>The product works, I don&#x27;t regret the absurd amount I initially spent, but am thrilled to find it at a reasonable price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the company itself supplies Amazon with the product to sell for a low price since it can&#x27;t be moving at $400 per product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dark circles lightened quite a bit after first use.</li>
            <li>Shouldn&#x27;t a reputable company stand behind their products?&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li>like many of the other reviewers complained, you can get the products for near a 10th the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My rosatia is clearing and the redness is now only pink and smooth and my dark circles (I work nights)</li>
            <li>Yes, they are very pushy and sometimes rude, however, the products themselves seem to be very high quality.</li>
            <li>I could do more to stop this kind of evil in the world~~~~~</li>
            <li>My wife uses this daily, she too spent to much at a kiosk until she found it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to use it in the morning, I suggest giving yourself time before applying makeup as the product takes a few extra minutes to be absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>Feels a little oily when you first apply.  </li>
            <li>This product really keeps dark circles and puffiness under control.</li>
            <li>It did help my husband&#x27;s really dark circles,they really bothered him.</li>
            <li>My story is the same as some other reviewers as I paid too much money on an impulse purchase that I was told was organic.</li>
            <li>So, really I paid $150 for the serum, then $150 for cream when you break it down, and I was still ripped off for both.</li>
            <li>I used this in the past (when I foolishly paid the ridiculous mall price!) and loved it.</li>
            <li>so unless something equally good and less expensive comes along, I will probably continue to use it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product tons of value.</li>
            <li> Any benefit you get immediately is great, but don&#x27;t expect any long-term benefits.</li>

            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> great item..</li>
            <li> I found it cheaper, this product honestly removes wrinkles before your eyes, and keeps the fine lines away ALL DAY!!!!</li>
            <li> finding on me is that it works great on the lines around my mouth but makes my eyes puffy.</li>
            <li> It keeps moisturizing throughout the day and works great with the replenishing eye cream.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy with this</li>
            <li> The two together do a great job of moisturizing the eye lids and under the eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a great product without being think or greasy-</li>
            <li> Tried this product today and have experienced blurry vision.</li>
            <li> I did love the immediate results and am impressed as I have used the product for about a week.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products, and this is the best, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying a lot more gratiae products and have been very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I Love them both and am very happy with the service, price etc.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re amazing, everything smells great and feels great.</li>
            <li> THE BEST EVER PRODUCT MADE FOR FINE LINES AND</li>
            <li> Make sure if you do buy, you do from someone with very good customer service.</li>
            <li> Amazon price at $23,if for the authentic product, is obviously very good by comparison.  </li>
            <li> When I started using it, I realized I loved it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but now way over priced.</li>
            <li> Clinique makes an eye serum just as good,</li>
            <li> Was delighted to find them on Amazon and they are now on clearance.</li>
            <li> This is a really good eye serum.</li>
            <li> &#x60;I have just returned from Fair Oaks mall in Fairfax Virginia, the store name is Premier Store, I think opened since one month or two...</li>
            <li> the product she loved in Vegas was Oro</li>
            <li> The salesgirls are really good, they do one eye</li>
            <li> and soooo good for your skin.</li>
            <li> Loved the eye serum.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> so my question is, would you support a company like this, even if their products are good?</li>
            <li> These guys know they are charming and use it to their advantage.</li>
            <li> It was a good product.</li>
            <li> the Replenishing Eye Serum doesn&#x27;t seem to improve wrinkles but it does make my skin feel good and softer.  </li>
            <li> Why would some of the most beautiful hotels and resorts in the world, allow these crooks in their lobbies and malls?</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the product at my hotel in Vegas and was super impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> It nothing exceptional.</li>
            <li> I love it, it smells great, good ingredients, but I get bumps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> I love using the products every day knowing it is organic and makes me feel great.</li>
            <li> Even so I am glad to have found it &amp; so happy Amazon has it avaailable @</li>
            <li> I thought it amazing how good they were.</li>
            <li> But I have been very satisfied with this serum.  </li>
            <li> there are so many great products out there.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love Gratiae&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li> I love this eye serum!</li>
            <li> I have to say I am pretty happy with this product!</li>
            <li> It does something magic to the skin around your eyes and helps the eye cream absorb into the skin giving a smoother appearance!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for many years and keep watching the price go up!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It is great at reducing the look of fine lines around your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Simply amazing.</li>
            <li> and she also said I look amazing.</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing.</li>
            <li> Its in a catagory of its own.</li>
            <li> my boss.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer, but so are the Olay</li>
            <li> What a nice eye serum.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that on nows days people use this kind of sales approach.</li>
            <li> but I honestly like the product</li>
            <li> I really liked the scent of the soap</li>
            <li> I was startled by that and liked the compliment at that time.</li>
            <li> My wife really liked Gratiae Organics Replenishing Eye Serum because it met your expectations!Comfortable handling the package.</li>
            <li> These Gratiae products are nicely packaged, smell nice, feel nice, and so on, but I feel like taking them to a lab for analysis.  </li>
            <li> When I returned home I ordered my own supply.</li>
            <li> The Eye Serum was so effective though (before/after effect in minutes) that I&#x27;m buying it on this page.</li>
            <li> AND AM LOVING</li>
            <li> But lets face it, this product is worth $75!!!</li>
            <li> I first bought his item in Las Vegas and loved it, then ran out, found it on amazon and a happy camper again</li>
            <li> It feels amazing after a nice cleansing wash (whatever cleanser you use), and my eye area has never looked and felt better.</li>
            <li> Love it - will be ordering more items - thank you!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using Gratiae products they always work well and are made with ingredience that I feel good about using .</li>
            <li> she asked me which one I liked better (she had 2 kinds), I picked one</li>
            <li> By far, this is the best Gratiae product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Non oily good for dry skin excellent product,have used it for three years I am seventy eight.</li>
            <li> Love it, Love it, Love it!</li>
            <li> Combining these two is smart and a great combination.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but it m not going to pay $90.00 for the eye serum.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it</li>
            <li> This Gratia product is my favorite.</li>
            <li> When I got home and looked most of the serum had leaked out</li>
            <li> I was so impressed I was almost willing to pay the $170 they were charging there but knew I had to check around online first.</li>
            <li> I love the eye serum.</li>
            <li> I have been using it about 5 months and have never had better results</li>
            <li> I think it is OK.  </li>
            <li> It is interesting that they sell in tourist areas where people leave.  </li>
            <li> so can you make sure you ship them for me?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I am sure that they know there is no risk for them...</li>
            <li> I LOVE this SERUM.  </li>
            <li> Now ladies, I do love the products and have seen a difference in my  lines around my eyes...</li>
            <li> Love this serum.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product before and have paid much more for the product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, I have used it twice</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find out</li>
            <li> Anyone who pays any more than 20.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products for my eyes and after using this for one week I already saw results.</li>
            <li> Love the product and so do my eyes, you need to also use some eye cream too.</li>
            <li> they told me so many lies like &amp;</li>
            <li> HOWEVER I think you&#x27;ll find most skin care</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is OK as a makeup primer in the daytime.</li>
            <li> days most hairdressers advise clients not to use dimethicone because it dries out your hair (from not breathing).</li>
            <li> Oz Naturals has a more creamy feel like this product but without silicon.</li>
            <li> more I look at the ingredients and</li>
            <li> the more</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li> more I look at the ingredients and</li>
            <li> the more</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than retail and works great.</li>
            <li> now for this price you would think the customer service would be a bit better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> they all love them.</li>
            <li> Only applied to one eye and the difference in the two eyes was shockingly wonderful!  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Target products uh as Aveeno delivers better results for the cost of the tax alone that was paid on the Gratiae products.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and am pleased with the serum&#x27;s perfomance.</li>
            <li> Love this serum.  </li>
            <li> and she said \\&quot;ok</li>
            <li> I had no problems with that - I love beauty products and the store looked lovely.</li>
            <li> their product is not terrible, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1</li>
            <li> But found it here and purchased 2 more for my mother and a for a friend.</li>
            <li> It is  a great serum and much cheaper than buying it from the mall.</li>
            <li> Surely will buy again.</li>
            <li> She showed us how much better we looked after using the eye cream.</li>
            <li> After reading these reviews I&#x27;m sure complaining will get me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 and have tried all kinds of products to keep my skin looking healthy, but these 2 products seem to work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but when I received it the package had leaked.</li>
            <li> but he was also charming and fun.</li>
            <li> After using these products for 5 days my cracked hands have healed and are in better shape than they have been in 20yrs.</li>
            <li> Ooh, I love this serum.  </li>
            <li> Felt like an unnatural film just sitting on top of my face.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the texture and the way that it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Simply the best eye serum, wonderfull.</li>
            <li> Love Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I love the serum can see the-difference by my eyes.</li>
            <li> He then began to apply a mask to one side of my face and said the mask sells for $599 in Neiman Marcus, but if I purchased the eye and the lifting serum for $350, he would throw in the $599 mask for free!</li>
            <li> Because in 69 yeas I have tried them all, and found that most will \\&quot;sit on top of my skin\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are safe.</li>
            <li> So many eye creams make my eyes tear, burn, itch and peel.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will surely be buying more off Amazon.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles a disappearing and putting make up on over it is so smooth!  </li>
            <li> Gratiae  replenishing eye serum lovely to use..</li>
            <li> br /&gt;skin feels better.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> I love the eye serum.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes of it reducing the not so lovely puffiness that has appeared under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m satisfied and can rocommend to the others.</li>
            <li> Maybe they put something better on my face and were trying to sell me Gratiae.</li>
            <li> (I take good care of my skin using \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; products) and to be honest, they don&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the products, but no too happy with the high pressure tactics.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend if you are looking for a great eye serum.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product, I loved it.  </li>
            <li> It has been one of the best investments either one of us have made in a long time.  </li>
            <li> At 50 the wrinkles around the eyes are becoming more noticable.</li>
            <li> The eye cream is ok, but has no affect on my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Okay.. let me start by say that those who bought and paid huge prices, these reviews are for the product, not buyer guilt.</li>
            <li> Have used this for many years, it&#x27;s fabulous for under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to a lot of product but this one (with the eye cream) is great.  </li>
            <li> It goes on silky smooth and love how it feels.</li>
            <li> It is a great price and truly makes a clear difference on the diminishing of lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The top doesn&#x27;t fit  </li>
            <li> So imagine my joy when I found I could get this line far more cheaply on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m so upset right now!!  </li>
            <li> so I saved my original packaging to make sure it was....</li>
            <li> One tub of eye cream came in perfect condition, while the other was already opened and used, with contents oozing out over the aluminium foil that is supposed to air-seal its contents.</li>
            <li> first I thought she was giving it for free, she had everything wrapped up and then charged me $100!!</li>
            <li> Ladies, take it from one who was shammed and feels embarrassed to have been taken in (by the friendly sincerity of the seller), these products need to be shut out from any more purchases.  </li>
            <li> I really liked it, and even contemplated going in to buy more when it was gone, but luckily checked Amazon first!  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without this product made for mature skin and absolutely the best eye serum I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and it came very quickly</li>
            <li> I am 49 and fortunate not to have many wrinkles so someone with more wrinkles or deeper ones might not notice a difference as quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used their products for a year now and highly recommend their line to anyone who likes to pamper your skin and feel good about how you look.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product is the best, I already notice a difference on my dark circles and lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Okay, just bought the serum and eye cream today in a cool downtown NYC boutique, THEN did my research here and realized I overpaid by about 300%.</li>
            <li> This product is hands down the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> They do half of your face, and I could see a difference and it felt wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d order in less than a week, awesome.</li>
            <li> serrum is fine, packaging not</li>
            <li> but since this absorbs quickly I must have more dryness in the eye area than I thought</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly nothing amazing.</li>
            <li> Thanks again for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> a fraction of cost with Free shiping yet.</li>
            <li> then insisted that I get the eye products and that I will get a range of free products if purchased</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, they&#x27;d be worth even more than that.  </li>
            <li> SMOOTH:  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s goes so smoothly on my skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> face feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li> Always does a fabulous job on my eyes.</li>
            <li> You see instant results and great price.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and make your skin feel like silk</li>
            <li> Instead of being upset that I paid too much in Vegas, I&#x27;m THRILLED</li>
            <li> She said she was going to get me some free samples and dragged me along to the shop.</li>
            <li> Their website says not to buy these products cheaply or you&#x27;re getting ripped off.  </li>
            <li> when the salesperson claims that the product actually sells for $500 online, so you&#x27;re getting a great deal.</li>
            <li> Eyeshadows go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll give one to you for free through my account \\&quot;she</li>
            <li> I am much too nice and polite and I should have walked away.</li>
            <li> Also if it is such a great product, why do they have to grab people walking through a mall?</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because that is the lowest rating available in order to write a review.</li>
            <li> This eye serum makes your skin feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> they charged me $290 for the serum, then then gave me the eye cream for free \\&quot;because</li>
            <li> I have not found it to be a wrinkle miracle cure but seems to be working good so far</li>
            <li> I was also informed that Gratiae is an national company, that the eye serum is a good product, that the product on Amazon (as far as known) is NOT a knock-off, but that the kiosk sales people are indeed commissioned, but should not to be so aggressive, like moving out from the area of the kiosk, or engaging with people walking by.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Someone is getting really rich on selling these pitiful combinations of cheap ingredients and yet making it look like some luxury brand.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this is cheap gelatin based stuff.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this product anytime, it is very good for dark circles and combating fines lines in the eye area.</li>
            <li> I originally started using this for around the eyes but started spreading it over my face as I like the feel of it</li>
            <li> It worked wonders on the area under my eye and the saleslady even put it on my laugh lines around my mouth and you couldn&#x27;t even see the lines anymore!</li>
            <li> It is worth every cent!</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;The original price is 700(!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a unique eye treatment.</li>
            <li> How I see it is never spend more than you are willing to lose.  </li>
            <li> I, too, was originally sucked in at a kiosk in a mall.  </li>
            <li> worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the first time at a salon and paid 3X more over a year ago.  </li>
            <li> THAT&#x27;S why it felt familiar.  </li>
            <li> she buffed my nails with this rectangle thing, leaving my nails looking shiny, wet and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Worth a try!</li>
            <li> I am glad i spent it on good product.  </li>
            <li> Best eye serum by far that I have used in the last 20 years.  </li>
            <li> I and thrilled to be able to purchase what I was at such a bargain price.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews from people saying they are concerned purchasing these products from another source might not be smart as they might be bogus...</li>
            <li> the eye serum and cream were on special for \\&quot;buy</li>
            <li> /&gt;It absorbs and you can go right on with the make up!</li>
            <li> He put it on my right eye, then added the eye cream, and I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference!</li>
            <li> I spent close to $1000 on their products and although the price made me shudder, the product made me happy.  </li>
            <li> The product is as expected so happy about my purchase.</li>
            <li> NEVER GAVE ME MY FULL REFUND</li>
            <li> I love the product and it works very well and is all organic.</li>
            <li> Glad it&#x27;s at a reasonable price here.</li>
            <li> Works much better than very pricey serums on the market.  </li>
            <li> Here on Amazon you can find it more reasonably priced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I  was previously using oil of olay which is also a good product, but for me this eye serum worked better for bagges under the eyes.</li>
            <li> After the famous \\&quot;trial on one side of your face\\&quot; and feeling good about the difference, I was offered a package deal of products for about $ 399.00  to begin, and then after telling them we do like the products , but the price is too high, they suddenly dropped the price to $199.00 and even threw in a \\&quot;free\\&quot; bottle of face cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Both of those ingredients  actually do lift the skin, even skin town and reduce fine lines and are effective anti-aging products.</li>
            <li> Great, just like all the other womens&#x27; reviews, I&#x27;ve been ripped off.</li>
            <li> Luckily for me I can afford it.  </li>
            <li> A very pushy kiosk sales person approached me claiming my face makeup wasn&#x27;t good nor natural.</li>
            <li> The serums I mentioned on Amazon have those two ingredients at the best possible price and it is only my skin care product addiction that caused me to buy the Gratiae serum just to</li>
            <li> I took the time to write this review because I suspected fraud and sleazy business tactics and could not let that stand.entioned on Amazon have those two ingredients at the best possible price and it is only my skin care product addiction that caused me to buy the Gratiae serum just to</li>
            <li> Item was received quickly and packaged well.  </li>
            <li> But it won&#x27;t provide any long term benefits &amp; isn&#x27;t good for continuous use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, avoid the super hot Israeli guys at the Vegas mall kiosks!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> In reality, none of the extra items were free and I knew that, however, she made it seem like I was getting such a great deal and</li>
            <li> I paid 500 for the serum and the cream, what&#x27;s all the whining, it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> A nice guy followed me to my car, took all the boxes I had and headed back to his store.  </li>
            <li> As for the Gratiae website and the prices there -- it makes me laugh.</li>
            <li> By the time I was done, I had purchased over 500 worth.</li>
            <li> Wait another minute after eye cream has absorbed into skin before applying concealer.  </li>
            <li> If it were miraculous these products would be worth the hundreds of dollars that the Kiosk people charge.  </li>
            <li> but they were nice enough to give my daughter a tube of skin cream worth about 15us...</li>
            <li> It is well worth buying.  </li>
            <li> And most importantly, it did not deliver the same results.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> the sales guy thinks I&#x27;m worth the deal</li>
            <li> The eye serum is very rich and soft around the eyes.</li>
            <li> It is the exact same product, and I do love it, but don&#x27;t be swindled by these crooks!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product that treats &amp; diminishes lines &amp; wrinkles leaving under eye skin soft, smooth &amp; wrinkle free!</li>
            <li> good if you used with other Gratiae products</li>
            <li> I was so excited about the much lower price points, but soon came to learn the price to pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To that I say, in a day in age of smart phones and free wireless everywhere if you can&#x27;t take 5 minutes to do a quick internet search to see if the price is reasonable</li>
            <li> I am so upset right now.  </li>
            <li> THEM DISAPPEAR RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES</li>
            <li> Obviously everything in Vegas is crazily marked up and Amazon has an amazing price!</li>
            <li> I was very worried but this product came and when I tried it, it felt soooo silky smooth exactly what the seller said it would do.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this in Vegas, I am so glad amazon offers it at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Great product for very little cost.</li>
            <li> Very little is needed and the results are great.</li>
            <li> but if the puffiness under my eyes continues to decrease I would say it is worth the higher price.  </li>
            <li> High pressure sales and ingredients like dimethicone are highly suspect  and not the way a reputable company does business.</li>
            <li> High pressure sales and ingredients like dimethicone are highly suspect  and not the way a reputable company does business.</li>
            <li> Well, when something looks too good to be true it usually is, and this case is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin and the moisturizing/hydrating effect lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work very fast.</li>
            <li> I was leaving a San Diego mall right at closing one night, and got handed a sample by an attractive young lady, who got me to sit down</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product in Miracle Mile in Vegas, salesman on the kiosk was pushy and rude, I agreed to purchase some product and furnished credit card details, he then proceeded to try and push more product which would have cost over £1000.I threatened to call security and he backed down, however this said the product is exceptional , it is a great pity that Gratiae adopts this style of selling, I recently visited Malta, and in Valetta found a store which approached the whole procedure differently ,I was happy to spend £300.</li>
            <li> First mistake.</li>
            <li> you will find that their first listed ingredients (which means they are the majority ingredients) have neuro- and endocrine toxicity.</li>
            <li> and I think one of the reasons is consistent use of this product.</li>
            <li> they have very agressive sales people, they say they are from Israel !</li>
            <li> recently ordered the product (Oro Instant Firming Serum) that made my sister squeal in Vegas, I will review it - honestly - after I give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;Until then -- save your money!</li>
            <li> It really works and people comment how I look great and usually ask what creams I am using.</li>
            <li> I first was introduce to this product in Las Vegas in the mall.  </li>
            <li> I actually fell in love with all the products.</li>
            <li> and I really do love the products, however, I will buy from Amazon in the future.  </li>
            <li> The actual salesperson I spoke with admit that he had told me that, but was so sure that I would love the products that he tried to make a deal with me that if I used it for 2 weeks and brought it back, he would refund me.</li>
            <li> I also noted that there are virtually no reviews by reputable beauty reviewers such as Allure magazine editors.</li>
            <li> me say FIRST: These ingredients are NOT TOXIC and have been approved by the U.S. FDA (a governmental agency) for use in beauty products.</li>
            <li> The Ultimate Swiss has a more watery texture and soaks in and contours and lifts.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought something like this on the internet.  </li>
            <li> I think I have got allergy to the product that was the first time I ever had the allergy to any cosmetics or skin care products.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> The first one I purchased from a Mall store for a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I first saw the eye cream when I was in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> They should make sure how they package it next time.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day the Gatiae side looked a tiny bit better</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t even get it off with hot water and soap...</li>
            <li> I had the same experience as most of the commentators.</li>
            <li> And since they only did one eye, and the effects lasted overnight, I was able to compare.</li>
            <li> First things first: This eye serum is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> even though I paid way too much, I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> problem is the pretty bottle  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not spending that kind of money\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product in Las Vegas 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> So I now have 2  bottles on top of the one I am presently using.</li>
            <li> I am amazed, and hear it works even better with the eye cream, which I hope to purchase next.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m a guy at age 50.</li>
            <li> I hope this works, because during my demo at the store, the product feels natural and comfortable on my skin, and I did see an immediate difference.</li>
            <li> The price was substantially higher in Las Vegas, so there must be a reason.  </li>
            <li> This is the same product I got sucked into buying for way more $$ at the shipping mall at Caesar&#x27;s in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> Honestly, because if my results in less than a week of use, I would recommend the full line at full price to anyone with problem sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> to be honest I had some doubts to buy it, because my skin around the eyes is really very sensitive, but finally I decided</li>
            <li> This is the most effective eye cream I have used, it firms the skin around the eye and definitely reduces appearance of dark circles.</li>
            <li> My eyes are so soft and completely wrinkle free, the skin is full and you cant see my pores on my cheeks anymore</li>
            <li> Been using this product for two years, wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind</li>
            <li> We were convinced by a very nice jewish girl that this was only sold in high end salons.</li>
            <li> I appreciated it very much.</li>
            <li> I am putting it on my eye wrinkles and small scars on my face, and it is amazing at how quickly they are disappearing.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s pretty much your fault for wasting your money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> when my husband saw me after I used it the first time (not knowing what I had done), he said \\&quot;you look really good\\</li>
            <li> A monkey could have done a better job.</li>
            <li> Everywhere I went in Vegas, they were there, same pitch same young attractive people from Israel.</li>
            <li> The company isn&#x27;t practicing good business so not sure if I will buy from them again, but if I do, I will buy through amazon.</li>
            <li> What high quality product is sold in Las Vegas at kiosks with super high pressure sales people?</li>
            <li> What high quality product is sold in Las Vegas at kiosks with super high pressure sales people?</li>
            <li> \\&quot;the buffer is made out of pure diamonds and silk and your nail will stay like this for 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I like the product and certainly think this is the way to purchase it versus at retail outlets.</li>
            <li> and she certainly wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;losing</li>
            <li> I do not have \\&quot;wrinkles\\&quot; but am starting to get fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> It actually does diminish the look of the fine wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I just started using Gratiae lifting serum after buying it from Amazon and thought it was a decent product at first</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year and recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> I love even more the fact that the price has gone down!!!!</li>
            <li> It really makes the skin around the eye area smooth and younger looking.</li>
            <li> I purchased the eye cream and the mask at Mission Viejo California, for a huge price of over $500.00 which now I know that is even bigger ripe off</li>
            <li> and it really seems to make my skin glow.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product in Las Vegas from a mall huckster and paid way too much.</li>
            <li> I told them I need to check online the real price and reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a gentle cooling effect around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I did really think about buying product but thank goodness</li>
            <li> The salesmen are very pushy and get very hateful when you do not buy....  </li>
            <li> This product by Gratiae makes the skin around my eyes very moist.</li>
            <li> It feels like velvet, is so gentle but really works.</li>
            <li> and my eyes are very swollen and itchy.  </li>
            <li> and you really see the difference.</li>
            <li> This eye serum really works and when I massage it into my crow&#x27;s feet, they almost disappear.  </li>
            <li> I thought it might not be the real thing</li>
            <li> Works really well under make up...</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product and the shipment was as expected.  </li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> Very neutral feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> It took a couple months but was hassle free and now I have their product and my money back.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I can really notice a diffrence with this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Very dissappointing.</li>
            <li> It really does work around the eye lines.</li>
            <li> This bottle lasted me a whole year..</li>
            <li> I was in a rush at the mall, but there was a girl holding a bunch of free soap samples standing outside asking passerbys if they would like one.</li>
            <li> ( I really was) and had to go home.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really pay attention to it and just kept on walking and talking to my partner.</li>
            <li> She began talking (high !)</li>
            <li> I found it on Amazon MUCH cheaper and was hoping it would help my puffy bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in the eye area.</li>
            <li> This makes me think that the whole company is a scam.  </li>
            <li> I would not find myself without it and highly recommend anyone try it and see for themselves!</li>
            <li> I will purchase more of the same products and more different ones by the same manufacturer....but from AMAZON.com</li>
            <li> I have find this product to work very well.  </li>
            <li> forward to this product.&lt;br /&gt;After my mall experience, I googled the product and was ecstatic to find it so much cheaper here.</li>
            <li> In almost every review that I have read about Gratiae serum products, everyone seems compelled to mention how much cheaper they are on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The serum goes on really nice,but it does absolutely nothing for the puffiness.</li>
            <li> I will never pay that much again</li>
            <li> It goes on greasy feeling but absorbs and keeps your eyes very hydrated</li>
            <li> This is a manufacturer issue and not so much Amazon, but still.</li>
            <li> It was very pricey.  </li>
            <li> prices and said that I should buy at least the two products she just applied on me because they would do so much good.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of other brands of skin care you find at high-end department stores and have not been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product, along with the eye cream, from a kiosk in White Plains.  </li>
            <li> I could not believe that it was only a fraction of the original price.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned in many of the other reviews, I also purchased this product from a kiosk at an upscale mall, where they offered the &amp;#34;deal of the century&amp;#34; for 3 products.  </li>
            <li> was excited to try this and the eye cream - the two products I tried in the store.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not the same.</li>
            <li> The top doesn&#x27;t sit well on the bottle due to the manner in which it was packaged.</li>
            <li> Still use it for the long lines and get compliments on how young I look :)</li>
            <li> thank God I was strong enough to refuse all their offers and checked on internet.</li>
            <li> I use it on the fine skin around my eyes and it makes my skin feel velvety instead of dry.</li>
            <li> Skin under my eye looked different for the whole day after I tried serum under my right eye.</li>
            <li> In just a few weeks all the fine lines around my eyes were gone!</li>
            <li> I was highly pressured by a sales girl named Nikki, in the hotel Paris in Las Vegas.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I did not like the extremely high price at the store</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s a high Pressure sales, high margin, high cost gemic.</li>
            <li> For $300 I walked away with a great selection of scrub lotion and facial system (final price about same as would have paid for same products from amazon).</li>
            <li> The products are high end, and just what one would expect from a mall.</li>
            <li> Their prices are way too high compared to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I also found out about the product from the high pressure sales at the Miracle Mall in Las Vegas</li>
            <li> After a moment, of course that led to checking out products that are supposedly not available anywhere except the most high end stores.  </li>
            <li> It has a special feel of softness under the eyes to keep the facial tissue soft without drying out the skin.</li>
            <li> The salesperson was very pushy and charged me $300 for the eye serum and the eye cream and acted like she was throwing in the following for free; multi-use lotion, toner and facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I had been burned with some resin that my husband coats concrete floors with and</li>
            <li> Telling him how much better he would look after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Not everyone responds the same way to anything, but these are worth the try.</li>
            <li> Normally eye treatments take a while.</li>
            <li> Many have complained of paying a higher price for this product at the mall</li>
            <li> The products are so good that I ask myself, why do they keep on playing the deceitful game?</li>
            <li> Other ingredients like jojoba oil and a trace amount of retinol are fine</li>
            <li> Other ingredients like jojoba oil and a trace amount of retinol are fine</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t particularly feel like my 28 year old skin needs $170 worth of products to make look younger.</li>
            <li> Then I read many Amazon reviews by customers who said they&#x27;d first learned of the product via high pressure kiosk sales (never a good sign).</li>
            <li> and they told me there were no refunds even though all our products were still brand new and unopened.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item at an upscale mall in New York.</li>
            <li> I came back to the UK with numerous skin care aids and all are fantastic</li>
            <li> I am convinced that this stuff is a sham, I believe someone decided they could substitute dimethicone (cheap) for hyaluronic acid which is the real thing.</li>
            <li> I am convinced that this stuff is a sham, I believe someone decided they could substitute dimethicone (cheap) for hyaluronic acid which is the real thing.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t allow your skin to breathe and instead layer it with a thin layer of plastic that will dry out your skin and in my opinion also prevent any good ingredients from being absorbed into your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am truly obsessed with this product and as long as you can acquire it for a good price on the internet or somehow from a mall kiosk than it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I believe Gratiae&#x27;s plan all along was to have a website with super expensive prices that make it seem like the product is high grade and high quality while then making most of their sales at prices like Amazon charges</li>
            <li> I believe Gratiae&#x27;s plan all along was to have a website with super expensive prices that make it seem like the product is high grade and high quality while then making most of their sales at prices like Amazon charges</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> Very much like the replenishing facial serum.  </li>
            <li> He was young, polite and friendly, full of tactics, so much that I didn&#x27;t know whether it was scary or funny.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I was strong and not let them rip me off.</li>
            <li> That explains the low price - as this definitely seems to be an original product.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the exact same stuff that is in the Gratiae Lifting Face serum.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s going some on a 63 year old woman!  </li>
            <li> I am not usually a person to complain on line, but I do not want this happen to anyone else.</li>
            <li> No product works exactly the same on everybody, but let me tell you if you follow Gratiae instructions</li>
            <li> This is the exact same product Gratiae sell but a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> What a big surprise to find the exact items on Amazon for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I find this produce to be on irritating,  it  absorbs quickly, and  works beautifully on fine lines around the eye</li>
            <li> I paid outrageous prices for this and several other Gratiae products, but the good part of this is that I learned about these wonderful products.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit tightly, so leaks.</li>
            <li> The area around my eye is tighter and the fine lines became softer after a few dabs.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy a product from a vendor that I am certain of its authenticity , especially for a product thats applied so close to the eye.</li>
            <li> At nearly 70 years I don&#x27;t suppose anything can really make a big difference</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go near them.  </li>
            <li> I am  a 53 year old business woman, and all I can say is that I wish I had these sales people in my business.  </li>
            <li> Over the next few days I Googled what I had bought and realized I paid too much, but they gave me soooo much free</li>
            <li> Oh much cheaper than what those kiosks in the malls sell the same product for.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 times so far and plan on buying again.</li>
            <li> FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This serum is very moisture but at the same time your face absorbe it inmediatelly</li>
            <li> But on a packaging point-of-view, the bottle was open as the lid doesn&#x27;t really close.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this product has never burned or irritated me.  </li>
            <li> I looked up the ingredients and told the guy there was almost nothing organic or natural about the serum.</li>
            <li> I was grabbed by a young woman at the hotel I was staying at.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow.</li>
            <li> directly contacted the mall management</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain as far as the delivery.  </li>
            <li> While I am annoyed that the company resorts to duping customers into overpaying for the product, i definitely think it is worth the amazon price and more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using it on other areas on my face where I&#x27;m noticing fine wrinkles, like above my lip.</li>
            <li> Later I realized that my right eye is not as puffy as the left one.</li>
            <li> I do not believe it does much in the long run, but short term, you can absolutely see the difference.</li>
            <li> the more I read the ridiculous claims on the company website</li>
            <li> the more I read the ridiculous claims on the company website</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend, and especially so at this price!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t harass me but definitely gave the high pressured sales pitch, and the discounted price (two products for $199 vs or).</li>
            <li> It was very convincing but too expensive.</li>
            <li> Feels smooth and one of the VERY FEW items I can use around my eye area without it burning my eyes or skin if I apply immediately after using facewash on my face or an exfoliant.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s too many other eye products for less.</li>
            <li> makes the skin under the eye very soft, can lead to puffyness left on over night</li>
            <li> I have been using the same bottle twice/day for 5 months and it is still half full.</li>
            <li> You use so little of it at a time - it lasts forever and therefore extremely economical.</li>
            <li> I will not buy it again as long as the prices are this high.</li>
            <li> but it is not and absorbs into your skin leaving the delicate tissue of your eyes feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> The product works, I don&#x27;t regret the absurd amount I initially spent, but am thrilled to find it at a reasonable price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the company itself supplies Amazon with the product to sell for a low price since it can&#x27;t be moving at $400 per product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dark circles lightened quite a bit after first use.</li>
            <li> Shouldn&#x27;t a reputable company stand behind their products?&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li> like many of the other reviewers complained, you can get the products for near a 10th the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My rosatia is clearing and the redness is now only pink and smooth and my dark circles (I work nights)</li>
            <li> Yes, they are very pushy and sometimes rude, however, the products themselves seem to be very high quality.</li>
            <li> I could do more to stop this kind of evil in the world~~~~~</li>
            <li> My wife uses this daily, she too spent to much at a kiosk until she found it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to use it in the morning, I suggest giving yourself time before applying makeup as the product takes a few extra minutes to be absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> Feels a little oily when you first apply.  </li>
            <li> This product really keeps dark circles and puffiness under control.</li>
            <li> It did help my husband&#x27;s really dark circles,they really bothered him.</li>
            <li> My story is the same as some other reviewers as I paid too much money on an impulse purchase that I was told was organic.</li>
            <li> So, really I paid $150 for the serum, then $150 for cream when you break it down, and I was still ripped off for both.</li>
            <li> I used this in the past (when I foolishly paid the ridiculous mall price!) and loved it.</li>
            <li> so unless something equally good and less expensive comes along, I will probably continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I then found exactly the same products online for a total of less than half this price.  </li>
            <li> Again, other reviewers may not have much experience in other skin regimes -- I&#x27;m an addict.</li>
            <li> I had there david, moses and sergey, not sure it&#x27;s their real names</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first two ingredients are basically dimethicone and another silicon common in hair smoothing products.</li>
            <li> He had guaranteed the products and promised a full refund if I was not happy.</li>
            <li> But this product seemed to be watered down, or just old?</li>
            <li> But the bottom line is, hyaluronic acid is something that exists naturally in our skin and is what gives our skin elasticity and as we age our skin has less of it.</li>
            <li> Now, my skin is extremely dry so everyone might not get the same effect.  </li>
            <li> We worry so much about illegal aliens from Mexico coming into our country, but what about the legal status of these people.</li>
            <li> what a clever little way to get people into the store!</li>
            <li> She told me to \\&quot;zip it\\&quot;, because no one else would ever get such a deal!&lt;br /&gt;I am sick because we do not have the kind of income to be taken advantage of like this.  </li>
            <li> I am sure they have had plenty mad people come back in and complain.  </li>
            <li> The next day, I went online and saw similar reviews to this one, and purchased all 3 products on Amazon for less than $100 total.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless other products and this is the only one that gives me immediate results.</li>
            <li> I have amazon app on my iphone, I wish I have checked right there , at least I would have tried returning the body products, but wait !</li>
            <li> I am 39 yr old with minimal wrinkling or sun damage but very sensitive, rosatia prone skin and a nurse who constantly uses harsh soaps and alcohol gels destroying my hands.</li>
            <li> but you really had to look hard.</li>
            <li> I paid way too much in a store, but at least I learned about this product.</li>
            <li> Why are people posting negative comments because they got ripped off and paid too much at a mall for this product?</li>
            <li> I just realised that I have spent 150 dollars on a gratie body product that cost only 11...</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS SERUM FOR QUITE A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> But once I got home and used as directed, 3 months and $375 later- absolutely no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> and I will use it as long as I can.</li>
            <li> put her fingers up as if to shush me\\&quot; as long as you pass the word to people\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s a middle aged woman to do?</li>
            <li> So as long as I can buy it at affordable prices, I won&#x27;t be changing.</li>
            <li> It has lasted me that long</li>
            <li> The product is very silky and soaks in slowly.  </li>
            <li> She chased me down the mall and lured me back into her store, taking a picture of me and acting as though she was sending my picture to her boss.  </li>
            <li> I really like this and use quite a few other products in this line!</li>
            <li> For 7 days, I used this on one eye and my current product on my other eye, twice a day.</li>
            <li> also try their other products in the future.</li>
            <li> But when I read the other reviews here at Amazon for the same product at $23, my heart sank.  </li>
            <li> I have exceptionally dry skin and all their products</li>
            <li> but does work at keeping wrinkles and dry lines away..</li>
            <li> I have problems with extremely dry areas around my nose since using these products my face just glows.</li>
            <li> Of course the product hydrated my skin when in the dry desert air and smokey hotel air of Vegas.</li>
            <li> This product has cured my dry skin patch under my eye.  </li>
            <li> The areas around my eyes are severely dry and often peel.</li>
            <li> This company uses high pressure sales tactics and dishonest marketing.  </li>
            <li> They have high pressure sales tactics and dishonest marketing strategies.</li>
            <li> stuff won&#x27;t harm you if you buy a single bottle or just use it ocasionally as a makeup primer as that&#x27;s what they all are made of, but it&#x27;s a temporary fix.</li>
            <li> I realised that something was wrong, the funny thing was that the salesman took an Ipad and showed me the same product on amazon for 300 dollars the cream and 300 the serum, all with 5 stars reviews.</li>
            <li> but you can find the same products on Amazon for considerably less.</li>
            <li> When I went to return the items the manager pointed me to a small sign on the OPPOSITE side of the kiosk (they had positioned me at the other side for the entire length of the purchase) and gave me a guilt trip that they could not resell the items because of the nature of the product (total bs, all other cosmetics companies will take returned products).</li>
            <li> But I think I would have bought the products if they had been cheaper and especially if the sales talk had been less agressive...</li>
            <li> It hides my black circles and makes my skin smoother with a younger look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48, I look much younger other than eye area due to insomnia.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed over the couple of years I&#x27;ve been using it that it has kept that delicate skin very soft and silky feeling.  </li>
            <li> The person that used this will see a difference and if you stop using it you feel the eye area very dry.</li>
            <li> I actually had little cuts in my eye lids and could not wear any makeup for over a week.  </li>
            <li> I feel bad for anyone who paid $350 for this, but again, just call the mall management, hopefully they will be able to help.</li>
            <li> They try to promote a product that does wonders at a great value, honestly, worst face line I&#x27;ve EVER tried!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected its like putting lube under you&#x27;re eyes</li>
            <li> Received in only a few days and have been using product as recommended.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> The plaza is letting these scam artist steal from the people who could have spent their money at their hotel</li>
            <li> Only a few ingredients are certified organic.  </li>
            <li> The sellers insist that Dr. Oz loves the products, but there is absolutely no evidence of this on the web.  </li>
            <li> The same thing happened with the thermal mask, which was in much worse condition, almost like a cement paste that is completely unusable.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way like half a pump at a time seems to be enough.  </li>
            <li> I was pitched for a big discount bringing down a PAIR of $350 priced products down to $400.</li>
            <li> Not really certain if it was this product, the cream or the combo that was beneficial.</li>
            <li> Certainly not at the liberal amount she applied...</li>
            <li> At first I was frustrated with Ultimate Swiss&#x27;s small bottle (which is $13 on Amazon rather than $85) but it actually does last 3 weeks if you just use what is needed  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so one bottle lasts.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But at 35 I actually have very little wrinkles yet</li>
            <li> you would think it would feel or stay greasy due to the texture?  </li>
            <li> As other posters said, yes they rip you off in places like Mall of America, or the pushy vendors in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> Instead of giving me samples, she started applying eye serum and an other product on side</li>
            <li> These other reviews are rambling rather than reviewing if product works.</li>
            <li> As for the product, I haven&#x27;t used it, other than my demonstration at the mall.  </li>
            <li> Other ingredients include cetearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, chemical fragrance, bht, retinyl acetate</li>
            <li> All the listed ingredients are cheap and absolutely nothing in it justifies the outrageous prices on the Gratiae website.</li>
            <li> All the listed ingredients are cheap and absolutely nothing in it justifies the outrageous prices on the Gratiae website.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was stuck with two over priced and half empty bottle of products that did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I decided to goggle it and was shocked to find out how cheap it was on Amazon</li>
            <li> , the lifting eye serum is fab, only complaint is the packaging, the bottles leak , please Gratiae take note of customer comment.</li>
            <li> It truly decreases the wrinkles, puffiness and dark circles around your eyes.  </li>
            <li> It has helped with bags and dark circles under my eyes and minimized some of the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother using the products, I left and immediately filed a complaint with my credit card company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and my dark circles around my eyes are fading weekly.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother getting this, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I did feel like I noticed a difference, but when he quoted me $175 each for the eye serum and the lifting serum, I told him that was too expensive, and that I would need to do research before laying out that much money for a product I had never heard of.</li>
            <li> We got a sample of this in a Washington shopping center a few months ago.</li>
            <li> It helps keep me from looking tired, which can make a person look old.</li>
            <li> The facial serum feels unusually thick and gooey when it came, even though I couldn&#x27;t tell whether it had been pre-opened or not.</li>
            <li> Snap them up, but be prepared to be on the hunt for another like-kind product down the road.</li>
            <li> And they don&#x27;t need to shove their product down your throat.</li>
            <li> And they don&#x27;t need to shove their product down your throat.</li>
            <li> Once I pinned him down on price we got to dealing.</li>
            <li> An guy named Igor in the Paris Hotel area pulled me aside and offered samples, and then asked me to sit down and try these products.</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews that gave it a bad rating due to the fact that they were gullible enough to buy it in kiosk and were angry that they couldn&#x27;t return it and buy it cheaper.</li>
            <li> I paid $100 for the eye serum which I was told was half price\\&quot; just for today\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> now I can get it some MUCH LESS here on amazon.  </li>
            <li> you is half price of the internet&amp;#34; and tried to show me some website.</li>
            <li> it has responded to products by Lo&#x27;occitaine that are half the cost.</li>
            <li> I was shown on their computer system the price on their website which is about 25us less than what she told me</li>
            <li> I myself was duped by one of them and paid $75 for my bottle (because I paid $100 for a scrub, thats also less than 1/2 price on Amazon)</li>
            <li> Both items for less than $70.</li>
            <li> Here is the odd thing.</li>
            <li> and he applied the product on half face.</li>
            <li> I mentionned one of the ingredients in particular and he said absolutely unashamed</li>
            <li> I feel that this eye serum made a change in my appearance in less than two weeks -- no miracle change, just a softness and a little less definition in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Not cool to lie to customers.</li>
            <li> and apparently the return policy is a scam as the company does not stand behind their products.</li>
            <li> I am sick to my stomach right now!  </li>
            <li> I was chocked and told them, first I am not rich and even if I was, do I look so desperate?</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;m a little generous with the amount i use and area</li>
            <li> and then I started to feel a little bit suspicious.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a solution to the bags and a little bit of darkness under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I went back a few times and even talked to a very rude man on the phone who claimed to be the manager of the kiosk.</li>
            <li> I can see a difference in my face if I don&#x27;t use it for a few days.</li>
            <li> used this for one month but does nothing for puffy eyes, i even bought the repelnishing eye cream but its been waste of money</li>
            <li> I made an impulse purchase after the salesperson had me trapped</li>
            <li> , it was far too expensive</li>
            <li> Yesterday I narrowly escaped one of the dreaded mall salespeople.</li>
            <li> The website for Gratiae is a sham.  </li>
            <li> The only reservation I have is that it is so much less expensive on Amazon and the product leaked from the cap making me think about the authenticity of the product.</li>
            <li> Bad - I ordered six items from this same seller, and they came in vastly different conditions.</li>
            <li> When I went by the booth a couple of days later, a girl was pushing samples, and I told her that I had ordered from Amazon, and she said that is too bad because it is not the same product.</li>
            <li> I do like the way it makes my eyes feel, not only do they not look as tired or dark circles, they don&#x27;t feel as tired.</li>
            <li> The only ultra expensive skin care product I have purchased and would buy if I could afford it is Creme de la Mer.</li>
            <li> The only ultra expensive skin care product I have purchased and would buy if I could afford it is Creme de la Mer.</li>
            <li> so researched it on AMAZON and saw the shockingly unbelievable price and ordered immediately.</li>
            <li> , of course, I&#x27;m not sure what to do.</li>
            <li> I felt a bit guilty about taking her time, and finally relented and reluctantly handed my credit card</li>
            <li> I was sick to see the prices on Amazon soooo much lower.</li>
            <li> The Gratiae product line is no better or worse than any other skin care line.</li>
            <li> To make it even worse, the mask was leaking and half gone already</li>
            <li> It was a hard lesson learned.</li>
            <li> and I find that the chicken neck and age wrinkles have actually improved.  </li>
            <li> At least not for me, my sister or</li>
            <li> he&#x27;d never heard of it, but that he guaranteed no one ever complained about allergies.</li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t like to be forced into anything</li>
            <li> I MEAN--</li>
            <li> At the very least, people from Mexico come here to work at any job to feed their families, I&#x27;m not sure about these people that say they are from Israel, just here to scam tourists?</li>
            <li> however I wasn&#x27;t stupid enough to fall for it and instead went home and did my research and found it on Amazon.com for 6 times less.</li>
            <li> Seriously they should be politicians or something.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked and thought maybe I had just misunderstood, then I read the reviews and found out several</li>
            <li> STAY AWAY from this company and do not support dishonest vendors like Gratiae!</li>
            <li> Then they started talking in hebrew which I found very rude as I don&#x27;t speak the language.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with the products as I am allergic to them, I have only used the products three days</li>
            <li> He became very rude, and was showing me a so-called website with the prices posted.</li>
            <li> removes little lines like crazy and a fraction of the price of the website price</li>
            <li> I noticed it was running low, and did not want to spend a stupid amount of money on a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I left without buying, feeling stupid and humiliated.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and a terrible disappointment to use apply two products under my eyes for several weeks (time consuming and inconvenient) only to see no results.</li>
            <li> and I was tired and just wanted to leave.</li>
            <li> It worked wonders on my friends tired looking eyes.</li>
            <li> They are worse in morning.</li>
            <li> horrible..if you ask me the people who let them in the plaza hotel should refund my money and take their crap product back!</li>
            <li> They told me how tired I looked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He gave me a look like I was the most pathetic idiot on the face of the earth, and shoo&#x27;d</li>
            <li> Very disturbing as to how little integrity this seller has to its customers!</li>
            <li> After a week I had a very bad skin reaction, swollen and red and itchy.  </li>
            <li> and I can hardly believe my skin!!</li>
            <li> She said the price for the eye serum was $350.00.Got very angry and rude when I walked out.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, like a lot of other reviews, I was cornered at the Palazzo in Las Vegas and did purchase 5 items for $400!!!!!!</li>
            <li> But I assure you was soooo damn difficult.</li>
            <li> I am so disgusted that these people are ripping off customers with such impunity, cant we do something?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was the wrong product...</li>
            <li> This is not wonderful.</li>
            <li> Because of this weird behaviour I decided to find customers reviews.</li>
            <li> When I went online to buy it, I found it to be too expensive.  </li>
            <li> I tried Grataie in the mall and told them I have do my research before buying any product THAT EXPENSIVE that DOES NOT have a return policy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to buying really expensive beauty products, so I said $100 max.</li>
            <li> Another failed attempt to reduce bags and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> For those who paid such horrific prices, buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Try it, you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> I had tried this in Vegas but, was way to expensive.</li>
            <li> This product is clearly fake but the salespeople at the mall are also scam artists.</li>
            <li> They were fuming and I literally started to be afraid of them, as you could sense that their aggresivity was growing.</li>
            <li> They looked at me crazy, the girl was telling everyone to do what I say.  </li>
            <li> I am afraid to use them because of the way they are sold (not by Amazon).  </li>
            <li> I got samples of the eye cream but am afraid to use it,can&#x27;t trust the product or the company.</li>
            <li> I started to walk away, and the guy got angry and started shouting things at me!</li>
            <li> The sales person tried to convince me to buy this for a very expensive price.</li>
            <li> but they are rude and insulting if you don&#x27;t stop to listen to their pitch.</li>
            <li> my ripped off was not as bad as im reading.</li>
            <li> And yes, the experience was just as bad as everyone else here.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> My bad.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase this product really bad.</li>
            <li> it was ugly.  </li>
            <li> My friend and I went in and I was shocked and amazed as what the product did.  </li>
            <li> Sick, sick, sick over this!!!Wish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am VERY UNHAPPY with the products I purchased.  </li>
            <li> Stupidly did that.</li>
            <li> Very bad experience but</li>
            <li> Very unhappy customer!</li>
            <li> The customer service is the worst I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> A very unhappy customer!!!</li>
            <li> The prices on Gratiae Organics website are outrageous (as they were in Vegas).  </li>
            <li> I think that is the worst eye serum I have ever tried, because the skin under my eye swelled and started itching after 10 minutes of applying the serum.</li>
            <li> when she handed me the soap, she looked at my nails, which were in terrible shape.</li>
            <li> I also was subjected to the outrageous sales tactics at kiosks in Las Vegas, in the Paris Hotel and the Caesars Palace Forum Shops.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not what I expected its like putting lube under you&#x27;re eyes doesn&#x27;t help anything been using it since I got it</li>
            <li> I originally started using this for around the eyes but started spreading it over my face as I like the feel of it and it really seems to make my skin glow.  I use this instead of a moisturizer and I now use it over my neck and chest and I find that the chicken neck and age wrinkles have actually improved.  No one believes I am 61!</li>
            <li> I bought this product in Las Vegas from a mall huckster and paid way too much. When I started using it, I realized I loved it. I use it on the fine skin around my eyes and it makes my skin feel velvety instead of dry. There is no perfume smell to irritate your eyes. I&#x27;ve started using it on other areas on my face where I&#x27;m noticing fine wrinkles, like above my lip. I have no wrinkles around my eyes and I am over 60, and I think this serum has something to do with that. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 years. The Amazon price is the cheapest I have found.</li>
            <li> This product is the best, I already notice a difference on my dark circles and lines under my eyes. I will order this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  An excellent product.</li>
            <li> good if you used with other Gratiae products</li>
            <li> Works well on wrinkles. I can see a difference in my face if I don&#x27;t use it for a few days.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I love even more the fact that the price has gone down!!!! I will definitely order again!  The last bottle I bought was about $27.00, I have bought it as low as $17.00 on Amazon. I love this product, but it m not going to pay $90.00 for the eye serum. There&#x27;s too many other eye products for less. It&#x27;s good, but now way over priced. I will not buy it again as long as the prices are this high. Clinique makes an eye serum just as good,</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without this product made for mature skin and absolutely the best eye serum I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it</li>
            <li> This Gratia product is my favorite. Slides on like water and fully hydrates. You use so little of it at a time - it lasts forever and therefore extremely economical.</li>
            <li> The company that makes this product is no longer in business. I have exceptionally dry skin and all their products have served me well over the years. Was delighted to find them on Amazon and they are now on clearance. Snap them up, but be prepared to be on the hunt for another like-kind product down the road.</li>
            <li> Bought this product while on vacation. Did not look in the box to see the condition of product. When I got home and looked most of the serum had leaked out but you couldn&#x27;t tell from the box. Bought it from kiosk in mall. First mistake. Emailed and called company in Georgia. Was told to return the bottle and they would sent another out. Stupidly did that. Never saw the replacement bottle. Emailed the company in Israel. Finally got messages from someone in Georgia, who asked me to call her so we could work this out. She is either on vacation or out of the office. The customer service is the worst I have ever seen. If this product works as I was told, it is probably great, but I&#x27;ll never know. Make sure if you do buy, you do from someone with very good customer service. The parent company has NONE.</li>
            <li> Great product, visible difference. However expiration date was only six months after delivery date. That explains the low price - as this definitely seems to be an original product.</li>
            <li> I was SOOOOO close to get fooled in centre London by them. When I was just about to pay £200 for 5 products +  facial (after fearceful negociations that last 1h and 30mins) I told them I need to check online the real price and reviews. They were fuming and I literally started to be afraid of them, as you could sense that their aggresivity was growing. Long story short, I was strong and not let them rip me off. I told them is against my philosophy of life to just spend like that a big amount of money for something I know nothing about. They told me they have never met a person like me (?) and the owner of the store started moaning that she lost her baby sleeping time because of me (??). I told her if she is in a rush she can go, I don t mind. She said she is not, she was just making conversation (?!) Then they started talking in hebrew which I found very rude as I don&#x27;t speak the language. Very bad experience but thank God I was strong enough to refuse all their offers and checked on internet. But I assure you was soooo damn difficult.</li>
            <li> We got a sample of this in a Washington shopping center a few months ago. It was working so well for my wife, that we bought two bottles on Amazon.com. It&#x27;s got a gentle cooling effect around the eyes. It&#x27;s a very refreshing feeling. She will keep using it.</li>
            <li> This brands products truly deliver on what they say. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> If you google their ingredients at the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetic Database (based out of DC. It&#x27;s ewg.org) you will find that their first listed ingredients (which means they are the majority ingredients) have neuro- and endocrine toxicity. For example: \\&quot;Suspected to be an environmental toxin and be persistent or bioaccumulative.\\&quot; The database also lists the PubMed studies and provides a link to all the research you can investigate yourself.  They basically threw industrial silicones into vitamin oils and pretty-packaged it. My daughter came home from the mall with three products after spending $750. She was railroaded. They give you a story that Celine Dion uses these products (they mail them to her, they say). I wonder if Celine Dion knows they are using her name. I think they&#x27;re crooks. Their products are bogus. And the glowing reviews are probably the vendor&#x27;s friends. Don&#x27;t go near them.  I am writing this so mothers can warn their daughters, and friends can tell friends.  EDIT: Vinyldimethicone Crosspolymer is a plastic. There is NOTHING organic about it.</li>
            <li> Just returned home from Las Vegas.  Was shown this product in Mircle Mile Mall in Las Vegas.  The product seemed to work wonderful....  They do half of your face, and I could see a difference and it felt wonderful.  They wanted 149.00 for a bottle of eye serum.  I did really think about buying product but thank goodness I waited to do my research when I got home.  When I googled the name I saw that Amazon carried the same product for $21.99.  I was shocked and thought maybe I had just misunderstood, then I read the reviews and found out several have had the same experience.  I can not believe this company can get away with treating their customers like this.  The salesmen are very pushy and get very hateful when you do not buy....  So thankful I stood my ground!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the product at my hotel in Vegas and was super impressed with the results. It worked wonders on the area under my eye and the saleslady even put it on my laugh lines around my mouth and you couldn&#x27;t even see the lines anymore! I was so impressed I was almost willing to pay the $170 they were charging there but knew I had to check around online first. Obviously everything in Vegas is crazily marked up and Amazon has an amazing price! I read so many reviews that gave it a bad rating due to the fact that they were gullible enough to buy it in kiosk and were angry that they couldn&#x27;t return it and buy it cheaper. To that I say, in a day in age of smart phones and free wireless everywhere if you can&#x27;t take 5 minutes to do a quick internet search to see if the price is reasonable then it&#x27;s pretty much your fault for wasting your money.&lt;br /&gt;They product though is awesome!</li>
            <li> This product by Gratiae makes the skin around my eyes very moist.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product in Miracle Mile in Vegas, salesman on the kiosk was pushy and rude, I agreed to purchase some product and furnished credit card details, he then proceeded to try and push more product which would have cost over £1000.I threatened to call security and he backed down, however this said the product is exceptional , it is a great pity that Gratiae adopts this style of selling, I recently visited Malta, and in Valetta found a store which approached the whole procedure differently ,I was happy to spend £300. I came back to the UK with numerous skin care aids and all are fantastic, the lifting eye serum is fab, only complaint is the packaging, the bottles leak , please Gratiae take note of customer comment.</li>
            <li> I first bought his item in Las Vegas and loved it, then ran out, found it on amazon and a happy camper again</li>
            <li> This is the most effective eye cream I have used, it firms the skin around the eye and definitely reduces appearance of dark circles. I have been using the same bottle twice/day for 5 months and it is still half full. It feels like velvet, is so gentle but really works. You need to follow the instructions and rub it in to get the circulation going under the eye, this is the key to improving the tone of the skin around your eye. It is worth every cent!</li>
            <li> I purchased a variety of products including eye serum, cream, etc. for $375!  I then found exactly the same products online for a total of less than half this price.  I called customer service and they told me there were no refunds even though all our products were still brand new and unopened.  They asked me to send an email with the details of what happened and I did.  Of course, they did not even respond.  The only phone number I can find for the outlet location in Las Vegas where I purchased has been disconnected.  This company uses high pressure sales tactics and dishonest marketing.  STAY AWAY from this company and do not support dishonest vendors like Gratiae!</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THE PRODUCTS FROM A SALESMAN IN THE GADREN STATE PLAZA PARAMUS NJ THEY DIDN&#x27;T WORK ON MY SKIN THE GUY WHO SOLD TO ME NAMED AVI WROTE 100%REFUND HAD ME GOING IN 3 TIMES TO GET Y MONEY BACK NEVER GAVE ME MY FULL REFUND AND KEPT THE PRODUCTS STAY AWAY FROM THIS GUY!!! SCAMM ARTIST!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I paid 500 for the serum and the cream, what&#x27;s all the whining, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The original price is 700(!)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a unique eye treatment. If you use it you know...&lt;br /&gt;Besides, when I buy cosmetics I go to the company&#x27;s web site, I won&#x27;t buy it from an unofficial distributor.&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s me.</li>
            <li> Been using since I bought at Vegas three years ago - of course I get it here now!  Wouldnt go to bed without putting this product under  and around my eyes.  I am 57 and no crows feet yet and I think one of the reasons is consistent use of this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item at an upscale mall in New York. They made me a \\&quot;deal\\&quot; for the eye serum plus cream for $200. I did love the immediate results and am impressed as I have used the product for about a week. I was sick to see the prices on Amazon soooo much lower. Shame on me for making an impulse buy. Lesson learned. I will continue to use the product but I will make my next purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the Gratiae Replenishing Eye Cream and Replenishing Eye Serum in the Brea Mall.  I am very unhappy with the products as I am allergic to them, I have only used the products three days and my eyes are very swollen and itchy.  I have attempted to contact my salesperson and well as the Gratiae Corporation to no avail.  A very unhappy customer!!!</li>
            <li> Love it - will be ordering more items - thank you! It works great. I have used this product two months. Thanks again for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> GRATiAE is a wonderful product line. I love using the products every day knowing it is organic and makes me feel great. I have used their products for a year now and highly recommend their line to anyone who likes to pamper your skin and feel good about how you look. I have noticed an improvement in the hydration under and around my eyes. When you put it on it feels like it will be greasy but it is not and absorbs into your skin leaving the delicate tissue of your eyes feeling smooth and silky. I have tried lots of other brands of skin care you find at high-end department stores and have not been pleased with the results. GRATiAE is my go to from now on. I am very happy with the fact I found it here on Amazon! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I love the eye serum.Its in a catagory of its own.My daughter loves it too. I will never want to run out of it . I was pulled into a store on streets of Vega by Israili people selling Gratiae-My daughter &amp; I were talked into purchasing $585 of product. Even so I am glad to have found it &amp; so happy Amazon has it avaailable @ a fraction of cost with Free shiping yet.</li>
            <li> This is a really good eye serum. I have been using it about 5 months and have never had better results and I am 67. I paid way too much in a store, but at least I learned about this product. The cost on Amazon is excellent!</li>
            <li> This is a total rip off!!!  I was highly pressured by a sales girl named Nikki, in the hotel Paris in Las Vegas.  She chased me down the mall and lured me back into her store, taking a picture of me and acting as though she was sending my picture to her boss.  She wanted him to see the difference in my appearance after she applied the product to one side of my face.  Then with his approval I walked out of the store spending $450.00 plus.  She told me to \\&quot;zip it\\&quot;, because no one else would ever get such a deal!&lt;br /&gt;I am sick because we do not have the kind of income to be taken advantage of like this.  I only wish there was a way to picket in front of there shop in the malls in Las Vegas, so others will not be taken advantage of like I was.  Sick, sick, sick over this!!!Wish I could do more to stop this kind of evil in the world~~~~~</li>
            <li> I am  a 53 year old business woman, and all I can say is that I wish I had these sales people in my business.  It is a great product.  I am not a push over, but they got me at the Mall of America rushing to make it to a meeting and I was there for 3 hours. I walked out 7K, yes 7K, poorer.  Luckily for me I can afford it.  Over the next few days I Googled what I had bought and realized I paid too much, but they gave me soooo much free I think it is OK.  Here is the kicker.  I am sure they have had plenty mad people come back in and complain.  It is interesting that they sell in tourist areas where people leave.  However, I returned 5 days later with all my packages in hand, ran in and confronted the girl who sold me everything.  I thought she was going to have a heart attack when I flew in the store with all these boxes.  All I said is&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I am in a big hurry and have to catch a plane.  Please have all these things shipped to me\\&quot;.  Then I said \\&quot;and by the way I have some things in my car that also need to be shipped and I do not have time to go to the UPS store so can you make sure you ship them for me?\\&quot;  They looked at me crazy, the girl was telling everyone to do what I say.  A nice guy followed me to my car, took all the boxes I had and headed back to his store.  I received everything in perfect order.  I knew I had been taken for the price, and I realized I fell for the sell tactics like I have never ever before.  I thought it amazing how good they were. Seriously they should be politicians or something.  How I see it is never spend more than you are willing to lose.  You are in Vegas??  It is all a gamble.  Last year in Vegas my friend bought a sofa for 7K and when I saw it at her house it was ugly.  I am glad i spent it on good product.  So now I am going to organize all the stuff I got and be faithful on how I use it. Then I will get back to you!</li>
            <li> I just realised that I have spent 150 dollars on a gratie body product that cost only 11... oh my god !&#x60;I have just returned from Fair Oaks mall in Fairfax Virginia, the store name is Premier Store, I think opened since one month or two... they have very agressive sales people, they say they are from Israel ! I had there david, moses and sergey, not sure it&#x27;s their real names, anyway they sold me a body product then insisted that I get the eye products and that I will get a range of free products if purchased, they asked me my credit card without giving me the amount beforehand and when I asked they said it&#x27;s 500 dollars ! I was chocked and told them, first I am not rich and even if I was, do I look so desperate? I realised that something was wrong, the funny thing was that the salesman took an Ipad and showed me the same product on amazon for 300 dollars the cream and 300 the serum, all with 5 stars reviews. I have amazon app on my iphone, I wish I have checked right there , at least I would have tried returning the body products, but wait ! they dont accept return lolll I am so disgusted that these people are ripping off customers with such impunity, cant we do something? can we complain to the police? I am sure that they know there is no risk for them... I definitly have to research this</li>
            <li> I bought this at my sister&#x27;s recommendation after she had a salesperson show her this in Vegas. Unfortunately, it was the wrong product...the product she loved in Vegas was Oro (see that product for reviews), which visibly gives you a life instantly. The Gratiae product line is no better or worse than any other skin care line. It does not diminish wrinkles. At least not for me, my sister or my boss.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer, but so are the Olay products.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy these again. As for the Gratiae website and the prices there -- it makes me laugh. I&#x27;m amazed at what people will buy to look younger -- me included.&lt;br /&gt;This just does not do what it claims. Again, other reviewers may not have much experience in other skin regimes -- I&#x27;m an addict. I&#x27;ll try anything that someone tells me is wonderful. This is not wonderful. It&#x27;s ordinary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have recently ordered the product (Oro Instant Firming Serum) that made my sister squeal in Vegas, I will review it - honestly - after I give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;Until then -- save your money!</li>
            <li> Great product but, I too, got ripped off in the Calgary, Canada airport.  The salesgirls are really good, they do one eye and you really see the difference. I paid $100 for the eye serum which I was told was half price\\&quot; just for today\\&quot;. I now buy at Amazon for under $30.00.  I love the product and it works very well and is all organic. Do not buy these products in any kiosk anywhere.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using Gratiae products they always work well and are made with ingredience that I feel good about using .</li>
            <li> This eye serum really works and when I massage it into my crow&#x27;s feet, they almost disappear.  I do not ever wish to be without it.</li>
            <li> Eye serum from Gratiae it is the best I have ever used! It really works and people comment how I look great and usually ask what creams I am using.</li>
            <li> Have used this for many years, it&#x27;s fabulous for under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I feel that this eye serum made a change in my appearance in less than two weeks -- no miracle change, just a softness and a little less definition in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d order in less than a week, awesome. But this product seemed to be watered down, or just old?</li>
            <li> I first was introduce to this product in Las Vegas in the mall.  NO WAY was I going to pay $200.00 for an eye serum.  I was though very impressed with the results.  I searched on line and found this item on amazon and scoop up and bought it.  I LOVE this SERUM.  It truly decreases the wrinkles, puffiness and dark circles around your eyes.  I won&#x27;t be without this product now I can get it some MUCH LESS here on amazon.  Thank you again amazon!!</li>
            <li> I am sick to my stomach right now!  I paid $350 for the eye serum and replenishing eye cream at the Forum Shops at Ceasar&#x27;s Palace yesterday for what I could have bought on Amazon for $50!  I am so upset right now.  I do have to say I do think it works well though.  I did notice an immediate difference and when my husband saw me after I used it the first time (not knowing what I had done), he said \\&quot;you look really good\\&quot;.  But I&#x27;m so upset right now!!  Warn everyone you know going to Vegas who likes to shop- do not buy from the kiosks in Vegas!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products, and this is the best, in my opinion.  My skin has improved since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Meets expectation......have recommended to friends. Received in only a few days and have been using product as recommended. Very happy with results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye serum for about six months. A little goes a long way, so one bottle lasts. It has helped with bags and dark circles under my eyes and minimized some of the wrinkles. It helps keep me from looking tired, which can make a person look old. I really like this and use quite a few other products in this line!</li>
            <li> Great product for very little cost.</li>
            <li> I was shopping at a local mall in Alpharetta GA one day. A very pushy kiosk sales person approached me claiming my face makeup wasn&#x27;t good nor natural. I agreed to sit and allow him to cleanse my face with his Gratiae products, then apply a mineral based makeup. I actually fell in love with all the products. By the time I was done, I had purchased over 500 worth. Now ladies, I do love the products and have seen a difference in my  lines around my eyes...but you can find the same products on Amazon for considerably less. I went ahead and ordered the products, hoping they are truly the same as what I just bought.I read many reviews from people saying they are concerned purchasing these products from another source might not be smart as they might be bogus...please let me know if you&#x27;ve experienced this.</li>
            <li> Oh much cheaper than what those kiosks in the malls sell the same product for. They will RIP YOU OFF!!!</li>
            <li> I bought the eye serum and eye cream in Vegas and I really do love the products, however, I will buy from Amazon in the future.  The salesperson was very pushy and charged me $300 for the eye serum and the eye cream and acted like she was throwing in the following for free; multi-use lotion, toner and facial cleanser.  In reality, none of the extra items were free and I knew that, however, she made it seem like I was getting such a great deal and the products make your skin look and feel great.  The prices on Gratiae Organics website are outrageous (as they were in Vegas).  The company isn&#x27;t practicing good business so not sure if I will buy from them again, but if I do, I will buy through amazon.</li>
            <li> Best eye serum ever.  Non irritating/does not cause puffiness.  Feels a little oily when you first apply.  Let product sink into skin before applying the eye cream.  Wait another minute after eye cream has absorbed into skin before applying concealer.  Purchase on Amazon.com for a fraction of the retail price.  All certified organic ingredients .... LOVE IT!!!  You will see immediate results and people will notice.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product, along with the eye cream, from a kiosk in White Plains.  I really liked it, and even contemplated going in to buy more when it was gone, but luckily checked Amazon first!  I could not believe that it was only a fraction of the original price.  I thought it might not be the real thing so I saved my original packaging to make sure it was....it is definitely the same product!!  While I am annoyed that the company resorts to duping customers into overpaying for the product, i definitely think it is worth the amazon price and more.  I ended up buying a lot more gratiae products and have been very happy with them.</li>
            <li> This works great... I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 as it doesn&#x27;t seem to hydrate your skin that well... but does work at keeping wrinkles and dry lines away.. .maybe it is and you just can&#x27;t feel it?  Works really well under make up... you would think it would feel or stay greasy due to the texture?  But your skin just absorbs it up.  Feels smooth and one of the VERY FEW items I can use around my eye area without it burning my eyes or skin if I apply immediately after using facewash on my face or an exfoliant.  I also use the Gratiae Facial Lifting Serum for just the rest of my face and eye area if I am out of the Eye Serum.</li>
            <li> Love this serum.  In just a few weeks all the fine lines around my eyes were gone!</li>
            <li> This has got to be the exact same stuff that is in the Gratiae Lifting Face serum. They smell the same, feel the same and look the same. Since I happen to like the face serum, I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> used this for one month but does nothing for puffy eyes, i even bought the repelnishing eye cream but its been waste of money</li>
            <li> As mentioned in many of the other reviews, I also purchased this product from a kiosk at an upscale mall, where they offered the &amp;#34;deal of the century&amp;#34; for 3 products.  I participated in a trial of the product and noticed a difference, so I made the purchase.  I noticed it was running low, and did not want to spend a stupid amount of money on a replacement.  I thought I would check online  and, to my surprise, I found it on Amazon for a fraction of the price.  The product works, I don&#x27;t regret the absurd amount I initially spent, but am thrilled to find it at a reasonable price on Amazon.  The product is very silky and soaks in slowly.  It makes a difference:  the lines are finer, and the puffiness is reduced.  I have a lot of allergies to beauty products, and have not had an issue with this product, especially on my eyes.  I can highly recommend, and especially so at this price!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and have paid much more for the product.  I am pleased with the product and the shipment was as expected.  The eye serum is very rich and soft around the eyes.</li>
            <li> This is a great product when used with the eye cream.  I am sensitive to a lot of product but this one (with the eye cream) is great.  I Love them both and am very happy with the service, price etc.</li>
            <li> I, too, was originally sucked in at a kiosk in a mall.  I paid outrageous prices for this and several other Gratiae products, but the good part of this is that I learned about these wonderful products.  I spent close to $1000 on their products and although the price made me shudder, the product made me happy.  So imagine my joy when I found I could get this line far more cheaply on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not someone who believes in &amp;#34;miracles&amp;#34; when it comes to any product.  If it were miraculous these products would be worth the hundreds of dollars that the Kiosk people charge.  Let&#x27;s face it, they&#x27;d be worth even more than that.  But I have been very satisfied with this serum.  I&#x27;ve noticed over the couple of years I&#x27;ve been using it that it has kept that delicate skin very soft and silky feeling.  That&#x27;s going some on a 63 year old woman!  I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ve noticed it reducing puffiness, but then maybe I&#x27;d have much puffier eyes without it!  I use it every evening after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put just a drop or two on the back of my hand and then rub it in all around my eye.  The residual on my hand has actually softened *that* area, as well!</li>
            <li> SMOOTH:  It&#x27;s goes so smoothly on my skin around my eyes.  I will not do without it from now on.</li>
            <li> I love Gratiae&#x27;s products! been using them for the last year and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. they&#x27;re amazing, everything smells great and feels great. and soooo good for your skin. worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have used it twice and I&#x27;m very happy with the result.</li>
            <li> I love this and it really works. I have bought 3 times so far and plan on buying again. Great price for this item.</li>
            <li> Stay away from this product. I ordered it and 3 of the bottles had leaked and spilled in the packaging. A monkey could have done a better job.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product, I loved it.  I couldn&#x27;t continue with it because of cost.  If the cost remains affordable, It will be part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the first time at a salon and paid 3X more over a year ago.  I was so glad to find out it was on Amazon.  This container should last a year. It is great at reducing the look of fine lines around your eyes.  Use it before the Gratiae Replenishing Eye Cream.</li>
            <li> As I wrote for the face serum, this is a wonderfully hydrating serum, but that&#x27;s about it. Anyone who pays any more than 20. for this....well.....forgive my candor, is a fool! It does not lift, it does not get rid of crepiness. It holds moisture, and that&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;Those unscrupulous vendors at malls across america are selling you snake oil so they can earn commission and they will lie to make money!</li>
            <li> What a nice eye serum.  Makes your eye area  face feel so smooth.  Make up goes on so well after application!</li>
            <li> eyes have not changed.  when put on at night i have an irritation in my eyes which results in a sand in the corners in am.</li>
            <li> Very neutral feeling on your skin. No burning. I have been using in corners of mouth to with the Replenishing eye cream</li>
            <li> PLEASE ARGUE WITH YOUR CREDIT CARD COMPANY! Next step: FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this helps someone else. I made an impulse purchase after the salesperson had me trapped and I was tired and just wanted to leave. He had guaranteed the products and promised a full refund if I was not happy. I took it home and immediately knew I needed to return it, it was far too expensive and I don&#x27;t particularly feel like my 28 year old skin needs $170 worth of products to make look younger. When I went to return the items the manager pointed me to a small sign on the OPPOSITE side of the kiosk (they had positioned me at the other side for the entire length of the purchase) and gave me a guilt trip that they could not resell the items because of the nature of the product (total bs, all other cosmetics companies will take returned products). The actual salesperson I spoke with admit that he had told me that, but was so sure that I would love the products that he tried to make a deal with me that if I used it for 2 weeks and brought it back, he would refund me. I didn&#x27;t bother using the products, I left and immediately filed a complaint with my credit card company. It took a couple months but was hassle free and now I have their product and my money back.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products for my eyes and after using this for one week I already saw results. It goes on silky smooth and love how it feels. Thank you for a product that finally works!</li>
            <li> Great product tons of value.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> I love this eye serum! It&#x27;s so &#x27;silky&#x27; and stays where its put. I have very sensitive eyes and this product does not irritate them at all.</li>
            <li> I used this in the past (when I foolishly paid the ridiculous mall price!) and loved it. It really makes the skin around the eye area smooth and younger looking. Glad it&#x27;s at a reasonable price here.</li>
            <li> I use this and the face serum I like both products and use them daily.. I have problems with extremely dry areas around my nose since using these products my face just glows.</li>
            <li> This serum is very moisture but at the same time your face absorbe it inmediatelly i will try to keep it always with us</li>
            <li> Love the product and so do my eyes, you need to also use some eye cream too.</li>
            <li> The sales person tried to convince me to buy this for a very expensive price. Because of the posts here I escaped from this SCAM - I realized later they told me so many lies like &amp;#34;I have a coupon that it&#x27;s only for employees I can give it to you as we&#x27;re closing for today&amp;#34;, later on she said &amp;#34;the price I am offering you is half price of the internet&amp;#34; and tried to show me some website. Because of this weird behaviour I decided to find customers reviews. I can&#x27;t believe that on nows days people use this kind of sales approach.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS SERUM FOR QUITE A LONG TIME AND IT HAS SERVED IT&#x27;S PURPOSE</li>
            <li> Always does a fabulous job on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am 50, look 35 and have used everything under the sun on my skin. This product is hands down the best I have ever used. I have been using it for a year and I can hardly believe my skin!!</li>
            <li> You see instant results and great price.  I first bought this in Vegas, I am so glad amazon offers it at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a kios in Las Vegas with a girlfriend. Actually, we both bought some.  We couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It has been one of the best investments either one of us have made in a long time.  Simply amazing.</li>
            <li> I just started using Gratiae lifting serum after buying it from Amazon and thought it was a decent product at first but the consistency reminded me of something else I&#x27;d used but couldn&#x27;t put my finger on it. Then I read many Amazon reviews by customers who said they&#x27;d first learned of the product via high pressure kiosk sales (never a good sign). I also looked at Gratiae&#x27;s website and pricing which includes a warning not to buy their products elsewhere as \\&quot;fakes\\&quot; could damage your skin. I also noted that there are virtually no reviews by reputable beauty reviewers such as Allure magazine editors. And THEN I looked at the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two ingredients are basically dimethicone and another silicon common in hair smoothing products. THAT&#x27;S why it felt familiar.  I&#x27;ve used that on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say FIRST: These ingredients are NOT TOXIC and have been approved by the U.S. FDA (a governmental agency) for use in beauty products. There is no truth to the fact that the U.S. govt says these ingredients are toxic. HOWEVER I think you&#x27;ll find most skin care people do not recommend them. They are basically plastics. They don&#x27;t allow your skin to breathe and instead layer it with a thin layer of plastic that will dry out your skin and in my opinion also prevent any good ingredients from being absorbed into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is OK as a makeup primer in the daytime. I might even say it&#x27;s \\&quot;good\\&quot; as a makeup primer except for the fact that it is preventing your skin from breathing. Any benefit you get immediately is great, but don&#x27;t expect any long-term benefits. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the company itself supplies Amazon with the product to sell for a low price since it can&#x27;t be moving at $400 per product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These days most hairdressers advise clients not to use dimethicone because it dries out your hair (from not breathing). And you can&#x27;t use it with extensions because it dissolves the bonds. I&#x27;ve had to look for alternatives to dimethicone (or any of the \\&quot;icone\\&quot; products) and all the hair products that don&#x27;t have it are much more expensive. Because silicon and plastic is CHEAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff won&#x27;t harm you if you buy a single bottle or just use it ocasionally as a makeup primer as that&#x27;s what they all are made of, but it&#x27;s a temporary fix. A layer of plastic on your face may even protect skin from the elements or smog temporarily. But it won&#x27;t provide any long term benefits &amp; isn&#x27;t good for continuous use.  If you want to use it during the day, whatever you do, DON&#x27;T put this product on your face at night when your skin needs to breathe to regenerate itself. It will not help and will prevent your skin from the healing that happens when we sleep. There are a couple hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C serums Amazon sells that actually do lift and reverse aging that do work, including Ultimate Swiss Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Vitamin C Serum and Oz Naturals. Both of those ingredients  actually do lift the skin, even skin town and reduce fine lines and are effective anti-aging products. The Ultimate Swiss has a more watery texture and soaks in and contours and lifts. Oz Naturals has a more creamy feel like this product but without silicon. At first I was frustrated with Ultimate Swiss&#x27;s small bottle (which is $13 on Amazon rather than $85) but it actually does last 3 weeks if you just use what is needed  (I sometimes like to slather it on.) (Oz Naturals has a larger bottle for $25 and I like that product too.). But the bottom line is, hyaluronic acid is something that exists naturally in our skin and is what gives our skin elasticity and as we age our skin has less of it. Researchers for skin care companies discovered this and found that hyaluronic acid does work both as a filler injected by dermatologists and also when applied topically. HA is great for lines and lifting and vitamin C is great for skin texture and tone. Combining these two is smart and a great combination. The serums I mentioned on Amazon have those two ingredients at the best possible price and it is only my skin care product addiction that caused me to buy the Gratiae serum just to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more I look at the ingredients and the more I read the ridiculous claims on the company website the more I am convinced that this stuff is a sham, I believe someone decided they could substitute dimethicone (cheap) for hyaluronic acid which is the real thing. Other ingredients like jojoba oil and a trace amount of retinol are fine but I doubt they can even penetrate the skin when they are used with dimethicone. All the listed ingredients are cheap and absolutely nothing in it justifies the outrageous prices on the Gratiae website. I believe Gratiae&#x27;s plan all along was to have a website with super expensive prices that make it seem like the product is high grade and high quality while then making most of their sales at prices like Amazon charges so you keep buying it because you think you are getting a deal. What high quality product is sold in Las Vegas at kiosks with super high pressure sales people? The only ultra expensive skin care product I have purchased and would buy if I could afford it is Creme de la Mer. And they don&#x27;t need to shove their product down your throat. It sells itself. High pressure sales and ingredients like dimethicone are highly suspect  and not the way a reputable company does business. Just my opinion  I won&#x27;t buy it again that&#x27;s for sure.  I took the time to write this review because I suspected fraud and sleazy business tactics and could not let that stand.entioned on Amazon have those two ingredients at the best possible price and it is only my skin care product addiction that caused me to buy the Gratiae serum just to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more I look at the ingredients and the more I read the ridiculous claims on the company website the more I am convinced that this stuff is a sham, I believe someone decided they could substitute dimethicone (cheap) for hyaluronic acid which is the real thing.

            <li> It nothing exceptional. I guess it is working. I am still using it.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than retail and works great.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this eye serum in Vegas and saw results immediately.  When I went online to buy it, I found it to be too expensive.  Then I found it on Amazon for 1/2 the price and have been using it ever since.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a year.  I was very happy to see you were selling the item and at that price.</li>
            <li> I purchased the eye cream and the mask at Mission Viejo California, for a huge price of over $500.00 which now I know that is even bigger ripe off than I thought since I can purchase same product at amazon for $23.00.  To make it even worse, the mask was leaking and half gone already, I took it back to return, I was told they didn&#x27;t accept returns, now for this price you would think the customer service would be a bit better. I went back a few times and even talked to a very rude man on the phone who claimed to be the manager of the kiosk. He said he&#x27;ll look into it. That time the sales person took my receipt and did not return it.   Needless to say, I was stuck with two over priced and half empty bottle of products that did absolutely nothing for me. I am not usually a person to complain on line, but I do not want this happen to anyone else. people before you purchase this product do your research.</li>
            <li> Loved the eye serum. Fast delivery. Would highly recommend. I can really notice a diffrence with this product. Goes on smooth and make your skin feel like silk</li>
            <li> Love this product. Have used this for several years</li>
            <li> I tend to have allergy eyes. This product really keeps dark circles and puffiness under control. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> great item.. i&#x27;ve ordered these items several times now. for myself and sister and neice also. they all love them.</li>
            <li> I was in Oahu, Hawaii and tried it on in the store.  Only applied to one eye and the difference in the two eyes was shockingly wonderful!  I could not believe it.  I did not like the extremely high price at the store so researched it on AMAZON and saw the shockingly unbelievable price and ordered immediately. I will continue to purchase this product from AMAZON forever!</li>
            <li> The Good - This eye serum works, and if it comes to you in pristine condition, then you have nothing to worry about! I&#x27;ve used Gratiae products for over two years now and only recently discovered that Amazon carries them. I was so excited about the much lower price points, but soon came to learn the price to pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad - I ordered six items from this same seller, and they came in vastly different conditions. One tub of eye cream came in perfect condition, while the other was already opened and used, with contents oozing out over the aluminium foil that is supposed to air-seal its contents. The same thing happened with the thermal mask, which was in much worse condition, almost like a cement paste that is completely unusable. The facial serum feels unusually thick and gooey when it came, even though I couldn&#x27;t tell whether it had been pre-opened or not. Very disturbing as to how little integrity this seller has to its customers!</li>
            <li> Very much like the replenishing facial serum.  Good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  This is the first time I bought something like this on the internet.  I was very worried but this product came and when I tried it, it felt soooo silky smooth exactly what the seller said it would do.  Thanks for the fast delivery.  I appreciated it very much.</li>
            <li> Very dissappointing. I purchased the eye serum and eye cream to be used in tandem in a mall in Las Vegas. Of course the product hydrated my skin when in the dry desert air and smokey hotel air of Vegas. But once I got home and used as directed, 3 months and $375 later- absolutely no noticeable difference. I&#x27;m 36, so it&#x27;s not like the skin around my eyes can&#x27;t be helped and it has responded to products by Lo&#x27;occitaine that are half the cost. I believe it&#x27;s a high Pressure sales, high margin, high cost gemic. Target products uh as Aveeno delivers better results for the cost of the tax alone that was paid on the Gratiae products.</li>
            <li> Non oily good for dry skin excellent product,have used it for three years I am seventy eight.</li>
            <li> Item was received quickly and packaged well.  Item is a velvety moisture serum for under eyes.  It feels wonderful.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and am pleased with the serum&#x27;s perfomance.</li>
            <li> I cannot give a feedback on the quality of the product as i just received it. But on a packaging point-of-view, the bottle was open as the lid doesn&#x27;t really close. and a part of the serum has spilled...</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this is cheap gelatin based stuff. Just like the rest of the line. They try to promote a product that does wonders at a great value, honestly, worst face line I&#x27;ve EVER tried! Save your money!!!</li>
            <li> Love this serum.  It really does work around the eye lines.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Gratiae Replenishing eye cream and eye serum from the Mall of America -Minnesota at Ya &amp; Ya Beauty on the 3rd floor across from Sears.  I am VERY UNHAPPY with the products I purchased.  After a week I had a very bad skin reaction, swollen and red and itchy.  I tried to return, and they told me I need to try a different line of products.....  I actually had little cuts in my eye lids and could not wear any makeup for over a week.  They have high pressure sales tactics and dishonest marketing strategies. They also do not tell you that once you walk out the door that they do not do refunds.  -- AT ALL. EVEN ON UNOPENED PRODUCTS -- EVEN IF IT IS AN HOUR LATER OR EVEN IF YOU HAVE A ADVERSE REACTION TO THEIR PRODUCT.  Shouldn&#x27;t a reputable company stand behind their products?&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this company.  ANYTHING from Ya &amp; Ya Beauty.  I will not step foot in this store or kiosk. Very unhappy customer!</li>
            <li> I find this produce to be on irritating,  it  absorbs quickly, and  works beautifully on fine lines around the eye This bottle lasted me a whole year..</li>
            <li> I recently visited dolphin mall and was approached by gratiae staff...my ripped off was not as bad as im reading.I was shown on their computer system the price on their website which is about 25us less than what she told me I would be paying...she offered me two for d price of one....now checking online and I&#x27;m realizing that I actually purchased each item..but they were nice enough to give my daughter a tube of skin cream worth about 15us...but I honestly like the product and I will use it as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I tried this product two days ago at the mall kiosk. I think that is the worst eye serum I have ever tried, because the skin under my eye swelled and started itching after 10 minutes of applying the serum. I think I have got allergy to the product that was the first time I ever had the allergy to any cosmetics or skin care products. Skin under my eye looked different for the whole day after I tried serum under my right eye. I would recommend trying it out or get some sample before buying.</li>
            <li> I tried Grataie in the mall and told them I have do my research before buying any product THAT EXPENSIVE that DOES NOT have a return policy.  I was told this product was on Dr. Oz. I checked the Dr Oz website and there is no record of this product ever being on that show.  That was all I needed to know to never buy this product. Not cool to lie to customers.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely a 5 star product. As other posters said, yes they rip you off in places like Mall of America, or the pushy vendors in Las Vegas. I myself was duped by one of them and paid $75 for my bottle (because I paid $100 for a scrub, thats also less than 1/2 price on Amazon) But lets face it, this product is worth $75!!! Instead of being upset that I paid too much in Vegas, I&#x27;m THRILLED I found it cheaper, this product honestly removes wrinkles before your eyes, and keeps the fine lines away ALL DAY!!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and my dark circles around my eyes are fading weekly.&lt;br /&gt;Best face product I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> I was in a rush at the mall, but there was a girl holding a bunch of free soap samples standing outside asking passerbys if they would like one. she asked me which one I liked better (she had 2 kinds), I picked one and she said \\&quot;ok, come inside to the store and I will wrap it in a tissue for you\\&quot;. what a clever little way to get people into the store! I had no problems with that - I love beauty products and the store looked lovely. when she handed me the soap, she looked at my nails, which were in terrible shape. she buffed my nails with this rectangle thing, leaving my nails looking shiny, wet and beautiful. \\&quot;the buffer is made out of pure diamonds and silk and your nail will stay like this for 2-3 weeks. I told her I was in a rush ( I really was) and had to go home. 2 days later, my nail was not shiny anymore. I really liked the scent of the soap so I looked online to see if I could buy it. then I saw the prices on the website, as well as on Amazon and on Ebay. like many of the other reviewers complained, you can get the products for near a 10th the price on Amazon. and apparently the return policy is a scam as the company does not stand behind their products. so my question is, would you support a company like this, even if their products are good? I wouldn&#x27;t. there are so many great products out there. I dislike being scammed. their product is not terrible, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1</li>
            <li> I am going to use this product until i&#x27;m on my death bed.  My eyes are so soft and completely wrinkle free, the skin is full and you cant see my pores on my cheeks anymore (i&#x27;m a little generous with the amount i use and area i apply it to) I am truly obsessed with this product and as long as you can acquire it for a good price on the internet or somehow from a mall kiosk than it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> They were handing out samples at a kiosk in a Las Vegas mall. I didn&#x27;t really pay attention to it and just kept on walking and talking to my partner. One of their salesgirls called me back by asking where I was from and she also said I look amazing. I was startled by that and liked the compliment at that time. She asked if I was a model and then I started to feel a little bit suspicious. She said she was going to get me some free samples and dragged me along to the shop. Instead of giving me samples, she started applying eye serum and an other product on side (you know...) and she was asking questions about my make-up routine, products I use, adding a compliment or two. She began talking (high !) prices and said that I should buy at least the two products she just applied on me because they would do so much good. Then she asked what my budget was. I&#x27;m not used to buying really expensive beauty products, so I said $100 max. Suddenly she dropped the prices. Now, I don&#x27;t like to be forced into anything so I said I wanted to think about it and asked if maybe she could give me some samples so I could decide later. She said she didn&#x27;t have any ! And I also had to buy before closing time that day or the deal was off. I left without buying, feeling stupid and humiliated. However, I must say the products she used on me did actually do what they promised. I saw a difference comparing my two eyes (although my husband says I imagined it ;-) But at 35 I actually have very little wrinkles yet (I take good care of my skin using \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; products) and to be honest, they don&#x27;t bother me that much. But I think I would have bought the products if they had been cheaper and especially if the sales talk had been less agressive...</li>
            <li> My wife uses this daily, she too spent to much at a kiosk until she found it here on Amazon.  She loves it and I can see the difference around her eyes since she began using this.  She told me she can feel and see the difference.  It is well worth buying.  Just don&#x27;t get it at a kiosk.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful for bags and swollen eyes.I have used this product for over a year and recommend it very highly. I  was previously using oil of olay which is also a good product, but for me this eye serum worked better for bagges under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for two years, wouldn&#x27;t use any other kind</li>
            <li> The first one I purchased from a Mall store for a lot of money. But found it here and purchased 2 more for my mother and a for a friend. They both like it as well.&lt;br /&gt;My finding on me is that it works great on the lines around my mouth but makes my eyes puffy. Still use it for the long lines and get compliments on how young I look :)</li>
            <li> This product has cured my dry skin patch under my eye.  I had been burned with some resin that my husband coats concrete floors with and this was the only thing that cured my eye within days.  Like a miracle!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a solution to the bags and a little bit of darkness under my eyes.  After several weeks, I saw virtually no results.  I used it in conjunction with it&#x27;s companion eye cream. Waste of money and a terrible disappointment to use apply two products under my eyes for several weeks (time consuming and inconvenient) only to see no results.</li>
            <li> It is  a great serum and much cheaper than buying it from the mall.</li>
            <li> My wife really liked Gratiae Organics Replenishing Eye Serum because it met your expectations!Comfortable handling the package. Surely will buy again.</li>
            <li> I first saw the eye cream when I was in Las Vegas. It worked wonders on my friends tired looking eyes. I found it on Amazon MUCH cheaper and was hoping it would help my puffy bags under my eyes. They are worse in morning. It does reduce them quite a bit though does not make them totally go away. I have to say I am pretty happy with this product! Worth a try!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in the eye area. Another failed attempt to reduce bags and wrinkles. Save your money and don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> As with the facial serum: I tested it in a mall in Florida. It was very convincing but too expensive. I googled it and found it on amazon. The product is as expected so happy about my purchase.</li>
            <li> These Gratiae products are nicely packaged, smell nice, feel nice, and so on, but I feel like taking them to a lab for analysis.  I am afraid to use them because of the way they are sold (not by Amazon).  I also was subjected to the outrageous sales tactics at kiosks in Las Vegas, in the Paris Hotel and the Caesars Palace Forum Shops.  This makes me think that the whole company is a scam.  Their website says not to buy these products cheaply or you&#x27;re getting ripped off.  Who is getting ripped off, the person who pays $25 or the person who pays $250 for the same product, esp. when the salesperson claims that the product actually sells for $500 online, so you&#x27;re getting a great deal. Walk away and check online yourself before you deal with these liars.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce the morning lines</li>
            <li> We were convinced by a very nice jewish girl that this was only sold in high end salons. She showed us how much better we looked after using the eye cream. It did help my husband&#x27;s really dark circles,they really bothered him. Boy did she play up on that. Telling him how much better he would look after a few weeks.To make this short we were ripped of $430.00 in the Treasure Island Casino. Shame on me for falling for such a scam. After reading these reviews I&#x27;m sure complaining will get me no where. WHAT A LEASON...</li>
            <li> I purchased the salts and lotion from a mall here in Phoenix. I didn&#x27;t have to pay the exorbitant prices others have told about. I paid $28 for each. Like someone else said, this is a PRODUCT review, not a forum for complaints against the sales people. Yes, they are very pushy and sometimes rude, however, the products themselves seem to be very high quality. I notice a big difference on the days I use them compared to the days I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m 56 and have tried all kinds of products to keep my skin looking healthy, but these 2 products seem to work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. For those who paid such horrific prices, buy from Amazon. For those who have not tried them, I say give them a try. Not everyone responds the same way to anything, but these are worth the try.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but when I received it the package had leaked. I did not feel like sending it back. They should make sure how they package it next time. Karen Demarco</li>
            <li> I purchased the body scrub and cream from a store in Opry Mills Mall in Nashville TN. The salesman was insistent in his pitch and skated around the price for quite a while but he was also charming and fun. Once I pinned him down on price we got to dealing. For $300 I walked away with a great selection of scrub lotion and facial system (final price about same as would have paid for same products from amazon). I am 39 yr old with minimal wrinkling or sun damage but very sensitive, rosatia prone skin and a nurse who constantly uses harsh soaps and alcohol gels destroying my hands. After using these products for 5 days my cracked hands have healed and are in better shape than they have been in 20yrs. My rosatia is clearing and the redness is now only pink and smooth and my dark circles (I work nights) are gone. Honestly, because if my results in less than a week of use, I would recommend the full line at full price to anyone with problem sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My sister let me use hers while I traveled home and forgot to pack  my face creams. When I returned home I ordered my own supply.</li>
            <li> Ooh, I love this serum.  It keeps moisturizing throughout the day and works great with the replenishing eye cream.  Now, my skin is extremely dry so everyone might not get the same effect.  This reduces wrinkles throughout the day.  Eyeshadows go on smoothly.  Works much better than very pricey serums on the market.  Go for it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Business Lady</li>
            <li> I was passing by a Gratiae store and a lady stopped me to give a sample. Being polite, I accepted. That&#x27;s when it got a bit out of control. I could not leave literally!! she kept on showing me this and that, pulling me to the side. She then whispered, \\&quot;listen I&#x27;ll give you a deal, take this body scrub salt and I&#x27;ll give one to you for free through my account \\&quot;she put her fingers up as if to shush me\\&quot; as long as you pass the word to people\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought she was giving it for free, she had everything wrapped up and then charged me $100!! I am much too nice and polite and I should have walked away. I&#x27;ll use the product that I got, but her trick was sneaky</li>
            <li> Felt like an unnatural film just sitting on top of my face.  Don&#x27;t bother getting this, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I used this product in conjunction with the eye cream. Not really certain if it was this product, the cream or the combo that was beneficial. It appeared to work for me after just one application. The only reservation I have is that it is so much less expensive on Amazon and the product leaked from the cap making me think about the authenticity of the product. I will probably buy a product from a vendor that I am certain of its authenticity , especially for a product thats applied so close to the eye.</li>
            <li> Best eye serum by far that I have used in the last 20 years.  It is a great price and truly makes a clear difference on the diminishing of lines around my eyes.  I have extremely sensitive skin and this product has never burned or irritated me.  I would not find myself without it and highly recommend anyone try it and see for themselves!</li>
            <li> For 7 days, I used this on one eye and my current product on my other eye, twice a day. At the end of the day the Gatiae side looked a tiny bit better but you really had to look hard. It&#x27;s certainly nothing amazing.</li>
            <li> serrum is fine, packaging not</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing. I LOVE the texture and the way that it feels on my skin. I use it around my eyes and my lips.  I do not have \\&quot;wrinkles\\&quot; but am starting to get fine lines around my eyes, I can already see an improvement with this product, and I am a skin cream hoarder! I am so happy with this and I follow up with the eye cream. Try it, you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Simply the best eye serum, wonderfull.</li>
            <li> Bought from the plaza hotel in Las Vegas...they test it out and say it is a $250 eye cream and then make u a deal for $120...at home the product is crap..and the face peel turned to glue on my face...couldn&#x27;t even get it off with hot water and soap...horrible..if you ask me the people who let them in the plaza hotel should refund my money and take their crap product back! The plaza is letting these scam artist steal from the people who could have spent their money at their hotel</li>
            <li> This product was packed well but i can&#x27;t see the results yet</li>
            <li> Tried it before and then switched to something else.  Back to it now and will evaluate it soon.</li>
            <li> I got conned into buying the Renewing Peeling Gel, for 50 € (instead of 100 they said, 37 $ on amazon...). The price announced for the Eye Serum was 200 € ! In a luxury mall downtown Brussels. I remember saying to the salesman, &amp;#34;this is about 10 times as much as y current budget&amp;#34;. I had no idea how close I was to the truth. He was young, polite and friendly, full of tactics, so much that I didn&#x27;t know whether it was scary or funny. I looked up the ingredients and told the guy there was almost nothing organic or natural about the serum. I mentionned one of the ingredients in particular and he said absolutely unashamed he&#x27;d never heard of it, but that he guaranteed no one ever complained about allergies. The Eye Serum was so effective though (before/after effect in minutes) that I&#x27;m buying it on this page. The products are so good that I ask myself, why do they keep on playing the deceitful game? Well maybe it&#x27;s still a tactic.</li>
            <li> Just got back from Vegas(1st trip). I had the same experience as most of the commentators. These people are scam artists! I was grabbed by a young woman at the hotel I was staying at. Didn&#x27;t think it would hurt to listen to her but she just started putting stuff on my face even after I asked her not to. She wouldn&#x27;t let me leave and wouldn&#x27;t take no for an answer!Told me she was an executive with the company and that Dr. Oz has endorsed Gratiae.She said the price for the eye serum was $350.00.Got very angry and rude when I walked out. This product might work but I am concerned about the ingredients and the fact that it is produced in Israel. Also if it is such a great product, why do they have to grab people walking through a mall? Not only are they scam artists but they are rude and insulting if you don&#x27;t stop to listen to their pitch. Everywhere I went in Vegas, they were there, same pitch same young attractive people from Israel. We worry so much about illegal aliens from Mexico coming into our country, but what about the legal status of these people. At the very least, people from Mexico come here to work at any job to feed their families, I&#x27;m not sure about these people that say they are from Israel, just here to scam tourists? Why would some of the most beautiful hotels and resorts in the world, allow these crooks in their lobbies and malls? Gratiae must pay premium for these spots! I got samples of the eye cream but am afraid to use it,can&#x27;t trust the product or the company.Be warned!</li>
            <li> I had tried this in Vegas but, was way to expensive. Love Amazon&#x27;s price. After using the serum within 5 minutes I noticed a difference in the tiny lines. I am 49 and fortunate not to have many wrinkles so someone with more wrinkles or deeper ones might not notice a difference as quickly. The serum was just like the one in Vegas. I do like the way it makes my eyes feel, not only do they not look as tired or dark circles, they don&#x27;t feel as tired. Dark circles lightened quite a bit after first use. I highly recommend if you are looking for a great eye serum.</li>
            <li> While staying at the Luxor hotel, we were stopped by a saleswoman who made a wonderful compliment about my skin.  After a moment, of course that led to checking out products that are supposedly not available anywhere except the most high end stores.  After the famous \\&quot;trial on one side of your face\\&quot; and feeling good about the difference, I was offered a package deal of products for about $ 399.00  to begin, and then after telling them we do like the products , but the price is too high, they suddenly dropped the price to $199.00 and even threw in a \\&quot;free\\&quot; bottle of face cleanser.  I am pleased with the products, but no too happy with the high pressure tactics.  I will purchase more of the same products and more different ones by the same manufacturer....but from AMAZON.com</li>
            <li> I love the serum can see the-difference by my eyes. Will order again love it!!! Catherine&lt;br /&gt;Will also try their other products in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Eye Serum since May of 2013.  I have find this product to work very well.  It hides my black circles and makes my skin smoother with a younger look</li>
            <li> Wish my skin could handle this. I love it, it smells great, good ingredients, but I get bumps. Darn it!</li>
            <li> Yesterday I narrowly escaped one of the dreaded mall salespeople. And yes, the experience was just as bad as everyone else here.&lt;br /&gt;She didn&#x27;t harass me but definitely gave the high pressured sales pitch, and the discounted price (two products for $199 vs or). I don&#x27;t know where they find these people or if they somehow brainwash them but she was good.&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to this product.&lt;br /&gt;After my mall experience, I googled the product and was ecstatic to find it so much cheaper here. Well, when something looks too good to be true it usually is, and this case is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try this and the eye cream - the two products I tried in the store.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not the same. The box itself was shrunk wrapped but anyone can do that. The smell was different. And most importantly, it did not deliver the same results. Within minutes of using the product in the store I noticed a difference. And since they only did one eye, and the effects lasted overnight, I was able to compare. The eye treated with this product did not show any change. Normally eye treatments take a while. But, in the case of the serum and cream at the store, my results were noticeable within minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Now, of course, I&#x27;m not sure what to do. This product is clearly fake but the salespeople at the mall are also scam artists. What&#x27;s a middle aged woman to do?</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It does something magic to the skin around your eyes and helps the eye cream absorb into the skin giving a smoother appearance!</li>
            <li> THE BEST EVER PRODUCT MADE FOR FINE LINES AND WRINKLES - WATCH THEM DISAPPEAR RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES NOW ON MY SECOND BOTTLE AND AM LOVING THE RESULTS - RECEIVED THE PRODUCT IN THE TIME LINE THAT WAS QUOTED</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product that treats &amp; diminishes lines &amp; wrinkles leaving under eye skin soft, smooth &amp; wrinkle free!</li>
            <li> Gratiae sales hype-An guy named Igor in the Paris Hotel area pulled me aside and offered samples, and then asked me to sit down and try these products. I did feel like I noticed a difference, but when he quoted me $175 each for the eye serum and the lifting serum, I told him that was too expensive, and that I would need to do research before laying out that much money for a product I had never heard of. He then began to apply a mask to one side of my face and said the mask sells for $599 in Neiman Marcus, but if I purchased the eye and the lifting serum for $350, he would throw in the $599 mask for free! I told him no, that I had to research, and would come back the next day- oh no, I could not do that he said because he would not be there, and this was the last mask he had. That sealed it for me, and I told him no. He became very rude, and was showing me a so-called website with the prices posted. He also said the product was featured on Dr. Oz. When you click on the link on their website to Dr. Oz, it goes to the show, but no mention of Gratiae!! The next day, I went online and saw similar reviews to this one, and purchased all 3 products on Amazon for less than $100 total. It is the exact same product, and I do love it, but don&#x27;t be swindled by these crooks! When I went by the booth a couple of days later, a girl was pushing samples, and I told her that I had ordered from Amazon, and she said that is too bad because it is not the same product. Again-erroneous information.</li>
            <li> Okay.. let me start by say that those who bought and paid huge prices, these reviews are for the product, not buyer guilt. The products are high end, and just what one would expect from a mall. (At our local mall in So. Cal. the eye serum and cream were on special for \\&quot;buy one get one free\\&quot; at $250.)  I and thrilled to be able to purchase what I was at such a bargain price. Why? Because in 69 yeas I have tried them all, and found that most will \\&quot;sit on top of my skin\\&quot;.  No product works exactly the same on everybody, but let me tell you if you follow Gratiae instructions this eye serum it the best. Use it, and it prepares the tissue to receive the rest of the goody treatment from the eye cream.  During the day I use the serum, and night the cream with the serum.  Been on this for about 2 weeks now and the crepey feeling of my skin is at ground zero.  So as long as I can buy it at affordable prices, I won&#x27;t be changing. </li>
            <li> If you are using the replenishing eye cream this goes hand in hand with it. The two together do a great job of moisturizing the eye lids and under the eyes. This is the exact same product Gratiae sell but a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a product work so well that instantly takes away puffiness under my eyes. It is wonderful. These other reviews are rambling rather than reviewing if product works. It does. The ingredients are safe. Give it a try. I&#x27;m 48, I look much younger other than eye area due to insomnia. This helped a lot, my daughter noticed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years.  When I was &amp;#34;testing&amp;#34; it, my husband made the comment, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know what that stuff is, but you should buy it!&amp;#34;  I wondered who he was and what he did with MY husband!</li>
            <li> First things first: This eye serum is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, avoid the super hot Israeli guys at the Vegas mall kiosks! Their prices are way too high compared to Amazon. However, I will not take away any stars for that - I blame myself. These guys know they are charming and use it to their advantage. I paid such an exorbitant amount for the eye serum and facial peel that I&#x27;m ashamed to specify it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this product is practically perfect for me. The areas around my eyes are severely dry and often peel. I&#x27;ve even tried prescription medication from a dermatologist and that didn&#x27;t even work. So many eye creams make my eyes tear, burn, itch and peel. Nothing ever worked until I used Gratiae Replenishing Eye Serum. It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin and the moisturizing/hydrating effect lasts all day. If you&#x27;re going to use it in the morning, I suggest giving yourself time before applying makeup as the product takes a few extra minutes to be absorbed into the skin. It feels amazing after a nice cleansing wash (whatever cleanser you use), and my eye area has never looked and felt better. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using my 1.02 oz bottle for over three months now, and even though I paid way too much, I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth. A little goes a long way. I will surely be buying more off Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great product without being think or greasy- its like satin! Wrinkles a disappearing and putting make up on over it is so smooth!  Excellent price on here compared to their website or counters! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this product anytime, it is very good for dark circles and combating fines lines in the eye area.I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> In almost every review that I have read about Gratiae serum products, everyone seems compelled to mention how much cheaper they are on Amazon. Please keep in mind that the vendors read these reviews also. If you persist in mentioning this, these products will no longer be affordable. I have seen this happen before. Please keep this in mind when posting your reviews.</li>
            <li> While in Vegas I was stopped in Planet Hollywood by a Salesman with a pitch selling this product.  My friend and I went in and I was shocked and amazed as what the product did.  But they were selling for $300.00.  When I got home I was shopping Amazon and this ad came up same product except for the price.  I ordered it and it came very quickly, I started using the product that day.  The results were just not there....I don&#x27;t know what they were selling in Vegas, but I didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> Gratiae  replenishing eye serum lovely to use..problem is the pretty bottle  doesn&#x27;t fit tightly, so leaks. On a recent trip I placed bottle in my beverage holder to protect it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Have been using it for many years and keep watching the price go up!  Here on Amazon you can find it more reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs and you can go right on with the make up!</li>
            <li> I too had someone at the mall put this on my eye. Later I realized that my right eye is not as puffy as the left one. He put it on my right eye, then added the eye cream, and I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference! The salesman said I could buy either one for $300, or both for $500. Ya, NO. He had said that Dr. Oz had this product on his show. But I saw that show, and I didn&#x27;t remember him showing a $300 serum or cream. I started to walk away, and the guy got angry and started shouting things at me! I was like \\&quot;Wow. I&#x27;m really not spending that kind of money\\&quot;. He gave me a look like I was the most pathetic idiot on the face of the earth, and shoo&#x27;d me away like he no longer had time for me.&lt;br /&gt;Well, a friend told me to check at Amazon,and low and behold, there it was. Both items for less than $70. I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;It is not as miraculous as I remembered.The serum goes on really nice,but it does absolutely nothing for the puffiness.The eye cream is ok, but has no affect on my fine lines. I&#x27;m fairly disappointed. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the same product or if I was just seeing things at the mall.I&#x27;m thinking of returning them but Amazon gave me $50 to spend if I opened a charge account, so it only cost me around $17.Seriously, where are you gonna get eye serum and cream for $17?</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 2 yrs. Unfortunately, like a lot of other reviews, I was cornered at the Palazzo in Las Vegas and did purchase 5 items for $400!!!!!! What a big surprise to find the exact items on Amazon for a fraction of the price. I will be purchasing these through Amazon from now on. Ladies Beware!!!! These items are very good but don&#x27;t pay that exorbitant prices at the Kiosks.</li>
            <li> Exellent , and used with the eye cream</li>
            <li> I first bought this product in Las Vegas 2 years ago. It has lasted me that long and I just ordered another bottle. Very little is needed and the results are great. I am 64 and no one believes me. I just bought another bottle through Amazon and it only cost me $12.. So I now have 2  bottles on top of the one I am presently using.Would I recommend this product? 100% yes.</li>
            <li> I too was &#x27;grabbed&#x27; by the sales people. There were three. They told me how tired I looked.&lt;br /&gt;I then got the make over. It went on and on. I left $500 lighter. Here is the odd thing. I have&lt;br /&gt;used the eye serum, and just about everything else. I am now getting compliments on my skin. Even from&lt;br /&gt;my Dermatologist. I will never pay that much again but I will continue to use the product. I like compliments and my&lt;br /&gt;skin feels better. It was a hard lesson learned. I will hunt for the lowest priced products from now on.</li>
            <li> By far, this is the best Gratiae product I&#x27;ve tried. It seemed to work very fast. I am putting it on my eye wrinkles and small scars on my face, and it is amazing at how quickly they are disappearing. I am amazed, and hear it works even better with the eye cream, which I hope to purchase next.</li>
            <li> Tried this product today and have experienced blurry vision. My story is the same as some other reviewers as I paid too much money on an impulse purchase that I was told was organic. I am throwing all products away.  I gave it one star because that is the lowest rating available in order to write a review.</li>
            <li> It has a special feel of softness under the eyes to keep the facial tissue soft without drying out the skin.</li>
            <li> The person that used this will see a difference and if you stop using it you feel the eye area very dry. It does help.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way like half a pump at a time seems to be enough.  It goes on greasy feeling but absorbs and keeps your eyes very hydrated I have not found it to be a wrinkle miracle cure but seems to be working good so far</li>
            <li> It was a good product. But it broke me out under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Like the Lifting Facial Serum the Replenishing Eye Serum doesn&#x27;t seem to improve wrinkles but it does make my skin feel good and softer.  At nearly 70 years I don&#x27;t suppose anything can really make a big difference but since this absorbs quickly I must have more dryness in the eye area than I thought so unless something equally good and less expensive comes along, I will probably continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Used product for over 6 months and did not work for me. Will go back to using Lancome.</li>
            <li> The top doesn&#x27;t sit well on the bottle due to the manner in which it was packaged. This is a manufacturer issue and not so much Amazon, but still. I like the product and certainly think this is the way to purchase it versus at retail outlets.</li>
            <li> This eye serum makes your skin feel silky and smooth. I use it in the morning and at night.  ok</li>
            <li> The top doesn&#x27;t fit  well so there is always some sticky liquid around the bottle of the mouth.</li>
            <li> removes little lines like crazy and a fraction of the price of the website price</li>
            <li> I love this product! At 50 the wrinkles around the eyes are becoming more noticable. This product has been a miracle worker. My husband and friends have noticed and commented on my younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> Love it! Wonderful deal on Amazon.. Don&#x27;t get suckered into the mall price!!</li>
            <li> Great, just like all the other womens&#x27; reviews, I&#x27;ve been ripped off. Run from these people selling at Maul&#x27;s Kiosks! They are snakes. Shame on the mauls for allowing it.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m a guy at age 50. I was leaving a San Diego mall right at closing one night, and got handed a sample by an attractive young lady, who got me to sit down and she soon liberally applied the eye serum and another eye product (\\&quot;for circulation\\&quot;) and yep, my wrinkles did diminish. Pretty amazing.  I was pitched for a big discount bringing down a PAIR of $350 priced products down to $400. After protesting I still couldn&#x27;t afford it, I was presented a number of combinations, $300, $200, and finally just the eye serum for $100. She said she was not on commission, that she was losing money, and I was to \\&quot;zip it,\\&quot; because of the deal I was getting. I felt a bit guilty about taking her time, and finally relented and reluctantly handed my credit card over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I got home I noticed the credit card slip said \\&quot;no refunds.\\&quot;  My bad.  But when I read the other reviews here at Amazon for the same product at $23, my heart sank.  She also said the 1.02 oz would last a year. Certainly not at the liberal amount she applied... and she certainly wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;losing money.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I directly contacted the mall management and they contacted the kiosk owner to arrange a refund and it looks like they will issue a refund.  I was also informed that Gratiae is an national company, that the eye serum is a good product, that the product on Amazon (as far as known) is NOT a knock-off, but that the kiosk sales people are indeed commissioned, but should not to be so aggressive, like moving out from the area of the kiosk, or engaging with people walking by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, if the product on Amazon is authentic, as it appears, it is outrageous to ask over 1000% more. I feel bad for anyone who paid $350 for this, but again, just call the mall management, hopefully they will be able to help. Gratiae, I hope you realize your reputation will soon need to be repaired, as well as your pricing and sales practices in the malls, and perhaps online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon price at $23,if for the authentic product, is obviously very good by comparison.  As for the product, I haven&#x27;t used it, other than my demonstration at the mall.  Some have alluded to the safety of the formumla--can&#x27;t speak to that.</li>
            <li> Why are people posting negative comments because they got ripped off and paid too much at a mall for this product? I also found out about the product from the high pressure sales at the Miracle Mall in Las Vegas however I wasn&#x27;t stupid enough to fall for it and instead went home and did my research and found it on Amazon.com for 6 times less. I love the eye serum. It actually does diminish the look of the fine wrinkles around my eyes. My husband can tell every time which eye I used it on. I have tried countless other products and this is the only one that gives me immediate results. Love it, Love it, Love it!</li>
            <li> Okay, just bought the serum and eye cream today in a cool downtown NYC boutique, THEN did my research here and realized I overpaid by about 300%. I MEAN-- they charged me $290 for the serum, then then gave me the eye cream for free \\&quot;because the sales guy thinks I&#x27;m worth the deal so I&#x27;d come back to buy more\\&quot;. So, really I paid $150 for the serum, then $150 for cream when you break it down, and I was still ripped off for both. I hope this works, because during my demo at the store, the product feels natural and comfortable on my skin, and I did see an immediate difference. The area around my eye is tighter and the fine lines became softer after a few dabs. So even though I over paid, I hope that this works. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes of it reducing the not so lovely puffiness that has appeared under my eyes.  I have been using it for three days and have already seen an improvement.  I have been applying it several times a day.  Many have complained of paying a higher price for this product at the mall but if the puffiness under my eyes continues to decrease I would say it is worth the higher price.  I have tried several drug store and department store products that promise a reduction in puff but none of these worked for me.</li>
            <li> This product was introduced to me in Las Vegas.  I can&#x27;t complain as far as the delivery.  Came on time, but the contents in this bottle is NOT the same as what was in the bottle that was sampled on my eyes in Las Vegas.  Maybe it is out of date.  The price was substantially higher in Las Vegas, so there must be a reason.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the same product I got sucked into buying for way more $$ at the shipping mall at Caesar&#x27;s in Las Vegas. It does work, you can immediately see the difference in the lines around your eyes.  I do not believe it does much in the long run, but short term, you can absolutely see the difference.</li>
            <li> to be honest I had some doubts to buy it, because my skin around the eyes is really very sensitive, but finally I decided and I started to use. Now I&#x27;m satisfied and can rocommend to the others.</li>
            <li> Gratiae skin-care products are touted as being organic, but they ARE NOT.  Only a few ingredients are certified organic.  Other ingredients include cetearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, chemical fragrance, bht, retinyl acetate (all in the silky body butter).  The sellers insist that Dr. Oz loves the products, but there is absolutely no evidence of this on the web.  The website for Gratiae is a sham.  Ladies, take it from one who was shammed and feels embarrassed to have been taken in (by the friendly sincerity of the seller), these products need to be shut out from any more purchases.  Someone is getting really rich on selling these pitiful combinations of cheap ingredients and yet making it look like some luxury brand.</li>
            <li> When I was in Vegas last month I was approached by a Gratiae sales rep. and he applied the product on half face. I saw excellent results. I wanted to purchase this product really bad. It was very pricey.  I decided to goggle it and was shocked to find out how cheap it was on Amazon so I decided to purchase it from Amazon and the results are not the same as the results I saw on my face in Vegas. Oh well! Maybe they put something better on my face and were trying to sell me Gratiae. I will never know.</li>
            <li> makes the skin under the eye very soft, can lead to puffyness left on over night</li>
