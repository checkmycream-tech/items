            <li>it smells good</li>
            <li>It keeps them in good health also  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner!  </li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo ever!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I am pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>The products have a nice scent without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast and happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>I find that I use probably too much shampoo and the perfect amount of conditioner.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells very nice and clean and lathers up nicely.  </li>
            <li>it makes my hair shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I also use the Melu &amp; Love line to mix it up.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, the smell is like most NouNou smells.</li>
            <li>You just don&#x27;t get the suds gratification that you do with most shampoos making you question if it&#x27;s working or not.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will, of course, purchase again.</li>
            <li>but it is strong.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and wavy/curly, color-treated, and prone to frizz and dryness.  </li>
            <li>Although I am fortunate enough to have great hair, this product line raises it to &amp;#34;camera ready&amp;#34; with just a wash and condition.  </li>
            <li>This is a Curl Building Serum and get fantastic results.</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo and conditioner, but didn&#x27;t really notice anything spectacular about it</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a product to make your hair soft and silky, this is a good one, but I would recommend using the oil as well.</li>
            <li>The conditioner has a very strong smell, not bad, definitely a high end smell</li>
            <li>The Nounou shampoo and conditoner are both super yummy smelling and leave hair feeling clean and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I love the rich creamy texture and the natural light scent of this duo.</li>
            <li>Nounou is much better for my dyed, fine, soft, and somewhat wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Being a self-proclaimed product junkie, I have had several adventures with many, many hair products.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Davines Nounou shampoo seems to clean well without drying out, and the conditioner seems to condition well without too much heaviness.</li>
            <li>NouNou line is designed for color treated hair and helps the color last longer, as well as moisturize to keep hair healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>It worked great with both long and short hair.</li>
            <li>You have to use just the right amount, not too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Davines product for a few years now and the quality is exceptional.</li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t have to use large amounts in your hair to get results.  </li>
            <li>Also the very fragrant scent without being too strong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have found that it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and these products don&#x27;t weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair and it was very soft and smooth, although, I do use Davines Oil, which I know helps make it smooth and so soft.  </li>
            <li>I use other Davines products and love them, so I thought I would try Nounou to revitalize my locks.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I feel like I need to rinse it more than other conditioner</li>
            <li>Really nice, not too heavy at all, leaves hair very soft and luxurious feeling.</li>
            <li>I think this is important for me because I feel like my hair is not as naturally soft anymore because of how much I&#x27;ve colored it recently.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is absolutely wonderful, and even though the bottles look small, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, so they will last a long time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to Davines, my hairdresser uses it and when I found it on Amazon for much cheaper, I had to get it.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be trying more of Davines products in the future.</li>
            <li>But, when I did - I found my hair much easier to style, very soft and lots of body.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend  this set to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with Davines and have purchased and used quite a few products.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new on my colored</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo and conditioner that consistently works on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have drier slightly wavy hair and these products kept it moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling soft, supple, shiny, and much healthier.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s because of how soft it leaves your hair.</li>
            <li>This is the only kind of shampoo that keeps my thin and colored hair moisturized without being greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in a timely fashion and at quite a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This seems to work decent with that problem...other than that my hair is fine but thick...</li>
            <li>My hair is much less dry and brittle, just shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>The product is such high quality you do not need to use a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shampoo keeps my red hair colour intact and the conditioner makes your hair feel like silky soft.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily scalp and hair and need to wash daily.</li>
            <li>So obviously I want to it to feel as soft as it did before.</li>
            <li>I left the conditioner in my hair for several minutes before washing out and was amazed at how silky soft my hair was.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m typically a very dark brunette and recently went blondish (ombre) - and this has been great on not messing with the color and helping out with my poor ends!</li>
            <li>I back it up with two other Davines products to keep it real.  </li>

            <li> I have very thick long naturally curly hair that I keep colored and highlighted.  This is my second purchase of the shampoo and conditioner.  Well worth the money. The product is such high quality you do not need to use a lot of it.  I use this with the Davines This is a Curl Building Serum and get fantastic results.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells weird and it gave me dandruff.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner!  Nourishes hair without weighing it down.  Great for color-treated hair. The products have a nice scent without being overpowering.  Wonderful products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to Davines, my hairdresser uses it and when I found it on Amazon for much cheaper, I had to get it.  After looking at the different options of shampoo and conditioner, I went with Nounou as my hair is colored and highlighted.  The shampoo smells very nice and clean and lathers up nicely.  I left the conditioner in my hair for several minutes before washing out and was amazed at how silky soft my hair was.  I blow dry my hair and it was very soft and smooth, although, I do use Davines Oil, which I know helps make it smooth and so soft.  If you are looking for a product to make your hair soft and silky, this is a good one, but I would recommend using the oil as well.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner, but didn&#x27;t really notice anything spectacular about it, I don&#x27;t have any complaints with it either</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used Davines product for a few years now and the quality is exceptional. My hair stylist introduced me to it.  It leaves my hair soft and looking healthy. You also don&#x27;t have to use large amounts in your hair to get results.  I have very fine hair and these products don&#x27;t weigh it down at all.

            <li> Davines Nounou shampoo seems to clean well without drying out, and the conditioner seems to condition well without too much heaviness. I have naturally oily scalp and hair and need to wash daily. This seems to work decent with that problem...other than that my hair is fine but thick...I like to switch between Nounou and Melu for the conditioner</li>
            <li> Horrible don&#x27;t get it&#x27;s too expensive and doesn&#x27;t do nothing will never order again get good stuff for this price not this crap it sucks so bad only thing it smells good</li>
            <li> it makes my hair shiny and healthy.  I use it when i wear extensions.  It keeps them in good health also  great product</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> my hair product has come along.  Being a self-proclaimed product junkie, I have had several adventures with many, many hair products.  I still adore a few here and there but this is my keeper.  Although I am fortunate enough to have great hair, this product line raises it to &amp;#34;camera ready&amp;#34; with just a wash and condition.  I back it up with two other Davines products to keep it real.  A few of my gal pals have tried it and are also on board.  I also use the Melu &amp; Love line to mix it up.  It&#x27;s worth the price.  Isn&#x27;t your hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair:  44 years - level 3 brown - salon colored (strictly to battle the pesky ever-more present grey roots!) on calendar - wear for 2 to 3 days MAX between washes - blow dry or natural dry on 1st day - heat styled 2nd &amp; 3rd day - med thickness w/natural waves - trim ends as necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;Sparkling Tess</li>
            <li> Really nice, not too heavy at all, leaves hair very soft and luxurious feeling. My hair is much less dry and brittle, just shiny and healthy. The conditioner has a very strong smell, not bad, definitely a high end smell but it is strong.</li>
            <li> The title says it all! All my life, I had to change my shampoo after a few months and to alternate between shampoos. Not anymore since I switched to Davines Nounou.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do like their Melu (green one with Avacado) too and every once in awhile I use that. Nounou is much better for my dyed, fine, soft, and somewhat wavy hair.It worked great with both long and short hair. (I went from very long to pixie short)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great thing about Nounou is that it does NOT rip off your hair color. I travel a lot and sometimes I can&#x27;t take enough of this for my travel period and I end up using other shampoos. I can tell the difference in my hair color immediately after using other shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using both shampoo and conditioner together. The conditioner is ahhmaazzziing, so if you need to choose between them, I&#x27;d go for the conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and wavy/curly, color-treated, and prone to frizz and dryness.  I use other Davines products and love them, so I thought I would try Nounou to revitalize my locks.  As usual, Davines did not disappoint!  This shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling soft, supple, shiny, and much healthier.  The price does seem a bit steep, but a little goes a long way and for the quality I think it&#x27;s worth it.  When these bottles run out I am thinking about buying the 33.8oz bottles, for the reduced price per ounce.  I will definitely be trying more of Davines products in the future.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is absolutely wonderful, and even though the bottles look small, you don&#x27;t need to use a lot, so they will last a long time! My hair is definitely thankful!</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo ever!</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner that consistently works on my hair.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for well over a month now. This product is great on color treated hair. I&#x27;m typically a very dark brunette and recently went blondish (ombre) - and this has been great on not messing with the color and helping out with my poor ends! Ends took a beating. Anyway, the smell is like most NouNou smells. I hear some people like it and some people don&#x27;t. I personally like it a lot. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t get sudsy which I don&#x27;t like...but it doesn&#x27;t change how it works. You just don&#x27;t get the suds gratification that you do with most shampoos making you question if it&#x27;s working or not. It is. The conditioner leaves your hair crazy soft. Sometimes I feel like I need to rinse it more than other conditioner but that&#x27;s because of how soft it leaves your hair. I think this is important for me because I feel like my hair is not as naturally soft anymore because of how much I&#x27;ve colored it recently. So obviously I want to it to feel as soft as it did before. The conditioner accomplishes this. I find that I use probably too much shampoo and the perfect amount of conditioner. I feel like this is due to the packaging. No complaints...just how I feel. I love this product and will, of course, purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to replace Pureology since I heard they got bought out by a big company and are changing the formula. I love the rich creamy texture and the natural light scent of this duo. I found that using too much was not good, made my hair seem dry. You have to use just the right amount, not too much. But, when I did - I found my hair much easier to style, very soft and lots of body. I am pretty impressed. I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with Davines and have purchased and used quite a few products.  The Nounou shampoo and conditoner are both super yummy smelling and leave hair feeling clean and hydrated.  I have drier slightly wavy hair and these products kept it moisturized and smooth.</li>
