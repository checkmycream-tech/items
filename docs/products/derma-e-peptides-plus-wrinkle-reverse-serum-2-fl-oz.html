            <li>you are getting top  quality at a good price.</li>
            <li>and it feels nice and seems to be working.</li>
            <li>Nice serum, one of the most effective  serums I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I need additional moisturizer for the dry weather, but this product feels great -- and is great.</li>
            <li>Great product for very decent price.</li>
            <li>I love this skin care line.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a serum, with more peptides.</li>
            <li>If you like something light and effective this is it.</li>
            <li>and i love it along with all the Derma -e products  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s working :)</li>
            <li>I will be using this product for many years to come.</li>
            <li>This product is simply phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen better results using this than with department store brands.</li>
            <li>even though it moisturizes I felt like it didn&#x27;t leave my face any better  </li>
            <li>I love this serum and use it in combination with the Derma e rehadrating serum.</li>
            <li>Much more affordable than most as well.</li>
            <li>I saw results in 2 weeks of using this product and will be ordering more when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but doesn&#x27;t compare to the product I wanted.</li>
            <li>My favorite peptide serum.</li>
            <li>I love the serum form because it is not sticky.</li>
            <li>I notice a huge difference in the plump-Ness to my skin.</li>
            <li>This reminds me of a light lotion.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth, and I think wrinkles are shrinking.</li>
            <li>Smooth plump skin in the morning.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked so healthy and young.</li>
            <li>I put it on after I shower or bathe, and it soaks right in.  </li>
            <li>, I love the price and am pretty sure my wrinkles are less noticeable</li>
            <li>I was hoping to find an all natural replacement for my Olay Regenerist Regenerating Serum (which I love, but it has parabens), but I don&#x27;t like this one as much.</li>
            <li>It seems drying (not a huge deal because I use the Derma E vitamin A cream afterward), and it sort of smells like daylily blooms that are beginning to rot, which I don&#x27;t find terribly pleasant.</li>
            <li>I saw results the first day.</li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m not frowning as much as before.</li>
            <li>This product works well and really does work.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Purchase other products from Derma-E, and am enjoying the benefits.</li>
            <li>But really didnt suit my skin.prompt shipping and decent price.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on my mature skin.</li>
            <li>I really love how this cream absorbs into my skin and leaves a slight youthful dewy sheen before bedtime.</li>
            <li>This helped with my smile lines and prevented future ones.  </li>
            <li>The packaging makes it sound wonderful, but the product is greasy and feels awful on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 7 years now, and every time I try any of the high-end more expensive ones I regret it, and go back to my favorite Derma E. Will be using it forever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay lotion - but overpriced, and the bottle is small.</li>
            <li>It has made a positive difference in my skins overall appearance.</li>
            <li>I was in the Beauty business for 18 years and have tried many natural, organic ingredient and very expensive products, also have acquired too many products in my &amp;#34;personal beauty supply&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I use it as preventative anti aging but the few fine lines I have it makes them hydrated and invisible.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Too soon to tell how well it does on the old wrinkles</li>
            <li>I hesitated because of the low price was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>On the other hand it is gentle enough to use around my eyes  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any decreased wrinkles  maybe just the prevention of new ones  </li>
            <li> It has made my skin so soft and less crinkly.</li>
            <li> Seems like this lotion is pretty average; however, it comes with a poor dispenser, so I think an unecessarily large amount of the product will go to waste.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no illusion that this will  miraculously make my wrinkles disappear, But it seems that I am really less wrinkly than my other friends my age.</li>
            <li> Amazon price is much less than the manufacturer&#x27;s website price.</li>
            <li> It works well under my facecream for added protection without heavy coverage.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take the wrinkles away completely, but does minimize them some and keeps them from getting worse!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any improvements in wrinkles and have been using at least 4 weeks!  </li>
            <li> Maybe worse because of the breakouts</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this deep wrinkle cream.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> OXITOXYN 2 is a REALLY BAD UNDEREYE CREAM.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this skin care line., it has changed my life. I really love how this cream absorbs into my skin and leaves a slight youthful dewy sheen before bedtime. It has made my skin so soft and less crinkly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my eyelids, it&#x27;s a good size bottle, smells nice but still, didn&#x27;t see any difference, do anything for me. and taking adventaje of the space... OXITOXYN 2 is a REALLY BAD UNDEREYE CREAM. just feel a kind of tighter skin but if you smille, ALL THE RINKLES POP OUT, THAT IS THE WORSSEEE CREAM THAT I EVER USED, PLUS IT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a serum, with more peptides. This reminds me of a light lotion. I see no difference.I may go back to vitamin C</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 7 years now, and every time I try any of the high-end more expensive ones I regret it, and go back to my favorite Derma E. Will be using it forever.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I&#x27;m not applying harmful chemicals to my skin. Purchase other products from Derma-E, and am enjoying the benefits. My skin feels smooth, and I think wrinkles are shrinking.</li>
            <li> this serum seems to be working on my skin, it tingles when it absorbs. Plus I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m not frowning as much as before.</li>
            <li> If you like something light and effective this is it. I have been using it sense it came out and i love it along with all the Derma -e products  you are getting top  quality at a good price.</li>
            <li> Have been using it daily and still unsure if it is making a difference but I will finish the bottle and write an updated review afterwards.</li>
            <li> This product actually works for the price. I hesitated because of the low price was pleasantly surprised. and quite happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working :)</li>
            <li> I Hope to see a difference soon if not I want to return it. It&#x27;s has great feedback but I don&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I saw results the first day. My skin has never looked so healthy and young. I will be using this product for many years to come.</li>
            <li> This product is simply phenomenal. I&#x27;ve seen better results using this than with department store brands.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any improvements in wrinkles and have been using at least 4 weeks!  I was so hoping this product would work!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 yrs. I never go a day without it. It works well under my facecream for added protection without heavy coverage. I always like to use a Peptide ingredient and Peptide plus works to reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Not only do I like the ingredients, I love the price and am pretty sure my wrinkles are less noticeable</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 years.  This helped with my smile lines and prevented future ones.  This is a great product and it delivers!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Smooth plump skin in the morning.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any change at all and used for 4 wks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that serums are good but this makes me break out  On the other hand it is gentle enough to use around my eyes  I really didn&#x27;t notice any decreased wrinkles  maybe just the prevention of new ones  Overall even though it moisturizes I felt like it didn&#x27;t leave my face any better  Maybe worse because of the breakouts</li>
            <li> I used Hydroxatone before trying this (which was like 3 times the price), and since using this along with the night cream, I&#x27;ve seen very similar results.  Doesn&#x27;t take the wrinkles away completely, but does minimize them some and keeps them from getting worse!</li>
            <li> I love this serum and use it in combination with the Derma e rehadrating serum. My skin looks and feels firmer. Great product for very decent price. Plus it doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals, which is crutial to me.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find an all natural replacement for my Olay Regenerist Regenerating Serum (which I love, but it has parabens), but I don&#x27;t like this one as much. It seems drying (not a huge deal because I use the Derma E vitamin A cream afterward), and it sort of smells like daylily blooms that are beginning to rot, which I don&#x27;t find terribly pleasant. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, though, and I think it&#x27;s doing what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Seems like this lotion is pretty average; however, it comes with a poor dispenser, so I think an unecessarily large amount of the product will go to waste.  It&#x27;s an okay lotion - but overpriced, and the bottle is small.</li>
            <li> Nice serum, one of the most effective  serums I have ever used. It has made a positive difference in my skins overall appearance. Much more affordable than most as well.</li>
            <li> This product works well and really does work. I saw results in 2 weeks of using this product and will be ordering more when I&#x27;m out. thanks R.Stevenson</li>
            <li> Feels good on my skin.  Non-greasy.  I mix it 50/50 with the Derma e hyaluronic rehydrating acid serum.  Makes my skin soft to the touch.  Does not seem pore-clogging at all.  Too soon to tell how well it does on the old wrinkles so I&#x27;m just giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a peptide product WITHOUT toxic chemicals and not-so-safe preservatives. This is it. I need additional moisturizer for the dry weather, but this product feels great -- and is great.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Have been using it daily for several years, under my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this thinking ir was a derma e product I had already tried and loved. My mistake. It&#x27;s okay, but doesn&#x27;t compare to the product I wanted.</li>
            <li> This stuff made me break out.  The packaging makes it sound wonderful, but the product is greasy and feels awful on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I also use it along wiht the derma e Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  I put it on after I shower or bathe, and it soaks right in.  Very gentle on my mature skin.</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you want a product that works like it&#x27;s described, this is it! I was in the Beauty business for 18 years and have tried many natural, organic ingredient and very expensive products, also have acquired too many products in my &amp;#34;personal beauty supply&amp;#34;. I will keep and use Derma E products and eliminate the others.</li>
            <li> Ok! But really didnt suit my skin.prompt shipping and decent price.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. I dont like this serum.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I thought it was and had a reaction around my eyes so I used it sparingly.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this deep wrinkle cream.  I saw this product on Dr. Oz and purchased it but it does not improve any wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li> I use this every night before I go to bed after I let my rosacea treatments sink in and it feels nice and seems to be working.</li>
            <li> My favorite peptide serum. I believe this is my 2nd or 3rd bottle and I will continue to repurchase. It does what it says and my skin loves it. I notice a huge difference in the plump-Ness to my skin. I use it as preventative anti aging but the few fine lines I have it makes them hydrated and invisible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no illusion that this will  miraculously make my wrinkles disappear, But it seems that I am really less wrinkly than my other friends my age. I&#x27;ve been using this for years for maintenance. I use the brand&#x27;s hyaluronic acid serum alongside this, for hydrating. I love the serum form because it is not sticky. Amazon price is much less than the manufacturer&#x27;s website price.</li>
    </ol>
