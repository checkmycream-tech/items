            <li>Nice, huh?</li>

            <li>I bought this as a gift for my daughter because she liked mine.</li>
            <li>If she&#x27;d had a nice brush like this I might&#x27;ve been able to stand having my hair brushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love how this brush feels on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m here looking for another one for my car and one for a gift.  : )</li>
            <li>and I guess there are supposed to be holes for better air flow or something like that.</li>
            <li>This brush, aside from making my own hair look and feel lovely, goes right through the extensions and seems to help spread healthy nutrients from my hair into them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With due respect for all the wonderful reviews, this brush just wasn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li>but I have fine, medium length, thinner hair).</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Very handy but the regular size one seems softer.</li>
            <li>this was wonderful to have on the trip as it fit in a small compartment</li>
            <li>The size is small, it&#x27;s great as a baby/young child brush but can work for an adult unless you have lots of hair (works great for me</li>
            <li>I ordered this brush for my Mom because I love mine so much.</li>
            <li>She had a wooden brush before from the Body Shop which she loved</li>
            <li>Super quality.</li>
            <li>I had many a sun burn on my scalp which is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>They are both 18 years old and are still fabulous!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good also, for brushing other people&#x27;s hair,  </li>
            <li>Works great in her long, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>it was the first time for me to use this wood Bruch, feeling is grate and worth the price .</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair and this brush feels great against the scalp and lets me brush my hair as much as I want without adding any static even in the dead of winter!  </li>
            <li>The small one fits perfectly in my purse and works as well as a larger one.</li>
            <li>durable just wish there were more bristles as on short hair when I want to hold it in position for blow drying</li>
            <li>My girlfriend at first thought it was crappy quality because there were &amp;#34;missing bristles&amp;#34; on the brush out of the box.</li>
            <li>I have fine long hair and this is the only brush I&#x27;ve ever liked.  </li>
            <li>I bought one of these brushes about 15 years ago and had loved using it on a daily basis but it finally showed its age</li>
            <li>The wooden bristles are gentle and do not create static</li>
            <li>The quality was nice but for the price just not worth.</li>
            <li>hair is fine and this brush leans a little smaller which works great for me - if you have tons of hair you may want to get the regular</li>
            <li>My hair is short and fine, so it doesn&#x27;t need much brushing.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing on the scalp, it&#x27;s like a good massage (I tried other wooden brushes like Bass</li>
            <li>have too much hair</li>
            <li>I have a tender scalp and it does not hurt too much.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to order another.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t cheap out and buy a similar brush of another brand</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m out in the wind my hair really gets tangled.  </li>
            <li>sister uses my brushes too, and her hair is waist length medium thickness and coarseness, she much prefers it too.  </li>
            <li>and she says her hair feels much healthier and stronger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is my only brush (I own 5-7 brushes of different kinds) that will go through the extensions knots without damaging them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I often had major tangles and in summer with fine blonde hair</li>
            <li>I bought this purse-sized wooden hairbrush to see if I liked it enough to buy the bigger one as well.</li>
            <li>and I just replaced it with a new one.</li>
            <li>so it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li>The new one is just as well made, and to the same specs, as the first.</li>
            <li>This was my first wooden brush.</li>
            <li>and it indeed felt good to him until, almost immediately the green cushion with the bristles attached kept popping out and takes a long time to work back in.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son to use since he has a sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>I have my old nylon bristle brush in my car</li>
            <li>the small size is fine for me.  </li>
            <li>I have had a large Widu brush for years, and decided to get a small one for my purse as this brush causes less static electricity than others.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m ready to pitch my regular brush, I&#x27;ll buy the bigger Widu.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to get away from plastic in general.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to fit in her purse</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other similar brushes but Widu bristles are very rounded so they don&#x27;t hurt my scalp.  </li>
            <li>There is one hole where the bristles are and at first I thought it was missing a bristle</li>

            <li> I have two Widu Ash Bristle Brushes, a large and a small.</li>
            <li> You can buy the small oval one instead of the big one if you don&#x27;t have very thick hair, but I like the big one slightly better</li>
            <li> The work well on long thick hair and at the same time the rounded wood bristles are gentle on your scalp.</li>
            <li> and they are easily tangled, dry and difficult to untangle.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s the only brush I use on my wet hair</li>
            <li> If I did not read another review about the extra pins, I would have thrown the pins hidden in the packaging.</li>
            <li> Since the larger size is more expensive, I thought the small size would be small</li>
            <li> Of all the brushes I&#x27;ve used widu brushes get out my tangles better and less painfully than any other.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make hair frizzy like some other brushes I used</li>
            <li> as other reviewers have said - the way it feels on your head is sooo nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , Bass brush bristles were too pointy and sharp and scratchy to the scalp, Widu&#x27;s bristles are rounded).</li>
            <li> Trust me, fine, long, curly hair is the worst for knots.  </li>
            <li> It pulls through my matted mess with hardly a stretch or break</li>
            <li> No static.</li>
            <li> my hair becomes longer  a couple inches past my ears</li>
            <li> He does not have thick hair or it would be impossible to use.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sorry i didn&#x27;t try this before.  </li>
            <li> Way to expensive for what you get.</li>

            <li> this brush is great, easy to comb through hair and does not flatten or puff up the hair.  i&#x27;m sorry i didn&#x27;t try this before.  the small size is fine for me.  took it on vacation but use it daily at home too.</li>
            <li> Since the larger size is more expensive, I thought the small size would be small but i gave it a shot and bought it. Its good&lt;br /&gt;I have no issue with it&lt;br /&gt;Also the size is good&lt;br /&gt;I have long long curly hair&lt;br /&gt;I have too much hair&lt;br /&gt;But it works well for me</li>
            <li> I bought the brush to stimulate my scalp.  It does a good job.  I have a tender scalp and it does not hurt too much.  My scalp will get use to it.  I am writing the review to let people know that there are extra pins in the package.  You have to look for them.  If I did not read another review about the extra pins, I would have thrown the pins hidden in the packaging.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these brushes for almost 4 years.  They even come with extra teeth should one snap or fall out.  It pulls through my matted mess with hardly a stretch or break I recommend them highly as a good all purpose brush.  It&#x27;s the only brush I use on my wet hair and I&#x27;m ready to order another.</li>
            <li> This was my first wooden brush. I will now only use a wooden brush.  I love it. There is one hole where the bristles are and at first I thought it was missing a bristle but after I read the box I learned its supposed to be there. Also it comes with extra bristles in case one falls out.</li>
            <li> Best brush I have ever used. Works for both me and my toddler. It doesn&#x27;t make hair frizzy like some other brushes I used (boar brushes make both my and my daughter&#x27;s hair too frizzy). It feels amazing on the scalp, it&#x27;s like a good massage (I tried other wooden brushes like Bass and it is NOT the same, Bass brush bristles were too pointy and sharp and scratchy to the scalp, Widu&#x27;s bristles are rounded). The size is small, it&#x27;s great as a baby/young child brush but can work for an adult unless you have lots of hair (works great for me but I have fine, medium length, thinner hair). It is great for traveling or to keep in your purse.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush for my Mom because I love mine so much. The work well on long thick hair and at the same time the rounded wood bristles are gentle on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I have long, fine hair and this brush feels great against the scalp and lets me brush my hair as much as I want without adding any static even in the dead of winter!  I am buying several to give as gifts this year.  I am convinced this brush makes my hair look and feel better!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush. The best ever. Feels great on my scalp and glides through my hair easily. I would recommend this brush for everyone. Super quality. No static.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very very good brush!Thank you!</li>
            <li> it was the first time for me to use this wood Bruch, feeling is grate and worth the price .</li>
            <li> I bought one of these brushes about 15 years ago and had loved using it on a daily basis but it finally showed its age and I just replaced it with a new one. The new one is just as well made, and to the same specs, as the first. The wooden bristles are gentle and do not create static so the brush works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I have had a large Widu brush for years, and decided to get a small one for my purse as this brush causes less static electricity than others. The small one fits perfectly in my purse and works as well as a larger one.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, gets all the tangles out easily and feels SO good on scalp.</li>
            <li> this was wonderful to have on the trip as it fit in a small compartment&lt;br /&gt;seems durable just wish there were more bristles as on short hair when I want to hold it in position for blow drying it is slippery on my hair&lt;br /&gt;as my hair becomes longer  a couple inches past my ears it works much better.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect, met all my wife&#x27;s criteria - FSC sourced wood, Good 4 U Design, hand made, recyclable packaging. Works great in her long, naturally curly hair. She had a wooden brush before from the Body Shop which she loved but it just wore out so it was time for a new one. She can definitely recommend the Widu brand for those in the market for a wooden brush.</li>
            <li> Just was tiny. Picture didnt  tell truth. Guess tho i should have paid attention to measuremebts. The quality was nice but for the price just not worth. Back it went</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son to use since he has a sensitive scalp and it indeed felt good to him until, almost immediately the green cushion with the bristles attached kept popping out and takes a long time to work back in.He does not have thick hair or it would be impossible to use. This is either a faulty design or it should have been glued. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.Way to expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> This brush makes me so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hair extensions which clip in and they are easily tangled, dry and difficult to untangle.  This brush, aside from making my own hair look and feel lovely, goes right through the extensions and seems to help spread healthy nutrients from my hair into them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my only brush (I own 5-7 brushes of different kinds) that will go through the extensions knots without damaging them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as other reviewers have said - the way it feels on your head is sooo nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine and this brush leans a little smaller which works great for me - if you have tons of hair you may want to get the regular size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to try all the different Widu brushes!</li>
            <li> It feels so good while brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> With due respect for all the wonderful reviews, this brush just wasn&#x27;t for me.  The rubber base kept catching my hair and pulling it, so I really couldn&#x27;t use it at all.  I emailed Widu and asked what I could do about it since no one else seemed to have the same problem, and they ignored me.  Nice, huh?</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I&#x27;m trying to get away from plastic in general. I bought this purse-sized wooden hairbrush to see if I liked it enough to buy the bigger one as well. My hair is short and fine, so it doesn&#x27;t need much brushing. I love how this brush feels on my scalp. When I&#x27;m ready to pitch my regular brush, I&#x27;ll buy the bigger Widu. Hope this review helps someone!</li>
            <li> I have fine long hair and this is the only brush I&#x27;ve ever liked.  I have the bigger oval one too.  I use the smaller one for travel.  I&#x27;ve used other similar brushes but Widu bristles are very rounded so they don&#x27;t hurt my scalp.  I can even brush my hair when I have a sunburn on my scalp and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  These bristles are like a head massage.  Don&#x27;t cheap out and buy a similar brush of another brand, Widu is the best brush ever.  You can buy the small oval one instead of the big one if you don&#x27;t have very thick hair, but I like the big one slightly better myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is great because it minimizes static, it feels good to brush your hair.  When I&#x27;m out in the wind my hair really gets tangled.  Trust me, fine, long, curly hair is the worst for knots.  Of all the brushes I&#x27;ve used widu brushes get out my tangles better and less painfully than any other.  I have my old nylon bristle brush in my car but In the two years since I&#x27;ve had the Widu I&#x27;ve used that brush once.  I&#x27;d rather wait until I get home.  That brush makes my hair frizzy, unlike the Widu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister uses my brushes too, and her hair is waist length medium thickness and coarseness, she much prefers it too.  She always searches out my brush rather than using hers, which I haven&#x27;t seen in a while.  It&#x27;s good also, for brushing other people&#x27;s hair,  I wish my mom had had this brush when I was a child.  I often had major tangles and in summer with fine blonde hair I had many a sun burn on my scalp which is very sensitive.  If she&#x27;d had a nice brush like this I might&#x27;ve been able to stand having my hair brushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why am I on this page if I own this brush?  I&#x27;m here looking for another one for my car and one for a gift.  : )</li>
            <li> Very handy but the regular size one seems softer.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend at first thought it was crappy quality because there were &amp;#34;missing bristles&amp;#34; on the brush out of the box. I googled it and I guess there are supposed to be holes for better air flow or something like that. Well now she loves it. It&#x27;s small enough to fit in her purse and she says her hair feels much healthier and stronger.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter because she liked mine. I have two Widu Ash Bristle Brushes, a large and a small. They are both 18 years old and are still fabulous!</li>
