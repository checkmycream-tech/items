            <li>It smells clean, light and frankly, romantic!</li>
            <li>and I recieved it very quickly thanks!</li>
            <li>This year my wife told me exactly what to buy her for her birthday thus year.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this, but I think it tastes funny.</li>
            <li>Feminine, fresh, soft!  </li>
            <li>Thanks to all involved.</li>

            <li> Romance by Ralph Lauren is a nice fragrance.  In fact my wife has a bottle and I didn&#x27;t know it.  When I tried to arrange for a return authorization with Perfumania, (on several occasions)they simply didn&#x27;t respond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, they charge a 20% restocking fee which is totally out of line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly suggest you buy your fragrances elsewhere.</li>
            <li> my wife loves it and i love the way she smells when using it.&lt;br /&gt;good name Romance</li>
            <li> My wife loves this fragrance.</li>
