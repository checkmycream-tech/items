    <ol>
            <li>Cotz Flawless Complexion SPF 50 is a tinted sunscreen that is designed for broad-spectrum protection from the sun without causing breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Flawless Complexion is tinted, but once you rub it in there&#x27;s no evidence that the tint was ever there!  </li>
            <li>I have tried the Fallen Cotz Flawless Complexion moisturizer and</li>
            <li>It is not oily or greasy and the sun-screen protection is SPF 50 which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Best product I have ever used!</li>
            <li>At a SPF of 50, it provides excellent coverage.  </li>
            <li>Best thing of all is there is no greasy feeling at all!</li>
            <li>Fallene Cotz Flawless Complexion added a bit of tint to the mix and doesn&#x27;t overly effect the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It would be ideal in a pump, so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to wash my tinted fingerprints from the tube every morning!</li>
            <li>but it does a great job as a sunscreen, while helping to moisturize your skin.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t GREAT, but they&#x27;re OK.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Make a great gift.</li>
            <li>did not smell anything, which was great, because I don’t like scented lotions either.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen provides great protection, but it makes my skin too shiny or greasy looking.</li>
            <li>The moment it touched my face, i fell in love with it!!</li>
            <li>have fair skin and use some form of sunscreen every day.  </li>
            <li>For a Spf 50 this product was surprisingly lightweight.</li>
            <li>I know there are folks who need super-powered sunscreen, and someone as fair as me would qualify.</li>
            <li>it has been a really good option.  </li>
            <li>Good sun protection with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>50 SPF is really good.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen provides good protection and is suited for activities wear you need sunscreen but don&#x27;t want it to show.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to give Cotz Flawless Complexion</li>
            <li>I have had a very positive experience using Cotz Flawless Complexion SPF 50 by Fallene.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somehow magically controlling my oil and this is a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells nicely.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely too.  </li>
            <li>I head out to the community pool every day of the summer looking shiny and kind of purple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to get a tad bit of coverage and know that my skin is well protected.</li>
            <li>I was waiting to see a color choice, or something that would replicate a chart of some kind to match a skin tone.</li>
            <li>But I honestly think the pros outweigh the cons with this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because otherwise this sunscreen is near perfect.</li>
            <li>So far, excellent!  </li>
            <li>I love that it is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor of any kind.  </li>
            <li>But if I&#x27;m happy enough to go without makeup, this is a good</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll finish up my bottle for sure while looking for The One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did not leave my face feeling oily as many sunscreens do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>this heavy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way too waxy for me, and there are better priced substitutes out there.</li>
            <li>I don’t need that much protection during the winter, but it will be great during the spring and summer months.</li>
            <li>I love this Fallene product.</li>
            <li>she was using the Neutrogena, SPF 15 + moisturizer, she is glad that she now does not have to put on foundation +</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>, I also needed to apply a sunscreen stick (SPF50) on top of it.  </li>
            <li>Container mentions this is safe for children over 6 months and that it should be reapplied after 2 hours or after swimming.  </li>
            <li>For more perfected days, I do have to use a concealer or foundation on top to get an even skin</li>
            <li>I have since become so pleased with it that I will sometimes just brush  mineral powder over it  and forego the foundation altogether.</li>
            <li>The lotion is very easy to apply and goes on light.</li>
            <li>These skin colored products are OK for covering up light blemishes or lightening up your skin tone.  </li>
            <li>but since the primary purpose is sun protection, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I have used other Cotz products and thought this might be a time saver since it is called Flawless Complexion and is tinted.</li>
            <li>to.&lt;br /&gt;The application feels smooth and product isn&#x27;t too greasy -- the feeling is comfortable rather than sitting on top of skin.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen is beige in color and goes on easily with no running, smudging or oil residue.  </li>
            <li>They blend easily with a sponge.  </li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t that strong either.</li>
            <li>In fact, the Cotz is perfect for someone with a good complexion looking for sheer coverage (with only a hint of color).  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen is quite light and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>With an SPF of 50 and a formula without parabens, it&#x27;s an easy choice for sun protection for face and a great size tube to pack for next vacation.</li>
            <li>But, a light coating will help brighten up pink-ish areas of your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is a light moisturizer with a light tint to it.</li>
            <li>This is really light.  </li>
            <li>Fallene solves this problem with protecting your skin with an SPF 50 and also providing a light foundation for your skin.</li>
            <li>With 50 SPF and 20% titanium dioxide as a main ingredient, this is a really nice, tinted sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cause any allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with this new sunscreen and highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li>However, and to my pleasure, it actually gave my skin a sun kissed glow which I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased about!</li>
            <li>With my light skin, I use an SPF 50 sunscreen daily from spring to fall, so I&#x27;d love to extend that kind of coverage to the face.</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when they mentioned in the product that this is tinted.</li>
            <li>I burn easily and most sunblocks of an effective rating make my skin feel either greasy or incredibly dry.  </li>
            <li>It is a good option for daily protection from sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, since I spend so much money and energy trying to keep my face from aging, it occurred to me that I should pay more attention to what separates me from those aging rays.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The tinting is also very light; it will give you a very natural look.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product - as I had an opportunity over a long weekend including a day at the pool, day at the beach, and day at the zoo, to put it through a good test.  </li>
            <li>after the first use!</li>
            <li>Use this only for when you are spending the day out in the sun and you will love it!</li>
            <li>I discovered Cotz from a sample and found their sun protection products intriguing.  </li>
            <li>After many trips to the dermatologist to take care of all my sun damage (I&#x27;m from the baby oil and iodine times before Coppertone), it&#x27;s a pleasure to find a spf 50 - and the added benefit is the soft tint.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it, but doesn&#x27;t do wonders for my self esteem.</li>
            <li>whether or not the zinc oxide staying on the surface does not prevent those ingredients from being absorbed by the skin.  </li>
            <li>Right after I put it on</li>
            <li>Even if I treated the fabric right away, the stain remained.</li>
            <li>Although it has not been tried in prolonged sun,it has an SPF of 50 and certainly should offer adequate protection.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>This is a lot better than that white paste-like stuff</li>
            <li>I first apply the Cotz, then I apply my primer over it.  </li>
            <li>But Cotz does provide excellent protection, especially for those times you are unexpectedly caught out in the sun for longer than expected.</li>
            <li>(I never know which to apply first).</li>
            <li>COTz is a mineral product and reminded me at first try of BB cream.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly to my combination skin and sinks right in, leaving a lightly luminous, but not at all greasy/zinc look.</li>
            <li>Though, the sunscreen is physical (20 % safe zinc oxide deflecting or blocking the sun&#x27;s rays), and not chemical (absorbing the sun&#x27;s rays), it is also unsophisticated like the plaster on wall.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that, if I am spending the day outside (as I do very often in the Florida sun with golf, tennis and just being outdoors) I do not need to use a foundation and layer it with sunscreen</li>
            <li>difference is pretty slight, but it&#x27;s effective.  </li>
            <li>My experience with this product has been totally positive.</li>
            <li>*½ Cotz Flawless Complexion SPF 50 is not only a sunscreen, but also provides complexion protection against blemishes and cover-up thanks to its light tint, which - unfortunately - also stains.  </li>
            <li>The small amount of shine from the reflective materials in the sunscreen combined with the light tint make my face look better.</li>
            <li>While I maintained a rosy glow from the tint, my skin was totally protected from the strong sun&#x27;s rays.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will use it every single day this summer.</li>
            <li>I liked the feel of this product to start but couldn&#x27;t really give a good test as my skin, which is already very sensitive is worse with my current pregnancy and it started causing my skin to be irritated.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t need much of this to use on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a quest for years to find my Holy Grail of sunscreens, and really wanted this one to be The One.</li>
            <li>Living in an area where there is sun over 300 days a year, one really needs to take care of the exposed areas.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle on my skin, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and lasts for longer than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>I only put light things on my face because I just don’t like the feeling of stuff all over my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Cotz since 2012, and really like it.  </li>
            <li>I personally (until I get a tan) need more coverage/color than this offers, which is why I apply tinted primer over it.  </li>
            <li>I ave used other Cotz products with better results - no breaking out and no shiny skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a complete loss, however because shiny is far better than burnt or cancerous</li>
            <li>The 50 spf (the only number I use) is well hidden in a pleasant fruity aroma and the moisturizer made my skin feel so soft  </li>
            <li>It basically is a light tint, used for a minimal foundation for your face, but really does the trick and adapts to all tones.</li>
            <li>Well, short of saying I am pleased too since I now do not have to wait too long for her to get ready to get out of the house.</li>
            <li>This has a slight foundation tint which I was first a little hesitant to try out in the middle of winter since I am a redhead with very fair skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this healthier sunscreen for all skin types.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and because it is lightly tinted it gives a nice kiss of subtle colour to my very pale face.</li>
            <li>As others mentioned,, it does tend to be a little greasy (as do many sunscreen products), which is why I rated this 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Well my skin is normal and not at all sensitive!!&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>Though, the sunscreen is not chemical, the rest is very much, as containing 25 ingredients listed above.  </li>
            <li>This is a more makeup friendly product than most sunscreen specific products I have tried,  Only slight negative: it comes in a tube.</li>
            <li>I loved the ingredients, and the tint was nice to avoid white cast, but in order to keep down the shine, I had to use far less product than recommended which would give me far less protection than advertised.</li>
            <li>Maybe its power as a sunscreen impresses some people but to me, the controversy surrounding how high a sunscreen should be rated is not about the number (as in Spf 50) but in the consumers awareness of whether or not they&#x27;re getting it on adequately all over their face, plus reapplying, still aiming for the shade and using other protections (hats, etc.)</li>
            <li>I like that the product is tinted so I can spot areas where I missed coverage before it dries clear.  </li>
            <li>and I have fairly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, prone to rosacea and irritation pimples.</li>
            <li>It made me learn just because it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>I tried it out on t-shirt material and an old swimsuit.</li>
            <li>The tinted formula disappears much like the white formula disappears into the skin.</li>
            <li>price range is similar to what I have been using in natural sun care, since it can be a bit pricier to avoid chemicals, but I feel it&#x27;s worth it since I use it daily, winter and summer.</li>
            <li>It had substance without being greasy and blended well with my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li>This suncreen is not only heavy but made my face look shiny and greasy to the point where my pores stood out even more.</li>
            <li>It offers light coverage if you&#x27;re pale, and it&#x27;s not noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have oily, acne-prone type skin, so I was looking for a physical suncreen that had mainly zinc in thinking I wouldn&#x27;t breakout.</li>
            <li>when I know I&#x27;ll be outside, I use a designated sunscreen with high SPF.  </li>
            <li>My usual foundation and mineral powder went over it smoothly and did not appear any  heavier or caked at all.</li>
            <li>To have both in one application is especially important for those who do not want deal with multiple creams for convenience or appearance not to be too feminine, such as less confident young male athletes in the environments enhancing blemishes, such as cold weather during winter sports, and sunny weather during summer sports.  </li>
            <li>have long wished for a facial sunscreen that has a higher than an SPF 15 coverage.</li>
            <li>I spent about half an hour outside wearing the sunscreen and most of the time I was in the shade.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it daily because of having such a high SPF, but at times when I know my face is going to have prolonged sun exposure</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover up red skin or dark blemishes, but for lightening up slight skin discolorations, it works OK.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a higher SPF than I have had in my previous Cotz, so I do appreciate that.</li>
            <li>30 sdf can be perfectly effective when used properly, in fact sdf potency has been decreased in products in recent years as proper understanding/education of sun screen products has gone up.</li>
            <li>Zinc based formulas tend to leave an unpleasant white cast/mask on skin and so the added tint to this facial sunscreen is a welcome attribute.  </li>
            <li>the best sunscreen i ever used, wish it was a little less expensive though.</li>
            <li>This is a good little cream to use on your face and get some serious sun protect (SPF 50!)  </li>
            <li>When first applied, it stings for about thirty seconds, and there is a little bit of a flush.</li>
            <li>Very much a time-saver especially when on weekends when we have a little on just clamoring to get out of the house and go out.</li>
            <li>I did notice, however, when I was out in the sun for longer than 2 hours (or if the sun was really beating down on me)</li>
            <li>Its tinted just the right amount, not at all greasy, does not leave white residue, spreads evenly, takes a few moments only to apply it and without any efforts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and the tint doesn&#x27;t look too heavy or dark.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Scots auburn with very pale, oily, mostly unlined, thicker, freckled, rosacea-prone skin,and most chemical sunscreens are a living hell, because I react so badly.  </li>

            <li> The lotion is very easy to apply and goes on light.</li>
            <li> These skin colored products are OK for covering up light blemishes or lightening up your skin tone.  </li>
            <li> but since the primary purpose is sun protection, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I have used other Cotz products and thought this might be a time saver since it is called Flawless Complexion and is tinted.</li>
            <li> to.&lt;br /&gt;The application feels smooth and product isn&#x27;t too greasy -- the feeling is comfortable rather than sitting on top of skin.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen is beige in color and goes on easily with no running, smudging or oil residue.  </li>
            <li> They blend easily with a sponge.  </li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t that strong either.</li>
            <li> In fact, the Cotz is perfect for someone with a good complexion looking for sheer coverage (with only a hint of color).  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen is quite light and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> With an SPF of 50 and a formula without parabens, it&#x27;s an easy choice for sun protection for face and a great size tube to pack for next vacation.</li>
            <li> But, a light coating will help brighten up pink-ish areas of your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is a light moisturizer with a light tint to it.</li>
            <li> This is really light.  </li>
            <li> Fallene solves this problem with protecting your skin with an SPF 50 and also providing a light foundation for your skin.</li>
            <li> With 50 SPF and 20% titanium dioxide as a main ingredient, this is a really nice, tinted sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cause any allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this new sunscreen and highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> However, and to my pleasure, it actually gave my skin a sun kissed glow which I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased about!</li>
            <li> With my light skin, I use an SPF 50 sunscreen daily from spring to fall, so I&#x27;d love to extend that kind of coverage to the face.</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when they mentioned in the product that this is tinted.</li>
            <li> I burn easily and most sunblocks of an effective rating make my skin feel either greasy or incredibly dry.  </li>
            <li> It is a good option for daily protection from sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, since I spend so much money and energy trying to keep my face from aging, it occurred to me that I should pay more attention to what separates me from those aging rays.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The tinting is also very light; it will give you a very natural look.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product - as I had an opportunity over a long weekend including a day at the pool, day at the beach, and day at the zoo, to put it through a good test.  </li>
            <li> after the first use!</li>
            <li> Use this only for when you are spending the day out in the sun and you will love it!</li>
            <li> I discovered Cotz from a sample and found their sun protection products intriguing.  </li>
            <li> After many trips to the dermatologist to take care of all my sun damage (I&#x27;m from the baby oil and iodine times before Coppertone), it&#x27;s a pleasure to find a spf 50 - and the added benefit is the soft tint.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it, but doesn&#x27;t do wonders for my self esteem.</li>
            <li> whether or not the zinc oxide staying on the surface does not prevent those ingredients from being absorbed by the skin.  </li>
            <li> Right after I put it on</li>
            <li> Even if I treated the fabric right away, the stain remained.</li>
            <li> Although it has not been tried in prolonged sun,it has an SPF of 50 and certainly should offer adequate protection.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> This is a lot better than that white paste-like stuff</li>
            <li> I first apply the Cotz, then I apply my primer over it.  </li>
            <li> But Cotz does provide excellent protection, especially for those times you are unexpectedly caught out in the sun for longer than expected.</li>
            <li> (I never know which to apply first).</li>
            <li> COTz is a mineral product and reminded me at first try of BB cream.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly to my combination skin and sinks right in, leaving a lightly luminous, but not at all greasy/zinc look.</li>
            <li> Though, the sunscreen is physical (20 % safe zinc oxide deflecting or blocking the sun&#x27;s rays), and not chemical (absorbing the sun&#x27;s rays), it is also unsophisticated like the plaster on wall.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that, if I am spending the day outside (as I do very often in the Florida sun with golf, tennis and just being outdoors) I do not need to use a foundation and layer it with sunscreen</li>
            <li> difference is pretty slight, but it&#x27;s effective.  </li>
            <li> My experience with this product has been totally positive.</li>
            <li> *½ Cotz Flawless Complexion SPF 50 is not only a sunscreen, but also provides complexion protection against blemishes and cover-up thanks to its light tint, which - unfortunately - also stains.  </li>
            <li> The small amount of shine from the reflective materials in the sunscreen combined with the light tint make my face look better.</li>
            <li> While I maintained a rosy glow from the tint, my skin was totally protected from the strong sun&#x27;s rays.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will use it every single day this summer.</li>
            <li> I liked the feel of this product to start but couldn&#x27;t really give a good test as my skin, which is already very sensitive is worse with my current pregnancy and it started causing my skin to be irritated.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t need much of this to use on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a quest for years to find my Holy Grail of sunscreens, and really wanted this one to be The One.</li>
            <li> Living in an area where there is sun over 300 days a year, one really needs to take care of the exposed areas.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle on my skin, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and lasts for longer than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I only put light things on my face because I just don’t like the feeling of stuff all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Cotz since 2012, and really like it.  </li>
            <li> I personally (until I get a tan) need more coverage/color than this offers, which is why I apply tinted primer over it.  </li>
            <li> I ave used other Cotz products with better results - no breaking out and no shiny skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a complete loss, however because shiny is far better than burnt or cancerous</li>
            <li> The 50 spf (the only number I use) is well hidden in a pleasant fruity aroma and the moisturizer made my skin feel so soft  </li>
            <li> It basically is a light tint, used for a minimal foundation for your face, but really does the trick and adapts to all tones.</li>
            <li> Well, short of saying I am pleased too since I now do not have to wait too long for her to get ready to get out of the house.</li>
            <li> This has a slight foundation tint which I was first a little hesitant to try out in the middle of winter since I am a redhead with very fair skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this healthier sunscreen for all skin types.</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly and because it is lightly tinted it gives a nice kiss of subtle colour to my very pale face.</li>
            <li> As others mentioned,, it does tend to be a little greasy (as do many sunscreen products), which is why I rated this 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Well my skin is normal and not at all sensitive!!&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> Though, the sunscreen is not chemical, the rest is very much, as containing 25 ingredients listed above.  </li>
            <li> This is a more makeup friendly product than most sunscreen specific products I have tried,  Only slight negative: it comes in a tube.</li>
            <li> I loved the ingredients, and the tint was nice to avoid white cast, but in order to keep down the shine, I had to use far less product than recommended which would give me far less protection than advertised.</li>
            <li> Maybe its power as a sunscreen impresses some people but to me, the controversy surrounding how high a sunscreen should be rated is not about the number (as in Spf 50) but in the consumers awareness of whether or not they&#x27;re getting it on adequately all over their face, plus reapplying, still aiming for the shade and using other protections (hats, etc.)</li>
            <li> I like that the product is tinted so I can spot areas where I missed coverage before it dries clear.  </li>
            <li> and I have fairly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin, prone to rosacea and irritation pimples.</li>
            <li> It made me learn just because it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> I tried it out on t-shirt material and an old swimsuit.</li>
            <li> The tinted formula disappears much like the white formula disappears into the skin.</li>
            <li> price range is similar to what I have been using in natural sun care, since it can be a bit pricier to avoid chemicals, but I feel it&#x27;s worth it since I use it daily, winter and summer.</li>
            <li> It had substance without being greasy and blended well with my natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> This suncreen is not only heavy but made my face look shiny and greasy to the point where my pores stood out even more.</li>
            <li> It offers light coverage if you&#x27;re pale, and it&#x27;s not noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone type skin, so I was looking for a physical suncreen that had mainly zinc in thinking I wouldn&#x27;t breakout.</li>
            <li> when I know I&#x27;ll be outside, I use a designated sunscreen with high SPF.  </li>
            <li> My usual foundation and mineral powder went over it smoothly and did not appear any  heavier or caked at all.</li>
            <li> To have both in one application is especially important for those who do not want deal with multiple creams for convenience or appearance not to be too feminine, such as less confident young male athletes in the environments enhancing blemishes, such as cold weather during winter sports, and sunny weather during summer sports.  </li>
            <li> have long wished for a facial sunscreen that has a higher than an SPF 15 coverage.</li>
            <li> I spent about half an hour outside wearing the sunscreen and most of the time I was in the shade.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it daily because of having such a high SPF, but at times when I know my face is going to have prolonged sun exposure</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover up red skin or dark blemishes, but for lightening up slight skin discolorations, it works OK.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a higher SPF than I have had in my previous Cotz, so I do appreciate that.</li>
            <li> 30 sdf can be perfectly effective when used properly, in fact sdf potency has been decreased in products in recent years as proper understanding/education of sun screen products has gone up.</li>
            <li> Zinc based formulas tend to leave an unpleasant white cast/mask on skin and so the added tint to this facial sunscreen is a welcome attribute.  </li>
            <li> the best sunscreen i ever used, wish it was a little less expensive though.</li>
            <li> This is a good little cream to use on your face and get some serious sun protect (SPF 50!)  </li>
            <li> When first applied, it stings for about thirty seconds, and there is a little bit of a flush.</li>
            <li> Very much a time-saver especially when on weekends when we have a little on just clamoring to get out of the house and go out.</li>
            <li> I did notice, however, when I was out in the sun for longer than 2 hours (or if the sun was really beating down on me)</li>
            <li> Its tinted just the right amount, not at all greasy, does not leave white residue, spreads evenly, takes a few moments only to apply it and without any efforts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and the tint doesn&#x27;t look too heavy or dark.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Scots auburn with very pale, oily, mostly unlined, thicker, freckled, rosacea-prone skin,and most chemical sunscreens are a living hell, because I react so badly.  </li>
            <li> and I have had no skin irritation including the absence of any breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I live in Southern California where sunscreen on your face is a must, every day, all year round.  </li>
            <li> Most sunscreen in too dry and irritating to use without lotion underneath, but not this one!</li>
            <li> In other words, mixing plaster-like zinc oxide with chemicals to be absorbed by the skin seems a bit contradictory at least on 1st glance.</li>
            <li> I finish it off with a matte face powder and it is fine for casual days.</li>
            <li> I am going back to Eucerin Redness relief, which feels more oily, but does not make me red and painful.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but it appears like it hides some minor imperfections in my skin.</li>
            <li> It covers my face and neck evenly without leaving my skin dry and wrinkly looking.</li>
            <li> It is sheer and slightly tinted.  </li>
            <li> The lotion also contains tiny granule particulars that you can feel so it&#x27;s not a smooth application.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a pretty nice color, it matched the circles under my eyes but not my pale, freckled natural skin, I looked like one of the 80&#x27;s covergirl wannabe&#x27;s who wear peach highlighter on their cheekbones, it was a bad, bad look for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;PS, if you are very, very pale, the tint may actually be *darker* than your skin which could be a plus or minus depending on you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so sheer that it seems pointless to me.</li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient in this sunscreen is Zinc Oxide (20%).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product comes in a lighter shade, if it  does I&#x27;d need at least two shades lighter, possibly three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then, it settles down and you don&#x27;t notice you&#x27;re wearing it.</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy, but not so much that it&#x27;s uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my arm where I could see a slight dewiness but</li>
            <li> Also it smells super bad, like Lady Mitchum deodorant, so if you don&#x27;t mind your face smelling like an armpit, go for it.</li>
            <li> So, yah my face has a little redness here and there.  </li>
            <li> TSo,  I lstill ike the healthier, non-chemical sunscreen, but it&#x27;s a little disappointing because the tint really does not do anything for coverage of existing sun</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you don&#x27;t mind the greasy feel and shiny look.</li>
            <li> The color is really subtle with some slight shimmer, and would be a much less color coverage than say, a tinted moisturizer or BB/CC cream.  </li>
            <li> On workdays, it&#x27;s usually a moisturizer with SPF and on weekends,</li>
            <li> I have heavy duty sunscreens, but they aren&#x27;t as heavy and irritating as Cotz.</li>
            <li> always have a hard time finding sunscreens I like because I have oily skin</li>
            <li> The tint is hardly noticeable, but it did cover a spot on my face.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean anything, I would rather purchase a suncreen that is worked with doctors/dermatologists compared to one that is organic.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why some people rated it poorly, may be did not suit to their skin type.</li>
            <li> I have always resigned myself to the fact that my face will look worse with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It may not correct my complexion, but the maximum SPF will help it from getting worse by protecting my face thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> It did not sting or (even worse) itch as I have had some sunscreens to do.</li>
            <li> If I piled it on, it looked weird, unnatural.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately when using the industry recommended 1/4 tsp of sunscreen for my face, it was greasy and shiny.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen did not irritate my neck area, so I guess I can wear it there, but I am very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The moment it touched my face, i fell in love with it!! Its tinted just the right amount, not at all greasy, does not leave white residue, spreads evenly, takes a few moments only to apply it and without any efforts.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why some people rated it poorly, may be did not suit to their skin type. Well my skin is normal and not at all sensitive!!&lt;br /&gt;Its the best sunscreen i ever used, wish it was a little less expensive though.</li>
            <li> I live in Southern California where sunscreen on your face is a must, every day, all year round.  I have had a very positive experience using Cotz Flawless Complexion SPF 50 by Fallene. It is sheer and slightly tinted.  It goes on evenly and I have had no skin irritation including the absence of any breakouts.  It feels like you are not wearing anything but it does a great job as a sunscreen, while helping to moisturize your skin.  I love that it is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor of any kind.  My experience with this product has been totally positive.</li>
            <li> This is just skin-colored sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve seen this type of thing before.  I used to use Neutrogena&#x27;s version of this ages ago.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy.  With Irish roots.  So, yah my face has a little redness here and there.  I&#x27;m used to it by now, but it used to bother me.  These skin colored products are OK for covering up light blemishes or lightening up your skin tone.  They aren&#x27;t GREAT, but they&#x27;re OK.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t need much of this to use on my cheeks.  If I piled it on, it looked weird, unnatural.  But, a light coating will help brighten up pink-ish areas of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The difference is pretty slight, but it&#x27;s effective.  This isn&#x27;t pancake makeup.  It&#x27;s sunscreen for your skin that&#x27;s supposed to help cover blemishes.  It doesn&#x27;t cover up red skin or dark blemishes, but for lightening up slight skin discolorations, it works OK.</li>
            <li> It took multiple applications to get any sense of foundation/complexion smoother and then I ended up putting some of another brand on to actually do the job. It&#x27;s so sheer that it seems pointless to me. I tried it on my arm where I could see a slight dewiness but still, no coverage. I can&#x27;t imagine a use for this. Maybe its power as a sunscreen impresses some people but to me, the controversy surrounding how high a sunscreen should be rated is not about the number (as in Spf 50) but in the consumers awareness of whether or not they&#x27;re getting it on adequately all over their face, plus reapplying, still aiming for the shade and using other protections (hats, etc.) 30 sdf can be perfectly effective when used properly, in fact sdf potency has been decreased in products in recent years as proper understanding/education of sun screen products has gone up. This is definitely not an item I would use or recommend.</li>
            <li> Cotz Flawless Complexion SPF 50 is a tinted sunscreen that is designed for broad-spectrum protection from the sun without causing breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin and use some form of sunscreen every day.  On workdays, it&#x27;s usually a moisturizer with SPF and on weekends, when I know I&#x27;ll be outside, I use a designated sunscreen with high SPF.  I was excited to give Cotz Flawless Complexion a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient in this sunscreen is Zinc Oxide (20%).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen is not waterproof, so you will need to reapply every 2 hours or after swimming/sweating/towel drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always have a hard time finding sunscreens I like because I have oily skin and I don&#x27;t want a sunscreen that makes my skin shine even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cotz Flawless Complexion is tinted, but once you rub it in there&#x27;s no evidence that the tint was ever there!  For days when my skin isn&#x27;t looking even, I&#x27;d rather use a BB Cream.  But if I&#x27;m happy enough to go without makeup, this is a good option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can feel it on my skin if I touch my face, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  It&#x27;s somehow magically controlling my oil and this is a good thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s clogging my pores or causing break outs.  Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a quest for years to find my Holy Grail of sunscreens, and really wanted this one to be The One. Unfortunately when using the industry recommended 1/4 tsp of sunscreen for my face, it was greasy and shiny. I loved the ingredients, and the tint was nice to avoid white cast, but in order to keep down the shine, I had to use far less product than recommended which would give me far less protection than advertised. It&#x27;s a shame because otherwise this sunscreen is near perfect. It&#x27;s not a complete loss, however because shiny is far better than burnt or cancerous so I&#x27;ll finish up my bottle for sure while looking for The One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, if you are very, very pale, the tint may actually be *darker* than your skin which could be a plus or minus depending on you.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is quite light and easy to apply. It is tinted tan. It smells nicely. It did not leave my face feeling oily as many sunscreens do.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it did not work for my face at all - I have rosacea and I got my face raging red by the next day. I spent about half an hour outside wearing the sunscreen and most of the time I was in the shade. The sunscreen did not irritate my neck area, so I guess I can wear it there, but I am very disappointed. I am going back to Eucerin Redness relief, which feels more oily, but does not make me red and painful.</li>
            <li> So far, excellent!  I like that the product is tinted so I can spot areas where I missed coverage before it dries clear.  It goes on nicely too.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but it appears like it hides some minor imperfections in my skin.</li>
            <li> With 50 SPF and 20% titanium dioxide as a main ingredient, this is a really nice, tinted sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cause any allergic reaction.  I&#x27;m a Scots auburn with very pale, oily, mostly unlined, thicker, freckled, rosacea-prone skin,and most chemical sunscreens are a living hell, because I react so badly.  I love this. I don&#x27;t have a reaction to it, at all, even after several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just tinted enough that it&#x27;s like a BB cream, not a sunscreen.  When first applied, it stings for about thirty seconds, and there is a little bit of a flush. Then, it settles down and you don&#x27;t notice you&#x27;re wearing it. It is a little greasy, but not so much that it&#x27;s uncomfortable. It offers light coverage if you&#x27;re pale, and it&#x27;s not noticeable. I can see wearing this daily. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> For a Spf 50 this product was surprisingly lightweight. I have used Spf 50 sunscreen that felt as though I were applying a mask. But this was not the case with Fallene Cotz. It went on smoothly and because it is lightly tinted it gives a nice kiss of subtle colour to my very pale face. I had no breakout issues with the product and I have fairly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I know there are folks who need super-powered sunscreen, and someone as fair as me would qualify. I have heavy duty sunscreens, but they aren&#x27;t as heavy and irritating as Cotz. As concerned as I am about sun damage, I&#x27;d have to be at the equator to need anything this heavy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Way too waxy for me, and there are better priced substitutes out there. I&#x27;d pass.</li>
            <li> I discovered Cotz from a sample and found their sun protection products intriguing.  Zinc based formulas tend to leave an unpleasant white cast/mask on skin and so the added tint to this facial sunscreen is a welcome attribute.  The color is really subtle with some slight shimmer, and would be a much less color coverage than say, a tinted moisturizer or BB/CC cream.  I have not tried it underneath a foundation as I prefer liquid foundation as my go to.&lt;br /&gt;The application feels smooth and product isn&#x27;t too greasy -- the feeling is comfortable rather than sitting on top of skin.  With an SPF of 50 and a formula without parabens, it&#x27;s an easy choice for sun protection for face and a great size tube to pack for next vacation.</li>
            <li> After many trips to the dermatologist to take care of all my sun damage (I&#x27;m from the baby oil and iodine times before Coppertone), it&#x27;s a pleasure to find a spf 50 - and the added benefit is the soft tint.  This plus a hat is about as covered up as one can get.  I recommend this product - as I had an opportunity over a long weekend including a day at the pool, day at the beach, and day at the zoo, to put it through a good test.  While I maintained a rosy glow from the tint, my skin was totally protected from the strong sun&#x27;s rays.  Bravo!</li>
            <li> This is a good little cream to use on your face and get some serious sun protect (SPF 50!)  I wouldn&#x27;t use it daily because of having such a high SPF, but at times when I know my face is going to have prolonged sun exposure it has been a really good option.  Doesn&#x27;t have a cloying smell, either!</li>
            <li> I have tried the Fallen Cotz Flawless Complexion moisturizer and I like it very much. It is not oily or greasy and the sun-screen protection is SPF 50 which is perfect for me. I don’t need that much protection during the winter, but it will be great during the spring and summer months. It is a light moisturizer with a light tint to it. The tint is hardly noticeable, but it did cover a spot on my face. I like the fact that the ingredients do not contain chemical sunscreens, oils, or fragrances. It is made so that it will not clog pores and that is a plus for me. I highly recommend this healthier sunscreen for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I love this Fallene product. Living in an area where there is sun over 300 days a year, one really needs to take care of the exposed areas. This product is gentle on my skin, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and lasts for longer than a couple of hours. Make a great gift.</li>
            <li> I have always resigned myself to the fact that my face will look worse with sunscreen. I head out to the community pool every day of the summer looking shiny and kind of purple. It&#x27;s worth it, but doesn&#x27;t do wonders for my self esteem. I also have sensitive skin, prone to rosacea and irritation pimples. For me this Cotz tinted sunscreen is a miracle. Most sunscreen in too dry and irritating to use without lotion underneath, but not this one! It covers my face and neck evenly without leaving my skin dry and wrinkly looking. The small amount of shine from the reflective materials in the sunscreen combined with the light tint make my face look better. I love it and will use it every single day this summer.</li>
            <li> Good sun protection with no irritation.  Goes on smoothly and the tint doesn&#x27;t look too heavy or dark.  I tend to have oily skin so this doesn&#x27;t wear all day quite as well as some foundations might but since the primary purpose is sun protection, I&#x27;m quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> This is really light.  I only put light things on my face because I just don’t like the feeling of stuff all over my face.  I will wear big hats in the summer to keep the sun off my face.  This is a lot better than that white paste-like stuff that sort of clumps all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the protection that it gives.  50 SPF is really good.  I can hang out outside for a while with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not smell anything, which was great, because I don’t like scented lotions either.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen from Ulta and returned it in one week. I have oily, acne-prone type skin, so I was looking for a physical suncreen that had mainly zinc in thinking I wouldn&#x27;t breakout. It did make me breakout a bit. This suncreen is not only heavy but made my face look shiny and greasy to the point where my pores stood out even more. Right after I put it on I felt like I needed to wash my face again. The lotion also contains tiny granule particulars that you can feel so it&#x27;s not a smooth application. It made me learn just because it&#x27;s all natural doesn&#x27;t mean anything, I would rather purchase a suncreen that is worked with doctors/dermatologists compared to one that is organic. Don&#x27;t waste your money unless you don&#x27;t mind the greasy feel and shiny look.</li>
            <li> ***½ Cotz Flawless Complexion SPF 50 is not only a sunscreen, but also provides complexion protection against blemishes and cover-up thanks to its light tint, which - unfortunately - also stains.  To have both in one application is especially important for those who do not want deal with multiple creams for convenience or appearance not to be too feminine, such as less confident young male athletes in the environments enhancing blemishes, such as cold weather during winter sports, and sunny weather during summer sports.  Though, the sunscreen is physical (20 % safe zinc oxide deflecting or blocking the sun&#x27;s rays), and not chemical (absorbing the sun&#x27;s rays), it is also unsophisticated like the plaster on wall.  Though, the sunscreen is not chemical, the rest is very much, as containing 25 ingredients listed above.  That raises the question whether or not the zinc oxide staying on the surface does not prevent those ingredients from being absorbed by the skin.  In other words, mixing plaster-like zinc oxide with chemicals to be absorbed by the skin seems a bit contradictory at least on 1st glance.</li>
            <li> My wife loves using this product as it serves as a 3-in-1 sunblock (SPF 50), moisturizer and foundation (tinted cream).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she was using the Neutrogena, SPF 15 + moisturizer, she is glad that she now does not have to put on foundation + make-up when she goes out for short drive out to get groceries. She just slaps this on and out she goes. Very much a time-saver especially when on weekends when we have a little on just clamoring to get out of the house and go out. Well, short of saying I am pleased too since I now do not have to wait too long for her to get ready to get out of the house. :)</li>
            <li> This sunscreen provides good protection and is suited for activities wear you need sunscreen but don&#x27;t want it to show.  The sunscreen is beige in color and goes on easily with no running, smudging or oil residue.  You can&#x27;t even tell it is on.  I think it is well-suited for use on the face, neck and head.  It is a good option for daily protection from sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not water-resistant or suited to use while playing sports and sweating.</li>
            <li> I liked the feel of this product to start but couldn&#x27;t really give a good test as my skin, which is already very sensitive is worse with my current pregnancy and it started causing my skin to be irritated.  I will try again after the baby comes and my hormones have calmed a bit.</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Cotz since 2012, and really like it.  I first apply the Cotz, then I apply my primer over it.  Cotz&#x27;s texture is similar to my primer, [[ASIN:B002DP75R6 Too Faced Cosmetics Primed and Poreless, 1 Ounce]].  They blend easily with a sponge.  In fact, the Cotz is perfect for someone with a good complexion looking for sheer coverage (with only a hint of color).  I personally (until I get a tan) need more coverage/color than this offers, which is why I apply tinted primer over it.  I alway apply Cotz during baseball season, when I&#x27;m outside a lot.  At a SPF of 50, it provides excellent coverage.  I did notice, however, when I was out in the sun for longer than 2 hours (or if the sun was really beating down on me), I also needed to apply a sunscreen stick (SPF50) on top of it.  But Cotz does provide excellent protection, especially for those times you are unexpectedly caught out in the sun for longer than expected.</li>
            <li> This has a slight foundation tint which I was first a little hesitant to try out in the middle of winter since I am a redhead with very fair skin. However, and to my pleasure, it actually gave my skin a sun kissed glow which I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased about! The 50 spf (the only number I use) is well hidden in a pleasant fruity aroma and the moisturizer made my skin feel so soft  after the first use! Best thing of all is there is no greasy feeling at all! Container mentions this is safe for children over 6 months and that it should be reapplied after 2 hours or after swimming.  I am extremely happy with this new sunscreen and highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> The biggest drawback to this sunscreen is that it stains! I tried it out on t-shirt material and an old swimsuit. Even if I treated the fabric right away, the stain remained. For me, this means I can only use this product when I&#x27;m wearing clothes I don&#x27;t care about, hanging around the house. But I care about all my clothes, so I don&#x27;t see how I&#x27;d use this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who want to give it a try anyway, it&#x27;s definitely heavier in feel than the tinted moisturizer I use now, [[ASIN:B00BN7FDPQ BOOTS No.7 SPF 15]]. After using it for several days, though, I didn&#x27;t detect any skin problems because of it. The tinting is also very light; it will give you a very natural look. But it isn&#x27;t enough coverage if you want to improve the look of your skin with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long wished for a facial sunscreen that has a higher than an SPF 15 coverage. With my light skin, I use an SPF 50 sunscreen daily from spring to fall, so I&#x27;d love to extend that kind of coverage to the face. Guess I&#x27;ll have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> I burn easily and most sunblocks of an effective rating make my skin feel either greasy or incredibly dry.  Fallene Cotz Flawless Complexion added a bit of tint to the mix and doesn&#x27;t overly effect the texture of my skin.  It&#x27;s nice to get a tad bit of coverage and know that my skin is well protected.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen provides great protection, but it makes my skin too shiny or greasy looking. I feel that it clogs my pores because I tend to break out after using it. I ave used other Cotz products with better results - no breaking out and no shiny skin.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very easy to apply and goes on light. No greasy feel or anything. Seems to absorb within 10 seconds. The color isn&#x27;t that strong either. This is coming from a person who uses Cetaphil products on a daily basis .</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when they mentioned in the product that this is tinted. I was waiting to see a color choice, or something that would replicate a chart of some kind to match a skin tone. Well, when I received it I know why. It basically is a light tint, used for a minimal foundation for your face, but really does the trick and adapts to all tones. I love the fact that, if I am spending the day outside (as I do very often in the Florida sun with golf, tennis and just being outdoors) I do not need to use a foundation and layer it with sunscreen (I never know which to apply first). Fallene solves this problem with protecting your skin with an SPF 50 and also providing a light foundation for your skin. As others mentioned,, it does tend to be a little greasy (as do many sunscreen products), which is why I rated this 4 instead of 5 stars. But I honestly think the pros outweigh the cons with this product. Use this only for when you are spending the day out in the sun and you will love it!</li>
            <li> I have used other Cotz products and thought this might be a time saver since it is called Flawless Complexion and is tinted. I have to say it is really no different than the regular Cotz sunscreen once it is on. The tinted formula disappears much like the white formula disappears into the skin. TSo,  I lstill ike the healthier, non-chemical sunscreen, but it&#x27;s a little disappointing because the tint really does not do anything for coverage of existing sun spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a higher SPF than I have had in my previous Cotz, so I do appreciate that. It may not correct my complexion, but the maximum SPF will help it from getting worse by protecting my face thoroughly.  It goes on smoothly to my combination skin and sinks right in, leaving a lightly luminous, but not at all greasy/zinc look. I finish it off with a matte face powder and it is fine for casual days. For more perfected days, I do have to use a concealer or foundation on top to get an even skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price range is similar to what I have been using in natural sun care, since it can be a bit pricier to avoid chemicals, but I feel it&#x27;s worth it since I use it daily, winter and summer.</li>
            <li> I am a sunscreen junkie.  I never leave home without it, not even in the winter. So when I saw the description of this product,  I thought it sounded dreamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a pretty nice color, it matched the circles under my eyes but not my pale, freckled natural skin, I looked like one of the 80&#x27;s covergirl wannabe&#x27;s who wear peach highlighter on their cheekbones, it was a bad, bad look for me.  I don&#x27;t know if this product comes in a lighter shade, if it  does I&#x27;d need at least two shades lighter, possibly three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst of all, it gave me a rash.  Also it smells super bad, like Lady Mitchum deodorant, so if you don&#x27;t mind your face smelling like an armpit, go for it.</li>
            <li> Reviewed by my wife, Lynn:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I should wear sunscreen, but too often I have depended on whatever is already included in my foundation or moisturizer. However, since I spend so much money and energy trying to keep my face from aging, it occurred to me that I should pay more attention to what separates me from those aging rays. COTz is a mineral product and reminded me at first try of BB cream. It had substance without being greasy and blended well with my natural skin tone. It did not sting or (even worse) itch as I have had some sunscreens to do. My usual foundation and mineral powder went over it smoothly and did not appear any  heavier or caked at all. I have since become so pleased with it that I will sometimes just brush  mineral powder over it  and forego the foundation altogether. Although it has not been tried in prolonged sun,it has an SPF of 50 and certainly should offer adequate protection. This is a more makeup friendly product than most sunscreen specific products I have tried,  Only slight negative: it comes in a tube. It would be ideal in a pump, so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to wash my tinted fingerprints from the tube every morning!</li>
