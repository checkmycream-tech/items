            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for my face since 2002... it&#x27;s not over drying and clears a lot of discoloration. Seems to prevent bumps, as I only breakout when I&#x27;m stressed, but the rest of the time my face is always clear. This is a staple in my cabinet and I buy in bulk, so I never run out!</li>

            <li> THE ABSOLUTE BEST for my skin! I have tried so many products but this is by far the best. Does not dry my skin skin out, leaves it radiant and smooth. Very affordable for wht it does! Clears dark spots within weeks. My entire family loves it!</li>
            <li> I did not buy the soap from this seller but I&#x27;ve been enjoying it so much I had to leave a review. I had zero expectations when I started using this soap, and believe it&#x27;s too good to be true!  Every time I use this soap I come out feeling like a new person.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.  It leaves my skin feeling refresh and works with my body&#x27;s chemistry.  I&#x27;m one of those people who would have to do a touch up on deodorant around three o&#x27;clock,  but now I come home workout  and I&#x27;m still fine.  This soap is great, I hope they don&#x27;t change the ingredients or try to alter it to keep with potential market demands.  It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
