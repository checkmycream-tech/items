            <li>Like these &amp; they serve my purpose during lash extension application, but they do have some areas of the white tips separating (kind of like some fuzz balls that you can pick off before use.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The head doesn&#x27;t absorb much lip gloss either</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Good for eye makeup, but very absorbent - not good for anything with liquid or anything soft like lipstick or gloss.</li>
            <li>Love these ordered them a few times</li>
            <li>Came quick, product was as expected.</li>

            <li> great for home spa parties</li>
            <li> Came on time... And is not flimsy. It&#x27;s identical to the lip glosses from the drugstore . Doesn&#x27;t fall apart good quality</li>
            <li> Great price and product</li>
            <li> great just what I was looking for</li>

            <li> Came quick, product was as expected. I don&#x27;t use them for makeup though. I&#x27;m a electrical engineer, I use them for cleaning delicate sensors with alcohol</li>

            <li> The applicator head is the same thickness as the wand. So the wand gets more product on it than the applicator head. The head doesn&#x27;t absorb much lip gloss either so I have to use multiple wands to apply lip gloss on one person.</li>
            <li> Love these ordered them a few times</li>
