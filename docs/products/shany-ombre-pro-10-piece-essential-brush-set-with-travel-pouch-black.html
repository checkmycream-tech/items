            <li>I love these brushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to MAC brushes, and I only bought this set for travel, but I have to say I was totally impressed with the quality of these brushes.</li>

            <li>and I am definitely pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>For the price, the quality of these brushed is excellent!</li>
            <li>I am enjoying these.  </li>
            <li>These are great quality for a fraction of the price I normally pay for brushes.</li>
            <li>They are quality and unusual shapes that I haven&#x27;t had before---very nice!</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li>wanted a set with synthetic bristles because they seem to be better hygene-wise and are easily maintained.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Super soft, and the perfect size to fit in a carry on bag or luggage case.</li>
            <li>,i haven&#x27;t seen any hairs fall out,these are better then some high end brushes,and i couldn&#x27;t believe how good the price was</li>
            <li>and it kept the brushes safe and secure.  </li>
            <li>If they were to send a brand new pouch, I&#x27;d be more than happy to give a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I threw out all my other brushes, these are great!</li>
            <li>incredibly easy to use and affordable.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash and hold up after plenty of uses.</li>
            <li>There is no ugly plastic odor, and the bristles are beautiful and soft.</li>
            <li>I will admit, this is my first experience buying make up brushes, but they arrived in a nice leather-like case that makes them look sleek</li>
            <li>I am relatively new at using brushes to apply makeup, so I loved that fact that the brushes are labeled.</li>
            <li>I super like all the brushes in this set!</li>
            <li>The pouch they come in is super cute too.</li>
            <li>The packaging is also nice and very high quality looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve alays used those disposable cosmetic sponges to apply foundation and cheap drugstore brushes for eyeshadow, blush, and powder.  </li>
            <li>Great brushes for travel and daily use.</li>
            <li>Great for personal use!</li>
            <li>the brushes are smooth.</li>
            <li>Got them at a great price during lightning deals and they have totally went beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they are so soft and they apply the makeup really good</li>
            <li>Case is not real leather like another reviewer mentioned, but nice looking and will be good for travel.</li>
            <li>even the one who is a professional make up artist and has all kinds of brushes says she likes these better (and no, she is not just trying to be nice,</li>
            <li>They are so soft and work really well and for the price, definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li>but these have actually became my favorite brushes they blend really nice</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, leather case was much nicer than expected.</li>
            <li>The only thing that wasn&#x27;t great at first was the strong chemical smell but it washed away ass soon as I first washed them!</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I lost it and bought another one.  </li>
            <li>but I did love the brushes so much that I kept it and didn&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li>Great sturdy box soft brushes live them all.</li>
            <li>These are really nice, super soft and the bristles are not shedding.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing set, worth far more than the extremely reasonable price that I paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase a set of brushed that were priced so low, but so happy I did!</li>
            <li>I feel like I got a better finish than the cosmetic wedges I normally use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much less...probably about 1/3 of what I normally use.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable!!</li>
            <li>They are great quality and she uses them everyday.  </li>
            <li>So worth it.</li>
            <li>Def worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth having them one.</li>
            <li>18 year old daughter just saw them and fell in love too.</li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>I love the quality of these brushes, they&#x27;re extremely soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li>The only problem is, now I have to find something as good (or better) for next Christmas!</li>
            <li>The storage box is a nice addition - I used it recently when travelling</li>
            <li>The case is nice and solid, keeping the bristles neat and orderly.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft the brushes are they&#x27;re super soft and easy to hold</li>
            <li>It was originally purchased to replace an Arbonne set that I really loved, but it just wore out after a few YEARS.  </li>
            <li>the brushes pick up the right amount of powder.</li>
            <li>I think I just need more practice in general.  </li>
            <li>I think I just need more practice in general.  </li>
            <li>Right amount of soft and hard and quality is great!</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it&#x27;s a very nice set for someone who&#x27;s just starting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think it&#x27;s a very nice set for someone who&#x27;s just starting out.    </li>
            <li>They are very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>They had a super strong chemical smell and I sent them back for both reasons.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This made me want to try using better quality and different types of brushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy more when they come back in stock..</li>
            <li>The blush brush is also better for buffing than actual blush.</li>
            <li>I was worried the brushes would be cheaply made, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>My make up is much easier to apply!</li>
            <li>We needed a bunch of different ones for some competition makeup and we were able to use almost all of them for her makeup.</li>
            <li>This  brushes are soft but the handle looks cheap</li>
            <li>Having said that, THIS case seems to be better at protecting the actual brush bristles.</li>
            <li>Although they were a little bit smaller than I had originally thought, they work great.</li>
            <li>Extra soft and amazing quality .</li>
            <li>They are super soft, and came it on time!</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find much of a difference between the flat top brush and the angled flat top brush, it is easy to get them mixed up, guess there isn&#x27;t much of an angle to it.</li>
            <li>Last year as a main gift I got them this cute brush set.</li>
            <li>Super soft</li>
            <li>Make sure to wash weekly with baby soap and let completely dry over night .</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft and dense.</li>
            <li>Super soft as well.</li>
            <li>Super soft material and</li>
            <li>They are super soft &amp; I haven&#x27;t had any problems with any bristle fall out.</li>
            <li>Came in time, very soft and worth it.</li>
            <li>I put them in a different container for travel, but do love the brushes, very soft and they carry the makeup well.  </li>
            <li>comes in a nice little case.</li>
            <li>I tried it with blush and it works very well for that.</li>
            <li>I tried it with blush and it works very well for that.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This brush is also quite dense, so be gentle around the eyes.</li>
            <li>High quality brushes...great price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a beginner so with them labeled, it makes it so much easier to know which one to use.  </li>
            <li>Ive never worn much makeup</li>
            <li>and I am very concerned with animal welfare and beauty products.</li>
            <li>I Received my brushes on time they appear to be very sturdy</li>
            <li>But other than that, the brushes are phenomenal.</li>
            <li>This is still a decent set but, having used both, I&#x27;d recommend Real Techniques.  </li>
            <li>This is still a decent set but, having used both, I&#x27;d recommend Real Techniques.  </li>
            <li>Great for beginners brushes are small thought they would be bigger</li>
            <li>The case has not failed me so far</li>
            <li>A few bristles fell out but overall they are good.</li>
            <li>People who aren&#x27;t professionals wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell; however, these brushes&#x27; emblem isn&#x27;t even the same and they are smaller in person.</li>
            <li>They are tight fine bristles which apply the eyeshadow exactly where you want it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Amazingly soft brushes!!</li>
            <li>I thought this very nice case would be quite useful, but I find that the larger brushes are awkward to remove from it unless you place them in it just right.  </li>
            <li>My last case was a fold-out envelope type case that laid open so you could easily see each brush.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are good very soft, but the reason I bought it was for the case and it was poor quality.</li>
            <li>Decided I needed a new set of brushes, and these were just what I needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also new to contouring.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also new to contouring.  </li>
            <li>live the fact that they are also a prime item</li>
            <li>Shany and Real Techniques stood out to me as having quality products for reasonable prices (I actually got this set during one of Amazon&#x27;s Lightning Deals for just under $12.00).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After using this set from November to February, I&#x27;ve noticed that some of the hairs have come loose from the powder brush, which I really haven&#x27;t used very much.  </li>
            <li>After using this set from November to February, I&#x27;ve noticed that some of the hairs have come loose from the powder brush, which I really haven&#x27;t used very much.  </li>
            <li>The top of the bristles are angled, I&#x27;m not sure if that was intentional.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not in love with is that the box shape can make it hard to quickly find the brush you&#x27;re looking for, particularly the smaller ones.  </li>
            <li>The wash easily &amp; have become a staple in my everyday makeup routine.</li>
            <li>foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder brush works pretty well but is not fluffy enough for me.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;The first bush I tried was the flat foundation brush with liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>They look more expensive than they actually are (specially because I got them on sale!)</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical, but bought based on the wonderful reviews.</li>
            <li>These are soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li>It has all the essentials without being overwhelming and confusing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve added several Real Techniques brushes to my collection and prefer them to these.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve added several Real Techniques brushes to my collection and prefer them to these.  </li>
            <li>but I decided to give these a try as my old ones needed replacing.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not bulky they soft, and hold the makeup well</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li>but so far their is no shedding.</li>
            <li>So far the brushes have held up.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised by the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li>They are soft, and get the job done.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much use for the bigger ones.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this set and would purchase from this company in the future.</li>
            <li>The round eyeshadow brush actually works better for concealer.  </li>

            <li>For my purposes, I need a few more than what are offered, so will buy the larger set as well.</li>
            <li>The E12 is a more fluffy version the flat eyeshadow brush.</li>
            <li>The E14 is a flat eyeshadow brush, not very fluffy and came really dense.</li>
            <li>Bought first set as a gift, then later bought a second set for myself.</li>
            <li>However, actual brush heads are on the small side; which could make one use more product.</li>
            <li>The brush bristles are very soft and dense and unlike other comparable sets, there are several small brushes for eyes/eyebrows, which come in handy.</li>
            <li>I mainly use the flat foundation brush and the eyeshadow brush.  </li>

            <li>I really was skeptical about the price,  but as soon as I used them I fell in love with the quality.</li>
            <li>Each brush is labeled clearly for its specific use.</li>
            <li>The blush brush barely puts any product on my face.  </li>

            <li>The F11 is a traditional paddle foundation brush,  still really soft.</li>
            <li>They are even holding up to a three year old occasionally playing with them.&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also the concealer brush is suited for sheer concealer and is not typically shaped.</li>
            <li>I have quite a few different makeup brushes, mainly from high end brands</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on very tight budget, the Real Techniques Travel Essentials set will get you a complete look (foundation, concealer, blush, powder, eyeshadow, and even some contouring) with just three brushes.as expecting; they still leave a lot of blending to do.  </li>

            <li> They are quality and unusual shapes that I haven&#x27;t had before---very nice!</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed!</li>
            <li> wanted a set with synthetic bristles because they seem to be better hygene-wise and are easily maintained.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Super soft, and the perfect size to fit in a carry on bag or luggage case.</li>
            <li> ,i haven&#x27;t seen any hairs fall out,these are better then some high end brushes,and i couldn&#x27;t believe how good the price was</li>
            <li> and it kept the brushes safe and secure.  </li>
            <li> If they were to send a brand new pouch, I&#x27;d be more than happy to give a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I threw out all my other brushes, these are great!</li>
            <li> incredibly easy to use and affordable.</li>
            <li> Easy to wash and hold up after plenty of uses.</li>
            <li> There is no ugly plastic odor, and the bristles are beautiful and soft.</li>
            <li> I will admit, this is my first experience buying make up brushes, but they arrived in a nice leather-like case that makes them look sleek</li>
            <li> I am relatively new at using brushes to apply makeup, so I loved that fact that the brushes are labeled.</li>
            <li> I super like all the brushes in this set!</li>
            <li> The pouch they come in is super cute too.</li>
            <li> The packaging is also nice and very high quality looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve alays used those disposable cosmetic sponges to apply foundation and cheap drugstore brushes for eyeshadow, blush, and powder.  </li>
            <li> Great brushes for travel and daily use.</li>
            <li> Great for personal use!</li>
            <li> the brushes are smooth.</li>
            <li> Got them at a great price during lightning deals and they have totally went beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they are so soft and they apply the makeup really good</li>
            <li> Case is not real leather like another reviewer mentioned, but nice looking and will be good for travel.</li>
            <li> even the one who is a professional make up artist and has all kinds of brushes says she likes these better (and no, she is not just trying to be nice,</li>
            <li> They are so soft and work really well and for the price, definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> but these have actually became my favorite brushes they blend really nice</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, leather case was much nicer than expected.</li>
            <li> The only thing that wasn&#x27;t great at first was the strong chemical smell but it washed away ass soon as I first washed them!</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I lost it and bought another one.  </li>
            <li> but I did love the brushes so much that I kept it and didn&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> Great sturdy box soft brushes live them all.</li>
            <li> These are really nice, super soft and the bristles are not shedding.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing set, worth far more than the extremely reasonable price that I paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase a set of brushed that were priced so low, but so happy I did!</li>
            <li> I feel like I got a better finish than the cosmetic wedges I normally use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much less...probably about 1/3 of what I normally use.  </li>
            <li> Very affordable!!</li>
            <li> They are great quality and she uses them everyday.  </li>
            <li> So worth it.</li>
            <li> Def worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth having them one.</li>
            <li> 18 year old daughter just saw them and fell in love too.</li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of these brushes, they&#x27;re extremely soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li> The only problem is, now I have to find something as good (or better) for next Christmas!</li>
            <li> The storage box is a nice addition - I used it recently when travelling</li>
            <li> The case is nice and solid, keeping the bristles neat and orderly.  </li>
            <li> I love how soft the brushes are they&#x27;re super soft and easy to hold</li>
            <li> It was originally purchased to replace an Arbonne set that I really loved, but it just wore out after a few YEARS.  </li>
            <li> the brushes pick up the right amount of powder.</li>
            <li> I think I just need more practice in general.  </li>
            <li> I think I just need more practice in general.  </li>
            <li> Right amount of soft and hard and quality is great!</li>
            <li> Overall, I think it&#x27;s a very nice set for someone who&#x27;s just starting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> Overall, I think it&#x27;s a very nice set for someone who&#x27;s just starting out.    </li>
            <li> They are very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> They had a super strong chemical smell and I sent them back for both reasons.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This made me want to try using better quality and different types of brushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy more when they come back in stock..</li>
            <li> The blush brush is also better for buffing than actual blush.</li>
            <li> I was worried the brushes would be cheaply made, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> My make up is much easier to apply!</li>
            <li> We needed a bunch of different ones for some competition makeup and we were able to use almost all of them for her makeup.</li>
            <li> This  brushes are soft but the handle looks cheap</li>
            <li> Having said that, THIS case seems to be better at protecting the actual brush bristles.</li>
            <li> Although they were a little bit smaller than I had originally thought, they work great.</li>
            <li> Extra soft and amazing quality .</li>
            <li> They are super soft, and came it on time!</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find much of a difference between the flat top brush and the angled flat top brush, it is easy to get them mixed up, guess there isn&#x27;t much of an angle to it.</li>
            <li> Last year as a main gift I got them this cute brush set.</li>
            <li> Super soft</li>
            <li> Make sure to wash weekly with baby soap and let completely dry over night .</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super soft and dense.</li>
            <li> Super soft as well.</li>
            <li> Super soft material and</li>
            <li> They are super soft &amp; I haven&#x27;t had any problems with any bristle fall out.</li>
            <li> Came in time, very soft and worth it.</li>
            <li> I put them in a different container for travel, but do love the brushes, very soft and they carry the makeup well.  </li>
            <li> comes in a nice little case.</li>
            <li> I tried it with blush and it works very well for that.</li>
            <li> I tried it with blush and it works very well for that.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This brush is also quite dense, so be gentle around the eyes.</li>
            <li> High quality brushes...great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner so with them labeled, it makes it so much easier to know which one to use.  </li>
            <li> Ive never worn much makeup</li>
            <li> and I am very concerned with animal welfare and beauty products.</li>
            <li> I Received my brushes on time they appear to be very sturdy</li>
            <li> But other than that, the brushes are phenomenal.</li>
            <li> This is still a decent set but, having used both, I&#x27;d recommend Real Techniques.  </li>

            <li> Great for beginners brushes are small thought they would be bigger</li>
            <li> The case has not failed me so far</li>
            <li> A few bristles fell out but overall they are good.</li>
            <li> People who aren&#x27;t professionals wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell; however, these brushes&#x27; emblem isn&#x27;t even the same and they are smaller in person.</li>
            <li> They are tight fine bristles which apply the eyeshadow exactly where you want it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Amazingly soft brushes!!</li>
            <li> I thought this very nice case would be quite useful, but I find that the larger brushes are awkward to remove from it unless you place them in it just right.  </li>
            <li> My last case was a fold-out envelope type case that laid open so you could easily see each brush.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are good very soft, but the reason I bought it was for the case and it was poor quality.</li>
            <li> Decided I needed a new set of brushes, and these were just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also new to contouring.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also new to contouring.  </li>
            <li> live the fact that they are also a prime item</li>
            <li> Shany and Real Techniques stood out to me as having quality products for reasonable prices (I actually got this set during one of Amazon&#x27;s Lightning Deals for just under $12.00).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After using this set from November to February, I&#x27;ve noticed that some of the hairs have come loose from the powder brush, which I really haven&#x27;t used very much.  </li>

            <li> The top of the bristles are angled, I&#x27;m not sure if that was intentional.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not in love with is that the box shape can make it hard to quickly find the brush you&#x27;re looking for, particularly the smaller ones.  </li>
            <li> The wash easily &amp; have become a staple in my everyday makeup routine.</li>
            <li> foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder brush works pretty well but is not fluffy enough for me.  </li>
            <li> The powder brush works pretty well but is not fluffy enough for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first bush I tried was the flat foundation brush with liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> They look more expensive than they actually are (specially because I got them on sale!)</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, but bought based on the wonderful reviews.</li>
            <li> These are soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li> It has all the essentials without being overwhelming and confusing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added several Real Techniques brushes to my collection and prefer them to these.  </li>

            <li> but I decided to give these a try as my old ones needed replacing.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re not bulky they soft, and hold the makeup well</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li> but so far their is no shedding.</li>
            <li> So far the brushes have held up.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by the quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li> They are soft, and get the job done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much use for the bigger ones.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this set and would purchase from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> The round eyeshadow brush actually works better for concealer.  </li>
            <li> The round eyeshadow brush actually works better for concealer.  </li>
            <li> For my purposes, I need a few more than what are offered, so will buy the larger set as well.</li>
            <li> The E12 is a more fluffy version the flat eyeshadow brush.</li>
            <li> The E14 is a flat eyeshadow brush, not very fluffy and came really dense.</li>
            <li> Bought first set as a gift, then later bought a second set for myself.</li>
            <li> However, actual brush heads are on the small side; which could make one use more product.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are very soft and dense and unlike other comparable sets, there are several small brushes for eyes/eyebrows, which come in handy.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the flat foundation brush and the eyeshadow brush.  </li>

            <li> Each brush is labeled clearly for its specific use.</li>
            <li> The blush brush barely puts any product on my face.  </li>
            <li> The blush brush barely puts any product on my face.  </li>
            <li> The F11 is a traditional paddle foundation brush,  still really soft.</li>
            <li> They are even holding up to a three year old occasionally playing with them.&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also the concealer brush is suited for sheer concealer and is not typically shaped.</li>
            <li> I have quite a few different makeup brushes, mainly from high end brands</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on very tight budget, the Real Techniques Travel Essentials set will get you a complete look (foundation, concealer, blush, powder, eyeshadow, and even some contouring) with just three brushes.as expecting; they still leave a lot of blending to do.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on very tight budget, the Real Techniques Travel Essentials set will get you a complete look (foundation, concealer, blush, powder, eyeshadow, and even some contouring) with just three brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them multiple times and it takes a bit of blending to get rid of some of the streaks they leave behind with my foundation, but overall, for the price, they are beyond worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite dense and small, so be gentle when using it to add contour color on the eyes.</li>
            <li> I use it for my nose cream contour because of how flat it is.</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes but I initially bought this for the case and I am extremely unhappy about the case.</li>
            <li> You can use it for a thick eyeliner, but its not thin enough for a wing eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Before using them, I washed them all with shampoo and layed them flat to dry.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes i was a little skeptical of the quality of hair since the price is so low</li>
            <li> The case it came in is magnetic, so be careful when traveling because it may open.</li>
            <li> I just washed them with some liquid make-up remover and let them dry out.</li>
            <li> The magnet on the lid popped lose and out of place and now just slides around in side the fabric, and some stiching is coming loose.</li>
            <li> I definitely used less product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve attached photos of what you get: The box contains the black leather-like travel pouch, which has all the brushes (each wrapped in individual plastic sleeves) inside.</li>
            <li> I bought them as a gift and just expected the quality of the company, not a resemblence.</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers mentioned that the brushes would shed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really small for a concealer brush for the face, so I use it for the inner eye highlight color.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have mentioned, the brushes did have a chemical smell when I received them.</li>
            <li> It also allows me to use significantly less product.  </li>
            <li> you use  less powder they grab blush.</li>
            <li> The eye brushes are a little dense, so they need to be used to be softened up.</li>
            <li> So, I was a little uncertain about buying this.  </li>
            <li> Some sets have a crazy  number of brushes, which was tempting, but I ultimately decided to stick with a smaller number to start out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pro makeup artist and needed extras of a few brushes</li>
            <li> The F16 is a round concealer brush.</li>
            <li> I use these everyday and have had them for almost a year</li>
            <li> However, over the course of about 3 weeks of having it, the magnetic seal on the actual brush case is broken..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any trouble with the clumping up.</li>
            <li> The down side is that the smaller brushes are difficult to see, sometimes.  </li>
            <li> Over the past couple of years I started watching makeup reviews and tutorials on You Tube.  </li>
            <li> I use everyday!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically a small Sigma F80.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will be placing an order for a second set.</li>
            <li> This item was not authentic.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fall apart or smell like some of the negative comments on here .</li>
            <li> When I received these there was a very very faint chemical smell, nothing compared to the others I received before.</li>
            <li> if they were bad she would tell me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they smelled awful.</li>

            <li> Bought first set as a gift, then later bought a second set for myself. Thinking of buying a third just in case!</li>
            <li> Decided I needed a new set of brushes, and these were just what I needed. Very nice. No fallout, every brush labeled for use, and a nice case. Would definitely recommend.</li>

            <li> I so love these brushes!! So worth it. Might buy some more again.</li>
            <li> In in love with these brushes . Extra soft and amazing quality . I will be buying more shany brushes</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Love the way they blend.</li>
            <li> These are soft and do not shed. A great set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes on a lightning deal. It was sort of an impulse buy, but I am very happy with them. They are soft and do not loose the hairs. It&#x27;s a very nice set. Def worth the money. No cons here! Great Product</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and smooth. Quality resembles &amp;#34;Autograph&amp;#34; (brand). Worth having them one.</li>
            <li> Really love this set. Great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Shany Ombre 10 piece brush set as a sort of  starter set for myself.  I&#x27;m new to makeup brushes.  I&#x27;ve alays used those disposable cosmetic sponges to apply foundation and cheap drugstore brushes for eyeshadow, blush, and powder.  Over the past couple of years I started watching makeup reviews and tutorials on You Tube.  This made me want to try using better quality and different types of brushes.  Amazon is my go to place to shop for anything, so I checked out all the brands they carry.  Shany and Real Techniques stood out to me as having quality products for reasonable prices (I actually got this set during one of Amazon&#x27;s Lightning Deals for just under $12.00).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a set with synthetic bristles because they seem to be better hygene-wise and are easily maintained.  I liked this set for that reason, plus it came with a nice case.  It has all the essentials without being overwhelming and confusing.  Some sets have a crazy  number of brushes, which was tempting, but I ultimately decided to stick with a smaller number to start out with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is very nice (leather) and has a magnetic closure.  I prefer this case to the roll-up type for space saving purposes.  The down side is that the smaller brushes are difficult to see, sometimes.  The brushes seem to be well-made and have their names printed on them.  Before using them, I washed them all with shampoo and layed them flat to dry.  They held up well during washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first bush I tried was the flat foundation brush with liquid foundation.  I feel like I got a better finish than the cosmetic wedges I normally use.  I definitely used less product.  It&#x27;s amazing how much less...probably about 1/3 of what I normally use.  I do get brush strokes, though, so it will take a bit to get used to.  I also tried the rounded foundation brush, which seems to create fuller coverage.  It also allows me to use significantly less product.  I like both but I&#x27;m not getting the flawless look I was expecting; they still leave a lot of blending to do.  I probably just need more practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for either of the concealer brushes.  They don&#x27;t blend well at all.  The round eyeshadow brush actually works better for concealer.  The blush brush barely puts any product on my face.  I&#x27;ve considered trying to use it for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder brush works pretty well but is not fluffy enough for me.  I tried it with blush and it works very well for that. There&#x27;s also buffed bronzer brush.  I tried it for contouring with so-so results.  I&#x27;m also new to contouring.  I think I just need more practice in general.  Overall, I think it&#x27;s a very nice set for someone who&#x27;s just starting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  After using this set from November to February, I&#x27;ve noticed that some of the hairs have come loose from the powder brush, which I really haven&#x27;t used very much.  I mainly use the flat foundation brush and the eyeshadow brush.  I&#x27;ve added several Real Techniques brushes to my collection and prefer them to these.

            <li> I love these brushes! I have quite a few different makeup brushes, mainly from high end brands but I decided to give these a try as my old ones needed replacing. I am so glad I did! These are great quality for a fraction of the price I normally pay for brushes. Some other reviewers mentioned that the brushes would shed but personally I have not had a problem with that. The set comes with so many great brushes to get so many great looks, and includes a durable case. Definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> Amazing brush set. I&#x27;m a pro makeup artist and needed extras of a few brushes so I picked up this one. Reasonably priced and great quality</li>
            <li> Great brushes for travel and daily use.</li>
            <li> Awsome brushes! I am going to buy another set!</li>
            <li> Very nice!  This made an excellent Christmas present.  Quality is really nice</li>
            <li> bushes seem very&lt;br /&gt; nice good quality</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  The bristles are soft.  There is a brush for every makeup need.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using these for a while and they have held up well.  So glad I bought these!</li>
            <li> I use everyday! Perfect!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, but bought based on the wonderful reviews. I am not disappointed! I threw out all my other brushes, these are great! For my purposes, I need a few more than what are offered, so will buy the larger set as well. Very good quality and can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I like it.</li>
            <li> Great quality! Amazingly dense and does not shade one bit. Comes in a nice sturdy case for traveling or storage which is a bonus. The only thing that wasn&#x27;t great at first was the strong chemical smell but it washed away ass soon as I first washed them! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to MAC brushes, and I only bought this set for travel, but I have to say I was totally impressed with the quality of these brushes. Super soft, and the perfect size to fit in a carry on bag or luggage case. The F15 powder brush is softer than my MAC 129 powder brush. I use the F19 blush brush to buff in a highlighter. It&#x27;s basically a small Sigma F80. The F17 buffed bronzer brush is the same brush, just with an angle. The F11 is a traditional paddle foundation brush,  still really soft. The F13 reminds me of the Kevyn Aucoin foundation brush, its a paddle brush but circular. The eye brushes are a little dense, so they need to be used to be softened up. The E14 is a flat eyeshadow brush, not very fluffy and came really dense. I use it for my nose cream contour because of how flat it is. The top of the bristles are angled, I&#x27;m not sure if that was intentional. The E12 is a more fluffy version the flat eyeshadow brush. It&#x27;s much more soft and is perfect for packing on a lid color. The E13 is a contour brush. It&#x27;s quite dense and small, so be gentle when using it to add contour color on the eyes. The F16 is a round concealer brush. It&#x27;s really small for a concealer brush for the face, so I use it for the inner eye highlight color. I sometimes use it as a lip brush, because its dense and the point is fine and the perfect shape for the lips. It can also be used for adding color under the eye. The B13 is an eyebrow brush. You can use it for a thick eyeliner, but its not thin enough for a wing eyeliner. This brush is also quite dense, so be gentle around the eyes. The case it came in is magnetic, so be careful when traveling because it may open. The case is really elegant and it&#x27;s a padded faux leather.  I really was skeptical about the price,  but as soon as I used them I fell in love with the quality. Totally recommend these, for beginners and professionals.</li>
            <li> I have ordered now 2 sets and gave one as a gift to my to-be daughter-in-law. She was thrilled! They are quality and unusual shapes that I haven&#x27;t had before---very nice! Very affordable!!</li>
            <li> Loved the fact the brushes came with a convenient case. I am relatively new at using brushes to apply makeup, so I loved that fact that the brushes are labeled.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. I like the packaging for camping! Overall my go to brushes</li>
            <li> These are great. Just what I was looking for and do not shed not even if u pull the bristles. smooth flawless finish. Im totally happy</li>
            <li> VERY NICE BRUSHES THEY ARE ALL LABELED FOR USE!! GREAT DEAL!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I&#x27;ve had it for about a week or so. It came in the leather pouch and box. Contents were not compromised and package came on time. I said it before and I&#x27;ll say it again LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! I&#x27;m a beginner when it comes to using brushes and fancy schmancy blending contour whatnot and these brushes PERFORM! Each brush is labeled clearly for its specific use. incredibly easy to use and affordable. The brushes are also very easy to clean. All around AMAZING experience.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes!  They are very reasonably priced. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set,i&#x27;m so pleased i bought it,quality brush at a great price,i love how they have the names on the handles,i use these everyday,they wash wonderfully,i haven&#x27;t seen any hairs fall out,these are better then some high end brushes,and i couldn&#x27;t believe how good the price was I&#x27;m going to buy more when they come back in stock..I would recommend this brush set.</li>
            <li> Came in time, very soft and worth it. I love it.</li>
            <li> Seriously best brushes ever. They&#x27;re not bulky they soft, and hold the makeup well</li>
            <li> wife purchased this set for travel. she loves them. quality is great and its the perfect size for travel as well. comes in a nice little case.</li>
            <li> These are really nice, super soft and the bristles are not shedding.  I&#x27;m no expert, but I think these brushes are quite serviceable!  I would buy them again and would recommend (in my non-pro opinon!).</li>
            <li> Just what I want. I love it</li>
            <li> I super like all the brushes in this set! Great for personal use!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes ! They don&#x27;t fall apart or smell like some of the negative comments on here . This brand is great and the price is basically ten brushes for one ( if you were to get them at sephora or ultra ) over all I&#x27;m very happy with this product . Make sure to wash weekly with baby soap and let completely dry over night .</li>
            <li> Good brush set for the price point. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good quality and good sized brushes but I wouldn&#x27;t use the brushes with what they recommend. Also the concealer brush is suited for sheer concealer and is not typically shaped. The blush brush is also better for buffing than actual blush. The case has not failed me so far</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes as a lightning deal. I had my doubts, but for the price, I thought, what the heck! Well, after two months of use, I&#x27;m impressed! I would buy these again and actually wished I would have gotten them as Christmas gifts. They are similar quality as what you would purchase at Ulta (their brand). Some reviews mentioned the brushes shedding, but mine haven&#x27;t at all. The packaging is also nice and very high quality looking.</li>
            <li> Update, I have had these brushes for over a year now.  They are still in wonderful shape, work great.  I have not had any issues with loosing bristles or any thing.  They are even holding up to a three year old occasionally playing with them.&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;I needed these, they are work great.</li>
            <li> High quality brushes...great price!</li>
            <li> I just received these brushes. The ratings and reviews are spot in! This is an amazing set, worth far more than the extremely reasonable price that I paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 18 year old daughter just saw them and fell in love too. Needless to say, I will be placing an order for a second set.</li>
            <li> I never knew about this brand until recently. I love that they are cruelty-free and the prices are phenomenal. Love it so far. The brushes are really soft. Softer than ecotools brushes!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!!!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They&#x27;re super soft and dense. I haven&#x27;t washed them yet but so far their is no shedding. The pouch they come in is super cute too. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend of mine, and she loves them! They are perfect. Although they were a little bit smaller than I had originally thought, they work great.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing for the price. I don&#x27;t need a 24 or 36 brush set. This has everything you need in a lovely carrying case for an excellent price.</li>
            <li> So far the brushes have held up. I love them!</li>
            <li> I was really surprised by the quality of these brushes. Would definitely recommend. They are so soft and work really well and for the price, definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> these are actually great brushes. we got a great deal on lightning deal, but nice quality</li>
            <li> Some did break though. Glued back together.</li>
            <li> Good price and good products!</li>
            <li> Arrived right on time; an excellent variety of brushes that work great for all makeup.  I&#x27;m a beginner so with them labeled, it makes it so much easier to know which one to use.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife.  They are great quality and she uses them everyday.  I would purchase them again for her.</li>
            <li> LOVE.  I use these everyday and have had them for almost a year and they are still in great shape.  They are the best makeup brushes I have owned and the price point is amazing</li>
            <li> I was worried the brushes would be cheaply made, but I was pleasantly surprised. They are soft, and get the job done. Easy to wash and hold up after plenty of uses. My set is still in great shape, but I will be re-buying this set when the time comes!</li>
            <li> Great.  Don&#x27;t need to pay more.</li>
            <li> The brushes are good very soft, but the reason I bought it was for the case and it was poor quality. The magnet on the lid popped lose and out of place and now just slides around in side the fabric, and some stiching is coming loose.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet. But the brushes seemed of good quality</li>
            <li> i loveeeee it they are all i need it evry day makeup and travlling and i do travel alot&lt;br /&gt;they are so soft and they apply the makeup really good</li>
            <li> I love how soft the brushes are they&#x27;re super soft and easy to hold</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes. All worked well.</li>
            <li> Very thrilled with this set of brushes. The selection covers all that I would need, and the quality is great. There is no ugly plastic odor, and the bristles are beautiful and soft. The case looks a lot like real leather and works perfect for storage. I would definitely recommend this product. Its a great deal !</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, leather case was much nicer than expected.</li>
            <li> Great for beginners brushes are small thought they would be bigger im giving this to my niece</li>
            <li> nice brushes and a beautiful case for travel.  the brushes are smooth. you use  less powder they grab blush. just likely tap and apply.</li>
            <li> Just what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of these brushes, they&#x27;re extremely soft and do not shed. However, over the course of about 3 weeks of having it, the magnetic seal on the actual brush case is broken.. and I took excellent care of my brushes and its case. That&#x27;s probably the only reason why I wouldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. But other than that, the brushes are phenomenal. If they were to send a brand new pouch, I&#x27;d be more than happy to give a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li> These are very high quality brushes, great deal for the price. Case is not real leather like another reviewer mentioned, but nice looking and will be good for travel.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! I will admit, this is my first experience buying make up brushes, but they arrived in a nice leather-like case that makes them look sleek and I love it!  I&#x27;ve used them multiple times and it takes a bit of blending to get rid of some of the streaks they leave behind with my foundation, but overall, for the price, they are beyond worth it! My make up is much easier to apply!</li>
            <li> I have got many sisters. MANY. So, every Christmas I have to come up with something for each one of them. Last year as a main gift I got them this cute brush set. It was a total hit. They look more expensive than they actually are (specially because I got them on sale!) and they all have commented how well they work... even the one who is a professional make up artist and has all kinds of brushes says she likes these better (and no, she is not just trying to be nice, if they were bad she would tell me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m totally getting a set for myself. The only problem is, now I have to find something as good (or better) for next Christmas!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes i was a little skeptical of the quality of hair since the price is so low but these have actually became my favorite brushes they blend really nice and they do not have any type of odor at all  live the fact that they are also a prime item</li>
            <li> Great make up brush set. Includes a brush for everything. High quality. Great price.</li>
            <li> Ive never worn much makeup but I thought since I splurged on a smashbox pallet I would get some brushes go with it. They are tight fine bristles which apply the eyeshadow exactly where you want it. I find that I only use the smaller brushes. I don&#x27;t have much use for the bigger ones.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Got them at a great price during lightning deals and they have totally went beyond my expectations. None of the bristles have fallen out and I use these daily. Super soft as well.</li>
            <li> I loved the brushes! I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li> They are super soft, and came it on time! A good selection of brushes and I love all Shany brushes!</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft! I&#x27;ve never had any trouble with the clumping up. I like the variety that you get too. We needed a bunch of different ones for some competition makeup and we were able to use almost all of them for her makeup. The case is also great to keep things neat and together since we tend to lose brushes a lot!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes. They are great quality and perfect for people who want to apply makeup well but do not know what each brush does.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes they are working great. I also bought these because they are PETA certified and I am very concerned with animal welfare and beauty products. The case it comes with is also great. I ordered another set before this not knowing it was animal hair and they smelled awful. They had a super strong chemical smell and I sent them back for both reasons. When I received these there was a very very faint chemical smell, nothing compared to the others I received before. So overall great product, great price.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful, high-quality brushes that can meet any make-up application needs.  The storage box is a nice addition - I used it recently when travelling and it kept the brushes safe and secure.  Highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Nice set of quality bushes. However, actual brush heads are on the small side; which could make one use more product. Nonetheless, great brushes.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the brushes. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes for a great price! A few bristles fell out but overall they are good.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes. Right amount of soft and hard and quality is great!</li>
            <li> Super soft material and the brushes pick up the right amount of powder. Love this brush set. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This  brushes are soft but the handle looks cheap</li>
            <li> This item was not authentic. People who aren&#x27;t professionals wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell; however, these brushes&#x27; emblem isn&#x27;t even the same and they are smaller in person. I bought them as a gift and just expected the quality of the company, not a resemblence.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I love it so much that I lost it and bought another one.  It was originally purchased to replace an Arbonne set that I really loved, but it just wore out after a few YEARS.  So, I was a little uncertain about buying this.  However, it is great and I am definitely pleased with it.  The case is nice and solid, keeping the bristles neat and orderly.  The only thing I&#x27;m not in love with is that the box shape can make it hard to quickly find the brush you&#x27;re looking for, particularly the smaller ones.  My last case was a fold-out envelope type case that laid open so you could easily see each brush.  Having said that, THIS case seems to be better at protecting the actual brush bristles.</li>
            <li> For the price, the quality of these brushed is excellent! They are super soft &amp; I haven&#x27;t had any problems with any bristle fall out. The wash easily &amp; have become a staple in my everyday makeup routine.</li>
            <li> GREAT !! I Received my brushes on time they appear to be very sturdy i cnt wait to use them thank you</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes but I initially bought this for the case and I am extremely unhappy about the case. It doesn&#x27;t even stay shut. It&#x27;s like the magnet doesn&#x27;t work. ): but I did love the brushes so much that I kept it and didn&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes as a gift and I was pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;ve attached photos of what you get: The box contains the black leather-like travel pouch, which has all the brushes (each wrapped in individual plastic sleeves) inside. The brushes are &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; length, not travel- sized. The brush bristles are very soft and dense and unlike other comparable sets, there are several small brushes for eyes/eyebrows, which come in handy. There box also contains an insert that tells you what each brush is for, which is nice. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the brushes did have a chemical smell when I received them. I just washed them with some liquid make-up remover and let them dry out. I also left the travel pouch open to air out and the smell is all gone. I&#x27;m really liking this set and would purchase from this company in the future.</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve been much nice if there was a lip brush</li>
            <li> I am enjoying these.  They work well and love the case for when I am traveling!</li>
            <li> these are nice brushes, very good travel size, a bit too small for my every day brushes, but are a very nice addition.  I thought this very nice case would be quite useful, but I find that the larger brushes are awkward to remove from it unless you place them in it just right.  I put them in a different container for travel, but do love the brushes, very soft and they carry the makeup well.  I don&#x27;t find much of a difference between the flat top brush and the angled flat top brush, it is easy to get them mixed up, guess there isn&#x27;t much of an angle to it.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase a set of brushed that were priced so low, but so happy I did! All the brushes are great quality, and in my opinion work as good as MAC brushes do. The case surprisingly comes in handy too when you need to travel</li>
