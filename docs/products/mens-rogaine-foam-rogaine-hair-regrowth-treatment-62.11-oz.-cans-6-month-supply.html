            <li>i lose more ,</li>
            <li>Have been on it for many years and my hair has stopped thinning out.  </li>
            <li>the liquid formula works a lot better</li>
            <li>The results are coming for sure after 3 months.</li>
            <li>Buy more, use more and you will be amazed by the results.</li>
            <li>Because of this, you need to budget a bit more for each year....</li>
            <li>Could cause permanent sexual side</li>
            <li>effects.&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine is safe though.</li>
            <li>and i still have a pretty good head of hair at 68yrs.</li>
            <li>It helps re-growing your hair and it is easy to apply during the day.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly easy to use....</li>
            <li>this product smells pretty nice, and it is easier to apply than tha liquid formula.</li>
            <li>From ordering to delivery, everything went smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I originally started using the liquid rogaine after a year of taking 1mg of finasteride (propecia).  </li>
            <li>Very easy and quick to apply, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 29 year old man with very mild thinning on top of my head and balding in the crown area.  </li>
            <li>I do like the idea of the foam as it is easy to apply and am not annoyed by the fragrance as it disappears rapidly.  </li>
            <li>I apply the foam right after my morning shower and then again around dinner time.</li>
            <li>and I am not even sure if it is actually working</li>
            <li>but it does not work pretty well.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>its like $90/month and the recent dealbreaker was that they found Propecia can cause permanent sexual problems, so I stopped and started Rogaine and hairomega instead.  </li>
            <li>It also dries much faster than the liquid.  </li>
            <li>After 3 months of not using anything, my hair was much thinner than it ever was.  </li>
            <li>The seller really meant what they said about fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>and I really believe that my hair has gotten thicker in the scalp area where I needed it.</li>
            <li>I am very hopeful that in the coming months that it continues to get thicker.</li>
            <li>or it is just I just want so much to see hair growing.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t itch, fast drying  </li>
            <li>I dont really notice anything from this product?</li>
            <li>My husband thinks the foam is much easier to use.</li>
            <li>Propecia worked much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I pretty much forgot how bald I was before, and I stopped taking the finasteride because of slight sexual side effects and inconvenience of getting the prescription...</li>
            <li>I know that the hair loss can increased after the first months but it is just a good signal because it is just the weak hair, then a new stronger hair will grow again.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure how effective others are.</li>
            <li>The finasteride gave me a decent improvement in thickness.  </li>
            <li>I also notice that my hair grows more quickly than it used to, and I have to schedule hair cutting appointments more frequently with her than I did before using this product.</li>
            <li>the texture and color of the new hair may be slightly different than the original hair (I&#x27;m a redhead and the new hair is finer and lighter in color)</li>
            <li>I find that this product helps keep the hair you have but does not regrow new hair.&lt;br /&gt;Find</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the rogaine foam had about the same amount of improvement in the crown area as using the finasteride by itself, maybe a little more.</li>
            <li>As the other reviews point out, the product dries quickly.</li>
            <li>The improvement was noticeable and my bald spot was almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>After about 4 months, I completely stopped using the liquid rogaine.      </li>
            <li>So far the product seems to work because I have not lost anymore hair</li>
            <li>And I like the prodcut so far.</li>
            <li>its the only thing that really works.</li>
            <li>young.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and produces results with just a small investment - $10 to $13 per month.  </li>
            <li>The foam dries quickly, and the slight stiffness it gives the area</li>
            <li>helps cover that pesky bald spot in the back (if you still have a decent amount of hair to cover it).  </li>
            <li>It also keeps your hair from blowing around in a medium or less wind, and kind of spikes it up a little in front.  </li>
            <li>I cannot rate this product too highly or recommend it enough.  </li>
            <li>So far it is working, but maybe not as fast as expected</li>
            <li>and I have high arterial pressure after starting rogaine, before I have never had such a problems, so I stopped using rogaine!</li>
            <li>I was really suprised, got it sooner that I expected tks..</li>
            <li>so it is a little too early to be very optimistic.  </li>

            <li> Now I don´t know for how long I can use it.</li>
            <li> The product is very easy to apply and does not have any bad odors.</li>
            <li> I have been using it as directed but no real results yet.  </li>
            <li> Be careful, not everyone can use this product without any damage for their health!</li>
            <li> I know my brother has tried other stuff</li>
            <li> On other issue, an operator of Amazon promissed me $15.00 in a gift card, which I am still waiting,</li>
            <li> after all, this is a lifelong commitment unless you want to lose the hair by stopping the program!?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after about 5 months, I have not gotten back to the results from when I used the combination of 1 mg finasteride and rogaine twice daily.  </li>
            <li> The advantage to that is it makes you look less bald in pictures.  </li>
            <li> Slowly-but-surely I started getting new hair growth and now have a difficult time seeing my scalp in that area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about it having a scent, even though it&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> After a few months, I noticed my hair was thining out again..</li>
            <li> Waste of money in my case.</li>
            <li> cuz it really dried your scalp out...</li>
            <li> The young lady who has been cutting my hair for the last 10 years or so says that she has never seen my hair as thick as it is now.  </li>
            <li> My advice is to give a chance to rogaine, and be patient, at least 3 months, by the way , from my previuos experience</li>
            <li> I am using rogaine for 5 days, since third day of using I have bad headache</li>
            <li> My wife gives me a bad time about my application technique....patting the foam down through the hair in the affected area (I should be rubbing my belly, too?)</li>
            <li> sorry I am not native.  </li>
            <li> and It was very unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> The liquid caused scalp issues like very bad dandruff.</li>
            <li> FAIL!!!</li>
            <li> I prefer the foam over liquid rogaine because the liquid gave me horrible dandruff and the foam doesn&#x27;t give me any dandruff.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The Rogaine foam is the best product compared with the Rogaine liquid. The liquid caused scalp issues like very bad dandruff. Had to be seen by two different doctors. No problem with the foam kind at all. The problem with the foam is towards the end of using up the can it turns into liquid and the foam is gone, but still works.</li>
            <li> I prefer the foam over liquid rogaine because the liquid gave me horrible dandruff and the foam doesn&#x27;t give me any dandruff.  It also dries much faster than the liquid.  I&#x27;m not crazy about it having a scent, even though it&#x27;s not too bad.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 months with noticeable growth in the crown area.  I&#x27;d estimate about 35% thicker than before.    Here&#x27;s a longer story on my trials:    I&#x27;m a 29 year old man with very mild thinning on top of my head and balding in the crown area.  I originally started using the liquid rogaine after a year of taking 1mg of finasteride (propecia).  The finasteride gave me a decent improvement in thickness.  I continued the finasteride while using the liquid rogaine twice a day.  The improvement was noticeable and my bald spot was almost completely gone.  I pretty much forgot how bald I was before, and I stopped taking the finasteride because of slight sexual side effects and inconvenience of getting the prescription... but I continued the liquid rogaine.      After a few months, I noticed my hair was thining out again.. I was also skipping days occasionally and often only using once a day.  After about 4 months, I completely stopped using the liquid rogaine.      After 3 months of not using anything, my hair was much thinner than it ever was.  So I began using the rogaine foam, and also switched to using Nioxin level 2 shampoo and conditioner.  Unfortunately, after about 5 months, I have not gotten back to the results from when I used the combination of 1 mg finasteride and rogaine twice daily.  I&#x27;d say the rogaine foam had about the same amount of improvement in the crown area as using the finasteride by itself, maybe a little more.</li>
            <li> The seller really meant what they said about fast shipping.  I&#x27;m really pleased with their service.</li>
            <li> Have not see any result after a month of using it my hair still falling and i lose more wen i rub my head after i apply it i lose more ,</li>
            <li> I am using rogaine for 5 days, since third day of using I have bad headache and I have high arterial pressure after starting rogaine, before I have never had such a problems, so I stopped using rogaine! Be careful, not everyone can use this product without any damage for their health!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months and I can see more hairs up there! So I ordered 6 months supply to continue the restoration. Very easy and quick to apply, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my brother. He seems happy with it and we even got another 4 month supply. His doctor said that this is the best product on the market. I am not sure how effective others are. I know my brother has tried other stuff and this is the only one that he is returning to.</li>
            <li> The cans hadn&#x27;t the expiration date... Did you erased them? This product should have it. Now I don´t know for how long I can use it. FAIL!!!</li>
            <li> I rated this product four stars because I have only been using it for about a month. So far the product seems to work because I have not lost anymore hair and I really believe that my hair has gotten thicker in the scalp area where I needed it. I am very hopeful that in the coming months that it continues to get thicker. The product is very easy to apply and does not have any bad odors. If you are considering this product why not give it a try.</li>
            <li> I was really suprised, got it sooner that I expected tks..And I like the prodcut so far.</li>
            <li> Been using this for my hair loss. Have been on it for many years and my hair has stopped thinning out.  I am happy I found this product in time before I lost all my hair.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift so I cannot comment on its quality, etc.</li>
            <li> I got the men&#x27;s rogaine 6 month supply at a great price with quick shipping! My husband hasn&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it works or not but we will be buying from here again if it does</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a month so it is a little too early to be very optimistic.  I do like the idea of the foam as it is easy to apply and am not annoyed by the fragrance as it disappears rapidly.  I have been using it as directed but no real results yet.  I have purchased a 6 month supply so by the end of the period, if there are no results, I will discontinue using this product.</li>
            <li> OK! So far it is working, but maybe not as fast as expected and I am not even sure if it is actually working or it is just I just want so much to see hair growing. Tell you in a couple of months. On other issue, an operator of Amazon promissed me $15.00 in a gift card, which I am still waiting,</li>
            <li> DID NOT WORK AFTER 2 years of use. I ended up shaving my head and look younger.  BALD IS IN!</li>
            <li> It is Good product! I like it. The only issue is the need to use it for a long time to keep results!</li>
            <li> this product smells pretty nice, and it is easier to apply than tha liquid formula. but it does not work pretty well. the liquid formula works a lot better</li>
            <li> its the only thing that really works. great product</li>
            <li> Product was delivered promptly and without any defects.  From ordering to delivery, everything went smoothly.  Good value for the product as it lasts 6 months.  Its easier to apply than the liquid formula and dries almost instantly.</li>
            <li> Only 3 and not 6 month supply</li>
            <li> It is working if you use it every day. It helps re-growing your hair and it is easy to apply during the day. The results are coming for sure after 3 months. Buy more, use more and you will be amazed by the results.</li>
            <li> It really works! I am really happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I have used Rogaine before and It worked, but I stopped using it, so my hair dissapeared. I hope this time this product can do a good job as before.  I stopped using beacuse the topical solution itches a lot and It was very unpleasant.  Now, I &#x27;ve got the rogaine foam and It doesn&#x27;t leave smell, doesn&#x27;t itch, fast drying  and it is easy to use. I am happy with this product. My advice is to give a chance to rogaine, and be patient, at least 3 months, by the way , from my previuos experience I know that the hair loss can increased after the first months but it is just a good signal because it is just the weak hair, then a new stronger hair will grow again.  .... I hope you can understand my english --- sorry I am not native.  Good luck !!</li>
            <li> Waste of money in my case. Didn&#x27;t help. I actually started using Wen Hair Care and it stopped hair loss (Disclaimer: I work for the company owning the license on Wen Hair Care).</li>
            <li> I use this all the time, it helps me keep the hair I already have.  And it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Uso este produto por recomendação do meu dermatologista.&lt;br /&gt;Em conjunto com os demais produtos que utilizo o efeito tem sido positivo.</li>
            <li> Who knows if its working? I dont know? I take it with HairOMega Vitamins. i took Propecia for years but its like $90/month and the recent dealbreaker was that they found Propecia can cause permanent sexual problems, so I stopped and started Rogaine and hairomega instead.  I dont really notice anything from this product? Youll need to start  using head and shoulders tho cuz it really dried your scalp out...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v been using it for years now and i still have a pretty good head of hair at 68yrs. young.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost six months now to address male pattern baldness on the crown of my head. Slowly-but-surely I started getting new hair growth and now have a difficult time seeing my scalp in that area. It&#x27;s fairly easy to use....I apply the foam right after my morning shower and then again around dinner time. As the other reviews point out, the product dries quickly. My wife gives me a bad time about my application technique....patting the foam down through the hair in the affected area (I should be rubbing my belly, too?) All kidding aside, this technique causes me to feel the liquid getting to the scalp where it belongs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just two \\&quot;buyer beware\\&quot; observations: 1) the texture and color of the new hair may be slightly different than the original hair (I&#x27;m a redhead and the new hair is finer and lighter in color); 2) the four cans advertised as a \\&quot;four month supply\\&quot; last only THREE months....three weeks per can (yes, I&#x27;m following their directions to the letter!) Because of this, you need to budget a bit more for each year....after all, this is a lifelong commitment unless you want to lose the hair by stopping the program!?</li>
            <li> I find that this product helps keep the hair you have but does not regrow new hair.&lt;br /&gt;Find the lowest price on the internet and you will not be wasting your money.&lt;br /&gt;The foam product does not cause sores on the head like the liquid seems to do.</li>
            <li> I cannot rate this product too highly or recommend it enough.  It is easy to use and produces results with just a small investment - $10 to $13 per month.  The foam dries quickly, and the slight stiffness it gives the area you put it on helps cover that pesky bald spot in the back (if you still have a decent amount of hair to cover it).  It also keeps your hair from blowing around in a medium or less wind, and kind of spikes it up a little in front.  The advantage to that is it makes you look less bald in pictures.  I have only been using it since last Thanksgiving, and I could see a difference in a couple of months.  The young lady who has been cutting my hair for the last 10 years or so says that she has never seen my hair as thick as it is now.  I also notice that my hair grows more quickly than it used to, and I have to schedule hair cutting appointments more frequently with her than I did before using this product.</li>
            <li> My husband thinks the foam is much easier to use.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband, and he uses it every day!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again when it is over.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to use.  Good results for me.  Disappears in hair.</li>
            <li> Propecia worked much better.&lt;br /&gt;Yet I do not suggest using it.  Could cause permanent sexual side effects.&lt;br /&gt;Rogaine is safe though.</li>
