            <li>Very nice product.  </li>

            <li>Good idea – in theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its that good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a good curling iron that I would recommend.</li>

            <li>i just love these!</li>
            <li>I love this curling wand!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this wand!</li>
            <li>It made perfect large beach waves on both or our hair.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and works perfect every time, and the curls are consistent between uses.</li>
            <li>This curling wand works amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li>But this one...is nice.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a learning curve to using it on your own hair, but once you get it, this wand works</li>
            <li>My daughter liked the fact that there are no crimp marks when using the tool.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get this thing to do much on my own head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wanted one of these curling irons for forever, so when I was offered one in exchange for an honest review I jumped on it.</li>
            <li>She is 12 but managed to learn how to use this on her own hair.  </li>
            <li>The curls are a nice size and leave your hair nice and bouncy with curls.</li>
            <li>For the first time ever, I&#x27;ve been able to whip up awesome curls that lasted!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;This is a great product... works super fast!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is by far the best wand I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>easy use!</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend this to anyone new to wands or the more experienced users looking for the best wand out there.</li>
            <li>but once you do, you&#x27;ll be able to curl your hair so very quickly!  </li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>when it&#x27;s longer I&#x27;ll take this one out again and see if it works any better for me.</li>
            <li>I love the temperature display and the heat settings.  </li>
            <li>because I was able to lock the temperature and it had a swivel</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this wand took longer and more effort.</li>
            <li>really glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li>I found that sectioning and clipping my hair before beginning the curling process made the process faster, easier, and more</li>
            <li>one from Remington is lovely.</li>
            <li>There is a lip at the end of the iron that keeps it from touching any surface, sometimes gets caught in your hair as you unravel the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I should have invested a bit more in a better model.</li>
            <li>Love the included glove to protect your fingers when curling hair around the wand.  </li>
            <li>My wife and daughter love this styling wand.  </li>
            <li>I did have better luck.</li>
            <li>also look into getting a styling tool holder that you can set up on your counter or put on your mirror so that you have a safe place to put it when it&#x27;s out of your hands.</li>
            <li>Perfection :) My friend had this curler</li>
            <li>So glad I could find a deal</li>
            <li>:) Thank you :)</li>
            <li>Love this curling wand.</li>
            <li>While it does protect your fingers from the brunt of the heat, you will not be able to feel your hair at all</li>
            <li>But either way, this is the tool you want to get those lovely Lauren Conrad relaxed waves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received many compliments on my hair since I started using the curling wand.  </li>
            <li>but there is a learning curve if you&#x27;re more used to clamp style curling irons.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use the included glove, so you don&#x27;t burn yourself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;I love this but wish my sister didn&#x27;t hog it</li>
            <li>Hair isn&#x27;t my strong suit, or rather I should say styling my own hair isn&#x27;t my strong suit, so I want something with guaranteed results.  </li>
            <li>I also appreciate the auto shut off, I&#x27;m pretty good at turning my appliances off, but some backup never</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well on my fine hair but works great on my daughters thicker hair.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;Includes heat resistant glove for safe and easy styling</li>
            <li>Her hair is longer but much more fine.</li>
            <li>My early results weren&#x27;t great, partly because it took me a while to get over being unwilling to let my gloved hand even brush the tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really would like to make it work and hope this is something that just takes a good bit of practice before you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t put in the time required to really get good at it.  </li>
            <li>This wand makes easy, wavy curls.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to turn it off.  </li>
            <li>I like the screen, that I can easily tell what temp I have it set on and adjust it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use and it comes with the glove that makes it easy to use</li>
            <li>This is a good wand to start with since it&#x27;s inexpensive and does a decent job.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty good, but nothing really extraordinary.</li>
            <li>should note that this is the first time I’ve tried to use one of those new-fangled curling irons that don’t have the clamp the old-fashioned kind did.</li>
            <li>Hands down this is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it to people with fine to medium hair.</li>
            <li>It is fine, but I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a stay at home mom, and usually only go to great lengths fixing my hair when I&#x27;m going out or having company over, but when I do use my curling iron, I want something easy to use and foolproof.  </li>
            <li>My hair is just a tad longer than shoulder length, and while i was still able to use the iron successfully ( the heat protective glove helped) on the shorter pieces near my face, my hair would just slide right</li>
            <li>Perfect waves with little effort.</li>
            <li>As soon as I learned to use it correctly, I noticed a huge difference in how well my hair holds the curls.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that the taper does give you more natural looking curls.  </li>
            <li>The handle, plastic, and barrel are all well finished and smooth.</li>
            <li>Not only is it inexpensive, but it provides great results.</li>
            <li>This really works well and gives your hair really nice curls.  </li>
            <li>The curls turn out great in only 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Overall great buy.</li>
            <li>, though, it&#x27;s good enough for most people&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>My hair hits right at the top of my shoulders</li>
            <li>Once you learn it, it&#x27;s super easy and works well.</li>
            <li>Digital settings are great and it will get very hot if you want it to.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, if you&#x27;re looking for a &amp;#34;clipless&amp;#34; iron around or under $30, you&#x27;d better off getting a hot tools or infiniti pro and just remove the clip yourself.</li>
            <li>This was my first curling iron that didn&#x27;t have the alligator clasp style, and I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work.</li>
            <li>wrapping the hair around the barrel provides a more natural curl shape and more even heat</li>
            <li>The cord is a bit longer than some other irons, and that&#x27;s always nice when you are working on your own hair in your home bathroom.  </li>
            <li>so using this one was a cinch in terms of wrapping the right amount of hair around the appropriate sections and heat curling the right amount of time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly cumbersome, and does little to make your hair curly.</li>
            <li>Right away I liked that the wand is very lightweight and it heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Heats up really fast and the ONLY curling iron I have used that I get beautiful waves from...</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not really anything about it that stands out among the rest, but it&#x27;s still a really great product.</li>
            <li>It is not often I follow a current fashion trend, but I have loved the ‘mermaid hair’ that you see all over television and magazines these days.</li>
            <li>one is experienced with curling wands, be very careful not to burn hands, scalp, or face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does heat up very quickly, much quicker than my good old Conair, so I will give it that.  </li>
            <li>being said, I am sure it has more to do with &#x27;user error&#x27; than the actual iron</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this curling wand; affordable and it gets results :)</li>
            <li>I have been very impressed with it and would certainly recommend it for ladies like me who rarely have need of a curling tool that just occasionally want an easy way to make them and make them look pretty natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good curling iron though quick to heat up and a long cord</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gets very hot-</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve ever wanted to try a wand for your long hair, this is a good one.</li>
            <li>so the last curl looks just as good as the first one.  </li>
            <li>They said it is easy to use and works very well.  </li>
            <li>It really does make life easy</li>
            <li>I love that the tip doesn&#x27;t get hot and the barrel heats up really fast.  </li>
            <li>and she suggested that with very fine, soft hair it would help to use a heat-activating hold spray, or conversely to try to style hair that has not been freshly washed.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and is exactly what I was needing!</li>
            <li>but it gets too hot!</li>
            <li>This would most likely work the best for people with hair past their shoulders.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t even curl the ends of your hair unless you&#x27;re willing to burn your fingers!  </li>
            <li>It does get hot, but comes with a special glove for protection.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a fabulous product, and I am absolutely smitten.</li>
            <li>And unlike the traditional metal curling irons/wands, these retain heat amazingly well</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering what this product looks like in action, or how to use it, I found this cute girl who does a tutorial with her &amp;#34;christmas gift&amp;#34; Remington wand.</li>
            <li>This wand has digital temperature setting that is a nice feature to have.  </li>
            <li>I own several Remington curling wands.  </li>
            <li>use this mostly to touch up my naturally wavy/curly hair after it&#x27;s been slept on.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I rarely ever use a curling iron in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Regular old curling irons with the clips never worked great for my hair, and I thought this style wouldn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my honest assessment: The barrel on this curling iron is bigger, so</li>
            <li>Remington Ci96x1 Silk Ceramic Wide Styling Wand was a good choice for us.</li>
            <li>I am just very careful while wrapping the hair and make sure to keep my fingers on top of the hair</li>
            <li>I am just very careful while wrapping the hair and make sure to keep my fingers on top of the hair</li>
            <li>controls are right where you hold the wand</li>
            <li>The only reason that I&#x27;m not rating it higher is because there is nothing spectacular about it.</li>
            <li>The results are much better (and more natural) than the smaller cone shapes.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy and curls easy.</li>
            <li>I have waist length, very straight hair</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and/or time with NuMe, Hot Tools, Conair Infiniti Pro, Jose Eber, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was hot, but it just was not curling.  </li>
            <li>well does involve a learning curve, so don&#x27;t give up if you&#x27;re struggling at first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty average.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s definitely a first for</li>
            <li>However, I compared the price with similar devices at Target, and it is a much better price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It will be tricky at first, but you&#x27;ll get the hang of it over time.</li>
            <li>so I know exactly what temp it&#x27;s on, even if I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s the correct one</li>
            <li>so I know exactly what temp it&#x27;s on, even if I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s the correct one</li>
            <li>She has recently become more concerned about her appearance, has discovered boys, and has been wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>but it does get hot</li>
            <li>Also, this heats up FAST!</li>
            <li>i got this for occasional use on my daughters very fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s well worth the $25, but for now I will probably stick with my older iron.  </li>
            <li>This curling iron has varying heat, which is excellent and prevents excess damage to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have complained that they are constantly pushing buttons while curling their hair, and</li>
            <li>I have medium weight hair that is in healthy condition but needs product to have texture and this wand curled my hair quickly, resulting in big soft curls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a really well-made tool and I love the digital display</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a really well-made tool and I love the digital display</li>
            <li>Definitely worth purchasing vs. a high end curler.</li>
            <li>Even with the glove the very end of the wand can get too hot to hold.</li>
            <li>I received this in the &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; 1.5&amp;#34; to 1&amp;#34; wand size and was a little concerned that it would be too large for my current hair length (about an inch or two below the shoulders) but it was perfect and since I plan on growing my hair out again, I&#x27;m glad I won&#x27;t have to purchase a different size later on.  </li>
            <li>easy to use, and comes with a glove (necessary</li>
            <li>If I have more success after practicing further with it, I’ll update my review, but after multiple attempts on several different days, I really can’t rate this wand higher than one star yet.thing that just takes a good bit of practice before you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>The wand is really slick-looking and I love everything about it for curling long hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s certainly a learning curve to creating the curls</li>
            <li>This is my third Remington ceramic styling wand (I keep buying them, my sisters try them, and love them so much that I have to buy a new one).  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re really serious about styling your hair with something like this regularly, and especially if you have thicker hair that doesn&#x27;t respond to heat as fast as fine hair, it&#x27;ll be worth your while to invest more into getting a higher end tool with a slightly better design that can also go to higher</li>
            <li>The main reason being is that it gets too hot.  </li>
            <li>all high temperature curling/styling wands, consistent use/misuse may eventually damage hair.&lt;br /&gt;*Unless</li>
            <li>I am able to quickly curl my entire head and the curls actually last and look better than any other curls.</li>
            <li>It is difficult to see in the picture, but the curling iron has a plastic tip on the end of the barrel, so the very end is safe to touch; a nice feature.</li>
            <li>I initially purchased a HerStyler curling wand, but it felt cheap</li>
            <li>compares to high end heating wands!</li>
            <li>Don’t put too much hair into each wrapped section.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this iron.</li>
            <li>An iron with the clam is much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>did heat up fast and told you the temp.</li>
            <li>Since you have to wrap by hand, you have to get used to gathering up your hair and figuring out how much to use at a time to get the curl you want.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl well with a metal curling iron, but for whatever reason, with this one it did.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Even with the lock I found it super distracting in a way no other curling iron has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only problem I had with the tapered style is that it&#x27;s easy to run out of room on the wand to wrap your hair around it if you take up too much real-estate as you start from the top (largest diameter) down.  </li>
            <li>Pros: gets hot quick and has digital reading.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly - useable in 30 sec, full heat in 1 minute.  </li>
            <li>I really like this one, much better than other cone shaped wands that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It looks like a slightly older model, but it doesn&#x27;t look like much has changed.</li>
            <li>Higher temperature (410) gives you tighter more defined curls, lower temperature (360) gives you that messy wavy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy curling.</li>
            <li>It is well made, easy to use, and quickly creates shiny, long lasting, voluminous curls!</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t necessarily anything special.  </li>
            <li>though it heats up super fast (like seconds), it&#x27;s going to take some time to do all the wrapping, and there&#x27;s definitely a learning curve.</li>
            <li>The wand heats up quickly and is good for long hair because of the extra wide barrel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Manufacturer claimed \\&quot;Silk protein coated ceramic\\&quot; wand supposedly provides more even heat and less damaging to hair.  </li>
            <li>This product claims that it gives you a healthy, effortless, long-lasting curl with less frizz</li>
            <li>and they do produce slightly different looks depending on the design, but what is always the same is the stunning result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For more long lasting and consistent curls, my gal still prefers her professional hair stylist!</li>
            <li>For quite some time I have been using a normal curling iron as a wand, but even on the highest heat setting, it required almost twenty seconds to create a decent curl.</li>
            <li>Indeed, we found when trying to use this on freshly washed hair with no spray that the hair was very slippery on the ceramic and just fell right down to the tip.  </li>
            <li>If I have more success after practicing further with it, I’ll update my review, but after multiple attempts on several different days, I really can’t rate this wand higher than one star yet.</li>
            <li>This is tough to use but creates gorgeous results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;--The cord is a decent length for ease of use if your plug isn&#x27;t right next to your mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair normally curls at 350-390&#x27;F temperature in about 8-10 seconds (the norm).</li>
            <li>useful curling wand for last minute touch ups or on-the-go hair styling.  </li>
            <li>This wand comes with a glove to help keep your hands from burning when using this and that right there threw up a red flag for me.  </li>
            <li>Heats quickly and works well for long hair.</li>
            <li>Instead, these new clamp-less irons come with a heat-resistant glove and lots of warnings.</li>
            <li>I did not have an issue with the heat, but my hair is long and thin and having such a thick top was not the best choice for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every type of curling device out there; hundred dollar rotating curling irons, every kind of hot roller, various overnight curling systems, different sized curling irons, etc, and apparently what I was looking for was sitting in every grocery store hair aisle for less than fifty dollars all along.</li>
            <li>I had long, nearly waist length hair and used this right before I chopped it all off to shoulder length.</li>
            <li>/&gt;--It heats up very quickly, has different heat settings, and has a digital readout of the current temperature.</li>
            <li>I do love the loose curls the wide wand creates.  </li>
            <li>but a little too slippery (smooth) for me.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to curl the very ends of my hair without burning myself, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I recently cut my hair that went down from the middle of my back to a long bob that falls right at my shoulders, so I was super excited to try this wand on my new &#x27;do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Sleek and modern with a digital setting</li>
            <li>Common sense dictates that all curling wands should not be unattended and make sure to unplug after each use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerns:&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Curl stays in for the whole day and my hair is curly when i wake up the next morning.</li>
            <li>The size and shape of the curl is dependent on how much hair you use.&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is so long, I used small sections and the curls came out spiraled and tighter at the bottom than at the top like a natural curl.</li>
            <li>This 1\\&quot;-1/1/2\\&quot; Wide Curling Wand was exactly what she needed to replace her old model Remington styling</li>
            <li>degree F digital salon high heat</li>
            <li>We used in on my very fine hair and my nieces very thick hair.</li>
            <li>and it was exactly what I expected and wanted</li>
            <li>The glove makes handling the hair a bit clumsy, but if you curl big chunks of hair at a time, it&#x27;ll work OK.  </li>
            <li>Also, for the record, this was with hair spray and heat protectant as I would use with any other hot tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used other wands before and never had to use a glove so in my opinion this wand gets too hot.  </li>
            <li>Her hair is pretty long, It falls almost to the bottom of her shoulder blades (mid back).  </li>
            <li>I got my hair cut and colored recently, and have naturally wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li>and I barely had a curl.  </li>
            <li>This makes bigger, natural looking</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to use but worth it!</li>
            <li>Plug it in, press the On/Off button until the display comes on, select heat setting (low, medium, or high according to hair strength, texture, and thickness), let it heat up in 30 seconds, press and hold the \\&quot;-\\&quot; button to lock the temperature, and use the gloved hand to wrap hair around the wand (smaller section for tighter curls; larger section for looser/larger</li>
            <li>On my daughter&#x27;s long hair we&#x27;ve tried every imaginable way to curl her hair, and this is the only tool that gave this particular result.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s long enough to really wrap around the barrel several times.</li>
            <li>It gets very hot and although there is protection for your hand you should be careful so you don&#x27;t burn other parts of your head like your forehead and your ear.  </li>
            <li>Personally, this seems kind of useless -</li>
            <li>I read on the internet that I should put a little styling spray in my hair first</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pointing straight down on the side of my head where I want to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>that is not long enough for this product to be any use.</li>
            <li>If you want tight curls, then buy the one inch but get ready to fight to loosen the curls.</li>
            <li>If you want big loose curls that look natural, then this is definitely the wand for you.  </li>
            <li>My gal has long, luscious, dark brown hair and sometimes likes large wavy curls for a change of style.  </li>

            <li> I love this curling wand!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this wand!</li>
            <li> It made perfect large beach waves on both or our hair.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and works perfect every time, and the curls are consistent between uses.</li>
            <li> This curling wand works amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice product</li>
            <li> But this one...is nice.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a learning curve to using it on your own hair, but once you get it, this wand works</li>
            <li> My daughter liked the fact that there are no crimp marks when using the tool.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get this thing to do much on my own head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted one of these curling irons for forever, so when I was offered one in exchange for an honest review I jumped on it.</li>
            <li> She is 12 but managed to learn how to use this on her own hair.  </li>
            <li> The curls are a nice size and leave your hair nice and bouncy with curls.</li>
            <li> For the first time ever, I&#x27;ve been able to whip up awesome curls that lasted!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;This is a great product... works super fast!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is by far the best wand I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> easy use!</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend this to anyone new to wands or the more experienced users looking for the best wand out there.</li>
            <li> but once you do, you&#x27;ll be able to curl your hair so very quickly!  </li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> when it&#x27;s longer I&#x27;ll take this one out again and see if it works any better for me.</li>
            <li> I love the temperature display and the heat settings.  </li>
            <li> because I was able to lock the temperature and it had a swivel</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this wand took longer and more effort.</li>
            <li> really glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> I found that sectioning and clipping my hair before beginning the curling process made the process faster, easier, and more</li>
            <li> one from Remington is lovely.</li>
            <li> There is a lip at the end of the iron that keeps it from touching any surface, sometimes gets caught in your hair as you unravel the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I should have invested a bit more in a better model.</li>
            <li> Love the included glove to protect your fingers when curling hair around the wand.  </li>
            <li> My wife and daughter love this styling wand.  </li>
            <li> I did have better luck.</li>
            <li> also look into getting a styling tool holder that you can set up on your counter or put on your mirror so that you have a safe place to put it when it&#x27;s out of your hands.</li>
            <li> Perfection :) My friend had this curler</li>
            <li> So glad I could find a deal</li>
            <li> :) Thank you :)</li>
            <li> Love this curling wand.</li>
            <li> While it does protect your fingers from the brunt of the heat, you will not be able to feel your hair at all</li>
            <li> But either way, this is the tool you want to get those lovely Lauren Conrad relaxed waves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received many compliments on my hair since I started using the curling wand.  </li>
            <li> but there is a learning curve if you&#x27;re more used to clamp style curling irons.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use the included glove, so you don&#x27;t burn yourself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;I love this but wish my sister didn&#x27;t hog it</li>
            <li> Hair isn&#x27;t my strong suit, or rather I should say styling my own hair isn&#x27;t my strong suit, so I want something with guaranteed results.  </li>
            <li> I also appreciate the auto shut off, I&#x27;m pretty good at turning my appliances off, but some backup never</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well on my fine hair but works great on my daughters thicker hair.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;Includes heat resistant glove for safe and easy styling</li>
            <li> Her hair is longer but much more fine.</li>
            <li> My early results weren&#x27;t great, partly because it took me a while to get over being unwilling to let my gloved hand even brush the tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really would like to make it work and hope this is something that just takes a good bit of practice before you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t put in the time required to really get good at it.  </li>
            <li> This wand makes easy, wavy curls.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to turn it off.  </li>
            <li> I like the screen, that I can easily tell what temp I have it set on and adjust it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to use and it comes with the glove that makes it easy to use</li>
            <li> This is a good wand to start with since it&#x27;s inexpensive and does a decent job.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty good, but nothing really extraordinary.</li>
            <li> should note that this is the first time I’ve tried to use one of those new-fangled curling irons that don’t have the clamp the old-fashioned kind did.</li>
            <li> Hands down this is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it to people with fine to medium hair.</li>
            <li> It is fine, but I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a stay at home mom, and usually only go to great lengths fixing my hair when I&#x27;m going out or having company over, but when I do use my curling iron, I want something easy to use and foolproof.  </li>
            <li> My hair is just a tad longer than shoulder length, and while i was still able to use the iron successfully ( the heat protective glove helped) on the shorter pieces near my face, my hair would just slide right</li>
            <li> Perfect waves with little effort.</li>
            <li> As soon as I learned to use it correctly, I noticed a huge difference in how well my hair holds the curls.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that the taper does give you more natural looking curls.  </li>
            <li> The handle, plastic, and barrel are all well finished and smooth.</li>
            <li> Not only is it inexpensive, but it provides great results.</li>
            <li> This really works well and gives your hair really nice curls.  </li>
            <li> The curls turn out great in only 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Overall great buy.</li>
            <li> , though, it&#x27;s good enough for most people&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> My hair hits right at the top of my shoulders</li>
            <li> Once you learn it, it&#x27;s super easy and works well.</li>
            <li> Digital settings are great and it will get very hot if you want it to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, if you&#x27;re looking for a &amp;#34;clipless&amp;#34; iron around or under $30, you&#x27;d better off getting a hot tools or infiniti pro and just remove the clip yourself.</li>
            <li> This was my first curling iron that didn&#x27;t have the alligator clasp style, and I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work.</li>
            <li> wrapping the hair around the barrel provides a more natural curl shape and more even heat</li>
            <li> The cord is a bit longer than some other irons, and that&#x27;s always nice when you are working on your own hair in your home bathroom.  </li>
            <li> so using this one was a cinch in terms of wrapping the right amount of hair around the appropriate sections and heat curling the right amount of time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly cumbersome, and does little to make your hair curly.</li>
            <li> Right away I liked that the wand is very lightweight and it heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> Heats up really fast and the ONLY curling iron I have used that I get beautiful waves from...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not really anything about it that stands out among the rest, but it&#x27;s still a really great product.</li>
            <li> It is not often I follow a current fashion trend, but I have loved the ‘mermaid hair’ that you see all over television and magazines these days.</li>
            <li> one is experienced with curling wands, be very careful not to burn hands, scalp, or face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does heat up very quickly, much quicker than my good old Conair, so I will give it that.  </li>
            <li> being said, I am sure it has more to do with &#x27;user error&#x27; than the actual iron</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this curling wand; affordable and it gets results :)</li>
            <li> I have been very impressed with it and would certainly recommend it for ladies like me who rarely have need of a curling tool that just occasionally want an easy way to make them and make them look pretty natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good curling iron though quick to heat up and a long cord</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets very hot-</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve ever wanted to try a wand for your long hair, this is a good one.</li>
            <li> so the last curl looks just as good as the first one.  </li>
            <li> They said it is easy to use and works very well.  </li>
            <li> It really does make life easy</li>
            <li> I love that the tip doesn&#x27;t get hot and the barrel heats up really fast.  </li>
            <li> and she suggested that with very fine, soft hair it would help to use a heat-activating hold spray, or conversely to try to style hair that has not been freshly washed.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is exactly what I was needing!</li>
            <li> but it gets too hot!</li>
            <li> This would most likely work the best for people with hair past their shoulders.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t even curl the ends of your hair unless you&#x27;re willing to burn your fingers!  </li>
            <li> It does get hot, but comes with a special glove for protection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a fabulous product, and I am absolutely smitten.</li>
            <li> And unlike the traditional metal curling irons/wands, these retain heat amazingly well</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering what this product looks like in action, or how to use it, I found this cute girl who does a tutorial with her &amp;#34;christmas gift&amp;#34; Remington wand.</li>
            <li> This wand has digital temperature setting that is a nice feature to have.  </li>
            <li> I own several Remington curling wands.  </li>
            <li> use this mostly to touch up my naturally wavy/curly hair after it&#x27;s been slept on.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I rarely ever use a curling iron in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Regular old curling irons with the clips never worked great for my hair, and I thought this style wouldn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my honest assessment: The barrel on this curling iron is bigger, so</li>
            <li> Remington Ci96x1 Silk Ceramic Wide Styling Wand was a good choice for us.</li>
            <li> I am just very careful while wrapping the hair and make sure to keep my fingers on top of the hair</li>
            <li> I am just very careful while wrapping the hair and make sure to keep my fingers on top of the hair</li>
            <li> controls are right where you hold the wand</li>
            <li> The only reason that I&#x27;m not rating it higher is because there is nothing spectacular about it.</li>
            <li> The results are much better (and more natural) than the smaller cone shapes.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy and curls easy.</li>
            <li> I have waist length, very straight hair</li>

            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and/or time with NuMe, Hot Tools, Conair Infiniti Pro, Jose Eber, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was hot, but it just was not curling.  </li>
            <li> well does involve a learning curve, so don&#x27;t give up if you&#x27;re struggling at first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty average.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s definitely a first for</li>
            <li> However, I compared the price with similar devices at Target, and it is a much better price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It will be tricky at first, but you&#x27;ll get the hang of it over time.</li>
            <li> so I know exactly what temp it&#x27;s on, even if I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s the correct one</li>

            <li> but it does get hot</li>
            <li> Also, this heats up FAST!</li>
            <li> i got this for occasional use on my daughters very fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s well worth the $25, but for now I will probably stick with my older iron.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron has varying heat, which is excellent and prevents excess damage to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have complained that they are constantly pushing buttons while curling their hair, and</li>
            <li> I have medium weight hair that is in healthy condition but needs product to have texture and this wand curled my hair quickly, resulting in big soft curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a really well-made tool and I love the digital display</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a really well-made tool and I love the digital display</li>
            <li> Definitely worth purchasing vs. a high end curler.</li>
            <li> Even with the glove the very end of the wand can get too hot to hold.</li>
            <li> I received this in the &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; 1.5&amp;#34; to 1&amp;#34; wand size and was a little concerned that it would be too large for my current hair length (about an inch or two below the shoulders) but it was perfect and since I plan on growing my hair out again, I&#x27;m glad I won&#x27;t have to purchase a different size later on.  </li>
            <li> easy to use, and comes with a glove (necessary</li>
            <li> If I have more success after practicing further with it, I’ll update my review, but after multiple attempts on several different days, I really can’t rate this wand higher than one star yet.thing that just takes a good bit of practice before you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> The wand is really slick-looking and I love everything about it for curling long hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s certainly a learning curve to creating the curls</li>
            <li> This is my third Remington ceramic styling wand (I keep buying them, my sisters try them, and love them so much that I have to buy a new one).  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re really serious about styling your hair with something like this regularly, and especially if you have thicker hair that doesn&#x27;t respond to heat as fast as fine hair, it&#x27;ll be worth your while to invest more into getting a higher end tool with a slightly better design that can also go to higher</li>
            <li> The main reason being is that it gets too hot.  </li>
            <li> all high temperature curling/styling wands, consistent use/misuse may eventually damage hair.&lt;br /&gt;*Unless</li>
            <li> I am able to quickly curl my entire head and the curls actually last and look better than any other curls.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to see in the picture, but the curling iron has a plastic tip on the end of the barrel, so the very end is safe to touch; a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased a HerStyler curling wand, but it felt cheap</li>
            <li> compares to high end heating wands!</li>
            <li> Don’t put too much hair into each wrapped section.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this iron.</li>
            <li> An iron with the clam is much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> did heat up fast and told you the temp.</li>
            <li> Since you have to wrap by hand, you have to get used to gathering up your hair and figuring out how much to use at a time to get the curl you want.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl well with a metal curling iron, but for whatever reason, with this one it did.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Even with the lock I found it super distracting in a way no other curling iron has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with the tapered style is that it&#x27;s easy to run out of room on the wand to wrap your hair around it if you take up too much real-estate as you start from the top (largest diameter) down.  </li>
            <li> Pros: gets hot quick and has digital reading.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly - useable in 30 sec, full heat in 1 minute.  </li>
            <li> I really like this one, much better than other cone shaped wands that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It looks like a slightly older model, but it doesn&#x27;t look like much has changed.</li>
            <li> Higher temperature (410) gives you tighter more defined curls, lower temperature (360) gives you that messy wavy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy curling.</li>
            <li> It is well made, easy to use, and quickly creates shiny, long lasting, voluminous curls!</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t necessarily anything special.  </li>
            <li> though it heats up super fast (like seconds), it&#x27;s going to take some time to do all the wrapping, and there&#x27;s definitely a learning curve.</li>
            <li> The wand heats up quickly and is good for long hair because of the extra wide barrel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Manufacturer claimed \\&quot;Silk protein coated ceramic\\&quot; wand supposedly provides more even heat and less damaging to hair.  </li>
            <li> This product claims that it gives you a healthy, effortless, long-lasting curl with less frizz</li>
            <li> and they do produce slightly different looks depending on the design, but what is always the same is the stunning result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For more long lasting and consistent curls, my gal still prefers her professional hair stylist!</li>
            <li> For quite some time I have been using a normal curling iron as a wand, but even on the highest heat setting, it required almost twenty seconds to create a decent curl.</li>
            <li> Indeed, we found when trying to use this on freshly washed hair with no spray that the hair was very slippery on the ceramic and just fell right down to the tip.  </li>
            <li> If I have more success after practicing further with it, I’ll update my review, but after multiple attempts on several different days, I really can’t rate this wand higher than one star yet.</li>
            <li> This is tough to use but creates gorgeous results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;--The cord is a decent length for ease of use if your plug isn&#x27;t right next to your mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair normally curls at 350-390&#x27;F temperature in about 8-10 seconds (the norm).</li>
            <li> useful curling wand for last minute touch ups or on-the-go hair styling.  </li>
            <li> This wand comes with a glove to help keep your hands from burning when using this and that right there threw up a red flag for me.  </li>
            <li> Heats quickly and works well for long hair.</li>
            <li> Instead, these new clamp-less irons come with a heat-resistant glove and lots of warnings.</li>
            <li> I did not have an issue with the heat, but my hair is long and thin and having such a thick top was not the best choice for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every type of curling device out there; hundred dollar rotating curling irons, every kind of hot roller, various overnight curling systems, different sized curling irons, etc, and apparently what I was looking for was sitting in every grocery store hair aisle for less than fifty dollars all along.</li>
            <li> I had long, nearly waist length hair and used this right before I chopped it all off to shoulder length.</li>
            <li> /&gt;--It heats up very quickly, has different heat settings, and has a digital readout of the current temperature.</li>
            <li> I do love the loose curls the wide wand creates.  </li>
            <li> but a little too slippery (smooth) for me.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to curl the very ends of my hair without burning myself, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I recently cut my hair that went down from the middle of my back to a long bob that falls right at my shoulders, so I was super excited to try this wand on my new &#x27;do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Sleek and modern with a digital setting</li>
            <li> Common sense dictates that all curling wands should not be unattended and make sure to unplug after each use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerns:&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Curl stays in for the whole day and my hair is curly when i wake up the next morning.</li>
            <li> The size and shape of the curl is dependent on how much hair you use.&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is so long, I used small sections and the curls came out spiraled and tighter at the bottom than at the top like a natural curl.</li>
            <li> This 1\\&quot;-1/1/2\\&quot; Wide Curling Wand was exactly what she needed to replace her old model Remington styling</li>
            <li> degree F digital salon high heat</li>
            <li> We used in on my very fine hair and my nieces very thick hair.</li>
            <li> and it was exactly what I expected and wanted</li>
            <li> The glove makes handling the hair a bit clumsy, but if you curl big chunks of hair at a time, it&#x27;ll work OK.  </li>
            <li> Also, for the record, this was with hair spray and heat protectant as I would use with any other hot tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other wands before and never had to use a glove so in my opinion this wand gets too hot.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is pretty long, It falls almost to the bottom of her shoulder blades (mid back).  </li>
            <li> I got my hair cut and colored recently, and have naturally wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> and I barely had a curl.  </li>
            <li> This makes bigger, natural looking</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to use but worth it!</li>
            <li> Plug it in, press the On/Off button until the display comes on, select heat setting (low, medium, or high according to hair strength, texture, and thickness), let it heat up in 30 seconds, press and hold the \\&quot;-\\&quot; button to lock the temperature, and use the gloved hand to wrap hair around the wand (smaller section for tighter curls; larger section for looser/larger</li>
            <li> On my daughter&#x27;s long hair we&#x27;ve tried every imaginable way to curl her hair, and this is the only tool that gave this particular result.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s long enough to really wrap around the barrel several times.</li>
            <li> It gets very hot and although there is protection for your hand you should be careful so you don&#x27;t burn other parts of your head like your forehead and your ear.  </li>
            <li> Personally, this seems kind of useless -</li>
            <li> I read on the internet that I should put a little styling spray in my hair first</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pointing straight down on the side of my head where I want to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> that is not long enough for this product to be any use.</li>
            <li> If you want tight curls, then buy the one inch but get ready to fight to loosen the curls.</li>
            <li> If you want big loose curls that look natural, then this is definitely the wand for you.  </li>
            <li> My gal has long, luscious, dark brown hair and sometimes likes large wavy curls for a change of style.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that the curls don&#x27;t hold as long as I&#x27;d like, but that might be because of the intense heat of where I live.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight hair that usually doesn&#x27;t hold curls very well and have tried several other wands of various sizes and shapes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the older models, with the little clip and holds your hair in place.  </li>
            <li> temperature range is from 270 to 410 degrees, which is a pretty large range, and unfortunately the instructions give no clear direction on which temp to use for which hair type.</li>
            <li> wand creates slightly looser waves, but even though they are those soft romantic waves, they still stay looking just curled for days</li>
            <li> This iron creates long lasting curls on my hair in about five seconds, I repeat FIVE SECONDS!</li>
            <li> BUT here&#x27;s the kicker, it started falling flat after about an hour.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s no problem as long as you realize you did it and change it back.  </li>
            <li> If you want fantastic hair you are going to have to try at least a little bit, but for fewer than 30 dollars this item is a steal.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter has very long very thick straight hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s definitely a pretty serious learning curve going on here, in terms of the difficulty of using styling tools anyway.</li>
            <li> The wand is so wide that i could only twist my duaghters hair around a couple of times.</li>
            <li> Cord is quite long, so we leave some of it in the twisty tie.</li>
            <li> You likely have seen these type of styling wands before, and you may have been curious to try them out.</li>
            <li> Need really long hair!&lt;br /&gt;I have medium length hair.</li>
            <li> problem for me is that with the glove on, I have trouble feeling the end of my hair and frequently lose my hold on it, requiring I start that section of hair all over again.</li>
            <li> My daughter has really long hair</li>
            <li> Your hair needs to be fairly long to use this styling wand.  </li>
            <li> It works very well for my thick waist length hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1&amp;#34; – 1 1/2&amp;#34; Styling Wand for professional tight and loose curls</li>
            <li> I think the stuff behind the power button shifted because it just doesn&#x27;t feel right when I push the power button anymore.  </li>
            <li> but if you have fine but thick hair that is hard to curl and make it hold</li>
            <li> I can see where this might be a great tool for people with thick hair, but for those of us who have thin hair this product is just not a good option.</li>
            <li> The only thing to say other than that is that I would sometimes accidentally change the temperature setting when I was using it.  </li>
            <li> If you have very long hair, I think this model would be easier for you to use, you will have longer lengths to work with making it easier to wrap your hair around the barrel, as opposed to wrapping it up IN the barrel.  </li>
            <li> The instruction says to use this wand on dry hair,</li>
            <li> so I wait for the mousses to dry before using the wand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to use this iron with the tip down (sort of backwards from a traditional curling iron), so it can definitely feel awkward.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to blow dry my hair and then create loose curls.  </li>
            <li> I have long coarse slightly wavy (often times frizzy) hair.</li>
            <li> have very long hair that reaches half-way down my back.</li>
            <li> For the curls, you need to use hair spray because they are too loose to hold otherwise.  </li>
            <li> then wind it around the iron to get a loose corkscrew style curl.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and thin, so I&#x27;m not really sure what temp I should be using.</li>
            <li> Not a high end wand.</li>
            <li> and and it feels super weird picking up sections of hair with it on.</li>
            <li> Has a wide barrel to give loose barrel curls or a wave to your hair.  </li>
            <li> They only cost a few dollars, you can use them to hold other styling tools when needed as well, and it could save you a nasty burn by making sure the hot part of the tool isn&#x27;t where you can accidentally touch it if you lean forward or bump it and knock it off the counter or something.</li>
            <li> The buttons are in an awkward spot where I was constantly hitting them while trying to use it, but at least I could feel the button shift so that I could make sure it was set the way I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cord has a swivel feature so it won&#x27;t tangle upon itself, and this definitely makes the wand easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the reviewers who found this difficult to use, I can understand your plight, but let&#x27;s be straight here:</li>
            <li> but she could have gotten the same effect by not brushing it for a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the wide</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t need the gloves but for the sake of this review, I did give it a go and as expected</li>
            <li> I ordered the Remington CI96X1 Silk Ceramic Wide Styling Wand and tried to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also takes significantly less time to curl my whole head (and I have very long, very thick hair).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing this for years with my regular plain jane curling iron (without using the clamp)</li>
            <li> For long hair to look slightly tousled but wavy, this is the tool to use.  </li>
            <li> I usually try and keep my hair pretty dirty and use dry shampoo prior to styling, and my curls stay for multiple days!</li>
            <li> You wrap your hair starting at the widest point on the wand down the wand to the narrow end and hold the end of your hair on the non-heated end of the wand for a count of 5-10 to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> For anyone who reviewed it and stating they kept accidentally resetting the controls due to the location of the controls on the wand, there is a lock</li>
            <li> It does come with a glove to protect your hand, but I found the thing pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> Yes, it was easier for both me and my daughter to use this on each other than on ourselves.</li>
            <li> With a non-tapered wand, you can usually just slide your already wrapped hair up further on the wand - you can&#x27;t do that at all with a tapered wand.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes me only 20 minutes tops to do my hair, regardless of my hair length.  </li>
            <li> I bought my trusty conair a few years ago, it has a 1&#x27; barrel, so the curls aren&#x27;t tight, but they produce enough wave and bounce to give me the results I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As directed in the instructions, I held the iron near (but not touching) my scalp and used my other (gloved) hand to wind a small section of hair around the shaft of the wand.</li>
            <li> If I could find a triangle screw driver I&#x27;d open the sucker up and could probably fix it.  </li>
            <li> To keep the hair from slipping, start by holding the wand with the thicker base at the bottom and the thinner tip at the top, then roll the hair onto the wand and hold for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a necessary feature, as I was pushing buttons like CRAZY while I was curling my hair! ;)</li>
            <li> it did muss her hair slightly</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what it is set to when you turn it on unless you hold down the temp button for a few seconds to \\&quot;lock\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had the hardest time wrapping my hair around it and keeping everything tight and in line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes a little while to get used to using this wand.  </li>
            <li> It also takes a little trial and error to develop some confidence about how well the glove can protect your hand.</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> /&gt;The iron heated in just a few moments.</li>
            <li> But either way, this is the tool you want to get those lovely Lauren Conrad relaxed waves.nce because I hated the way it felt to touch my hair with it on.</li>
            <li> both of us are lefties and had few issues with the cord getting in our way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suggested it to a few friends.</li>
            <li> noticed a lot of the other reviewers on here have rated it low since the style of styling wand is difficult to learn.</li>
            <li> I also tried this on my sister who has very thick, heavy, long hair and the curls just didn&#x27;t take.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for at least a few hours</li>
            <li> So I returned this product but only because it was not best for my hair type</li>
            <li> Unlike ordinary curling irons, there is no clip to keep the hair in place.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s correct.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how you&#x27;d burn your eyes with it</li>
            <li> BUT MY HAIR DOESN&#x27;T HOLD A HARD CURL I AM PROBABLY GOING TO DONATE THIS</li>
            <li> Have you ever worn those little thin cotton stretchy gloves, the ones you can get at the dollar store?</li>
            <li> you have silky hair, or you have hair that is thick</li>
            <li> (as in each strand is really thick), this is not the curling iron for you.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little expensive.</li>
            <li> After numerous starts and stops without any progress, I became frustrated and gave up.</li>
            <li> I hate curling my hair but every once in a while I really want to swap my boring straight hair for something sultry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very late in writing this review and have had mine for some time now, and it&#x27;s holding up</li>
            <li> I only used it once because I hated the way it felt to touch my hair with it on.</li>
            <li> feel that using the glove made it difficult to use on myself.</li>
            <li> so this wasn&#x27;t difficult for me, but there is a learning curve.</li>
            <li> The packaging was questionable and the barrel had a couple of scratches, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the hassle of returning things that I&#x27;ve ordered online.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> WTF?!  </li>
            <li> If you have silky hair, then your hair slides ALL over the stupid wand.  </li>
            <li> like the swivel base-</li>
            <li> Seriously terrible.  </li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing and using this curling iron, and it is literally the worst hair product I&#x27;ve ever had the displeasure of using.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome product! love it!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent curling iron. The handle, plastic, and barrel are all well finished and smooth. It is difficult to see in the picture, but the curling iron has a plastic tip on the end of the barrel, so the very end is safe to touch; a nice feature. I initially purchased a HerStyler curling wand, but it felt cheap and I did not like that it did not have variable heat controls. This curling iron has varying heat, which is excellent and prevents excess damage to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have complained that they are constantly pushing buttons while curling their hair, and well I guess I&#x27;m the only nerd who reads the manual before using a product... because you can &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; the buttons by pushing and holding the &amp;#34;minus&amp;#34; button for two seconds. This is definitely a necessary feature, as I was pushing buttons like CRAZY while I was curling my hair! ;)&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron creates gorgeous, voluminous curls with lightening speed. I am seriously amazed at how quickly this iron creates curls. For quite some time I have been using a normal curling iron as a wand, but even on the highest heat setting, it required almost twenty seconds to create a decent curl. This iron creates long lasting curls on my hair in about five seconds, I repeat FIVE SECONDS! Mind-blown!&lt;br /&gt;The cord has a swivel feature so it won&#x27;t tangle upon itself, and this definitely makes the wand easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the reviewers who found this difficult to use, I can understand your plight, but let&#x27;s be straight here: using ANY curling wand requires a good deal of patience and practice, practice, practice! ;) If you&#x27;re wondering what this product looks like in action, or how to use it, I found this cute girl who does a tutorial with her &amp;#34;christmas gift&amp;#34; Remington wand. It looks like a slightly older model, but it doesn&#x27;t look like much has changed. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;EEPUpxLXzJw&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a fabulous product, and I am absolutely smitten.It is well made, easy to use, and quickly creates shiny, long lasting, voluminous curls! They have thought of everything with this wand, and it is simply a dream to work with.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This wand makes easy, wavy curls.  I use Aussie mousses + leave-in conditioner and Aussie Sprunch hairspray to hold the curls in.  The instruction says to use this wand on dry hair, so I wait for the mousses to dry before using the wand.  This wand has digital temperature setting that is a nice feature to have.  Give 4 stars because sometimes while using the wand, my fingers would accidentally hit the temperature control and change the temperature setting.  Takes a little while to get used to using this wand.  To keep the hair from slipping, start by holding the wand with the thicker base at the bottom and the thinner tip at the top, then roll the hair onto the wand and hold for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t necessarily anything special.  It does heat up very quickly, much quicker than my good old Conair, so I will give it that.  The cord is a bit longer than some other irons, and that&#x27;s always nice when you are working on your own hair in your home bathroom.  I also appreciate the auto shut off, I&#x27;m pretty good at turning my appliances off, but some backup never hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use a curling iron often.  I&#x27;m a stay at home mom, and usually only go to great lengths fixing my hair when I&#x27;m going out or having company over, but when I do use my curling iron, I want something easy to use and foolproof.  Hair isn&#x27;t my strong suit, or rather I should say styling my own hair isn&#x27;t my strong suit, so I want something with guaranteed results.  I bought my trusty conair a few years ago, it has a 1&#x27; barrel, so the curls aren&#x27;t tight, but they produce enough wave and bounce to give me the results I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one does to, but I would be lying if I didn&#x27;t say the &#x27;wrap and go&#x27; curling technique didn&#x27;t throw me off a bit.  I&#x27;m used to the older models, with the little clip and holds your hair in place.  If you have very long hair, I think this model would be easier for you to use, you will have longer lengths to work with making it easier to wrap your hair around the barrel, as opposed to wrapping it up IN the barrel.  My hair is just a tad longer than shoulder length, and while i was still able to use the iron successfully ( the heat protective glove helped) on the shorter pieces near my face, my hair would just slide right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I am sure it has more to do with &#x27;user error&#x27; than the actual iron itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice product and I think it&#x27;s well worth the $25, but for now I will probably stick with my older iron.  HOwever, I am trying to grow my hair out a bit, so when it&#x27;s longer I&#x27;ll take this one out again and see if it works any better for me.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is exactly what I was needing!</li>
            <li> compares to high end heating wands! easy use!</li>
            <li> Digital settings are great and it will get very hot if you want it to.  Buttons are in the way for me.  Maybe the way I hold it.</li>
            <li> Love this wand! Perfect waves with little effort. Definitely worth purchasing vs. a high end curler.</li>
            <li> This is a five-star purchase. Not only is it inexpensive, but it provides great results. For anyone who reviewed it and stating they kept accidentally resetting the controls due to the location of the controls on the wand, there is a lock button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Cord to the ceiling, tip to the floor. Wrap away from your face. Hold the tips of your hair as you wrap and you won’t burn yourself (I have used it twice now and have yet to need the glove). Take your time and section your hair. Don’t put too much hair into each wrapped section. If you want fantastic hair you are going to have to try at least a little bit, but for fewer than 30 dollars this item is a steal. Higher temperature (410) gives you tighter more defined curls, lower temperature (360) gives you that messy wavy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy curling.</li>
            <li> Very very nice styling wand.  I love the temperature display and the heat settings.  The heat glove that is included seems to work great.  It doesn&#x27;t work very well on my fine hair but works great on my daughters thicker hair.  I read on the internet that I should put a little styling spray in my hair first so I will be trying that next.  Very nice product.  The only reason I made my review a 4 instead of a 5 is because it took longer than I thought it should to heat up.  I would recommend starting it up well ahead of time - not something you just flip on and start curling.</li>
            <li> I own several Remington curling wands.  I really like this one, much better than other cone shaped wands that I&#x27;ve tried.  Before using this one, I think my favorites were the regular cylindrical wands and the elliptical shaped Remington wand.  But this one...is nice.  The results are much better (and more natural) than the smaller cone shapes.  Heats quickly, is simple to use.  Includes glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this mostly to touch up my naturally wavy/curly hair after it&#x27;s been slept on.</li>
            <li> i got this for occasional use on my daughters very fine straight hair. Her hair is pretty long, It falls almost to the bottom of her shoulder blades (mid back).  that is not long enough for this product to be any use. The wand is so wide that i could only twist my duaghters hair around a couple of times. it did muss her hair slightly but she could have gotten the same effect by not brushing it for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;So, unless you are trying to achieve the unbrushed look or you are Rapunzel, id try another styling wand.</li>
            <li> The Remington Ci96x1 is a great curling wand. We used in on my very fine hair and my nieces very thick hair. It made perfect large beach waves on both or our hair. It is very easy to use and works perfect every time, and the curls are consistent between uses.</li>
            <li> Great seller,  Great product</li>
            <li> I got the wide and i think a newer version(?) because I was able to lock the temperature and it had a swivel cord.&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, it&#x27;s still sucks.&lt;br /&gt;I have normal-thick mid-back length hair. My hair normally curls at 350-390&#x27;F temperature in about 8-10 seconds (the norm). Similar temps and/or time with NuMe, Hot Tools, Conair Infiniti Pro, Jose Eber, etc.&lt;br /&gt;However, this wand took longer and more effort. It took 12-15 seconds and at max heat which, mind you, wasn&#x27;t giving me any curls or even a wave so I had to pin-set each curl. After all that time and effort, I achieved LE beachy waves. BUT here&#x27;s the kicker, it started falling flat after about an hour. Gosh darn it! I was hoping for at least a few hours but that isn&#x27;t going to happen. Also, for the record, this was with hair spray and heat protectant as I would use with any other hot tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve been using clipless curling irons for a while so I didn&#x27;t need the gloves but for the sake of this review, I did give it a go and as expected, it&#x27;s one of those $1.50 for 2-pack gloves you can buy at target. Definitely not heat resistant but it will save your finger getting burned for a split second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if you&#x27;re looking for a &amp;#34;clipless&amp;#34; iron around or under $30, you&#x27;d better off getting a hot tools or infiniti pro and just remove the clip yourself.</li>
            <li> This is my third Remington ceramic styling wand (I keep buying them, my sisters try them, and love them so much that I have to buy a new one).  I keep trying different barrel shapes and they do produce slightly different looks depending on the design, but what is always the same is the stunning result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wand creates slightly looser waves, but even though they are those soft romantic waves, they still stay looking just curled for days (I&#x27;ve gone three days before and probably could have gone four).  And unlike the traditional metal curling irons/wands, these retain heat amazingly well so the last curl looks just as good as the first one.  It also takes significantly less time to curl my whole head (and I have very long, very thick hair).  i just love these!</li>
            <li> Heats up really fast and the ONLY curling iron I have used that I get beautiful waves from...really glad I bought this. And it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> This is not a curling iron and trying to use the curling iron technique with it will only end in tears.  There&#x27;s a learning curve to using it on your own hair, but once you get it, this wand works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included glove is to be worn on the hair hand, not the tool hand.  The glove makes handling the hair a bit clumsy, but if you curl big chunks of hair at a time, it&#x27;ll work OK.  I found that sectioning and clipping my hair before beginning the curling process made the process faster, easier, and more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controls are right where you hold the wand and it&#x27;s easy to turn it off.  Practice makes perfect in keeping your index finger off the switch.  I do love the loose curls the wide wand creates.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4, because the effect outweighs the hassle.</li>
            <li> I hate curling my hair but every once in a while I really want to swap my boring straight hair for something sultry. But I find that traditional curling irons always leave a telltale crimp mark. It&#x27;s probably user error but ever since I started seeing styling wands without the clip I&#x27;ve been dying to give one a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one from Remington is lovely. I like the screen, that I can easily tell what temp I have it set on and adjust it. I don&#x27;t mind the heat resistant glove, though it took some getting used to. For the first time ever, I&#x27;ve been able to whip up awesome curls that lasted!!! But there&#x27;s a problem... I kept hitting the buttons on the side. Even with the lock I found it super distracting in a way no other curling iron has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s certainly a learning curve to creating the curls but if you have fine but thick hair that is hard to curl and make it hold well I definitely give this a thumbs-up. I have been very impressed with it and would certainly recommend it for ladies like me who rarely have need of a curling tool that just occasionally want an easy way to make them and make them look pretty natural.</li>
            <li> This curling wand is not for me.  I think that is just because of the type of hair I have, but yep this is one styling tool I won&#x27;t be using again.  The main reason being is that it gets too hot.  I have very thin hair and I try not to use products that will burn my hair and break it. This wand comes with a glove to help keep your hands from burning when using this and that right there threw up a red flag for me.  I have used other wands before and never had to use a glove so in my opinion this wand gets too hot.  Plus my hair wouldn&#x27;t stay on the wand.  I had the hardest time wrapping my hair around it and keeping everything tight and in line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is just the case for my hair though.  I can see where this might be a great tool for people with thick hair, but for those of us who have thin hair this product is just not a good option.</li>
            <li> I receive on time. Very good! Thanks</li>
            <li> Pros: gets hot quick and has digital reading. The size of curls it creates is awesome, ideal for longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the location of the buttons get in the way of your fingers and it changes the temperature as your curling. There is a lip at the end of the iron that keeps it from touching any surface, sometimes gets caught in your hair as you unravel the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it does its job but I should have invested a bit more in a better model.</li>
            <li> Seriously terrible.  I got my hair cut and colored recently, and have naturally wavy/curly hair.  Because of this, I rarely ever use a curling iron in my hair.  I wanted to blow dry my hair and then create loose curls.  I ended up purchasing and using this curling iron, and it is literally the worst hair product I&#x27;ve ever had the displeasure of using.  If you have silky hair, then your hair slides ALL over the stupid wand.  In addition to that, I had it on 410 degrees, and holding my hair in place for 30 seconds and I barely had a curl.  WTF?!  My hair was hot, but it just was not curling.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem before either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have silky hair, or you have hair that is thick (as in each strand is really thick), this is not the curling iron for you.  It&#x27;s incredibly cumbersome, and does little to make your hair curly.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly - useable in 30 sec, full heat in 1 minute.  Has a wide barrel to give loose barrel curls or a wave to your hair.  For the curls, you need to use hair spray because they are too loose to hold otherwise.  Love the included glove to protect your fingers when curling hair around the wand.  Cord is quite long, so we leave some of it in the twisty tie.</li>
            <li> this product is great. I did not have an issue with the heat, but my hair is long and thin and having such a thick top was not the best choice for me. So I returned this product but only because it was not best for my hair type</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter love this styling wand.  They said it is easy to use and works very well.  My daughter liked the fact that there are no crimp marks when using the tool.  It does get hot, but comes with a special glove for protection.</li>
            <li> I really like this iron. It works very well for my thick waist length hair. Unlike ordinary curling irons, there is no clip to keep the hair in place. You must wind the hair around the iron &amp; keep it in place with a gloved hand. So, there&#x27;s a learning curve here. But you can check out vids on youtube to see how it&#x27;s done. It does take practice to use this iron, I don&#x27;t feel that&#x27;s a mark against the iron itself. I like to twist a section of hair then wind it around the iron to get a loose corkscrew style curl. This keeps the ends from coming out and not getting curled. My waves lasted all day and into the next without looking shaggy. I have long coarse slightly wavy (often times frizzy) hair. If that&#x27;s the texture of hair you have, I think you&#x27;ll like this iron once you get used to using it. Practice makes perfect.</li>
            <li> You likely have seen these type of styling wands before, and you may have been curious to try them out. This is a good wand to start with since it&#x27;s inexpensive and does a decent job.  The concept is simple - instead of using a curling iron to curl your hair, which leaves indentations on your hair where the clip holds your hair, you simply wrap your hair around the wand and hold it for a bit, which sets the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, and comes with a glove (necessary so you don&#x27;t burn your hand while holding the hair around the wand). Learning how to curl it well does involve a learning curve, so don&#x27;t give up if you&#x27;re struggling at first. You will get the hang of it and you&#x27;ll be able to have beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> Need really long hair!&lt;br /&gt;I have medium length hair. Just below my shoulders. My hair is naturally wavy and curls easy. I couldn&#x27;t get this thing to do much on my own head. I tried it on my daughters hair. I did have better luck. Her hair is longer but much more fine. The curls didn&#x27;t hold for long.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that using the glove made it difficult to use on myself. An iron with the clam is much easier.&lt;br /&gt;It did heat up fast and told you the temp. I tried the &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; function. It didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. I did like the locking feature on the temp controls.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> My gal has long, luscious, dark brown hair and sometimes likes large wavy curls for a change of style.  This 1\\&quot;-1/1/2\\&quot; Wide Curling Wand was exactly what she needed to replace her old model Remington styling wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;*Sleek and modern with a digital setting display.&lt;br /&gt;*Heat protective glove.&lt;br /&gt;*Easy to use.  Plug it in, press the On/Off button until the display comes on, select heat setting (low, medium, or high according to hair strength, texture, and thickness), let it heat up in 30 seconds, press and hold the \\&quot;-\\&quot; button to lock the temperature, and use the gloved hand to wrap hair around the wand (smaller section for tighter curls; larger section for looser/larger curls).&lt;br /&gt;*My gals has years of experience using home curling wands so using this one was a cinch in terms of wrapping the right amount of hair around the appropriate sections and heat curling the right amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;*Manufacturer claimed \\&quot;Silk protein coated ceramic\\&quot; wand supposedly provides more even heat and less damaging to hair.  Seems to work well for my gal&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;*Auto shut-off after 60 minutes.  Common sense dictates that all curling wands should not be unattended and make sure to unplug after each use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concerns:&lt;br /&gt;*Like all high temperature curling/styling wands, consistent use/misuse may eventually damage hair.&lt;br /&gt;*Unless one is experienced with curling wands, be very careful not to burn hands, scalp, or face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;A useful curling wand for last minute touch ups or on-the-go hair styling.  For more long lasting and consistent curls, my gal still prefers her professional hair stylist!</li>
            <li> This is pretty good, but nothing really extraordinary. The buttons are in an awkward spot where I was constantly hitting them while trying to use it, but at least I could feel the button shift so that I could make sure it was set the way I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s definitely a pretty serious learning curve going on here, in terms of the difficulty of using styling tools anyway. Since you have to wrap by hand, you have to get used to gathering up your hair and figuring out how much to use at a time to get the curl you want. It also takes a little trial and error to develop some confidence about how well the glove can protect your hand. My early results weren&#x27;t great, partly because it took me a while to get over being unwilling to let my gloved hand even brush the tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get a handle on using it, though, it&#x27;s good enough for most people&#x27;s use. If you&#x27;re really serious about styling your hair with something like this regularly, and especially if you have thicker hair that doesn&#x27;t respond to heat as fast as fine hair, it&#x27;ll be worth your while to invest more into getting a higher end tool with a slightly better design that can also go to higher heats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also look into getting a styling tool holder that you can set up on your counter or put on your mirror so that you have a safe place to put it when it&#x27;s out of your hands. They only cost a few dollars, you can use them to hold other styling tools when needed as well, and it could save you a nasty burn by making sure the hot part of the tool isn&#x27;t where you can accidentally touch it if you lean forward or bump it and knock it off the counter or something.</li>
            <li> Like the size of the barrel but it gets too hot! Even with the glove the very end of the wand can get too hot to hold. It&#x27;s a good curling iron though quick to heat up and a long cord</li>
            <li> I recently cut my hair that went down from the middle of my back to a long bob that falls right at my shoulders, so I was super excited to try this wand on my new &#x27;do. Right away I liked that the wand is very lightweight and it heats up quickly. I have medium weight hair that is in healthy condition but needs product to have texture and this wand curled my hair quickly, resulting in big soft curls. I also tried this on my sister who has very thick, heavy, long hair and the curls just didn&#x27;t take. Because of my hair type, I&#x27;ve received the desired results from this product and I recommend it to people with fine to medium hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different styling wands to curl my hair throughout the years. This one works great. There&#x27;s not really anything about it that stands out among the rest, but it&#x27;s still a really great product. The only reason that I&#x27;m not rating it higher is because there is nothing spectacular about it. It&#x27;s pretty average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a lot of the other reviewers on here have rated it low since the style of styling wand is difficult to learn. Once you learn it, it&#x27;s super easy and works well. Definitely look on YouTube for examples, or have a friend show you have to use it correctly. Regular old curling irons with the clips never worked great for my hair, and I thought this style wouldn&#x27;t either. As soon as I learned to use it correctly, I noticed a huge difference in how well my hair holds the curls. I curl my hair almost every day now. Just don&#x27;t write it off until you&#x27;ve actually taken the time to learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> Perfection :) My friend had this curler and I used it....then needed one myself. So glad I could find a deal and it was exactly what I expected and wanted :) Thank you :)</li>
            <li> worked..got he job done. but a little too slippery (smooth) for me. However, I will continue to use it</li>
            <li> This was my first curling iron that didn&#x27;t have the alligator clasp style, and I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work. However, it far exceeded my expectations. Here are the ups and downs that I&#x27;ve noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Hand wrapping the hair around the barrel provides a more natural curl shape and more even heat distribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--It doesn&#x27;t overheat/burn your hair, partly because of the hand wrapping, and partly because it&#x27;s ceramic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--It heats up very quickly, has different heat settings, and has a digital readout of the current temperature. That&#x27;s definitely a first for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--My hair actually curled with this! I have straight hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl well with a metal curling iron, but for whatever reason, with this one it did. This makes bigger, natural looking curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The cord is a decent length for ease of use if your plug isn&#x27;t right next to your mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--If you&#x27;re buying this (I got mine on Vine), it&#x27;s a little expensive. However, I compared the price with similar devices at Target, and it is a much better price on Amazon. Also, you do get what you pay for. I&#x27;m very late in writing this review and have had mine for some time now, and it&#x27;s holding up perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Don&#x27;t lose the glove!! If you lose the heat resistant glove that comes with this, you&#x27;re basically screwed. I wish it came with several, as it&#x27;s bound to get lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Even though it heats up super fast (like seconds), it&#x27;s going to take some time to do all the wrapping, and there&#x27;s definitely a learning curve. It will be tricky at first, but you&#x27;ll get the hang of it over time.</li>
            <li> Great product. Heats quickly and works well for long hair.</li>
            <li> Love this curling wand. Curl stays in for the whole day and my hair is curly when i wake up the next morning.</li>
            <li> It is not often I follow a current fashion trend, but I have loved the ‘mermaid hair’ that you see all over television and magazines these days. I searched the internet for instructions on how to achieve this look and several suggested using a curling iron with a tapered wand. I ordered the Remington CI96X1 Silk Ceramic Wide Styling Wand and tried to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note that this is the first time I’ve tried to use one of those new-fangled curling irons that don’t have the clamp the old-fashioned kind did. Instead, these new clamp-less irons come with a heat-resistant glove and lots of warnings. I have to say, I was and still am intimidated by this feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron heated in just a few moments. I set it to the maximum temperature of 410 to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair that reaches half-way down my back. It is fine, but I have a lot of hair. As directed in the instructions, I held the iron near (but not touching) my scalp and used my other (gloved) hand to wind a small section of hair around the shaft of the wand. You then hold the end of the hair section while the rest of the hair is heated and curled. Good idea – in theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem for me is that with the glove on, I have trouble feeling the end of my hair and frequently lose my hold on it, requiring I start that section of hair all over again. After numerous starts and stops without any progress, I became frustrated and gave up. I suspect using the iron without the glove would make it easier to keep a hold of the end of the hair section, but of course the glove is necessary to prevent burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started trying to use this wand, I tried a similar style (clampless) that is not a tapered wand. While it is still tricky, it does seem to be easier to use with a barrel that is one width from end to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try this styling wand again on a day when I am feeling patient again. I really would like to make it work and hope this is something that just takes a good bit of practice before you get the hang of it. If I have more success after practicing further with it, I’ll update my review, but after multiple attempts on several different days, I really can’t rate this wand higher than one star yet.thing that just takes a good bit of practice before you get the hang of it.

            <li> I did not buy this from Amazon but at a local grocery store and use it for weaves. It is the best wand ever. It really does make life easy the curls can last for one week without adding anything to the hair. If you want tight curls, then buy the one inch but get ready to fight to loosen the curls. Its that good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted one of these curling irons for forever, so when I was offered one in exchange for an honest review I jumped on it. Here&#x27;s my honest assessment: The barrel on this curling iron is bigger, so in order for it to work well you have to have hair that&#x27;s long enough to really wrap around the barrel several times. This would most likely work the best for people with hair past their shoulders. My hair hits right at the top of my shoulders and I can only wrap my hair around this maybe 3 times. I think for my hair length a smaller size barrel, such as [[ASIN:B00BB8ZHL2 Remington Ci96w1 Silk Ceramic Slim Styling Wand]]  would probably work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temperature range is from 270 to 410 degrees, which is a pretty large range, and unfortunately the instructions give no clear direction on which temp to use for which hair type. My hair is fine and thin, so I&#x27;m not really sure what temp I should be using. The default is 360. That&#x27;s what it is set to when you turn it on unless you hold down the temp button for a few seconds to \\&quot;lock\\&quot; it at the temp you want. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been using but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take some practice to get used to this type of curling iron, since there is no clamp to hold your hair, and you have to wrap from the crown of your head, around the fattest portion of the barrel, towards the ends on the smaller portion of the barrel. I&#x27;ve been doing this for years with my regular plain jane curling iron (without using the clamp) so this wasn&#x27;t difficult for me, but there is a learning curve. It does come with a glove to protect your hand, but I found the thing pretty much useless. Have you ever worn those little thin cotton stretchy gloves, the ones you can get at the dollar store? That&#x27;s basically what this glove is. While it does protect your fingers from the brunt of the heat, you will not be able to feel your hair at all and and it feels super weird picking up sections of hair with it on. I only used it once because I hated the way it felt to touch my hair with it on. I am just very careful while wrapping the hair and make sure to keep my fingers on top of the hair so I don&#x27;t touch the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a really well-made tool and I love the digital display so I know exactly what temp it&#x27;s on, even if I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s the correct one haha. If your hair is longer, I think this would work great for you. If it&#x27;s shorter, like mine, maybe go for a smaller barrel size. But either way, this is the tool you want to get those lovely Lauren Conrad relaxed waves.nce because I hated the way it felt to touch my hair with it on.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been out of touch with hair styling technology, and didn&#x27;t realize this is JUST a barrel.  There is no clamp like old-fashioned irons.  You wear a heat-resistant glove and wrap strands of hair around this.  Personally, this seems kind of useless - you can&#x27;t even curl the ends of your hair unless you&#x27;re willing to burn your fingers!  Maybe if you want irregular waves in the middle of your strands this would work for you!</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT BUT MY HAIR DOESN&#x27;T HOLD A HARD CURL I AM PROBABLY GOING TO DONATE THIS</li>
            <li> Works fine. Not a high end wand. My teenage daughter wishes the the curls were tighter.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand!  It takes a little practice to curl the very ends of my hair without burning myself, but it&#x27;s worth it.  I&#x27;ve received many compliments on my hair since I started using the curling wand.  I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is tough to use but creates gorgeous results.  My daughter has really long hair and she wanted &#x27;beach curls,&#x27; and this did it for her.  She is 12 but managed to learn how to use this on her own hair.  I also tried it but I didn&#x27;t put in the time required to really get good at it.  I talked to my stylist about how to use this and she suggested that with very fine, soft hair it would help to use a heat-activating hold spray, or conversely to try to style hair that has not been freshly washed.  Indeed, we found when trying to use this on freshly washed hair with no spray that the hair was very slippery on the ceramic and just fell right down to the tip.  It&#x27;s important to use this iron with the tip down (sort of backwards from a traditional curling iron), so it can definitely feel awkward.  Yes, it was easier for both me and my daughter to use this on each other than on ourselves. However, the results, on her anyway, were beautiful.  For long hair to look slightly tousled but wavy, this is the tool to use.  On my daughter&#x27;s long hair we&#x27;ve tried every imaginable way to curl her hair, and this is the only tool that gave this particular result.  It&#x27;s hard to use but worth it!</li>
            <li> I received this in the &amp;#34;wide&amp;#34; 1.5&amp;#34; to 1&amp;#34; wand size and was a little concerned that it would be too large for my current hair length (about an inch or two below the shoulders) but it was perfect and since I plan on growing my hair out again, I&#x27;m glad I won&#x27;t have to purchase a different size later on.  I&#x27;ve used styling wands before but never a tapered wand and I can honestly say that the taper does give you more natural looking curls.  If you want big loose curls that look natural, then this is definitely the wand for you.  The only problem I had with the tapered style is that it&#x27;s easy to run out of room on the wand to wrap your hair around it if you take up too much real-estate as you start from the top (largest diameter) down.  With a non-tapered wand, you can usually just slide your already wrapped hair up further on the wand - you can&#x27;t do that at all with a tapered wand.  I always hold the wand so it&#x27;s pointing straight down on the side of my head where I want to curl my hair.  Takes a little practice to get the hang of it but once you do, you&#x27;ll be able to curl your hair so very quickly!  It usually takes me only 20 minutes tops to do my hair, regardless of my hair length.  Highly recommend this curling wand; affordable and it gets results :)</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter has very long very thick straight hair.  She has recently become more concerned about her appearance, has discovered boys, and has been wearing makeup. She has been seeing infomercials on different products that allow you to make curls and wanted something that would do it. Remington Ci96x1 Silk Ceramic Wide Styling Wand was a good choice for us. I did not want her to get something that would damage her hair. This product claims that it gives you a healthy, effortless, long-lasting curl with less frizz and damage.&lt;br /&gt;The product specs include:&lt;br /&gt;1&amp;#34; – 1 1/2&amp;#34; Styling Wand for professional tight and loose curls&lt;br /&gt;Silk Technology: Silk powder coating infused on to the Ceramic surface.&lt;br /&gt;410 degree F digital salon high heat&lt;br /&gt;30 second heat up time&lt;br /&gt;Includes heat resistant glove for safe and easy styling&lt;br /&gt;Digital display controls for temperature control and 60 minute auto shut off.&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good curling iron that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have waist length, very straight hair and my daughter has mid-back length wavy hair. Both of us tried this on our hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets very hot- in fact there is an attached tag that says it can burn eyes. I&#x27;m not sure how you&#x27;d burn your eyes with it but it does get hot quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a styling wand- so there is no clip to deform curls. You wrap your hair starting at the widest point on the wand down the wand to the narrow end and hold the end of your hair on the non-heated end of the wand for a count of 5-10 to curl your hair. The size and shape of the curl is dependent on how much hair you use.&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is so long, I used small sections and the curls came out spiraled and tighter at the bottom than at the top like a natural curl. My daughter used larger sections and wound up with lots of bounce, wave and volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the swivel base- both of us are lefties and had few issues with the cord getting in our way. Similarly- the controls weren&#x27;t a problem either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it easier to use without the glove- just holding the hair to the non-heated tip after wrapping. My daughter prefers using it with the glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended- but there is a learning curve if you&#x27;re more used to clamp style curling irons.</li>
            <li> This really works well and gives your hair really nice curls.  This styling wand comes with a glove to use so you don&#x27;t burn your hand while you are using it.  It gets very hot and although there is protection for your hand you should be careful so you don&#x27;t burn other parts of your head like your forehead and your ear.  Your hair needs to be fairly long to use this styling wand.  The curls are a nice size and leave your hair nice and bouncy with curls.</li>
            <li> I had long, nearly waist length hair and used this right before I chopped it all off to shoulder length. The wand is really slick-looking and I love everything about it for curling long hair. You can finally get those spiral curls without the dreaded &amp;#34;dent&amp;#34; from a traditional curling iron, but it will take some practice. Make sure you use the included glove, so you don&#x27;t burn yourself. Also, this heats up FAST! Now that my hair is shoulder length, I think I&#x27;ll have to wait a while for it to grow back out some before using this. It would be too difficult to use on short hair, better to just use a roll brush and hair dryer for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever wanted to try a wand for your long hair, this is a good one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every type of curling device out there; hundred dollar rotating curling irons, every kind of hot roller, various overnight curling systems, different sized curling irons, etc, and apparently what I was looking for was sitting in every grocery store hair aisle for less than fifty dollars all along. This curling wand works amazing. I am able to quickly curl my entire head and the curls actually last and look better than any other curls. Hands down this is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best wand I&#x27;ve ever used. I have long, straight hair that usually doesn&#x27;t hold curls very well and have tried several other wands of various sizes and shapes. The size of this barrel is perfect for creating those beachy curls that are so in-style right now and holds well. I usually try and keep my hair pretty dirty and use dry shampoo prior to styling, and my curls stay for multiple days! Absolutely recommend this to anyone new to wands or the more experienced users looking for the best wand out there.</li>
            <li> The styling wand is similar to a curling iron but there is not a clip to hold the hair while curling. The wand is just that...a heated wand. It comes with a thermal glove to prevent burns. It works by wrapping individual strands of hair around the heated wand. Curls are supposed to result. We&#x27;ll, despite several attempts, it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I have color treated permed hair. I&#x27;d rather just use a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love it! I finally get to have those waves I wanted, it&#x27;s easy to use and it comes with the glove that makes it easy to use</li>
            <li> This is something that will not be getting any use will not recommend. I should have listened to the reviews.</li>
            <li> The packaging was questionable and the barrel had a couple of scratches, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the hassle of returning things that I&#x27;ve ordered online.  I went about using it and loved it!  However, one day it took a short fall and it won&#x27;t turn on now.  I think the stuff behind the power button shifted because it just doesn&#x27;t feel right when I push the power button anymore.  If I could find a triangle screw driver I&#x27;d open the sucker up and could probably fix it.  The only thing to say other than that is that I would sometimes accidentally change the temperature setting when I was using it.  That&#x27;s no problem as long as you realize you did it and change it back.  I love that the tip doesn&#x27;t get hot and the barrel heats up really fast.  I&#x27;ve suggested it to a few friends.</li>
            <li> I love this wand! The curls turn out great in only 15-20 minutes. The wand heats up quickly and is good for long hair because of the extra wide barrel. My only complaint would be that the curls don&#x27;t hold as long as I&#x27;d like, but that might be because of the intense heat of where I live. Overall great buy.</li>
            <li> As a bald man, I can&#x27;t speak to the power of the wand, so i&#x27;ll let these quotes from my teen daughters speak for themselves:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;This is a great product... works super fast!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I love this but wish my sister didn&#x27;t hog it all the time.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I&#x27;m not hogging it... i was here first.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No you weren&#x27;t!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Yes I was!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Is it my turn yet?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Daaaaaaaaad!&amp;#34;</li>
