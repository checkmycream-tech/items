            <li>Love John Freida and this product</li>
            <li>Finally I found my perfect products !!!!</li>
            <li>they just got Loreal Everstyle Smooth &amp; Shine Creme &amp; that works pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taking me 37 years to find a product that works well with my fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair frizz free and super curled!</li>
            <li>I have light brown curly hair &amp; just want something to keep flyaways in check.</li>
            <li>Pro Smooth Gloss Anti-Frizz Cream was always my go-to</li>
            <li>It takes the frizz out and makes the curl smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this after spotting it in the drugstore.</li>
            <li>My hair is just as good the second day.</li>
            <li>It works well year round and gives me great curls and style.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth getting on curls.</li>
            <li>and then my curls dry nicely.</li>
            <li>It really does keep my hair smoother without the frizzies!  </li>
            <li>I always apply the serum first.</li>
            <li>They work really well together for anyone with curly hair!</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have curly hair and leave a little in my hair and get frizz free curls.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Not 100% yet, but very close.  </li>
            <li>this really dries my hair out.</li>
            <li>This product works very well on unruly hair.  </li>
            <li>Still, I quite like it, and the size is very generous for the price.</li>
            <li>I love all of John Frieda&#x27;s products that suit my needs--especially hair control...without excessive &amp;#34;force&amp;#34; (smile).</li>
            <li>It keeps the frizz down fantastically and is very light</li>
            <li>It does seem to help tame the frizz a bit and make my hair more manageable but it stops short of actually making my curls stop having a mind of their own.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the effects will be more pronounced in the fall and winter when it&#x27;s much less humid.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and enjoy how it doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh my hair down or make it appear greasy.</li>
            <li>I love embracing my natural hair texture lately, and this product has definitely helped me do that.  </li>
            <li>(if I want to actually part my hair instead of letting it fall to either side and naturally part, I brush the product through, then part, then brush again quickly according to the part, then shake my head around, upside down, etc., so my hair doesn&#x27;t fall in a strict way).  </li>
            <li>They are really dry and VERY curly.</li>
            <li>so you can barely tell it is in your hair.</li>
            <li>Some products leave your hair feeling hard, like you&#x27;ve sprayed a weeks worth of hair spray on but not this product!  </li>
            <li>their curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out quick and you only need a little bit, so be careful!</li>

            <li> I do not like putting too much product in my children&#x27;s hair, but this helps tame and maintain</li>
            <li> All I have to do after washing my hair is wrap my hair in a towel while I am getting ready, then add about a quarter-sized amount of creme (I have short, thick hair) and comb it through.</li>
            <li> As my hair air dries, I scrunch it a little bit to soften the product where needed, shake my head around to help the hair fall in a natural, undone way...</li>
            <li> My hair is thin but can get BIG when it is very humid.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dry it, but I also don&#x27;t touch it again until it&#x27;s dry when I fluff it with my fingers.</li>

            <li> The bonus of it is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking wet, like gel and mousse does.</li>

            <li> This creme does everything it says, including calming my curls and keeping down the frizz.</li>
            <li> Also when you squeeze the product ALOT comes out so be careful you don&#x27;t squeeze it too hard</li>
            <li> I have been using this frizz ease for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed because sometimes I really just want to lengthen my hair because my curl pattern is so Shirley Temple tight</li>

            <li> Strict hair lately to me seems dated and not sexy.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately this didn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> I notice there&#x27;s alcohol in it, which may explain the bad effect it seemed to have on my hair.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so in love ❤ has my daughter curly hair looking and smelling beautiful. Definitely worth getting on curls. &amp;#34;I received this product as a promotion in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions stated are 100% my own&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> love the control this product seem to do and my granddaughter loves the smell...</li>
            <li> It works good to make my hair more curly, but it doesn&#x27;t unwind anything.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair, and this stuff works great! I can put it in when my hair is wet and then my curls dry nicely.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hair. This is the only product she will use.....</li>
            <li> All other frizz control products weighs my hair down and makes it feel greasy. This product does not do that. It keeps the frizz down fantastically and is very light so you can barely tell it is in your hair.</li>
            <li> My girls and I both have curly hair, and this product works wonders, especially for the girls. I do not like putting too much product in my children&#x27;s hair, but this helps tame and maintain their curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out quick and you only need a little bit, so be careful!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this stuff here, I get it in the grocery store, but saw it and had to post a review.  This stuff is the best product I have come across for hair. I have purchased countless bottles at this point.  I no longer have to blow dry my SLIGHTLY wavy hair, nor do I have to put any heat on it at all.  I put this stuff in my wet hair, brush it through, then flip my head around to whatever side I want my hair to fall, and go (if I want to actually part my hair instead of letting it fall to either side and naturally part, I brush the product through, then part, then brush again quickly according to the part, then shake my head around, upside down, etc., so my hair doesn&#x27;t fall in a strict way).  As my hair air dries, I scrunch it a little bit to soften the product where needed, shake my head around to help the hair fall in a natural, undone way... My hair always looks great, undone, not strict- just like I like it. I love embracing my natural hair texture lately, and this product has definitely helped me do that.  Strict hair lately to me seems dated and not sexy.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair frizz free and super curled!</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair and this works great! It tames the frizz that all girls with curls know too well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taking me 37 years to find a product that works well with my fine, curly hair. This creme does everything it says, including calming my curls and keeping down the frizz. The bonus of it is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking wet, like gel and mousse does. I can now be a wash-and-go girl. All I have to do after washing my hair is wrap my hair in a towel while I am getting ready, then add about a quarter-sized amount of creme (I have short, thick hair) and comb it through. I don&#x27;t dry it, but I also don&#x27;t touch it again until it&#x27;s dry when I fluff it with my fingers. My hair is just as good the second day.</li>
            <li> Mr. Frieda just keeps on giving...Stress-free hair and ease of convenience. I love all of John Frieda&#x27;s products that suit my needs--especially hair control...without excessive &amp;#34;force&amp;#34; (smile). I never have any problems with packaging and arrivals. All is good!</li>
            <li> keeps my frizz undercontrol</li>
            <li> I have curly Hispanic hair (3b). They are really dry and VERY curly. I have a couple of products I use but nothing that unwinds them. I washed my hair and put my leave in conditioner along with this. Once they tried the curls were formed, free of frizz and looked so healthy! There wasn&#x27;t any extreme unwinding which was the reason I bought them. I was a bit disappointed because sometimes I really just want to lengthen my hair because my curl pattern is so Shirley Temple tight but unfortunately this didn&#x27;t cut it. Also when you squeeze the product ALOT comes out so be careful you don&#x27;t squeeze it too hard or you&#x27;ll end up with alot more than you needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still on the lookout for a curling creme. Oh the woes of a curly haired gal.</li>
            <li> I brought this product along with three other products. John Frieda unwind curls works the best! It defines my curls and keeps the frizz out.</li>
            <li> Love John Freida and this product</li>
            <li> For years I have been looking for a product to keep my hair from frizzing.  This calming creme is as close as I have gotten.  Not 100% yet, but very close.  Hopefully one day a product will be perfected for unruly hair like mine.</li>
            <li> this really dries my hair out. I have light brown curly hair &amp; just want something to keep flyaways in check. Loreal Vive Pro Smooth Gloss Anti-Frizz Cream was always my go-to but my supermarket doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore. they just got Loreal Everstyle Smooth &amp; Shine Creme &amp; that works pretty good. I got this John Frieda one in the mean-time but it didn&#x27;t work out. I notice there&#x27;s alcohol in it, which may explain the bad effect it seemed to have on my hair.</li>
            <li> This product works very well on unruly hair.  It takes the frizz out and makes the curl smooth and silky.  This product also has a very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this after spotting it in the drugstore. I later ordered it here and was anxious to try it out during this hot, humid summer we&#x27;ve been having. I have poofy, wavy hair with random curls that are anything but calm. My hair is thin but can get BIG when it is very humid. I typically just pull it back in the summer because I can&#x27;t be bothered with fighting it. \&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is fairly lightweight and easy to work through the hair. It does seem to help tame the frizz a bit and make my hair more manageable but it stops short of actually making my curls stop having a mind of their own. Perhaps the effects will be more pronounced in the fall and winter when it&#x27;s much less humid. Still, I quite like it, and the size is very generous for the price. I use it daily and enjoy how it doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh my hair down or make it appear greasy.</li>
            <li> Best product for freeze ever! It&#x27;s cheap and the result is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Finally I found my perfect products !!!!</li>
            <li> i liked the hold it gave my hair</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have curly hair and leave a little in my hair and get frizz free curls.</li>
            <li> I have been using this frizz ease for a few weeks now and I love it!  It really does keep my hair smoother without the frizzies!  Some products leave your hair feeling hard, like you&#x27;ve sprayed a weeks worth of hair spray on but not this product!  I will be ordering some more of this product for sure! I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I always apply the serum first. This goes on second.  They work really well together for anyone with curly hair!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for my naturally curly hair. It works well year round and gives me great curls and style.</li>
            <li> Keeps my nappy hair tamed all day.</li>
            <li> I like this product quite a bit. Certiany tames the frizz and you need very little to make it work.</li>
