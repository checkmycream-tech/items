    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Awesome...</li>
            <li>but it is great in a pinch!</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully to kill the leg fuzz, and I have PLENTY to kill.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>All in all, not the best option out there.</li>
            <li>This is the best shaver my wife has ever owned bar</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>This is the best lady razor I have found!</li>
            <li>Works awesome, does not nick!</li>
            <li>The charger, power, and guard make it especially perfect.</li>
            <li>The intercept works best for the bikini line, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted an electric razor</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to shave in the shower and this is perfect for me, although it works in the shower too.  </li>
            <li>Best Remington shaver I have owned yet!</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that is not the case with this razor!  </li>
            <li>It is so wonderful!</li>
            <li>It seems to me a well constructed piece of equipment, and my wife thinks it&#x27;s a very good shaver.</li>
            <li>This shaver is proving to be a very good choice for me.</li>
            <li>I bought it over a year ago, and it has been working great.</li>
            <li>Great shaver and a great value for the price.</li>
            <li>A great alternative to razor blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shaver on legs and underarms and have been extremely happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for when I don&#x27;t have time to shower and shave, to just get rid of the visible hair and be on my way with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Great product, and a great price.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t do that great a job on my legs</li>
            <li>I find that it gives a great shave on your underarms and legs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Ideally, this shaver woiuld be used after a shower, after a good exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product and think you will be too.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re hoping to replace your blade with this electric razor, you won&#x27;t get as good of results.</li>
            <li>razor does not do a good of shaving my legs.</li>
            <li>shaving is excellent and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this Remington Smooth and Silky shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor is well made and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>Good for legs but not underarms.</li>
            <li>guard this shaver comes is especially nice for *those* special areas where you just want to remove bulk.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this Remington</li>
            <li>My wife used this to good effect while we had it, and its become kind of a staple for her now.</li>
            <li>This is, by no means, a great shaver, but as far as women&#x27;s shavers go, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The $20 shaver was SO much better than this one!</li>
            <li>Shaves nice.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, I don&#x27;t think any electric shaver will give you as close a shave as a manual razor, but the Remington is a good alternative if you&#x27;re OK with a semi-close shave.</li>
            <li>So when I had a chance to try this shaver, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>Whats the point of even buying a nice shaver if it looks like you didnt shave at all?</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that the Panasonic features a button that extends the trimmer for the longer hairs.  </li>
            <li>I have two Remington hair dryers, a Remington straightener (best straightener ever), and an older Remington electric razor, but this one just did not do it for me.</li>
            <li>It would be worth spending more to get a better electric razor, or stick with the trusty Gillette Fusion, the best of the non-electrics in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to comfortably shave my underarm area and it didn&#x27;t do that great a job when I did.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice light weight shaver that feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>However, the razor really is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, I think this product is ideal for the certain type of shaver</li>
            <li>It worked ok on my legs, but for some reason wouldnt even TRIM bikini, never mind a shave of any kind.</li>
            <li>so far so good, it is beautiful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so easy to use and no razor burn after I shave!</li>
            <li>The best model I found and works very well, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>This foil shaver does a great job at first.</li>
            <li>First time I used it on my legs, worked great</li>
            <li>but I am fine with it because unless someone rubs my leg, no one will know!</li>
            <li>Easy to use does a great job and really easy to clean</li>
            <li>and I love that she is not using a razor</li>
            <li>So it really didn&#x27;t do great for anything I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I have been using razor blades to shave for most of my life.</li>
            <li>It has a better charge than most</li>
            <li>There ARE reasons for favoring an electric (maybe a razor gives you ingrown hairs, for example), but for most women, this just isn&#x27;t going to cut it</li>
            <li>When it was operable, it would get rid of most of the hair.</li>
            <li>Having never used an electric shaver before, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>Okay, let&#x27;s get started.  </li>
            <li>I was more dismayed when I put on my deodorant, and had to deal with the stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife likes it better than any she has ever tried.</li>
            <li>To top that off, razor burn galore.</li>
            <li>Does a better job, too.</li>
            <li>I am not overly impressed with it for several reasons.  </li>
            <li>so I like the Panasonic charger better, but if you have sideways outlets or your outlets are under your medicine cabinet or another obstruction</li>
            <li>I still own my original Remington shaved purchased 50 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Just BARELY not as close as your best, sharpest razor OR waxing.</li>
            <li>nice clean shave . .</li>
            <li>This shaver is for those who are okay with not achieving a *perfect* close shave, but want a simple, easy, painless way to remove body hair.</li>
            <li>The shaver is very light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Great product so far with a good price that s worth to pay</li>
            <li>This Remington women&#x27;s shaver is actually pretty good for a women&#x27;s shaver.  </li>
            <li>First, the good.</li>
            <li>Best dry shaver ever used!</li>
            <li>It does not scratch the skin like Panasonic and it gives silky smooth effect that I love.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However this turned out to be a great razor for my 13 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I decided to give the Remington Women&#x27;s Smooth &amp; Silky Foil Shaver a try, and I am so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a person who is sensitive to nickel, I can happily say Remington did not use nickel in the screens</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you put it in the charger correctly and that the light is on.</li>
            <li>I typically love Remington products and always, always buy that brand if it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>Not awful bit was not super impressed.  </li>
            <li>34;NOTE:  For best results, make sure that the area is clean, dry and free from creams or oils.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huh?  </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve been impressed by other Remington products, this is not one of the items that I would recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this shaver I&#x27;m very pleased with how smooth my legs feel!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not expecting epilator results, but if I can still easily grab hairs with a tweezer it&#x27;s just not doing the job.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works perfectly -- it&#x27;s easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very quick and efficient.</li>
            <li>The charger is nice and helps makes sure that the shaver can charge often, and thus is always ready to go.</li>
            <li>It worked fine for over a year, but one of the foil parts came off, and I can&#x27;t fix it.  </li>
            <li>It still works just fine, but it is getting on in age (as I am-74).  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still very convenient, and so I&#x27;m glad I have it!</li>
            <li>The product is easy to grasp, and relatively easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>When I have opened the top to clean it out, there has been nothing inside to clean.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this shaver!</li>
            <li>I see huge difference.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of this shaver.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as easy to clean as I&#x27;d like to.</li>
            <li>The shave was not quite smooth</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver when my cheap Panasonic Wet/Dry died.</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t be smooth.</li>
            <li>This a very nice-looking razor, with a nice charging stand.</li>
            <li>: Overall, not that great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m bummed because I really wanted a nice wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li>Smooth shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight but not flimsy or cheap feeling.</li>
            <li>I have basically shaved my entire body, including my lady parts without any pain and great results.</li>
            <li>Women&#x27;s Smooth and Silky Foil Shaver.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as a Venus razor, better than those yellow Bics.</li>
            <li>The Remington charger sits on the counter while the Panasonic charger is a cube you plug in and the shaver sits right on top.</li>
            <li>I broke with that habit and used this shaver for two weeks, shaving every other day, and am pleased to say that I have experienced no problems.  </li>
            <li>It took too many passes to get rid of the hair (the older model...despite being purchased 3 years ago still works better) and I don&#x27;t like the bulkiness of this in my hand</li>
            <li>My thought process was it would be good to have an electric shaver for those days when you need to shave your legs right quick and don&#x27;t have time to shave with a manual razor; however, I quickly discovered that I liked the convenience of the electric shaver so much that I became an avid user.</li>
            <li>If you really don&#x27;t have much time or motivation to do a good detailed job in the shower, but just want a quick easy way to shave every once in a while with an electric shaver, then I think this product is for you.</li>
            <li>I have always purchased Remington shavers in the past, and they have always been the best.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It works great in the shower and as a dry shaver as well.</li>
            <li>A gift to someone special who never before used an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I use it mainly to shave my legs, and it is doing a good, close job and holding a charge very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found, when shaving my legs, that this shaver does best going over a spot 2-3 times then once again pressing fairly hard.</li>
            <li>B00BB5YHEI a GREAT men&#x27;s Remington]], which actually gives a pretty close shave.  </li>
            <li>shaver is truly amazing and completely exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I really like this razor better than any I have owned.  </li>
            <li>Both offer a similar level of closeness, as good as you can expect from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always have time to epilate and wanted a shaving option for quick touch-ups.</li>
            <li>I still love Remington, but I&#x27;ll stick to my older model.</li>
            <li>If all you want is a quick touch up to stubble level, that&#x27;s about all I can recommend this for.</li>
            <li>Customer service is top notch, answering the phone without even waiting, so I highly recommend this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I expected a good product from Remington and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor in my life and like I do with most new things I viewed it with probably an unreasonable amount of terror.</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;ll give it a try with the apparently better method, dry shaving.  </li>
            <li>so have only used it dry, and I&#x27;m very happy with</li>
            <li>not as easy to use as my old one, but good enough.</li>
            <li>Still isn&#x27;t as good as a wet shave</li>
            <li>It is totally worth your money.</li>
            <li>shaver gives a nice close shave and keeps its charge the entire time I use it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s lightweight and comfortable to hold, it works well to trim the bikini area, it can be used wet or dry, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and it gives a better shave than most women&#x27;s shavers.  </li>
            <li>The price was right and it was everything that I was looking for in an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I had tried electric shavers in the past and they were OK, but I was never too thrilled with them.</li>
            <li>I am able to get a silky smooth shave, and it&#x27;s so much easier than a traditional blade.  </li>
            <li>the beach, I still use a manual razor but most other days the Remington does just fine.</li>
            <li>and I got a very very close shave just as close as I would of with a disposable razor</li>
            <li>As with most electric shavers, you don&#x27;t get as close of a shave as you would with a regular shaver.</li>
            <li>So if I want a really close shave, then I will use a regular razor, but if I&#x27;m in a big hurry, this one is great.</li>
            <li>First, since I am 66 but not Suzanne Somers, there will be no review of the bikini trimmer attachment and ditto for using this shaver in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I used the Remington exactly as I had used my Panasonic, with some shave gel to help prevent burn.</li>
            <li>It left my skin more inflamed than I have ever seen, and took a lot of lidocaine and lanolin to extinguish the flames.</li>
            <li>Some shavers are &amp;#34;linear&amp;#34; meaning that they work just as well on low battery as on fully charged, but this one is definitely better immediately after charging.</li>
            <li>And the first time I used it, it took me a while to get the job done.</li>
            <li>first time I used this, it did both well.</li>
            <li>First off, to start the shaver you push the button in and THEN up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used a Remington shaver for years and it also had an intercept trimmer which shaves off the longer hair first.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants close, clean shaves without using a blade razor.</li>
            <li>(I prefer models that are more flat).</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d say this is a nice razor for a young teen, but if you&#x27;re use to the a closer shave, you won&#x27;t find it replaces your blade razor.</li>
            <li>first used this razor dry and was generally pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>(they&#x27;re very sensitive), but I was actually surprised that this shaver did NOT pinch me in the bikini area, which I&#x27;ve experienced with every other electric shaver I&#x27;ve tried (including men&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, it&#x27;s not NEARLY as close as shaving with a razor, and it takes a lot more time.  </li>
            <li>It gives a pretty close shave, not quite as close as a disposable but very acceptable.</li>
            <li>First of all, you really must be in the market for this TYPE of shaver to appreciate this one.</li>
            <li>I would think many women are into basic, decent shavers, however, and if that is the case with you--I can&#x27;t find a reason not to recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She likes it quite a bit and finds it easy enough for her to use.</li>
            <li>and I thought the newer model might be less effective but it works just as well, even under the arms.  </li>
            <li>And for legs, this just doesn&#x27;t get that close shave like a real &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier, safer and quicker to use than a manual</li>
            <li>makes for a fast touch up</li>
            <li>Moreover, this shaver holds a charge really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing I really don&#x27;t like about this shaver is the aloe strip.  </li>
            <li>women have noted that this shaver pulls their hair and pinches (cuts) their skin when trimming longer hairs (especially in sensitive areas).  </li>
            <li>Secondly, to avoid irritation and pulling, Remington recommends that the foils and cutters be replaced every 6 months; I called their customer service, 1-800-392-6544, and when this part becomes available, it will sell in the neighborhood of $24.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a very comprehensive use and care guide with the razor.  </li>
            <li>I do like the wet/dry function as I find it very convenient.  </li>
            <li>After charging overnight, you are ready to rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thing to keep in mind is that the foils don&#x27;t handle longer hairs very well.</li>
            <li>Really like the Remington shaver.  </li>
            <li>so it may work better wet, which I haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
            <li>much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry</li>
            <li>, the charger is very convenient and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instead of shaving it just leaves you with hair everywhere no matter how much I press it against my legs.</li>
            <li>I really like that addition.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much I used that feature until I didn&#x27;t have it.  </li>
            <li>and they were fast to respond and told me what I was doing wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very useful, especially as I am on a blood thinner and am not supposed to use a razor.</li>
            <li>The Remington cannot get a very close shave dry without a feeling of razor burn, but it&#x27;s great for touch-ups, or in Subject B&#x27;s case, shaving while watching TV and house-sitting.</li>
            <li>However, what I do like about this one, is that it was very easy to set up, and once you put it on the charger for the initial 24 hours, it has a pretty long life.</li>
            <li>Well enough that my original review was four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Remington also lists on Amazon for approximately twice the price of the Panasonic, so that may not be surprising; but it&#x27;s still a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It requires multiple passes in all areas just to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for my legs and under arms dry, and found that I got a little razor burn under one of my arms, but it was great on my legs.</li>
            <li>With a full charge, I can use it multiple times between charging sessions.</li>
            <li>Remigton get so close to the skin that it cuts very well the hair even long hair without special attachments.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe this thing, despite its own instructions, will do better with shaving in the shower, but I&#x27;m not willing to give it the benefit of the doubt, at least, not until my armpits heal.  </li>
            <li>The new one works very well</li>
            <li>Overall I can&#x27;t see spending money on this especially since my favorite bikini razor sells for about $10.</li>
            <li>The older model had a wall charger that the razor balanced upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hoping this one would be better because it was more expensive</li>
            <li>I recommend using this shaver while wet and with shaving cream or soap; when I shaved with just water it definitely wasn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>then I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>For just a little more money, you could get [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It contours nicely around curves and knees, gives a really close shave and seriously doesn&#x27;t miss hairs.</li>
            <li>That is not explained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only somewhat daunted by the irritation to my legs, I went on to my clean, dry underarms.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It shaves smooth and virtually glides over the skin when used wet.</li>
            <li>It shaves smoothly and has held the charge for longer than I ever expected.</li>
            <li>You have to really go over a spot a few times to get a smooth cut, but that&#x27;s not really the point of using electric razors, they never get your skin completely smooth.</li>
            <li>I found that I had to go back over the same area over and over again to get it even passably smooth.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to wax</li>
            <li>I purchased my first electric shaver about 5 years ago as an after thought while out shopping at a local store.</li>
            <li>(I particularly like the cap you can clip on to just trim and thin), and it could possibly be useful for a quick touch-up (sometimes you don&#x27;t realize until AFTER your shower that you really needed to shave).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other electric shavers before and so far this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I tried to complete registration on the Remington website and found that this model was not listed yet because it is a new model, so I had to e-mail their customer service department with the information instead.</li>
            <li>So, for me (your mileage may vary, apparently), this is a decent trimmer for the bikini area</li>
            <li>We had not charged it for 24 hours straight before using it, and maybe we were setting it in its cradle incorrectly, but I would&#x27;ve expected it to not require that much charge to make it 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s sad, because Remington used to make only great products.</li>
            <li>I prefer to have my counter space clear</li>
            <li>purchased this for my 12 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>I bought this about 4 months ago and yesterday the battery just died completely.....</li>
            <li>Totally painless and really convenient.  </li>
            <li>How could an aloe strip POSSIBLY last, even if it were real?  </li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive, so my pattern has been to limit shaving my armpits and legs to weekly to avoid irritations and infections.  </li>
            <li>In fact, my skin does feel soft, but I would not say that the shaver is closer than using a blade.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so old</li>
            <li>I knew what to expect as far as closeness of shave, etc.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t trim as close as an old school razor.</li>
            <li>But after using it for a month, I definitely prefer it to disposable razors--and it doesn&#x27;t really take any longer than shaving with a razor</li>
            <li>As far as I could tell, the aloe strip did nothing.  </li>
            <li>And there is no way I&#x27;m letting this thing near my &amp;#34;bikini</li>
            <li>The only drawback, as it does provide a comfortable shave, she said it died in the middle of her shower several times.</li>
            <li>I thought I was done with one leg and noticed I was far from it.  </li>
            <li>The package must be completely destroyed to get the razor out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a gift for my mom and she loves it because her old panasonic just stopped working.</li>
            <li>Remington shaver works really very well in that it gets a lot of hair off when you go over spots multiple times.</li>
            <li>Completely ineffectual.</li>
            <li>Because I trim daily it should have done a decent job, but it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Subject B with the fine blonde hair</li>
            <li>It is a smaller patch of strips in front of the first blade, not the wider multiple strips between that blade and the roller-shaped ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the older model the intercept trimmer sticks out further over the edge</li>
            <li>My older one has lasted so long, I can&#x27;t tell you how old it</li>
            <li>It would seem simple enough, with the large purple button on the front.</li>
            <li>I much prefer to use it dry after my shower.</li>
            <li>When I use this shaver and press fairly hard on the final (3-4 run) then it gets as close of a shave as most basic razors.</li>
            <li>and I like it generally.</li>
            <li>The shaver felt mildly irritating as I shaved my legs, but it did a decent job, not as close as a manual razor but not bad.  </li>
            <li>I had to change back to my old shaver in the middle of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Under the first arm, I felt a little pinch.  </li>
            <li>The only downside to the razor is that it is a bit hard to clean.</li>
            <li>We tested this razor out on two hair types: One coarse, dark, and quick growing (Subject A), the other blonde and fine (Subject B).</li>
            <li>I much prefered the way my previous Remington charged.</li>
            <li>Something about the sting of a single hair being pulled unexpectedly on the leg always makes me then dread using the razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I let my hair get a little too long, I first go over it with the trimmer, then the foils.</li>
            <li>product information states that the foils and blades should be replaced every 6 months, which seems like a gross generalization since they can&#x27;t know how much or how little I use the shaver.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Awesome...</li>
            <li> but it is great in a pinch!</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully to kill the leg fuzz, and I have PLENTY to kill.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product!</li>
            <li> All in all, not the best option out there.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver my wife has ever owned bar</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> This is the best lady razor I have found!</li>
            <li> Works awesome, does not nick!</li>
            <li> The charger, power, and guard make it especially perfect.</li>
            <li> The intercept works best for the bikini line, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted an electric razor</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to shave in the shower and this is perfect for me, although it works in the shower too.  </li>
            <li> Best Remington shaver I have owned yet!</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that is not the case with this razor!  </li>
            <li> It is so wonderful!</li>
            <li> It seems to me a well constructed piece of equipment, and my wife thinks it&#x27;s a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver is proving to be a very good choice for me.</li>
            <li> I bought it over a year ago, and it has been working great.</li>
            <li> Great shaver and a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> A great alternative to razor blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver on legs and underarms and have been extremely happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for when I don&#x27;t have time to shower and shave, to just get rid of the visible hair and be on my way with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Great product, and a great price.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t do that great a job on my legs</li>
            <li> I find that it gives a great shave on your underarms and legs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Ideally, this shaver woiuld be used after a shower, after a good exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product and think you will be too.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re hoping to replace your blade with this electric razor, you won&#x27;t get as good of results.</li>
            <li> razor does not do a good of shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> shaving is excellent and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this Remington Smooth and Silky shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor is well made and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> Good for legs but not underarms.</li>
            <li> guard this shaver comes is especially nice for *those* special areas where you just want to remove bulk.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this Remington</li>
            <li> My wife used this to good effect while we had it, and its become kind of a staple for her now.</li>
            <li> This is, by no means, a great shaver, but as far as women&#x27;s shavers go, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The $20 shaver was SO much better than this one!</li>
            <li> Shaves nice.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, I don&#x27;t think any electric shaver will give you as close a shave as a manual razor, but the Remington is a good alternative if you&#x27;re OK with a semi-close shave.</li>
            <li> So when I had a chance to try this shaver, I was thrilled.</li>
            <li> Whats the point of even buying a nice shaver if it looks like you didnt shave at all?</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that the Panasonic features a button that extends the trimmer for the longer hairs.  </li>
            <li> I have two Remington hair dryers, a Remington straightener (best straightener ever), and an older Remington electric razor, but this one just did not do it for me.</li>
            <li> It would be worth spending more to get a better electric razor, or stick with the trusty Gillette Fusion, the best of the non-electrics in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to comfortably shave my underarm area and it didn&#x27;t do that great a job when I did.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice light weight shaver that feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> However, the razor really is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I think this product is ideal for the certain type of shaver</li>
            <li> It worked ok on my legs, but for some reason wouldnt even TRIM bikini, never mind a shave of any kind.</li>
            <li> so far so good, it is beautiful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so easy to use and no razor burn after I shave!</li>
            <li> The best model I found and works very well, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> This foil shaver does a great job at first.</li>
            <li> First time I used it on my legs, worked great</li>
            <li> but I am fine with it because unless someone rubs my leg, no one will know!</li>
            <li> Easy to use does a great job and really easy to clean</li>
            <li> and I love that she is not using a razor</li>
            <li> So it really didn&#x27;t do great for anything I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I have been using razor blades to shave for most of my life.</li>
            <li> It has a better charge than most</li>
            <li> There ARE reasons for favoring an electric (maybe a razor gives you ingrown hairs, for example), but for most women, this just isn&#x27;t going to cut it</li>
            <li> When it was operable, it would get rid of most of the hair.</li>
            <li> Having never used an electric shaver before, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> Okay, let&#x27;s get started.  </li>
            <li> I was more dismayed when I put on my deodorant, and had to deal with the stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife likes it better than any she has ever tried.</li>
            <li> To top that off, razor burn galore.</li>
            <li> Does a better job, too.</li>
            <li> I am not overly impressed with it for several reasons.  </li>
            <li> so I like the Panasonic charger better, but if you have sideways outlets or your outlets are under your medicine cabinet or another obstruction</li>
            <li> I still own my original Remington shaved purchased 50 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Just BARELY not as close as your best, sharpest razor OR waxing.</li>
            <li> nice clean shave . .</li>
            <li> This shaver is for those who are okay with not achieving a *perfect* close shave, but want a simple, easy, painless way to remove body hair.</li>
            <li> The shaver is very light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Great product so far with a good price that s worth to pay</li>
            <li> This Remington women&#x27;s shaver is actually pretty good for a women&#x27;s shaver.  </li>
            <li> First, the good.</li>
            <li> Best dry shaver ever used!</li>
            <li> It does not scratch the skin like Panasonic and it gives silky smooth effect that I love.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However this turned out to be a great razor for my 13 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> I decided to give the Remington Women&#x27;s Smooth &amp; Silky Foil Shaver a try, and I am so glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a person who is sensitive to nickel, I can happily say Remington did not use nickel in the screens</li>
            <li> Just make sure that you put it in the charger correctly and that the light is on.</li>
            <li> I typically love Remington products and always, always buy that brand if it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> Not awful bit was not super impressed.  </li>
            <li> 34;NOTE:  For best results, make sure that the area is clean, dry and free from creams or oils.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huh?  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve been impressed by other Remington products, this is not one of the items that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this shaver I&#x27;m very pleased with how smooth my legs feel!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not expecting epilator results, but if I can still easily grab hairs with a tweezer it&#x27;s just not doing the job.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works perfectly -- it&#x27;s easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very quick and efficient.</li>
            <li> The charger is nice and helps makes sure that the shaver can charge often, and thus is always ready to go.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for over a year, but one of the foil parts came off, and I can&#x27;t fix it.  </li>
            <li> It still works just fine, but it is getting on in age (as I am-74).  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still very convenient, and so I&#x27;m glad I have it!</li>
            <li> The product is easy to grasp, and relatively easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> When I have opened the top to clean it out, there has been nothing inside to clean.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this shaver!</li>
            <li> I see huge difference.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of this shaver.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as easy to clean as I&#x27;d like to.</li>
            <li> The shave was not quite smooth</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver when my cheap Panasonic Wet/Dry died.</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t be smooth.</li>
            <li> This a very nice-looking razor, with a nice charging stand.</li>
            <li> : Overall, not that great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bummed because I really wanted a nice wet/dry shaver.</li>
            <li> Smooth shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight but not flimsy or cheap feeling.</li>
            <li> I have basically shaved my entire body, including my lady parts without any pain and great results.</li>
            <li> Women&#x27;s Smooth and Silky Foil Shaver.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as a Venus razor, better than those yellow Bics.</li>
            <li> The Remington charger sits on the counter while the Panasonic charger is a cube you plug in and the shaver sits right on top.</li>
            <li> I broke with that habit and used this shaver for two weeks, shaving every other day, and am pleased to say that I have experienced no problems.  </li>
            <li> It took too many passes to get rid of the hair (the older model...despite being purchased 3 years ago still works better) and I don&#x27;t like the bulkiness of this in my hand</li>
            <li> My thought process was it would be good to have an electric shaver for those days when you need to shave your legs right quick and don&#x27;t have time to shave with a manual razor; however, I quickly discovered that I liked the convenience of the electric shaver so much that I became an avid user.</li>
            <li> If you really don&#x27;t have much time or motivation to do a good detailed job in the shower, but just want a quick easy way to shave every once in a while with an electric shaver, then I think this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased Remington shavers in the past, and they have always been the best.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It works great in the shower and as a dry shaver as well.</li>
            <li> A gift to someone special who never before used an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I use it mainly to shave my legs, and it is doing a good, close job and holding a charge very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found, when shaving my legs, that this shaver does best going over a spot 2-3 times then once again pressing fairly hard.</li>
            <li> B00BB5YHEI a GREAT men&#x27;s Remington]], which actually gives a pretty close shave.  </li>
            <li> shaver is truly amazing and completely exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor better than any I have owned.  </li>
            <li> Both offer a similar level of closeness, as good as you can expect from an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always have time to epilate and wanted a shaving option for quick touch-ups.</li>
            <li> I still love Remington, but I&#x27;ll stick to my older model.</li>
            <li> If all you want is a quick touch up to stubble level, that&#x27;s about all I can recommend this for.</li>
            <li> Customer service is top notch, answering the phone without even waiting, so I highly recommend this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I expected a good product from Remington and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor in my life and like I do with most new things I viewed it with probably an unreasonable amount of terror.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ll give it a try with the apparently better method, dry shaving.  </li>
            <li> so have only used it dry, and I&#x27;m very happy with</li>
            <li> not as easy to use as my old one, but good enough.</li>
            <li> Still isn&#x27;t as good as a wet shave</li>
            <li> It is totally worth your money.</li>
            <li> shaver gives a nice close shave and keeps its charge the entire time I use it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s lightweight and comfortable to hold, it works well to trim the bikini area, it can be used wet or dry, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and it gives a better shave than most women&#x27;s shavers.  </li>
            <li> The price was right and it was everything that I was looking for in an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I had tried electric shavers in the past and they were OK, but I was never too thrilled with them.</li>
            <li> I am able to get a silky smooth shave, and it&#x27;s so much easier than a traditional blade.  </li>
            <li> the beach, I still use a manual razor but most other days the Remington does just fine.</li>
            <li> and I got a very very close shave just as close as I would of with a disposable razor</li>
            <li> As with most electric shavers, you don&#x27;t get as close of a shave as you would with a regular shaver.</li>
            <li> So if I want a really close shave, then I will use a regular razor, but if I&#x27;m in a big hurry, this one is great.</li>
            <li> First, since I am 66 but not Suzanne Somers, there will be no review of the bikini trimmer attachment and ditto for using this shaver in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I used the Remington exactly as I had used my Panasonic, with some shave gel to help prevent burn.</li>
            <li> It left my skin more inflamed than I have ever seen, and took a lot of lidocaine and lanolin to extinguish the flames.</li>
            <li> Some shavers are &amp;#34;linear&amp;#34; meaning that they work just as well on low battery as on fully charged, but this one is definitely better immediately after charging.</li>
            <li> And the first time I used it, it took me a while to get the job done.</li>
            <li> first time I used this, it did both well.</li>
            <li> First off, to start the shaver you push the button in and THEN up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a Remington shaver for years and it also had an intercept trimmer which shaves off the longer hair first.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants close, clean shaves without using a blade razor.</li>
            <li> (I prefer models that are more flat).</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d say this is a nice razor for a young teen, but if you&#x27;re use to the a closer shave, you won&#x27;t find it replaces your blade razor.</li>
            <li> first used this razor dry and was generally pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> (they&#x27;re very sensitive), but I was actually surprised that this shaver did NOT pinch me in the bikini area, which I&#x27;ve experienced with every other electric shaver I&#x27;ve tried (including men&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s not NEARLY as close as shaving with a razor, and it takes a lot more time.  </li>
            <li> It gives a pretty close shave, not quite as close as a disposable but very acceptable.</li>
            <li> First of all, you really must be in the market for this TYPE of shaver to appreciate this one.</li>
            <li> I would think many women are into basic, decent shavers, however, and if that is the case with you--I can&#x27;t find a reason not to recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She likes it quite a bit and finds it easy enough for her to use.</li>
            <li> and I thought the newer model might be less effective but it works just as well, even under the arms.  </li>
            <li> And for legs, this just doesn&#x27;t get that close shave like a real &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier, safer and quicker to use than a manual</li>
            <li> makes for a fast touch up</li>
            <li> Moreover, this shaver holds a charge really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing I really don&#x27;t like about this shaver is the aloe strip.  </li>
            <li> women have noted that this shaver pulls their hair and pinches (cuts) their skin when trimming longer hairs (especially in sensitive areas).  </li>
            <li> Secondly, to avoid irritation and pulling, Remington recommends that the foils and cutters be replaced every 6 months; I called their customer service, 1-800-392-6544, and when this part becomes available, it will sell in the neighborhood of $24.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a very comprehensive use and care guide with the razor.  </li>
            <li> I do like the wet/dry function as I find it very convenient.  </li>
            <li> After charging overnight, you are ready to rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thing to keep in mind is that the foils don&#x27;t handle longer hairs very well.</li>
            <li> Really like the Remington shaver.  </li>
            <li> so it may work better wet, which I haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
            <li> much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry</li>
            <li> , the charger is very convenient and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instead of shaving it just leaves you with hair everywhere no matter how much I press it against my legs.</li>
            <li> I really like that addition.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much I used that feature until I didn&#x27;t have it.  </li>
            <li> and they were fast to respond and told me what I was doing wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very useful, especially as I am on a blood thinner and am not supposed to use a razor.</li>
            <li> The Remington cannot get a very close shave dry without a feeling of razor burn, but it&#x27;s great for touch-ups, or in Subject B&#x27;s case, shaving while watching TV and house-sitting.</li>
            <li> However, what I do like about this one, is that it was very easy to set up, and once you put it on the charger for the initial 24 hours, it has a pretty long life.</li>
            <li> Well enough that my original review was four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Remington also lists on Amazon for approximately twice the price of the Panasonic, so that may not be surprising; but it&#x27;s still a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It requires multiple passes in all areas just to get a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for my legs and under arms dry, and found that I got a little razor burn under one of my arms, but it was great on my legs.</li>
            <li> With a full charge, I can use it multiple times between charging sessions.</li>
            <li> Remigton get so close to the skin that it cuts very well the hair even long hair without special attachments.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe this thing, despite its own instructions, will do better with shaving in the shower, but I&#x27;m not willing to give it the benefit of the doubt, at least, not until my armpits heal.  </li>
            <li> The new one works very well</li>
            <li> Overall I can&#x27;t see spending money on this especially since my favorite bikini razor sells for about $10.</li>
            <li> The older model had a wall charger that the razor balanced upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping this one would be better because it was more expensive</li>
            <li> I recommend using this shaver while wet and with shaving cream or soap; when I shaved with just water it definitely wasn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> then I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> For just a little more money, you could get [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It contours nicely around curves and knees, gives a really close shave and seriously doesn&#x27;t miss hairs.</li>
            <li> That is not explained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only somewhat daunted by the irritation to my legs, I went on to my clean, dry underarms.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It shaves smooth and virtually glides over the skin when used wet.</li>
            <li> It shaves smoothly and has held the charge for longer than I ever expected.</li>
            <li> You have to really go over a spot a few times to get a smooth cut, but that&#x27;s not really the point of using electric razors, they never get your skin completely smooth.</li>
            <li> I found that I had to go back over the same area over and over again to get it even passably smooth.  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to wax</li>
            <li> I purchased my first electric shaver about 5 years ago as an after thought while out shopping at a local store.</li>
            <li> (I particularly like the cap you can clip on to just trim and thin), and it could possibly be useful for a quick touch-up (sometimes you don&#x27;t realize until AFTER your shower that you really needed to shave).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other electric shavers before and so far this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I tried to complete registration on the Remington website and found that this model was not listed yet because it is a new model, so I had to e-mail their customer service department with the information instead.</li>
            <li> So, for me (your mileage may vary, apparently), this is a decent trimmer for the bikini area</li>
            <li> We had not charged it for 24 hours straight before using it, and maybe we were setting it in its cradle incorrectly, but I would&#x27;ve expected it to not require that much charge to make it 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s sad, because Remington used to make only great products.</li>
            <li> I prefer to have my counter space clear</li>
            <li> purchased this for my 12 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 4 months ago and yesterday the battery just died completely.....</li>
            <li> Totally painless and really convenient.  </li>
            <li> How could an aloe strip POSSIBLY last, even if it were real?  </li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive, so my pattern has been to limit shaving my armpits and legs to weekly to avoid irritations and infections.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my skin does feel soft, but I would not say that the shaver is closer than using a blade.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so old</li>
            <li> I knew what to expect as far as closeness of shave, etc.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t trim as close as an old school razor.</li>
            <li> But after using it for a month, I definitely prefer it to disposable razors--and it doesn&#x27;t really take any longer than shaving with a razor</li>
            <li> As far as I could tell, the aloe strip did nothing.  </li>
            <li> And there is no way I&#x27;m letting this thing near my &amp;#34;bikini</li>
            <li> The only drawback, as it does provide a comfortable shave, she said it died in the middle of her shower several times.</li>
            <li> I thought I was done with one leg and noticed I was far from it.  </li>
            <li> The package must be completely destroyed to get the razor out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my mom and she loves it because her old panasonic just stopped working.</li>
            <li> Remington shaver works really very well in that it gets a lot of hair off when you go over spots multiple times.</li>
            <li> Completely ineffectual.</li>
            <li> Because I trim daily it should have done a decent job, but it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Subject B with the fine blonde hair</li>
            <li> It is a smaller patch of strips in front of the first blade, not the wider multiple strips between that blade and the roller-shaped ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the older model the intercept trimmer sticks out further over the edge</li>
            <li> My older one has lasted so long, I can&#x27;t tell you how old it</li>
            <li> It would seem simple enough, with the large purple button on the front.</li>
            <li> I much prefer to use it dry after my shower.</li>
            <li> When I use this shaver and press fairly hard on the final (3-4 run) then it gets as close of a shave as most basic razors.</li>
            <li> and I like it generally.</li>
            <li> The shaver felt mildly irritating as I shaved my legs, but it did a decent job, not as close as a manual razor but not bad.  </li>
            <li> I had to change back to my old shaver in the middle of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Under the first arm, I felt a little pinch.  </li>
            <li> The only downside to the razor is that it is a bit hard to clean.</li>
            <li> We tested this razor out on two hair types: One coarse, dark, and quick growing (Subject A), the other blonde and fine (Subject B).</li>
            <li> I much prefered the way my previous Remington charged.</li>
            <li> Something about the sting of a single hair being pulled unexpectedly on the leg always makes me then dread using the razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I let my hair get a little too long, I first go over it with the trimmer, then the foils.</li>
            <li> product information states that the foils and blades should be replaced every 6 months, which seems like a gross generalization since they can&#x27;t know how much or how little I use the shaver.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get to try out this Remington Smooth and Silky Foil Shaver, however, it was a little bit of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I HAD TO REDUCE MY RATING BECAUSE THIS RAZOR IS STARTING TO DULL WITHIN THE FIRST MONTH OF USE</li>
            <li> Both are cordless, rechargeable and can be used wet or dry, but for the performance the Panasonic is the clear choice for me.</li>
            <li> Subject A. Remington states the battery charge will last 30 minutes of continuous use; so far we have had no problems with the battery.</li>
            <li> No matter what length my hair is, wet, dry, it doesn&#x27;t matter I can barely get this to trim hair at all!!!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not grooming down there till he comes home because no one will be anywhere near there till he&#x27;s home</li>
            <li> I really have nothing negative to say about this shaver.</li>
            <li> Mostly, I was afraid of slicing myself to death, somehow.</li>
            <li> Also included in this guide is the warranty, for two years; in addition, Remington offers a 60-day money back guarantee if you are not satisfied and would like a refund.</li>
            <li> I wish I would buy this product long time ago.</li>
            <li> I normally use an Epilator for my legs and a small shaver for my bikini area, but I gave up both to try this out</li>
            <li> The razor comes with a charger, and supposedly you can use it in the shower and outside of a wet environment.  </li>
            <li> It worked good for legs but nicked the crap out of my underarms.</li>
            <li> You have to press this tiny button down, then slide the larger button.</li>
            <li> If not, then a few runs over are required followed by a final run by pressing pretty hard to apply the closest shave</li>
            <li> There is actually a little white button inside of the larger button.</li>
            <li> As everyone knows, you have to handle an electric shaver a little differently than a regular blade.</li>
            <li> Then I tried it in the shower, and I didn&#x27;t get any razor burn, but I didn&#x27;t feel like I got as close of a shave as I did when I used it dry.</li>
            <li> But how could it with a dry shave?  </li>
            <li> I use it dry</li>
            <li> I just received my this Remington saver today and used it on my dry legs</li>
            <li> With all this being said though, the quality of the shave is above average and satisfactory but not anything that would make me want to &amp;#34;woo hoo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Both have a trimmer at the front to trim down longer hair so the foil part can shave the hair properly.</li>
            <li> When I tested this shaver on my legs, both wet and dry, it did not get as close as I wanted.  </li>
            <li> It works wet or dry, so you can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> razor can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Subject B then tried the razor wet, and found the shave only slighter closer.</li>
            <li> This razor has been a huge disappointment for me, I&#x27;ve used a Remington for years</li>
            <li> If it can&#x27;t remove at least the same amount of hair that I can with a regular blade...</li>
            <li> I got it wet, and it had no slickness to it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> : Our coarse-haired candidate used this razor wet, and felt it did not offer her as close a shave as her Venus razor.</li>
            <li> I spent 30 minutes on one leg alone.  </li>
            <li> and yes you have to go over it a few time&#x27;s and the last time I went over my legs</li>
            <li> What a drag.</li>
            <li> I finally killed it recently, so</li>
            <li> Both times as I shaved it felt rough.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a couple of months and absolutely no problem.  </li>
            <li> However, I am giving only four stars because it starts to give slightly lower performance as the battery starts to go down.</li>
            <li> She was a little confused as to how to turn it on at first.</li>
            <li> It shaves closer than any other razor I have had.</li>
            <li> Quieter than other Remingtons I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> This electric shaver makes me NOT want to try any other electric shavers on the market.</li>
            <li> My only small quibble is the charging cradle.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives me a closer shave than any other electric shaver I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> Much more stable base than the other shavers.</li>
            <li> Plus the occasional pulled hair tends to make me a little anxious when using it.</li>
            <li> It is hard to turn on and off - especially when used in the shower.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t press hard during that last run, then I don&#x27;t get as close of a shave as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I did prefer the Panasonic&#x27;s charger, which plugs directly into an outlet, but at least the Remington&#x27;s countertop charger has a small footprint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> and they are on average around $20.</li>
            <li> Being a slow learner, I went to the second pit and tried again.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick hair in some areas, so I cannot use this shaver without a lot of frustration.  </li>
            <li> and it is just now starting to slow down and need charging.</li>
            <li> IF you don&#x27;t mind going over the same area a few times and pressing down hard.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t shave as close to the skin as I typically like.</li>
            <li> so I have not suffered from any reactions or rashes as I have with previous razors.</li>
            <li> Subject A</li>
            <li> The closest shave we got was the equivalent of one day stubble for Subject A.</li>
            <li> I do wish it had a pop up trimmer like my previous Remington razor.</li>
            <li> I let myself heal up and tried again, slightly less burn, still so-so result.</li>
            <li> charge lasts a long time--I can go at least a week between charges.</li>
            <li> I can also see that I am going to save a lot of money because now I don&#x27;t have to buy new expensive razor blades every</li>
            <li> I put a little pressure on the shaver</li>
            <li> It arrives boxed in a very hard to open bubble package.</li>
            <li> I used this razor a few times, and it works</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s going to take longer than regular shaving and do a worse job, what&#x27;s the point?  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to rinse it off every few seconds, the hair just flies off.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I have used it to shave my legs a few times a week all month</li>
            <li> This sucker managed to give me a nasty case of razor burn, yet didn&#x27;t do a terribly good job as removing the hair.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat dismayed to see that I had little bloody spots under both arms, not blood actually seeping out but having been brought to the surface, directly under the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick hair on my legs and very sensitive skin which makes it difficult for me to shave my legs regularly without painful razor burns.</li>
            <li> After being frustrated by the lack of closeness and numerous missed hairs with several different brands I switched to disposable razors (which I hated), then eventually moved on to epilating (which is effective but time consuming and painful).</li>
            <li> I usually shave in the shower, but the instructions also state, &amp;#</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the reason I wanted to try an electric shaver because the disposable razor&#x27;s were missing spots on my legs!</li>
            <li> The cradle is small but you will need to find space for it.</li>
            <li> The Remington is not good at trimming in tight spaces, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> It is hard to hold onto there nothing to help you grip it.</li>
            <li> I could see this confusing some people at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately like every other razor I have used, it does take repeated passes to get all of the hairs under my arms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am NOT pleased with their false advertising.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, if you are looking for a less expensive but quality shaver</li>
            <li> shaver holds a charge well, but this review will be revisited over the coming months because typically if anything is going to fail for me it will be the rechargeable battery.  </li>
            <li> but the second time both legs had bad razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product with the expectation that it would be reminiscent of the electric shavers that had disappointed me years ago but with the hope that I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for the bikini area, it was even worse.</li>
            <li> Not a great product, and rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had bought the $20 Panasonic Close Curves electric shaver at Target before this one and had been using it for about a month but a piece of foil had broken off and I returned it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this razor better than any I have owned.  It shaves closer than any other razor I have had.</li>
            <li> purchased this for my 12 yr old daughter. She loves it and I love that she is not using a razor</li>
            <li> I wish I would buy this product long time ago.I had Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Shaver and I did not like it from the beginning. Now that I got Remington I see huge difference.The noise level is about the same but the cut...Remigton get so close to the skin that it cuts very well the hair even long hair without special attachments. It does not scratch the skin like Panasonic and it gives silky smooth effect that I love. Buy it without thinking.Great product so far with a good price that s worth to pay</li>
            <li> It is hard to hold onto there nothing to help you grip it.</li>
            <li> Shaves nice. Has two year warranty .</li>
            <li> Not awful bit was not super impressed.  You can&#x27;t use this for the bikini area, which is what I was hoping. And for legs, this just doesn&#x27;t get that close shave like a real &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34;. So it really didn&#x27;t do great for anything I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my boney legs, but I can&#x27;t seem to get a razor-close shave.  But it&#x27;s still very convenient, and so I&#x27;m glad I have it!</li>
            <li> I normally use an Epilator for my legs and a small shaver for my bikini area, but I gave up both to try this out and it failed me miserably.  When I tested this shaver on my legs, both wet and dry, it did not get as close as I wanted.  I&#x27;m not expecting epilator results, but if I can still easily grab hairs with a tweezer it&#x27;s just not doing the job.  As for the bikini area, it was even worse. Because I trim daily it should have done a decent job, but it didn&#x27;t and I gave up.  Overall I can&#x27;t see spending money on this especially since my favorite bikini razor sells for about $10.</li>
            <li> Awesome... Best dry shaver ever used! Still isn&#x27;t as good as a wet shave but it is great in a pinch!</li>
            <li> I love this razor. I bought it over a year ago, and it has been working great. I have also found that it is almost impossible to nick yourself using this razor. The only downside to the razor is that it is a bit hard to clean. I highly recommend this razor. It is totally worth your money.</li>
            <li> This exceeded expectations.  While this was for my wife, I am also buying another one for myself.</li>
            <li> It seems to me a well constructed piece of equipment, and my wife thinks it&#x27;s a very good shaver.</li>
            <li> Great shaver and a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other electric shavers before and so far this one is my favorite. Keep in mind, I don&#x27;t think any electric shaver will give you as close a shave as a manual razor, but the Remington is a good alternative if you&#x27;re OK with a semi-close shave. It&#x27;s much easier, safer and quicker to use than a manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the beach, I still use a manual razor but most other days the Remington does just fine.</li>
            <li> I used this razor a few times, and it works okay. But it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t shave as close to the skin as I typically like. So if you&#x27;re hoping to replace your blade with this electric razor, you won&#x27;t get as good of results. Because the shave is not as close, by the next day the hair on my legs is back enough to bother me and I need to shave again. With a blade, I can go 2 days before I need to shave again. Plus the occasional pulled hair tends to make me a little anxious when using it. Something about the sting of a single hair being pulled unexpectedly on the leg always makes me then dread using the razor again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However this turned out to be a great razor for my 13 year old daughter. She likes it quite a bit and finds it easy enough for her to use. The occasional pulled hair doesn&#x27;t phase her one bit. She was a little confused as to how to turn it on at first. It would seem simple enough, with the large purple button on the front. But that&#x27;s actually not all there is to it. There is actually a little white button inside of the larger button. You have to press this tiny button down, then slide the larger button. I could see this confusing some people at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So i&#x27;d say this is a nice razor for a young teen, but if you&#x27;re use to the a closer shave, you won&#x27;t find it replaces your blade razor.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get to try out this Remington Smooth and Silky Foil Shaver, however, it was a little bit of a disappointment. The shaver did not give me as close of a shave as I like with my manual razor, so I had to redo spots with a regular razor. It wasn&#x27;t as easy to clean as I&#x27;d like to. The razor comes with a charger, and supposedly you can use it in the shower and outside of a wet environment.  The shaver also comes with a &amp;#34;guard&amp;#34; to trim your bikini area too.</li>
            <li> I have been using razor blades to shave for most of my life. I had tried electric shavers in the past and they were OK, but I was never too thrilled with them. I decided to give the Remington Women&#x27;s Smooth &amp; Silky Foil Shaver a try, and I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to use and no razor burn after I shave! I can also see that I am going to save a lot of money because now I don&#x27;t have to buy new expensive razor blades every month.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver gives a nice close shave and keeps its charge the entire time I use it. It works great in the shower and as a dry shaver as well. It looks and feels sturdy - like it will last for years to come.  A great alternative to razor blades.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 4 months ago and yesterday the battery just died completely..... For no reason -,- with no forewarning!! It worked good for legs but nicked the crap out of my underarms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been big on electric shavers, but decided to give this one a try. As with most electric shavers, you don&#x27;t get as close of a shave as you would with a regular shaver. However, what I do like about this one, is that it was very easy to set up, and once you put it on the charger for the initial 24 hours, it has a pretty long life. I have used this for my legs and under arms dry, and found that I got a little razor burn under one of my arms, but it was great on my legs. Then I tried it in the shower, and I didn&#x27;t get any razor burn, but I didn&#x27;t feel like I got as close of a shave as I did when I used it dry. So if I want a really close shave, then I will use a regular razor, but if I&#x27;m in a big hurry, this one is great.</li>
            <li> I expected a good product from Remington and I am not disappointed. It works quite well.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully to kill the leg fuzz, and I have PLENTY to kill.  Totally painless and really convenient.  It was faster than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shaving too.  The shave was not quite smooth but I am fine with it because unless someone rubs my leg, no one will know!</li>
            <li> makes for a fast touch up</li>
            <li> so far so good, it is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Quieter than other Remingtons I&#x27;ve had and I like it generally.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first electric shaver about 5 years ago as an after thought while out shopping at a local store. (It too was a Remington.) My thought process was it would be good to have an electric shaver for those days when you need to shave your legs right quick and don&#x27;t have time to shave with a manual razor; however, I quickly discovered that I liked the convenience of the electric shaver so much that I became an avid user. So when I had a chance to try this shaver, I was thrilled. As a person who is sensitive to nickel, I can happily say Remington did not use nickel in the screens so I have not suffered from any reactions or rashes as I have with previous razors. Moreover, this shaver holds a charge really well. With a full charge, I can use it multiple times between charging sessions. With all this being said though, the quality of the shave is above average and satisfactory but not anything that would make me want to &amp;#34;woo hoo&amp;#34;. Nonetheless, if you are looking for a less expensive but quality shaver then I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This Remington women&#x27;s shaver is actually pretty good for a women&#x27;s shaver.  It has a better charge than most, it&#x27;s lightweight and comfortable to hold, it works well to trim the bikini area, it can be used wet or dry, it&#x27;s easy to clean, and it gives a better shave than most women&#x27;s shavers.  So why only three stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s not NEARLY as close as shaving with a razor, and it takes a lot more time.  I found that I had to go back over the same area over and over again to get it even passably smooth.  If it&#x27;s going to take longer than regular shaving and do a worse job, what&#x27;s the point?  Well, only you can answer that.  There ARE reasons for favoring an electric (maybe a razor gives you ingrown hairs, for example), but for most women, this just isn&#x27;t going to cut it (literally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why are women&#x27;s shavers so underpowered compared to men&#x27;s shavers?  For just a little more money, you could get [[ASIN:B00BB5YHEI a GREAT men&#x27;s Remington]], which actually gives a pretty close shave.  If you are buying a shaver for facial hair, don&#x27;t even think about getting a women&#x27;s shaver; always go for the men&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I really don&#x27;t like about this shaver is the aloe strip.  How could an aloe strip POSSIBLY last, even if it were real?  But I think this thing is just colored plastic.  I got it wet, and it had no slickness to it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some women have noted that this shaver pulls their hair and pinches (cuts) their skin when trimming longer hairs (especially in sensitive areas).  I haven&#x27;t had the nerve to try this on my underarms yet (they&#x27;re very sensitive), but I was actually surprised that this shaver did NOT pinch me in the bikini area, which I&#x27;ve experienced with every other electric shaver I&#x27;ve tried (including men&#x27;s).  So, for me (your mileage may vary, apparently), this is a decent trimmer for the bikini area (I particularly like the cap you can clip on to just trim and thin), and it could possibly be useful for a quick touch-up (sometimes you don&#x27;t realize until AFTER your shower that you really needed to shave).  This is, by no means, a great shaver, but as far as women&#x27;s shavers go, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I used to be in the electric shaving camp years ago. After being frustrated by the lack of closeness and numerous missed hairs with several different brands I switched to disposable razors (which I hated), then eventually moved on to epilating (which is effective but time consuming and painful). I don&#x27;t always have time to epilate and wanted a shaving option for quick touch-ups. I ordered this product with the expectation that it would be reminiscent of the electric shavers that had disappointed me years ago but with the hope that I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is truly amazing and completely exceeded my expectations. It contours nicely around curves and knees, gives a really close shave and seriously doesn&#x27;t miss hairs. I&#x27;ve used this shaver on legs and underarms and have been extremely happy with the results. I really have nothing negative to say about this shaver. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> First, since I am 66 but not Suzanne Somers, there will be no review of the bikini trimmer attachment and ditto for using this shaver in the shower.  My skin is extremely sensitive, so my pattern has been to limit shaving my armpits and legs to weekly to avoid irritations and infections.  I broke with that habit and used this shaver for two weeks, shaving every other day, and am pleased to say that I have experienced no problems.  In fact, my skin does feel soft, but I would not say that the shaver is closer than using a blade.  Unfortunately like every other razor I have used, it does take repeated passes to get all of the hairs under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver holds a charge well, but this review will be revisited over the coming months because typically if anything is going to fail for me it will be the rechargeable battery.  The one thing I do not like about this shaver is that it takes a forceful thumb to turn it on.  Secondly, to avoid irritation and pulling, Remington recommends that the foils and cutters be replaced every 6 months; I called their customer service, 1-800-392-6544, and when this part becomes available, it will sell in the neighborhood of $24.  Since the retail of the entire shaver is $49.99, do the math.  I was unhappy to learn that the aloe strip on the razor, by itself, is not replaceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a very comprehensive use and care guide with the razor.  Also included in this guide is the warranty, for two years; in addition, Remington offers a 60-day money back guarantee if you are not satisfied and would like a refund. I tried to complete registration on the Remington website and found that this model was not listed yet because it is a new model, so I had to e-mail their customer service department with the information instead.</li>
            <li> This razor has been a huge disappointment for me, I&#x27;ve used a Remington for years but it&#x27;s so old I couldn&#x27;t find replacement blades for it so I bought this one based on reviews.  No matter what length my hair is, wet, dry, it doesn&#x27;t matter I can barely get this to trim hair at all!!! I used several passes in different directions and the hair just stays there!! Awful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver when my cheap Panasonic Wet/Dry died. Thought I&#x27;d try something a bit more expensive, since my Panasonic lasted only three years before it died. I knew what to expect as far as closeness of shave, etc. I did not expect the razor burn! I used the Remington exactly as I had used my Panasonic, with some shave gel to help prevent burn. I could feel the Remington tearing my skin and pulling out the hair as I shaved. It left my skin more inflamed than I have ever seen, and took a lot of lidocaine and lanolin to extinguish the flames. I will return to my Panasonic. I was not a fan of the trimmer attachment on the Remington, and prefer the extendable trimmer on the Panasonic. The Remington is not good at trimming in tight spaces, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> The best model I found and works very well, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for over a year, but one of the foil parts came off, and I can&#x27;t fix it.  When it was operable, it would get rid of most of the hair. You wouldn&#x27;t be smooth. But you wouldn&#x27;t be a beast, either.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver, but I&#x27;m in agreement with another reviewer about the Panasonic shaver. I do like the wet/dry function as I find it very convenient.  I have not used the bikini function, so I don&#x27;t have anything to say about it.The shaver is very light and easy to handle. Just make sure that you put it in the charger correctly and that the light is on.</li>
            <li> I typically love Remington products and always, always buy that brand if it&#x27;s available. I have two Remington hair dryers, a Remington straightener (best straightener ever), and an older Remington electric razor, but this one just did not do it for me. It took too many passes to get rid of the hair (the older model...despite being purchased 3 years ago still works better) and I don&#x27;t like the bulkiness of this in my hand (I prefer models that are more flat). The bulkiness is exacerbated by the fact that multiple passes are required to get all the hair, so you&#x27;re actually holding it for a longer period of time. No thanks. I still love Remington, but I&#x27;ll stick to my older model.</li>
            <li> We tested this razor out on two hair types: One coarse, dark, and quick growing (Subject A), the other blonde and fine (Subject B). The results were somewhat mixed. Read on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SET UP/APPEARANCE: This a very nice-looking razor, with a nice charging stand. Now, I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor in my life and like I do with most new things I viewed it with probably an unreasonable amount of terror. Mostly, I was afraid of slicing myself to death, somehow. However, the razor really is very easy to use. After charging overnight, you are ready to rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFORMANCE: Subject A: Our coarse-haired candidate used this razor wet, and felt it did not offer her as close a shave as her Venus razor. She also felt it was no faster than a traditional razor. Subject B with the fine blonde hair first used this razor dry and was generally pleased with the results. The Remington cannot get a very close shave dry without a feeling of razor burn, but it&#x27;s great for touch-ups, or in Subject B&#x27;s case, shaving while watching TV and house-sitting. Subject B then tried the razor wet, and found the shave only slighter closer. Not as good as a Venus razor, better than those yellow Bics. But what isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor did not cut or pinch skin on leg hair, but when tried on underarm hair it did pinch Subject A. Remington states the battery charge will last 30 minutes of continuous use; so far we have had no problems with the battery. The only thing about this razor that trumps regular razors is use on longer hair (like if you haven&#x27;t shaved in a month or two). You don&#x27;t have to rinse it off every few seconds, the hair just flies off. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION: Overall, not that great. The closest shave we got was the equivalent of one day stubble for Subject A. It would be worth spending more to get a better electric razor, or stick with the trusty Gillette Fusion, the best of the non-electrics in my opinion. Not a great product, and rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GRADE: C</li>
            <li> Everything irritates my skin and gives me razor rash, but this doesn&#x27;t. You have to really go over a spot a few times to get a smooth cut, but that&#x27;s not really the point of using electric razors, they never get your skin completely smooth. It&#x27;s great for when I don&#x27;t have time to shower and shave, to just get rid of the visible hair and be on my way with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Very useful, especially as I am on a blood thinner and am not supposed to use a razor.</li>
            <li> This foil shaver does a great job at first. However, I am giving only four stars because it starts to give slightly lower performance as the battery starts to go down. Some shavers are &amp;#34;linear&amp;#34; meaning that they work just as well on low battery as on fully charged, but this one is definitely better immediately after charging. You can tell it is time to charge when you start to feel the occasional pulled hair. The product is easy to grasp, and relatively easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> First, the good. This is a nice light weight shaver that feels good in the hand. It works wet or dry, so you can use it in the shower. But it doesn&#x27;t trim as close as an old school razor. And the battery charge is nothing to write home about. All in all, not the best option out there.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of this shaver. Having never used an electric shaver before, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. And the first time I used it, it took me a while to get the job done. But after using it for a month, I definitely prefer it to disposable razors--and it doesn&#x27;t really take any longer than shaving with a razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that the foils don&#x27;t handle longer hairs very well. When I let my hair get a little too long, I first go over it with the trimmer, then the foils. It takes a bit longer, but there&#x27;s also no risk of cuts like you have with blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One charge lasts a long time--I can go at least a week between charges. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this shaver!</li>
            <li> Okay, let&#x27;s get started.  I&#x27;ve charged the shaver for 24 hours as described.  Next, I&#x27;m to remove the cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no cover.  I checked all the packaging thinking I overlooked it.  Nope.  No cover, unless the separately packed &amp;#34;Bikini trimmer headguard&amp;#34; is the cover.  Nothing to remove.  Moving on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aloe vera strip is not that same as shown on the product page.  It is a smaller patch of strips in front of the first blade, not the wider multiple strips between that blade and the roller-shaped ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Wet/dry.  Use in or out of the shower.&amp;#34;  I usually shave in the shower, but the instructions also state, &amp;#34;NOTE:  For best results, make sure that the area is clean, dry and free from creams or oils.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huh?  Okay, I&#x27;ll give it a try with the apparently better method, dry shaving.  The shaver felt mildly irritating as I shaved my legs, but it did a decent job, not as close as a manual razor but not bad.  As far as I could tell, the aloe strip did nothing.  But how could it with a dry shave?  And even if it did, what happens when there is no aloe left?  That is not explained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only somewhat daunted by the irritation to my legs, I went on to my clean, dry underarms.  Mistake.  Big mistake.  Under the first arm, I felt a little pinch.  Ouch!  Being a slow learner, I went to the second pit and tried again.  Same thing.  I was somewhat dismayed to see that I had little bloody spots under both arms, not blood actually seeping out but having been brought to the surface, directly under the skin.  I was more dismayed when I put on my deodorant, and had to deal with the stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this thing, despite its own instructions, will do better with shaving in the shower, but I&#x27;m not willing to give it the benefit of the doubt, at least, not until my armpits heal.  And there is no way I&#x27;m letting this thing near my &amp;#34;bikini area.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s back to the manual razor....</li>
            <li> Really like the Remington shaver.  My only problem is that I still get knicks on my underarms when I shave, and I have had the shaver for a number of months.  I use it dry so it may work better wet, which I haven&#x27;t tried.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick hair on my legs and very sensitive skin which makes it difficult for me to shave my legs regularly without painful razor burns. I like to use an electric razor in between to make razor shaving easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor does not do a good of shaving my legs. It is hard to turn on and off - especially when used in the shower. This is one of the poorest performing electric razors I have used.</li>
            <li> My wife used this to good effect while we had it, and its become kind of a staple for her now. The only drawback, as it does provide a comfortable shave, she said it died in the middle of her shower several times. We had not charged it for 24 hours straight before using it, and maybe we were setting it in its cradle incorrectly, but I would&#x27;ve expected it to not require that much charge to make it 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This shaver is terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaves smooth and virtually glides over the skin when used wet. My wife likes it better than any she has ever tried. She has an Ice 5 blade Venus Razor but she likes this Remington Shaver much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shaving is excellent and smooth. The trimmer works perfectly -- it&#x27;s easy to hold and use. This is the best shaver my wife has ever owned bar none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the charger is very convenient and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It does NOT give you a close, silky shave as advertised. False advertisement. It only reduces the hair to stubble. I then have to go back with a disposable razor to get the rest of the stubble. To top that off, razor burn galore. It does not do well for the bikini area either. It also reduces that hair to stubble. I am NOT pleased with their false advertising. I followed the directions. This will be going back to their company for a refund. I would NOT recommend this electric shaver. I will just stick with disposable razors. This electric shaver makes me NOT want to try any other electric shavers on the market.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased Remington shavers in the past, and they have always been the best. I would recommend it to anyone using an electric shaver, and also to those that use shaving razors should try this. Great product, and a great price.</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T TRIM OR SHAVE BIKINI. It worked ok on my legs, but for some reason wouldnt even TRIM bikini, never mind a shave of any kind. I charged it several times, but it wasnt that. I&#x27;m bummed because I really wanted a nice wet/dry shaver. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t buy it on amazon, so it&#x27;s in the garbage now.</li>
            <li> I hate this!! I spent 30 minutes on one leg alone.  I thought I was done with one leg and noticed I was far from it.  My leg was covered in stubble. Whats the point of even buying a nice shaver if it looks like you didnt shave at all?</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. It shaves smoothly and has held the charge for longer than I ever expected. When I have opened the top to clean it out, there has been nothing inside to clean. Did I miss something? Where does the hair go? I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> I just received my this Remington saver today and used it on my dry legs and yes you have to go over it a few time&#x27;s and the last time I went over my legs I put a little pressure on the shaver and I got a very very close shave just as close as I would of with a disposable razor but without the cuts I would have gotten with the disposable razor! And this shaver didn&#x27;t miss any parts of my legs. That&#x27;s the reason I wanted to try an electric shaver because the disposable razor&#x27;s were missing spots on my legs! I haven&#x27;t tried this shaver in the bikini area yet because my fiance is away till the middle of Sep so I&#x27;m not grooming down there till he comes home because no one will be anywhere near there till he&#x27;s home but once he comes home I&#x27;ll let you know how this work&#x27;s in that area. I highly recommended this shaver I&#x27;m very pleased with how smooth my legs feel!</li>
            <li> Smooth shaving. Much more stable base than the other shavers. Does a better job, too.</li>
            <li> This is the best lady razor I have found! If you don&#x27;t want your hair ripped out everytime you want to shave, buy this product. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> present for grandaughter, she is likes it</li>
            <li> nice clean shave . . ..hope it lasts. I only  used it once.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month.  I am not overly impressed with it for several reasons.  I have not been able to comfortably shave my underarm area and it didn&#x27;t do that great a job when I did.  It also didn&#x27;t do that great a job on my legs and I don&#x27;t have the heavier hair growth that I had when I was younger (senior gal now).  I had to go over an area several times to get &#x27;stragglers&#x27;.  I did not try to use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a shaver to use on your face, such as the chin area or upper lip area so that in itself is a deal breaker for me.  I want the convenience of a shaver that can whisk away a &#x27;chin whisker&#x27; when needed and not have to have two different shavers in the drawer to accomplish that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for me, for the reasons stated, it isn&#x27;t a shaver I would use regularly.</li>
            <li> This shaver is proving to be a very good choice for me. I use it mainly to shave my legs, and it is doing a good, close job and holding a charge very well. I don&#x27;t like the idea of taking a shaver into the shower so have only used it dry, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only shaver I have used before is the Panasonic ES2207P Close Curves rechargeable Wet/Dry shaver, and I find that this Remington gives a smoother outcome. The Remington also lists on Amazon for approximately twice the price of the Panasonic, so that may not be surprising; but it&#x27;s still a very reasonable price. I did prefer the Panasonic&#x27;s charger, which plugs directly into an outlet, but at least the Remington&#x27;s countertop charger has a small footprint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product information states that the foils and blades should be replaced every 6 months, which seems like a gross generalization since they can&#x27;t know how much or how little I use the shaver. I don&#x27;t know what the replacement parts cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this Remington Smooth and Silky shaver. Five stars.</li>
            <li> ***  I HAD TO REDUCE MY RATING BECAUSE THIS RAZOR IS STARTING TO DULL WITHIN THE FIRST MONTH OF USE ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recently given the opportunity to try this razor. It arrives boxed in a very hard to open bubble package. The package must be completely destroyed to get the razor out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is well made and feels good in the hand. It&#x27;s lightweight but not flimsy or cheap feeling. The razor charges via a cradle. The cradle is small but you will need to find space for it. I much prefered the way my previous Remington charged. The older model had a wall charger that the razor balanced upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor can be used wet or dry. I much prefer to use it dry after my shower. I find that it gives a great shave on your underarms and legs. It gives a pretty close shave, not quite as close as a disposable but very acceptable. It&#x27;s very quick and efficient. It does not require you to go over the same area multiple times.  It holds a charge well. I have used it for about 4 shaves before having to charge it. I do wish it had a pop up trimmer like my previous Remington razor. The moisturizing strip on the razor useless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great electric shaver. Its priced well and works well. My only small quibble is the charging cradle.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve been impressed by other Remington products, this is not one of the items that I would recommend. I&#x27;ve owned several brands of wet/dry shavers, and when my last one died, I purchased this. As everyone knows, you have to handle an electric shaver a little differently than a regular blade. This sucker managed to give me a nasty case of razor burn, yet didn&#x27;t do a terribly good job as removing the hair. I let myself heal up and tried again, slightly less burn, still so-so result. If it can&#x27;t remove at least the same amount of hair that I can with a regular blade... it&#x27;s not worth it to me. If all you want is a quick touch up to stubble level, that&#x27;s about all I can recommend this for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product. I had bought the $20 Panasonic Close Curves electric shaver at Target before this one and had been using it for about a month but a piece of foil had broken off and I returned it. I was hoping this one would be better because it was more expensive and it&#x27;s just terrible. The $20 shaver was SO much better than this one! I don&#x27;t think I can return this shaver anymore. What a drag. Oh well. I&#x27;m definitely going back to the $20 one. What a waste of money. Instead of shaving it just leaves you with hair everywhere no matter how much I press it against my legs.</li>
            <li> Works awesome, does not nick!</li>
            <li> I tried a couple of electric shavers before settling on this one. It definitely does its job. As another reviewer stated, it works well IF you don&#x27;t mind going over the same area a few times and pressing down hard. It definitely beats home waxing, which is messy, time-consuming and not to mention you have to wait to be hairy enough to wax, which really defeats the purpose of getting rid of unwanted body hair regularly. I recommend using this shaver while wet and with shaving cream or soap; when I shaved with just water it definitely wasn&#x27;t as effective. I have basically shaved my entire body, including my lady parts without any pain and great results. Goodbye home waxing and rusty disposable razors!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my mom and she loves it because her old panasonic just stopped working.</li>
            <li> I still own my original Remington shaved purchased 50 years ago.  It still works just fine, but it is getting on in age (as I am-74).  The new one works very well and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants close, clean shaves without using a blade razor.</li>
            <li> First of all, you really must be in the market for this TYPE of shaver to appreciate this one. This shaver is for those who are okay with not achieving a *perfect* close shave, but want a simple, easy, painless way to remove body hair. When I use this shaver and press fairly hard on the final (3-4 run) then it gets as close of a shave as most basic razors. Just BARELY not as close as your best, sharpest razor OR waxing. I would think many women are into basic, decent shavers, however, and if that is the case with you--I can&#x27;t find a reason not to recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Remington shaver works really very well in that it gets a lot of hair off when you go over spots multiple times. I&#x27;ve found, when shaving my legs, that this shaver does best going over a spot 2-3 times then once again pressing fairly hard. If I don&#x27;t press hard during that last run, then I don&#x27;t get as close of a shave as I&#x27;d like. Ideally, this shaver woiuld be used after a shower, after a good exfoliating. If not, then a few runs over are required followed by a final run by pressing pretty hard to apply the closest shave possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guard this shaver comes is especially nice for *those* special areas where you just want to remove bulk. I really like that addition. The charger is nice and helps makes sure that the shaver can charge often, and thus is always ready to go. Very simple! I haven&#x27;t had this shaver run out of juice during use yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I think this product is ideal for the certain type of shaver and you&#x27;re going to have to decide if this is you. If you really don&#x27;t have much time or motivation to do a good detailed job in the shower, but just want a quick easy way to shave every once in a while with an electric shaver, then I think this product is for you. The charger, power, and guard make it especially perfect. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it if you&#x27;re in the market for an electric ladies shaver.</li>
            <li> Before I start, I should point out that I only use this shaver around my bikini area. I am very sensitive to wax and so that is not an option. I prefer to do it myself at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been searching for a shaver that would both have a good trimmer guard for the trimming (using foils on longer hair causes pulling, which is extremely painful) and offer the closer shave of the foils without needed two separate devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this, it did both well. Well enough that my original review was four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I used it again, and it just didn&#x27;t work at all. I had to change back to my old shaver in the middle of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst of all, I had horrible razor rash for about 5 days. YUCK! I will not be trying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sad, because Remington used to make only great products.</li>
            <li> I have been using the [[ASIN:B0018A32XS Panasonic ES2207P Ladies 3-Blade \\&quot;Close Curves\\&quot; Wet/Dry Shaver]] for three years now so I will compare this Remington Shaver to that one. Both offer a similar level of closeness, as good as you can expect from an electric shaver. Both have a trimmer at the front to trim down longer hair so the foil part can shave the hair properly. The Panasonic shaver has the added feature that you can push a button to extend the trimmer, which I think is essential if you want to trim your bikini line without pulling. Both are cordless/rechargeable. The Remington charger sits on the counter while the Panasonic charger is a cube you plug in and the shaver sits right on top. I prefer to have my counter space clear so I like the Panasonic charger better, but if you have sideways outlets or your outlets are under your medicine cabinet or another obstruction you would prefer the Remington charger. I charged the Remington a month ago and I have used it to shave my legs a few times a week all month and it is just now starting to slow down and need charging.</li>
            <li> I prefer electric shavers.  I used the Panasonic ES2207P Ladies 3-Blade &amp;#34;Close Curves&amp;#34; Wet/Dry Shaver for over three years without any problems.  I finally killed it recently, so I figured I would give Remington a try. I found that this shaver is not for me.  I have coarse, thick hair in some areas, so I cannot use this shaver without a lot of frustration.  It requires multiple passes in all areas just to get a clean shave.  I did not have that problem with the Panasonic.  The holes are smaller in this shaver, so that may be the cause of the problem.  I like the idea of the bikini attachment, but I don&#x27;t use it.  I liked the fact that the Panasonic features a button that extends the trimmer for the longer hairs.  I didn&#x27;t realize how much I used that feature until I didn&#x27;t have it.  Both are cordless, rechargeable and can be used wet or dry, but for the performance the Panasonic is the clear choice for me.</li>
            <li> First off, to start the shaver you push the button in and THEN up.  The instructions didn&#x27;t say that and, dummy me, couldn&#x27;t figure it out.  So I called Customer Service and they were fast to respond and told me what I was doing wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a Remington shaver for years and it also had an intercept trimmer which shaves off the longer hair first.  On the older model the intercept trimmer sticks out further over the edge and I thought the newer model might be less effective but it works just as well, even under the arms.  After getting rid of the longer hair, I go over it with the foils and you can hear it cutting even closer.  I tried the bikini trimmer and basically it just cuts back on the bushiness, so rather than shave to nothing, you could use that.  The intercept works best for the bikini line, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted an electric razor so I don&#x27;t have to shave in the shower and this is perfect for me, although it works in the shower too.  Customer service is top notch, answering the phone without even waiting, so I highly recommend this shaver.  My older one has lasted so long, I can&#x27;t tell you how old it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can replace the foils and cutters every 6 months and they are on average around $20.</li>
            <li> Works well and holds a charge for several days. But, the razor (after being cleaned) fell apart into several pieces and it&#x27;s beyond repair. It lasted almost a year. But it&#x27;s not a longtime shaver.</li>
            <li> Best Remington shaver I have owned yet! One swipe &amp; the hair is gone. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this one...</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this Remington WDF4840 Women&#x27;s Smooth and Silky Foil Shaver.  I have tried electric razors in the past and have always been disappointed with the quality of the shave.  You can never get close enough.  I am happy to report that is not the case with this razor!  I am able to get a silky smooth shave, and it&#x27;s so much easier than a traditional blade.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product and think you will be too.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives me a closer shave than any other electric shaver I have ever had.  The price was right and it was everything that I was looking for in an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> One of the worst.  Pulls hair rather than shaves it.  Completely ineffectual.</li>
            <li> Good for legs but not underarms.</li>
            <li> not as easy to use as my old one, but good enough.</li>
            <li> It is so wonderful! Shaves as close as a razor! I don&#x27;t see myself ever going back to razors.......</li>
            <li> A gift to someone special who never before used an electric razor.  SHE LOVES IT.  &#x27;nut said.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my granddaughter. Works great. Easy to use does a great job and really easy to clean</li>
            <li> Just okay, I am not impressed, I wish it was a closer shave.</li>
            <li> First time I used it on my legs, worked great but the second time both legs had bad razor burn.  Both times as I shaved it felt rough. Still healing and will never use it again.  I had a Remington Wet/Dry for years that didn&#x27;t shave all that well but did not burn my legs.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a couple of months and absolutely no problem.  Very smooth shave and easy to hold.</li>
