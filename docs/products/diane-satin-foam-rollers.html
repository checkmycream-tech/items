            <li>I just wish they would come out now with a jumbo size to roll your roots at top with!!!!</li>
            <li>Great idea to assure rollers do not damage hair.</li>
            <li>Product as described, arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li>In fairness, I move around a good amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, these rollers are great.</li>
            <li>It is a good thing in my case, because I think that the plastic mechanism would pop off before my hair was damaged by these.  </li>
            <li>These rollers were very cheap.</li>
            <li>yes very comfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li>I purchased on a whim and am now a satisfied consumer.</li>
            <li>Actually the satin covered foam roller is excellent and deserves a 5 star rating.  </li>
            <li>As my hair grows and thickens the clamps will break apart even more.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and don&#x27;t like to use heat to curl it as it is easily damaged.</li>
            <li>I love these curlers and they&#x27;re great for natural hair that has been straightened by heat.</li>
            <li>However, the flimsy plastic clamps, which come apart easily, made me give this product a 3 star rating.  </li>
            <li>but they do break easy.</li>
            <li>I use it to smooth my bags and give my hair body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rocking curls for the first time ever because I&#x27;ve finally got a good way to get nice heat-less curls.</li>
            <li>I ended up pulling the satin off of these because my hair would just slide right off of the rollers.  </li>
            <li>The rollers I received were the right size, but they were not satin covered.</li>
            <li>The sort of cheap quality product one would normally purchase in a dollar store.</li>
            <li>These rollers were pretty good, but they are a little flimsy.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more for her to replace her entire roller set.</li>
            <li>The hinge part isn&#x27;t very well made, so the little plastic bit that is supposed to clip your hair to the roller pops off very easily.  </li>
            <li>These are great for delicate hair, and they are relatively fragile.  </li>
            <li>They take a few minutes to get used to, but a good product overall.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Not only are they a perfect match for her hair type, but I&#x27;ve noticed she doesn&#x27;t have the usual frizz and fly-aways like she did with her other rollers.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and squishy.</li>
            <li>FOAM CURLERS OR ANY OF THESE CURLERS WITH OR WITHOUT SATIN BREAK APART OR STOP HOLDING, THE HARD  CLIP ON PLASTIC ARE BETTER FOR CURLING, BUT THE SOFT FOR SLEEPING</li>
            <li>I really should have sent them back...</li>
            <li>The sliky wrap fabric helps the foam roler not dry your curl out.</li>

            <li> I received the size I wanted. Arrived in about a week. They smell bad. Like a musty garage. Maybe washing them will help. They are very soft and squishy. Almost too squishy. Wish the foam was firmer</li>
            <li> My grandmother has medium-length, wispy, coarse hair. I was worried that her current rollers were pulling hair out. I bought these, not realizing how big they were or WHY they were called satin rollers. I purchased on a whim and am now a satisfied consumer. Not only are they a perfect match for her hair type, but I&#x27;ve noticed she doesn&#x27;t have the usual frizz and fly-aways like she did with her other rollers. Her hairstyle stays in place! I will be buying more for her to replace her entire roller set. I hope I can find some that are a little bit smaller for the back of her hair.</li>
            <li> These rollers were pretty good, but they are a little flimsy. I find when I am putting them in at least 2-3 come apart and I have to redo that section. Then when I wake up in the morning after setting them right before bed the night before, at least 2-3 have fallen out, and I wear a beanie to try and prevent that. In fairness, I move around a good amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, these rollers are great. I have very fine hair, and don&#x27;t like to use heat to curl it as it is easily damaged. I&#x27;m rocking curls for the first time ever because I&#x27;ve finally got a good way to get nice heat-less curls.</li>

            <li> Rollers are very poor quality. they fell apart the very first time that I used an hate them. do not recommend anyone to buy them</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work for my hair :-(</li>
            <li> Great idea to assure rollers do not damage hair. Product as described, arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality. The sort of cheap quality product one would normally purchase in a dollar store. Definitely not recommended. Don&#x27;t wast your money.</li>
            <li> I love these curlers and they&#x27;re great for natural hair that has been straightened by heat. I just wish the satin wouldn&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> The rollers I received were the right size, but they were not satin covered. I really should have sent them back...</li>
            <li> plastic part didn&#x27;t hold; foam didn&#x27;t hold up well - started deteriorating soon after I started using them. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Actually the satin covered foam roller is excellent and deserves a 5 star rating.  However, the flimsy plastic clamps, which come apart easily, made me give this product a 3 star rating.  My hair is thinning at the present time, so the clamps work to an extent.  As my hair grows and thickens the clamps will break apart even more.  I have foam rollers (without satin covers) purchased years ago with sturdy clamps which I&#x27;ve replaced Diane&#x27;s as they break.  I ordered twelve of these rollers and they work well...I have to re-aligned the satin on some of them as they do &#x27;ride&#x27; up.  I&#x27;ve had no problem with unraveling as I noticed other customers mentioned...probably because I handle them and my hair with utmost care.</li>
            <li> These rollers were very cheap. In fact, when I received them, two were broken. The \\&quot;satin\\&quot; covering the rollers didn&#x27;t damage my hair, but they were difficult to use and to open and close. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> FOAM CURLERS OR ANY OF THESE CURLERS WITH OR WITHOUT SATIN BREAK APART OR STOP HOLDING, THE HARD  CLIP ON PLASTIC ARE BETTER FOR CURLING, BUT THE SOFT FOR SLEEPING</li>
            <li> Having the satin makes the ends of my hair not get so scrunched going around the roller!  Will order another set</li>
            <li> I have shoulder lenght hair and these rollers does not stay in place. In essence I cannot use these at all.&lt;br /&gt;Would like to return or give them to Goodwill.</li>
            <li> yes very comfortable to sleep in I just wish they would come out now with a jumbo size to roll your roots at top with!!!!</li>

            <li> I like them but they do break easy. The sliky wrap fabric helps the foam roler not dry your curl out.</li>
