            <li>Works Great, no complaints at all about the blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Great price and great deal.  </li>
            <li>but it works so great</li>
            <li>Great price, great hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This is a really good blow dryer.</li>
            <li>My mother-in-law commented that she loved mine while staying at our apartment</li>
            <li>A good point is that it is quieter.  </li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>Another good thing is that it&#x27;s lighter too.</li>
            <li>and I loved it</li>
            <li>It was also fairly quite.</li>
            <li>I will add that it is a good idea to use the concentrator for added control and smoothness.  </li>
            <li>Favorite blow dryer, great price.</li>
            <li>The Conair Infinty Pro tools mostly have great reviews, and it didn&#x27;t break the bank.  </li>
            <li>My hair used to be all puffy after blow drying and needed 12+ hours to recover,so I&#x27;m very satisfied by immediate results.</li>
            <li>Love this blow dryer !</li>
            <li>I love this dryer!</li>
            <li>And it was so inexpensive compared to many others!</li>
            <li>So glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely beautiful color and SO powerful!</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>: hair dryer is still working well - the removable rear grill is nice - makes cleaning out lint</li>
            <li>My hair needs a lot of heat because of the texture and this blow dryer doesn&#x27;t have the kind of heat my hair needs.</li>
            <li>I loved that one, so I decided to stick with Conair and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is so much more gorgeous in person than online.</li>
            <li>This is ABSOLUTELY the best hair dryer out there.</li>
            <li>super satisfied with the product, really good quality , powerful , excellent .</li>
            <li>It also has a very easily removable filter so that you can keep the hair dryer</li>
            <li>This dries my hair super quickly and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>Have my own and love it.  </li>
            <li>This is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned, by far.</li>
            <li>Two very important notes:</li>
            <li>(a very cheap Revlon from about five years ago and an Andis which cost ~$60).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>I am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>I found this hair dryer to be just OK.</li>
            <li>Styling your hair is more of a challenge.</li>
            <li>You would think more heat means more damage, not in this case.</li>
            <li>More air ends up blowing on your hands and away from your head than where you are directing it.</li>
            <li>It is what I wanted and I am pleased purchase</li>
            <li>And I love the colour.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I don&#x27;t think one could get a better deal.</li>
            <li>but I figured that it would surely be covered under warranty.</li>
            <li>Love this dryer.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never go cheap again!</li>
            <li>To the contrary, my drugstore Revlon travel dryer did better.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know a dryer could make a difference, but I love this one.  </li>
            <li>and I get no frizz or static from it.  </li>
            <li>Also, I watched some great blowdrying videos online that give excellent tips on how to achieve volume, smoothness and avoid certain mistakes that can frizz or cause flat styling.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>Very powerful blow dryer!</li>
            <li>It has a &#x27;cool shot&#x27; button which is also nice.</li>
            <li>Drys it a lot faster than my old hair dryer which is great.</li>
            <li>It has great temperature control, direct heat, and optional speeds.</li>
            <li>Also, it does get the hair pretty straight if you&#x27;re looking for a good blowout!</li>
            <li>Well balanced and great volume of air - hot is really hot, can heat shrink tubing with this thing</li>
            <li>Switches are easily changed when waving blower for drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt; - controls on handle were easy to click on/off which sometimes happened just by holding it to use.</li>
            <li>It does come with an attachment piece to help with air flow direction, and this attached easily.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair VERY quickly</li>
            <li>When it gets to the highest setting, the air flow is strong.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this dryer.  </li>
            <li>Medium works just fine.  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer works fine, but the nozzle attachment has air vents on the side of it which seem to defeat the purpose.</li>
            <li>For me, it seems just fine.</li>
            <li>and I super recommend it!</li>
            <li>even my husband commented on the sound.</li>
            <li>And my heart ends up being silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was mislead by the fantastic reviews this product has.</li>
            <li>This is a very powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s very powerful.</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s very powerful.</li>
            <li>It was fine, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful blend of purple and pink.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using an ionic blow dryer, and I must say I&#x27;m pretty impressed, my hair is smoother and shinier than using a regular one!</li>
            <li>Dries hair fast and love the color.</li>
            <li>takes us some space in cabinet/suitcase if you like to travel with full size dryer</li>
            <li>The hottest setting still felt too cool and it wasn&#x27;t sufficient to make their hair sleek.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer gets it dry quickly and leaves it looking pretty good!</li>
            <li>I love the different temperature settings because the warm is just right, and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m burning my hair off.</li>
            <li>I like to get ready super quickly and don&#x27;t have patience to spend any more than 10 minutes blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li>And lastly, i had to purchase at Target because when I ordered from amazon, my shipment never came...not sure why, but I still love this product.</li>
            <li>Love that this has multiple settings, it&#x27;s sturdy, cute, and drys the hair quick.</li>
            <li>its working amazingly, quick and powerful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how quickly it dries my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is very pretty</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li>So powerful it fried my fine hair to a crisp.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t report as to the longetivity of the unit at this time, as I am a new owner, but I love the frizz busting efficiency of this dryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super powerful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty!</li>
            <li>I would easily compare this blow dryer to the pricey ones and actually think it is better.</li>
            <li>My hair was noticeably frizzier after using this dryer, and my hair is fine and straight.</li>
            <li>This dryer is quiter than my previous dryer and the weight is right, but it made my hair so frizzy and static!!</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t used a great blow dryer like this one, you are missing out.</li>
            <li>Powerful.</li>
            <li>love it, but it is loud</li>
            <li>Extremely powerful and burned my hair</li>
            <li>Maybe I will have that nice dyer in the future, but this will do until then.  </li>
            <li>Its worth it</li>
            <li>Really like this hair dryer; it is so much better for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Price really fluctuated on this.  </li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>This model is also very light and the length of the nozzle is a little on the shorter side, so it is very easy to handle without fatigue.</li>
            <li>It dries pretty quick and it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise.</li>
            <li>It looks awesome (if you&#x27;re a fan of pink and purple), and it&#x27;s pretty quiet -</li>
            <li>I had this hair dryer at my house and decided to replace my hair dryer at the cabin with the exact same one, I loved it so much.</li>
            <li>Great blow dryer, I am blessed with REALLY REALLY thick hair and need something powerful with multiple settings (cool, warm, hot).</li>
            <li>There is a right way to use a dryer and a brush.  </li>
            <li>Powerful and hot.</li>
            <li>Almost too powerful when switched to high!</li>
            <li>Pretty Color too.  </li>
            <li>I have never used a hair dryer that cost more than $15 or $20 because I thought it was BS that the more expensive ones were better.</li>
            <li>This was my first usage and I&#x27;ll update if any issues occur.</li>
            <li>Fast dry on warm</li>
            <li>the middle warm setting is what hot was on my old dryer.</li>
            <li>blow drys fast, but it is VERY noisy, seems like a plane is in your room!</li>
            <li>Since I have fine hair, I use the highest setting (hot &amp; high) at the beginning, when my hair is wet, and then switch to warm &amp; low to finish it off.</li>
            <li>easy - several photos attached with product details showing concentrator nozzle attached and unattached.</li>
            <li>Also, it is quite large, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a travel dryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely on the louder side, but it really dries my hair quickly!</li>
            <li>Good hair dryer blows to hard frizzed my curly hair</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t like that too much.</li>
            <li>Who wants to buy a hair dryer from someone who can&#x27;t spell.  </li>
            <li>It seems very durable and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair and dries it fast.  </li>
            <li>It also seems like the attachment will stay on very well.</li>
            <li>It has saved me so much time getting ready.</li>
            <li>and my hair is very shiny.  </li>
            <li>so they are straight versus curled.</li>
            <li>has much now either.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I enjoy it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I bought it after my old Conair 1875 cord keeper that I&#x27;d had for 5 years started smelling funny and getting way too hot when using it.</li>
            <li>Works great for my super thick and long hair!</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable and the color is vibrant.</li>
            <li>With the high speed, drying my kid&#x27;s hair with this was like sticking them in a wind tunnel, a very frizzy wind tunnel.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this was on dry hair with the concentrator and a round brush to smooth my hair and restyle with more volume.  </li>
            <li>Cuts down on drying time and leaves my hair so smooth!</li>
            <li>it seems higher than the high on my old dryer.  </li>
            <li>The lower speed doesn&#x27;t allow me to manage my hair as my previous dryer was able to do.</li>
            <li>The cord is a decent length.</li>
            <li>Decent hairdryer,</li>
            <li>I have straight hair but like most people, there are a few curly Qs.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even need to use this on the high setting.  </li>
            <li>I have short hair…growing it out…needed something to tame my hair without damaging…high powered, and gives me a very sleek look…definitely recommend…works much better than my $120 &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; dryer!</li>
            <li>Totally true, which I can&#x27;t say the same for my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I would end up curling it with the iron anyway because the heat wasn&#x27;t powerful enough.</li>
            <li>It is heavy but most of mine are like that.</li>
            <li>This dryer never really got hot enough for me to get my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>This is not the case with this new hair dryer</li>
            <li>The other reason I love it (and really why I bought it) was that it allows me to dry my bangs</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the looks but disappointed in function.</li>
            <li>works well but its really loud!</li>
            <li>The electric cord is also shorter than I expected (from a lower level wall outlet, it&#x27;s stretched to reach the top of my head).  </li>
            <li>Steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural and like ceramic products if I&#x27;m going to use heat on my hair.</li>
            <li>- it was loud but tolerable.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Granted the old one was over 10 years old, but still.  </li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like is how heavy/bulky it is but for the time it saves me getting ready</li>
            <li>It is loud but it&#x27;s a hair dryer</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s not such thing as a powerful quiet dryer.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick hair and tons of it, so the faster my hair dries, the better!  </li>
            <li>I recently visited a new stylist that recommended a name brand professional dryer for size, weight, and effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>I called Conair directly to find out this information, and they said even if I purchased the dryer through Amazon that the return process and warranty to get a new product are the same.</li>
            <li>I have really long hair and this blow dryer, dries it extremely fast.</li>
            <li>And even though this does not really matter, it is pretty.</li>
            <li>The dryer does dry my hair fast -</li>
            <li>This hairdryer is very quiet as far as hair driers go and gets my hair dry much faster than my old one.  </li>
            <li>Probably terrific for regular straight</li>
            <li>It was used maybe 5 times a week, just once a day -- not extreme or abusive.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry the hair THAT much faster than other dryers, but it does dry the hair rather quickly.</li>
            <li>&gt; - did dry faster than older Conair I had been using&lt;br</li>
            <li>Going back to my old Revlon that is still working after almost 7 years.</li>
            <li>It is loud even though it advertises as quiet.</li>
            <li>Cold shot functions good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s remarkably quiet in comparison, and even on the hottest setting it isn&#x27;t unbearably hot like the other one was.</li>
            <li>The only slight downfall is that it is slightly heavier than my last dryer, however, because it dries so fast, it really isn&#x27;t that much of an issue.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;limited&#x27; part just means you pay return shipping for a new product.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; heat setting is nearly indistinguishable from &amp;#34;warm.&amp;#34; It takes a very long time to achieve maximum heat.</li>
            <li>The biggest problem with my old hair dryer was that it took me between 25 to 30 min to dry my hair</li>
            <li>I think it actually did dry my hair faster than the old dryer.</li>
            <li>That means less noise (one of the things I was looking for), although when set at the highest setting it is still quieter than my old Conair (which is about 4 years old same 1875-Watt).</li>

            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> Another good thing is that it&#x27;s lighter too.</li>
            <li> and I loved it</li>
            <li> It was also fairly quite.</li>
            <li> I will add that it is a good idea to use the concentrator for added control and smoothness.  </li>
            <li> Favorite blow dryer, great price.</li>
            <li> The Conair Infinty Pro tools mostly have great reviews, and it didn&#x27;t break the bank.  </li>
            <li> My hair used to be all puffy after blow drying and needed 12+ hours to recover,so I&#x27;m very satisfied by immediate results.</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer !</li>
            <li> I love this dryer!</li>
            <li> And it was so inexpensive compared to many others!</li>
            <li> So glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful color and SO powerful!</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> : hair dryer is still working well - the removable rear grill is nice - makes cleaning out lint</li>
            <li> My hair needs a lot of heat because of the texture and this blow dryer doesn&#x27;t have the kind of heat my hair needs.</li>
            <li> I loved that one, so I decided to stick with Conair and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is so much more gorgeous in person than online.</li>
            <li> This is ABSOLUTELY the best hair dryer out there.</li>
            <li> super satisfied with the product, really good quality , powerful , excellent .</li>
            <li> It also has a very easily removable filter so that you can keep the hair dryer</li>
            <li> This dries my hair super quickly and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> Have my own and love it.  </li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned, by far.</li>
            <li> Two very important notes:</li>
            <li> (a very cheap Revlon from about five years ago and an Andis which cost ~$60).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> I am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I found this hair dryer to be just OK.</li>
            <li> Styling your hair is more of a challenge.</li>
            <li> You would think more heat means more damage, not in this case.</li>
            <li> More air ends up blowing on your hands and away from your head than where you are directing it.</li>
            <li> It is what I wanted and I am pleased purchase</li>
            <li> And I love the colour.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t think one could get a better deal.</li>
            <li> but I figured that it would surely be covered under warranty.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go cheap again!</li>
            <li> To the contrary, my drugstore Revlon travel dryer did better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know a dryer could make a difference, but I love this one.  </li>
            <li> and I get no frizz or static from it.  </li>
            <li> Also, I watched some great blowdrying videos online that give excellent tips on how to achieve volume, smoothness and avoid certain mistakes that can frizz or cause flat styling.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful hair dryer!  </li>
            <li> Very powerful blow dryer!</li>
            <li> It has a &#x27;cool shot&#x27; button which is also nice.</li>
            <li> Drys it a lot faster than my old hair dryer which is great.</li>
            <li> It has great temperature control, direct heat, and optional speeds.</li>
            <li> Also, it does get the hair pretty straight if you&#x27;re looking for a good blowout!</li>
            <li> Well balanced and great volume of air - hot is really hot, can heat shrink tubing with this thing</li>
            <li> Switches are easily changed when waving blower for drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt; - controls on handle were easy to click on/off which sometimes happened just by holding it to use.</li>
            <li> It does come with an attachment piece to help with air flow direction, and this attached easily.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair VERY quickly</li>
            <li> When it gets to the highest setting, the air flow is strong.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Medium works just fine.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer works fine, but the nozzle attachment has air vents on the side of it which seem to defeat the purpose.</li>
            <li> For me, it seems just fine.</li>
            <li> and I super recommend it!</li>
            <li> even my husband commented on the sound.</li>
            <li> And my heart ends up being silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was mislead by the fantastic reviews this product has.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s very powerful.</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s very powerful.</li>
            <li> It was fine, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful blend of purple and pink.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using an ionic blow dryer, and I must say I&#x27;m pretty impressed, my hair is smoother and shinier than using a regular one!</li>
            <li> Dries hair fast and love the color.</li>
            <li> takes us some space in cabinet/suitcase if you like to travel with full size dryer</li>
            <li> The hottest setting still felt too cool and it wasn&#x27;t sufficient to make their hair sleek.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer gets it dry quickly and leaves it looking pretty good!</li>
            <li> I love the different temperature settings because the warm is just right, and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m burning my hair off.</li>
            <li> I like to get ready super quickly and don&#x27;t have patience to spend any more than 10 minutes blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li> And lastly, i had to purchase at Target because when I ordered from amazon, my shipment never came...not sure why, but I still love this product.</li>
            <li> Love that this has multiple settings, it&#x27;s sturdy, cute, and drys the hair quick.</li>
            <li> its working amazingly, quick and powerful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how quickly it dries my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is very pretty</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li> So powerful it fried my fine hair to a crisp.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t report as to the longetivity of the unit at this time, as I am a new owner, but I love the frizz busting efficiency of this dryer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super powerful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty!</li>
            <li> I would easily compare this blow dryer to the pricey ones and actually think it is better.</li>
            <li> My hair was noticeably frizzier after using this dryer, and my hair is fine and straight.</li>
            <li> This dryer is quiter than my previous dryer and the weight is right, but it made my hair so frizzy and static!!</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t used a great blow dryer like this one, you are missing out.</li>
            <li> Powerful.</li>
            <li> love it, but it is loud</li>
            <li> Extremely powerful and burned my hair</li>
            <li> Maybe I will have that nice dyer in the future, but this will do until then.  </li>
            <li> Its worth it</li>
            <li> Really like this hair dryer; it is so much better for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Price really fluctuated on this.  </li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This model is also very light and the length of the nozzle is a little on the shorter side, so it is very easy to handle without fatigue.</li>
            <li> It dries pretty quick and it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise.</li>
            <li> It looks awesome (if you&#x27;re a fan of pink and purple), and it&#x27;s pretty quiet -</li>
            <li> I had this hair dryer at my house and decided to replace my hair dryer at the cabin with the exact same one, I loved it so much.</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer, I am blessed with REALLY REALLY thick hair and need something powerful with multiple settings (cool, warm, hot).</li>
            <li> There is a right way to use a dryer and a brush.  </li>
            <li> Powerful and hot.</li>
            <li> Almost too powerful when switched to high!</li>
            <li> Pretty Color too.  </li>
            <li> I have never used a hair dryer that cost more than $15 or $20 because I thought it was BS that the more expensive ones were better.</li>
            <li> This was my first usage and I&#x27;ll update if any issues occur.</li>
            <li> Fast dry on warm</li>
            <li> the middle warm setting is what hot was on my old dryer.</li>
            <li> blow drys fast, but it is VERY noisy, seems like a plane is in your room!</li>
            <li> Since I have fine hair, I use the highest setting (hot &amp; high) at the beginning, when my hair is wet, and then switch to warm &amp; low to finish it off.</li>
            <li> easy - several photos attached with product details showing concentrator nozzle attached and unattached.</li>
            <li> Also, it is quite large, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a travel dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely on the louder side, but it really dries my hair quickly!</li>
            <li> Good hair dryer blows to hard frizzed my curly hair</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t like that too much.</li>
            <li> Who wants to buy a hair dryer from someone who can&#x27;t spell.  </li>
            <li> It seems very durable and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair and dries it fast.  </li>
            <li> It also seems like the attachment will stay on very well.</li>
            <li> It has saved me so much time getting ready.</li>
            <li> and my hair is very shiny.  </li>
            <li> so they are straight versus curled.</li>
            <li> has much now either.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I enjoy it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought it after my old Conair 1875 cord keeper that I&#x27;d had for 5 years started smelling funny and getting way too hot when using it.</li>
            <li> Works great for my super thick and long hair!</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable and the color is vibrant.</li>
            <li> With the high speed, drying my kid&#x27;s hair with this was like sticking them in a wind tunnel, a very frizzy wind tunnel.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this was on dry hair with the concentrator and a round brush to smooth my hair and restyle with more volume.  </li>
            <li> Cuts down on drying time and leaves my hair so smooth!</li>
            <li> it seems higher than the high on my old dryer.  </li>
            <li> The lower speed doesn&#x27;t allow me to manage my hair as my previous dryer was able to do.</li>
            <li> The cord is a decent length.</li>
            <li> Decent hairdryer,</li>
            <li> I have straight hair but like most people, there are a few curly Qs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need to use this on the high setting.  </li>
            <li> I have short hair…growing it out…needed something to tame my hair without damaging…high powered, and gives me a very sleek look…definitely recommend…works much better than my $120 &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; dryer!</li>
            <li> Totally true, which I can&#x27;t say the same for my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I would end up curling it with the iron anyway because the heat wasn&#x27;t powerful enough.</li>
            <li> It is heavy but most of mine are like that.</li>
            <li> This dryer never really got hot enough for me to get my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> This is not the case with this new hair dryer</li>
            <li> The other reason I love it (and really why I bought it) was that it allows me to dry my bangs</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the looks but disappointed in function.</li>
            <li> works well but its really loud!</li>
            <li> The electric cord is also shorter than I expected (from a lower level wall outlet, it&#x27;s stretched to reach the top of my head).  </li>
            <li> Steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural and like ceramic products if I&#x27;m going to use heat on my hair.</li>
            <li> - it was loud but tolerable.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Granted the old one was over 10 years old, but still.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is how heavy/bulky it is but for the time it saves me getting ready</li>
            <li> It is loud but it&#x27;s a hair dryer</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s not such thing as a powerful quiet dryer.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and tons of it, so the faster my hair dries, the better!  </li>
            <li> I recently visited a new stylist that recommended a name brand professional dryer for size, weight, and effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> I called Conair directly to find out this information, and they said even if I purchased the dryer through Amazon that the return process and warranty to get a new product are the same.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and this blow dryer, dries it extremely fast.</li>
            <li> And even though this does not really matter, it is pretty.</li>
            <li> The dryer does dry my hair fast -</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is very quiet as far as hair driers go and gets my hair dry much faster than my old one.  </li>
            <li> Probably terrific for regular straight</li>
            <li> It was used maybe 5 times a week, just once a day -- not extreme or abusive.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry the hair THAT much faster than other dryers, but it does dry the hair rather quickly.</li>
            <li> &gt; - did dry faster than older Conair I had been using&lt;br</li>
            <li> Going back to my old Revlon that is still working after almost 7 years.</li>
            <li> It is loud even though it advertises as quiet.</li>
            <li> Cold shot functions good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s remarkably quiet in comparison, and even on the hottest setting it isn&#x27;t unbearably hot like the other one was.</li>
            <li> The only slight downfall is that it is slightly heavier than my last dryer, however, because it dries so fast, it really isn&#x27;t that much of an issue.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;limited&#x27; part just means you pay return shipping for a new product.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; heat setting is nearly indistinguishable from &amp;#34;warm.&amp;#34; It takes a very long time to achieve maximum heat.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem with my old hair dryer was that it took me between 25 to 30 min to dry my hair</li>
            <li> I think it actually did dry my hair faster than the old dryer.</li>
            <li> That means less noise (one of the things I was looking for), although when set at the highest setting it is still quieter than my old Conair (which is about 4 years old same 1875-Watt).</li>
            <li> At first I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t be hot enough, but it dried my medium length and REALLY thick hair in 10 minutes without frizz.</li>
            <li> however I think it is priced a little high.  </li>
            <li> shinier/smoother looking hair and half off drying time; regular &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34; (not quiet, but not too loud)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the low blow speed is very high....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not having to use my flat iron</li>
            <li> Works really well but expected it to be a little lighter in weight.</li>
            <li> As far as the weight goes it&#x27;s a little heavier than my last</li>
            <li> I purchased this new at Walmart; it burnt out after just a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> What sold me when looking at reviews was that the lowest speed was enough to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Loads of power and not super loud.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a swivel cord, which would be much easier when moving around drying my hair.</li>
            <li> It took me less than 10 minutes (old blow dryer- around 20 minutes).</li>
            <li> This is my second one, only because the first was broken in my luggage in transit.</li>
            <li> and It takes almost half the time it took me to dry &amp; curl my hair with the old one.</li>
            <li> After my 3rd one died I didn&#x27;t have time to go get another one as the salon wholesale stores where closed.</li>
            <li> Actually dried my clients hair faster than professional ones.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s held up since the weekend having been used all day everyday.</li>
            <li> (But heavy and loud).</li>
            <li> The cord is quite long.</li>
            <li> OMG, why did I wait so long?</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t take the time to rate &amp; give my review when I purchase things online, unless totally love or hate the product.</li>
            <li> It dries my thick hair much faster than my Revlon dryer that it&#x27;s replacing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; - for those with long hair, this does tend to pull in to the back filter, but only a little which wasn&#x27;t problematic.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the dryer is pretty heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good, if not better than the very expensive one we have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This dryer comes with a 4 year warranty that is &#x27;limited.&#x27;</li>
            <li> concentrator attachment is flawed, in that it has two large vents, which direct about half the air volume away from the area you&#x27;re trying to concentrate on.</li>
            <li> Actually, it had so little use</li>
            <li> I deal with professional dryers often and have had my share of professional expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> (This despite only using it once every few days, and never using it on the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting.)</li>
            <li> Even so, I have a few cons, so in short: Pros: ionic technology does work!</li>
            <li> It stopped producing hot air and now only blows cold which doesn&#x27;t do a thing to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> And the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; speed is near or equivalent to &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; on my other dryers, which range from cheap crap to high-end</li>
            <li> I have soft, thick coarse hair and this doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair as it dries like my other blow dryers have done in the past.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, straight/wavy and dry hair and have used hot/low setting to dry it.</li>
            <li> It is heavier than other hair dryers that I have used.  </li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s advertised as drying hair faster than other dryers, I found it to take longer than either of my other hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Plus given the ceramic put into it, it shouldn&#x27;t be as damaging as other driers might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I called the Conair service line and spent my lunch waiting to talk to representative I was told that ITEMS PURCHASED ON AMAZON ARE NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY!</li>
            <li> +, so I began looking at other options.  </li>
            <li> I use the low heat and low speed setting, as my hair is thin.  </li>
            <li> I like the color, but the weight of the dryer is heavy - especially when holding it to dry my hair, which is thick and curly (and I want to straighten it).</li>
            <li> Dryer works well, but a little bulkier than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Average product for me.  </li>
            <li> Only slight negative I have is the switch location.  </li>
            <li> It did cut down drying time...</li>
            <li> Yes, it did indeed cut down on drying time.</li>
            <li> This cut my hair drying time down to under a minute.</li>
            <li> But the pluses are undeniably outweighed by the minuses: not enough power, not enough heat, useless attachment, and longer drying time than average for both me and my daughter.</li>
            <li> Cuts drying time in half.</li>
            <li> If I can find different attachments (might be difficult as they actually screw on)</li>
            <li> I tend to have slightly wavy, frizzy hair that has been colored.  </li>
            <li> ; cord could be longer to improve overall function; big appliance and not foldable (complicated for storage)</li>
            <li> Would recommend for people with thick and/or long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavier than I would like</li>
            <li> Lots of power that gets my thick head of hair dry on no time!</li>
            <li> I have short very thick hair and it works like a dream.</li>
            <li> Works well however, it is a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has cut my hair drying time in half!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any heavier than other hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned, which I noted was a common complaint from other reviews.</li>
            <li> (I have long, thin, strait hair and lots of it) and I used it once in a while to curl it with a round brush to take a brake from the curling iron.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll try for a replacement from Conair as this merchant won&#x27;t replace.  </li>
            <li> Actually, this item was useless to me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> Use it every day and even though I would not have believed it, it dries my very thick hair faster than any other dryer I have used.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, slightly unruly hair, but I also have very little patience for fixing it.</li>
            <li> probably because half my hair has broken off.  </li>
            <li> Duh.  </li>
            <li> Cons: heavy, tiresome for hands; stiff cord that doesn&#x27;t rotate</li>
            <li> so badly I needed to get a haircut the next day!</li>
            <li> This goes back tomorrow. :(</li>
            <li> Dumb design flaw</li>
            <li> I received it as a gift for Christmas, after two months of gentle use it started making an awful noise.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s irritating to use since buttons are on the handle, where you need to hold it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst hair dryer I ever owned!</li>
            <li> Very frustrating</li>
            <li> I would say I&#x27;m cutting my drying time by 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> Great dryer. Fast dry on warm</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer !</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer. Powerful. Dries hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer, I am blessed with REALLY REALLY thick hair and need something powerful with multiple settings (cool, warm, hot). I like to get ready super quickly and don&#x27;t have patience to spend any more than 10 minutes blow drying my hair. If you haven&#x27;t used a great blow dryer like this one, you are missing out. This dries my hair super quickly and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a really good blow dryer. It dries pretty quick and it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise. Price was reasonable and the color is vibrant.</li>
            <li> Powerful and hot. Well balanced and great volume of air - hot is really hot, can heat shrink tubing with this thing I believe- the middle warm setting is what hot was on my old dryer. Only slight negative I have is the switch location.  Switches are easily changed when waving blower for drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2-1-16 update: hair dryer is still working well - the removable rear grill is nice - makes cleaning out lint easy - several photos attached with product details showing concentrator nozzle attached and unattached.</li>
            <li> Favorite blow dryer, great price. My mother-in-law commented that she loved mine while staying at our apartment so I bought her one for Xmas!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Very frustrating</li>
            <li> It is very pretty however I think it is priced a little high.  It is heavier than other hair dryers that I have used.  A good point is that it is quieter.  I have not noticed any reduction in the time in which my hair dries.  Average product for me.  I was impressed with the looks but disappointed in function.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful and the quality is good !</li>
            <li> After reading reviews everywhere, I thought this hair dryer was the best one for its price. I like that it&#x27;s ceramic- I&#x27;m natural and like ceramic products if I&#x27;m going to use heat on my hair. It doesn&#x27;t dry the hair THAT much faster than other dryers, but it does dry the hair rather quickly. Also, it does get the hair pretty straight if you&#x27;re looking for a good blowout! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I gave it one star shy of 5 stars because it&#x27; is heavier than most blow dryers and I didn&#x27;t like that too much. And lastly, i had to purchase at Target because when I ordered from amazon, my shipment never came...not sure why, but I still love this product.</li>
            <li> great hairdryer!!! Love that this has multiple settings, it&#x27;s sturdy, cute, and drys the hair quick.</li>
            <li> This is my second one, only because the first was broken in my luggage in transit. Lots of power that gets my thick head of hair dry on no time!</li>
            <li> works well but its really loud!</li>
            <li> Works good. My hair needs a lot of heat because of the texture and this blow dryer doesn&#x27;t have the kind of heat my hair needs.</li>
            <li> I have short hair…growing it out…needed something to tame my hair without damaging…high powered, and gives me a very sleek look…definitely recommend…works much better than my $120 &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; dryer!</li>
            <li> Great dryer.  I purchased it as a Christmas gift.  Have my own and love it.  The gift was a hit with my friend.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this hair dryer</li>
            <li> This dryer is quiter than my previous dryer and the weight is right, but it made my hair so frizzy and static!! Will be returning.</li>
            <li> Works really well but expected it to be a little lighter in weight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to say OMBRE finish.  Duh.  Who wants to buy a hair dryer from someone who can&#x27;t spell.  Doesn&#x27;t seem legit.</li>
            <li> I like the color of this hair dryer. It seems very durable and sturdy. My son has one that still works very&lt;br /&gt;well after two years. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair dryers I ever owned.  It doesn&#x27;t fry my hair and dries it fast.  I don&#x27;t even need to use this on the high setting.  Medium works just fine.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt that this is a great color as well.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. Dries hair fast and love the color. I am glad I made the purchase. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I found this hair dryer to be just OK. I like the color, but the weight of the dryer is heavy - especially when holding it to dry my hair, which is thick and curly (and I want to straighten it). There does need to be a \\&quot;slower\\&quot; speed. There are only two speed levels. The lower speed doesn&#x27;t allow me to manage my hair as my previous dryer was able to do. The dryer does dry my hair fast - so if you&#x27;re looking for a \\&quot;fast-drying\\&quot; tool for your hair, then this one is for you. Styling your hair is more of a challenge.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t take the time to rate &amp; give my review when I purchase things online, unless totally love or hate the product. I completely loved it!!!! What sold me when looking at reviews was that the lowest speed was enough to dry your hair. Totally true, which I can&#x27;t say the same for my old hair dryer. That means less noise (one of the things I was looking for), although when set at the highest setting it is still quieter than my old Conair (which is about 4 years old same 1875-Watt). The biggest problem with my old hair dryer was that it took me between 25 to 30 min to dry my hair (I have long, thin, strait hair and lots of it) and I used it once in a while to curl it with a round brush to take a brake from the curling iron. I would end up curling it with the iron anyway because the heat wasn&#x27;t powerful enough. This is not the case with this new hair dryer and It takes almost half the time it took me to dry &amp; curl my hair with the old one. You would think more heat means more damage, not in this case. At the end my hair looks healthier &amp; bouncier than before. Another good thing is that it&#x27;s lighter too. Overall it&#x27;s an A+. I am very happy with mine and I super recommend it!</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;Fast speed. Cuts drying time in half. This is the closest thing to a salon dryer in have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hair dryer! Loads of power and not super loud. I love the different temperature settings because the warm is just right, and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m burning my hair off. Feels like a quality dryer that will last, and the color is darling. Great buy!</li>
            <li> its working amazingly, quick and powerful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;although based on my address which is in Australia, they did not send me with Australian power plug!!!</li>
            <li> Gift for mom, she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer! I bought it after my old Conair 1875 cord keeper that I&#x27;d had for 5 years started smelling funny and getting way too hot when using it. I loved that one, so I decided to stick with Conair and I&#x27;m glad I did. It&#x27;s remarkably quiet in comparison, and even on the hottest setting it isn&#x27;t unbearably hot like the other one was. At first I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t be hot enough, but it dried my medium length and REALLY thick hair in 10 minutes without frizz. It also seems like the attachment will stay on very well. My only complaint is that the dryer is pretty heavy. But for only 10 minutes, I can deal with that. And it was so inexpensive compared to many others! Buy it.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works fine, but the nozzle attachment has air vents on the side of it which seem to defeat the purpose. More air ends up blowing on your hands and away from your head than where you are directing it. If I can find different attachments (might be difficult as they actually screw on) then I would be a fan of this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The hairdryer is what Amazon information says it is-good piece of equipment. It is what I wanted and I am pleased purchase</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful hair dryer. Almost too powerful when switched to high! And I love the colour. Very pretty.</li>
            <li> My daughter has one of these and I loved it so I got one for myself!</li>
            <li> I used it 4 times since I got it 5 days ago and I like it a lot! It looks awesome (if you&#x27;re a fan of pink and purple), and it&#x27;s pretty quiet - even my husband commented on the sound. When it gets to the highest setting, the air flow is strong. Since I have fine hair, I use the highest setting (hot &amp; high) at the beginning, when my hair is wet, and then switch to warm &amp; low to finish it off. And my heart ends up being silky and smooth. That&#x27;s all I wanted, without loosing my hearing, and I got it.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after using it for 6 weeks.  It was used maybe 5 times a week, just once a day -- not extreme or abusive.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll try for a replacement from Conair as this merchant won&#x27;t replace.  Did lots of looking before choose this one and this was unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product when it worked, here are some comments:&lt;br /&gt; - it was loud but tolerable.&lt;br /&gt; - did dry faster than older Conair I had been using&lt;br /&gt; - for those with long hair, this does tend to pull in to the back filter, but only a little which wasn&#x27;t problematic.  BTW -- there were none in the filter of this when it died so not the reason.  Actually, it had so little use the filter was totally clear!&lt;br /&gt; - it&#x27;s big.  takes us some space in cabinet/suitcase if you like to travel with full size dryer&lt;br /&gt; - controls on handle were easy to click on/off which sometimes happened just by holding it to use.</li>
            <li> I received it as a gift for Christmas, after two months of gentle use it started making an awful noise. I contacted conair and they wanted me to pay for shipping to send it back along with a check for $17 or so in order for me to get it back.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it again and it worked for a week until one day some fire came out of it. Definitely scared to even replaced it for the same model. Going back to my old Revlon that is still working after almost 7 years.</li>
            <li> Good hair dryer blows to hard frizzed my curly hair but my daughter loves it</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer. I have really long hair and this blow dryer, dries it extremely fast. It has saved me so much time getting ready. I would easily compare this blow dryer to the pricey ones and actually think it is better. Def recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> It does great wonders for my family&#x27;s hair. Love it.</li>
            <li> love it, but it is loud</li>
            <li> Very powerful hair dryer!  So powerful it fried my fine hair to a crisp.  It did cut down drying time...probably because half my hair has broken off.  Living in Montana, I&#x27;ll save it for thawing pipes.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift. Though it&#x27;s advertised as drying hair faster than other dryers, I found it to take longer than either of my other hair dryers. Two very important notes: The &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; heat setting is nearly indistinguishable from &amp;#34;warm.&amp;#34; It takes a very long time to achieve maximum heat. And the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; speed is near or equivalent to &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; on my other dryers, which range from cheap crap to high-end (a very cheap Revlon from about five years ago and an Andis which cost ~$60).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concentrator attachment is flawed, in that it has two large vents, which direct about half the air volume away from the area you&#x27;re trying to concentrate on. Not at all effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some pluses to this appliance. It&#x27;s very pretty. The cord is a decent length. And it has a removable filter, which I like a lot. But the pluses are undeniably outweighed by the minuses: not enough power, not enough heat, useless attachment, and longer drying time than average for both me and my daughter. Steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li> Yes, it did indeed cut down on drying time. With the high speed, drying my kid&#x27;s hair with this was like sticking them in a wind tunnel, a very frizzy wind tunnel. The hottest setting still felt too cool and it wasn&#x27;t sufficient to make their hair sleek. With warm-ish air blasting at them it just kept getting fluffier and fluffier. This goes back tomorrow. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for only about 6 months. It stopped producing hot air and now only blows cold which doesn&#x27;t do a thing to dry my hair. I guess it&#x27;s time to look for yet another hair dryer!!</li>
            <li> I found that I had to use my regular dryer prior to using the Infinity Pro. Actually, this item was useless to me.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.  It dries my thick hair much faster than my Revlon dryer that it&#x27;s replacing.  I have no frizz and my hair is very shiny.  The only slight downfall is that it is slightly heavier than my last dryer, however, because it dries so fast, it really isn&#x27;t that much of an issue.  I would strongly recommend this dryer.  For the price, I don&#x27;t think one could get a better deal.</li>
            <li> blow drys fast, but it is VERY noisy, seems like a plane is in your room!</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful color and SO powerful!</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst hair dryer I ever owned! Extremely powerful and burned my hair so badly I needed to get a haircut the next day! If I could give it no stars I would! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product!</li>
            <li> super satisfied with the product, really good quality , powerful , excellent .</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is very quiet as far as hair driers go and gets my hair dry much faster than my old one.  Granted the old one was over 10 years old, but still.  I would say I&#x27;m cutting my drying time by 5 minutes.  I have long, thick hair and tons of it, so the faster my hair dries, the better!  Plus given the ceramic put into it, it shouldn&#x27;t be as damaging as other driers might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my decision and it&#x27;s a great value for the price too!</li>
            <li> purchased this product for my wife. TWO MONTHS later the heat stopped working! Disappointing but I figured that it would surely be covered under warranty. When I called the Conair service line and spent my lunch waiting to talk to representative I was told that ITEMS PURCHASED ON AMAZON ARE NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY!</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and was everything I expected. My only issue is that the end keeps popping off while using it.</li>
            <li> Decent hairdryer, but it&#x27;s irritating to use since buttons are on the handle, where you need to hold it. Dumb design flaw</li>
            <li> Love this dryer. Cuts down on drying time and leaves my hair so smooth!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. I think it actually did dry my hair faster than the old dryer. It was also fairly quite.</li>
            <li> Works great for my super thick and long hair! Drys it a lot faster than my old hair dryer which is great. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is how heavy/bulky it is but for the time it saves me getting ready it&#x27;s not a big deal! Would recommend for people with thick and/or long hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t report as to the longetivity of the unit at this time, as I am a new owner, but I love the frizz busting efficiency of this dryer.  I recently visited a new stylist that recommended a name brand professional dryer for size, weight, and effectiveness.  Well, that dryer cost $200+, so I began looking at other options.  Maybe I will have that nice dyer in the future, but this will do until then.  The Conair Infinty Pro tools mostly have great reviews, and it didn&#x27;t break the bank.  The first time I used this was on dry hair with the concentrator and a round brush to smooth my hair and restyle with more volume.  I was very impressed.  I use the low heat and low speed setting, as my hair is thin.  I tend to have slightly wavy, frizzy hair that has been colored.  I will add that it is a good idea to use the concentrator for added control and smoothness.  Also, I watched some great blowdrying videos online that give excellent tips on how to achieve volume, smoothness and avoid certain mistakes that can frizz or cause flat styling.  There is a right way to use a dryer and a brush.  This model is also very light and the length of the nozzle is a little on the shorter side, so it is very easy to handle without fatigue. I will update my review after using this for a longer period of time</li>
            <li> Works well however, it is a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  I can&#x27;t believe how quickly it dries my hair.  My only complaint is that the low blow speed is very high.... it seems higher than the high on my old dryer.  I wish there was one lower for the last stages of blow drying.</li>
            <li> Works Great, no complaints at all about the blow dryer.  Pretty Color too.  Great price and great deal.  Its worth it</li>
            <li> Have owned this model since it came out.</li>
            <li> I deal with professional dryers often and have had my share of professional expensive ones. After my 3rd one died I didn&#x27;t have time to go get another one as the salon wholesale stores where closed. So I picked this one up from target. It is heavy but most of mine are like that. It is loud even though it advertises as quiet. But it&#x27;s very powerful. Actually dried my clients hair faster than professional ones. So far it&#x27;s held up since the weekend having been used all day everyday. But I had to comment to say it seems to be a really good dryer! (But heavy and loud). I will definatley keep it at home for my families use!!!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is so much more gorgeous in person than online. It&#x27;s a beautiful blend of purple and pink. It has a &#x27;cool shot&#x27; button which is also nice. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any heavier than other hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned, which I noted was a common complaint from other reviews. For me, it seems just fine. It does come with an attachment piece to help with air flow direction, and this attached easily. The buttons work well. The cord is quite long. It also has a very easily removable filter so that you can keep the hair dryer clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a swivel cord, which would be much easier when moving around drying my hair. Also, it is quite large, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a travel dryer. That said, it&#x27;s very powerful. Overall, it was just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer comes with a 4 year warranty that is &#x27;limited.&#x27; The &#x27;limited&#x27; part just means you pay return shipping for a new product. I called Conair directly to find out this information, and they said even if I purchased the dryer through Amazon that the return process and warranty to get a new product are the same. I hope this is helpful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Year update-I use this every day and it&#x27;s still working great! This is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned, by far. It&#x27;s super powerful. It&#x27;s definitely on the louder side, but it really dries my hair quickly! Love this thing. So glad I bought it! I get compliments when my friends borrow it, too. It&#x27;s so pretty!</li>
            <li> Very powerful blow dryer!</li>
            <li> Really like this hair dryer; it is so much better for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Price really fluctuated on this.  I got it and shortly after that the price went way up.&lt;br /&gt;This is sold at Costco too.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, slightly unruly hair, but I also have very little patience for fixing it. This hairdryer gets it dry quickly and leaves it looking pretty good! I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not as quiet as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I have never used a hair dryer that cost more than $15 or $20 because I thought it was BS that the more expensive ones were better. OMG, why did I wait so long? This cut my hair drying time down to under a minute. I have short hair but prior to this, it was up to 4 or 5 minutes even with short hair. The other reason I love it (and really why I bought it) was that it allows me to dry my bangs so they are straight versus curled. I have straight hair but like most people, there are a few curly Qs. I&#x27;ll never go cheap again!</li>
            <li> Best hairdryer I have owned!</li>
            <li> I purchased this new at Walmart; it burnt out after just a few weeks of use. (This despite only using it once every few days, and never using it on the &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; setting.)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t agree with the reviews. It was fine, but nothing special. It didn&#x27;t decrease my drying time at all. To the contrary, my drugstore Revlon travel dryer did better. This dryer never really got hot enough for me to get my hair smooth. My hair was noticeably frizzier after using this dryer, and my hair is fine and straight. I ended up putting it away as a spare and ordering the BaByLiss Pro. I&#x27;m very happy with that one.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has cut my hair drying time in half! I&#x27;m not having to use my flat iron has much now either. I have short very thick hair and it works like a dream. It is loud but it&#x27;s a hair dryer there&#x27;s not such thing as a powerful quiet dryer. As far as the weight goes it&#x27;s a little heavier than my last but it works so great I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know a dryer could make a difference, but I love this one.  It dries my hair VERY quickly and I get no frizz or static from it.  Amazing.  It&#x27;s a little heavier than I would like but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I always use Conair products, so I sent this hair dryer to my granddaughter and she loves it too!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Use it every day and even though I would not have believed it, it dries my very thick hair faster than any other dryer I have used. My hair is never frizzy. It is a bit heavy but that is not a problem for me. And even though this does not really matter, it is pretty.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t order from Amazon (found it cheaper at the wholesale store), but since I&#x27;ve followed Am reviews when deciding what hairdryer to buy, I wanted to leave a review here. This was my first usage and I&#x27;ll update if any issues occur. This was my first time using an ionic blow dryer, and I must say I&#x27;m pretty impressed, my hair is smoother and shinier than using a regular one! My hair used to be all puffy after blow drying and needed 12+ hours to recover,so I&#x27;m very satisfied by immediate results. I have long, thick, straight/wavy and dry hair and have used hot/low setting to dry it. It took me less than 10 minutes (old blow dryer- around 20 minutes). Cold shot functions good and yes, you do need to hold it. Even so, I have a few cons, so in short: Pros: ionic technology does work! shinier/smoother looking hair and half off drying time; regular &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34; (not quiet, but not too loud) Cons: heavy, tiresome for hands; stiff cord that doesn&#x27;t rotate; cord could be longer to improve overall function; big appliance and not foldable (complicated for storage)</li>
            <li> Probably terrific for regular straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have soft, thick coarse hair and this doesn&#x27;t straighten my hair as it dries like my other blow dryers have done in the past. I was mislead by the fantastic reviews this product has. This dryer is DEFINITELY getting returned.</li>
            <li> Dryer works well, but a little bulkier than I expected.  The electric cord is also shorter than I expected (from a lower level wall outlet, it&#x27;s stretched to reach the top of my head).  Otherwise, I enjoy it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great price, great hair dryer. It&#x27;s as good, if not better than the very expensive one we have. We plan to take it on trips!</li>
            <li> This is ABSOLUTELY the best hair dryer out there. It has great temperature control, direct heat, and optional speeds. I had this hair dryer at my house and decided to replace my hair dryer at the cabin with the exact same one, I loved it so much.</li>
