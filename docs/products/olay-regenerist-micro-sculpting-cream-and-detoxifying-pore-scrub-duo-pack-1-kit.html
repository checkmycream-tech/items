            <li>I love whole line of the Regenerist products.</li>
            <li>my skin has really improved for the better.</li>
            <li>Love it so much I&#x27;ve set up subscribe &amp; save</li>
            <li>Not one single sing of irritation and my skin looks amazing!</li>
            <li>I got lucky making the decision to use Olay since my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite Oil of Olay pack.</li>
            <li>worked very well, skin is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>so i guess i made a right choice.</li>
            <li>I use both of these products religiously on a daily basis and my skin has never felt better.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even and my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li>was the first</li>
            <li>The face cream really does reduce wrinkles!</li>
            <li>Comparing this with the Olay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser to see which helps my face more in the long run.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know anything bout sculpting cream stuff</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about a month, and I really see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It works very well on my skins -</li>
            <li>both products work very well.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my skin after only the first use!!</li>
            <li>Throw in a weekly regimen of Korean face masks and your skin will look gorgeous for a lot less than getting a facial.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have been using Olay my whole adult life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 58 years old and really don&#x27;t have any wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I love that this cleanser isn&#x27;t harsh on my skin and it still leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face is so soft and my large pored are nearly invisible.</li>
            <li>Gives my face a nice glow that during the summer months I don&#x27;t need any facial makeup just a little eye shadow and mascara, and I&#x27;m out the door.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I used it once or twice a day depending on how busy I am</li>
            <li>Lightened the skin discoloration I have from sun damage, texture of my skin is soft again.</li>
            <li>I have an expensive microdermabrasion machine and this is almost as good...</li>
            <li>I have have a mild case of the typical skin problems..  </li>
            <li>but I really did notice a difference in the first few weeks of using it, and I am still seeing improvement.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and always tried new products that might be cheaper but always came back to olay.</li>
            <li>The abrasive (but not too rough), pore scrub gets rid of dirt that regular soap can&#x27;t, cleans way down deep and leaves my skin feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s faster and the moisturizer is thick but really soaks in fast.</li>
            <li>I use the Olay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser on the right half of my face, and the Olay Detoxifying Pore Scrub on the left for cleansing, and the Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting Cream over my entire face.</li>
            <li>The scrub can be too harsh depending on how you&#x27;re using it, so, don&#x27;t scrub with the scrub ;)</li>

            <li> Long story short, I got 3 treatments and the only that one that showed sun damage</li>
            <li> oily spots, dry spots, occasional pimples, blackheads, irregular tone and texture,</li>
            <li> She is not old nor wrinkly yet (40y/</li>
            <li> Makes your pores smaller unlike other products that claim it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using both these products daily at night for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I told them it couldn&#x27;t due the sun damage I should have.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my mom as a Christmas present since it is really hard to please her with other material gifts.</li>
            <li> However, when I do use them, I feel a slight tingling (almost tightening) sensation in my skin that makes me think I would see drastic results If I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these with the serum for about a year and a half now.</li>
            <li> and I get little pimples from it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the unscented Olay Regenerist cream for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the difference in touch and appearance in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> At the age of 68 with badly sun damaged skin I find that the detoxifying pore scrub not only reduced size of pores but also has smoothed the dry rough skin along the jaw line.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it in the morning in the shower and leave it on my face for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> no more Olay creams for me.</li>
            <li> and alas,</li>
            <li> I was shocked</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel horrible leaving the house in make up anymore.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t touch it retail!</li>
            <li> I havent really noticed any results but it makes my skin feel nice</li>
            <li> I can tell the difference already and it has only been about 10 days.  I have lots of sun damage on my face and this is helping to minimize the look.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Guys like to look good, too, so I tried this combo and it works great.  The abrasive (but not too rough), pore scrub gets rid of dirt that regular soap can&#x27;t, cleans way down deep and leaves my skin feeling very clean.  Then I put the cream on my frown lines and underneath my eyes.  I&#x27;ve been using a combo like this (including this one), for years, and everybody tells me I look great (I&#x27;m going to be 60 next year), and it&#x27;s good to hear from others that I don&#x27;t look (or act) as &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; as I am!</li>
            <li> The best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my face. My face is so soft and my large pored are nearly invisible.</li>

            <li> These are a couple of my favorite Olay products.Great packaging and arrived in 2 days. I will definitely purchase again.</li>

            <li> Been using this for how many years</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and always tried new products that might be cheaper but always came back to olay. My skin is sensitive and this has always worked the best. Cleans so well and moisturizes great.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that when I used this,  my sensitive skin might revolt because I&#x27;ve never really used any products like this before.  I have have a mild case of the typical skin problems..  oily spots, dry spots, occasional pimples, blackheads, irregular tone and texture, blah blah blah.  The cream went on nicely without any irritation or redness.  The scrub can be too harsh depending on how you&#x27;re using it, so, don&#x27;t scrub with the scrub ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using both these products daily at night for a few weeks and I can definitely see a difference with my skin. I love that this cleanser isn&#x27;t harsh on my skin and it still leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream goes on smoothly and absorbs well. My skin feels smoother and firmer. My skin tone is more even and my pores look smaller. The wrinkles around my eyes aren&#x27;t as prominent. I love Olay products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the unscented Olay Regenerist cream for a few years now. I got this because it came with the exfoliating wash. I like the way the wash leaves my skin very smooth. I usually use it in the morning in the shower and leave it on my face for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The scent of both are kind of strong. I would purchase the wash again, but think I will go back to the unscented cream.&lt;br /&gt;In all, I&#x27;ve used creams that cost three times as much as this one and Olay Regenerist works better than all of them.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my mom as a Christmas present since it is really hard to please her with other material gifts. So, i decided to buy this and she loves it. She is not old nor wrinkly yet (40y/o) but i don&#x27;t know, she just loves it so i guess i made a right choice. I don&#x27;t really know anything bout sculpting cream stuff but i know Olay is a great product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast shipment.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month, and I really see a difference in my skin. It looks and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay my whole adult life. I&#x27;m 58 years old and really don&#x27;t have any wrinkles. People comment on how good my skin looks a lot. I  was a sun worshiper all my life and thought I needed IPL treatments. They told my that my skin looked pretty good. I told them it couldn&#x27;t due the sun damage I should have. Long story short, I got 3 treatments and the only that one that showed sun damage was the first and it was only 3 tiny spots. The next 2 IPL treatments I asked them for a deeper IPL and nothing. I was shocked but I can only attribute it to the Olay. I got lucky making the decision to use Olay since my 20&#x27;s. If you do the research on moisturizers where they aren&#x27;t trying to sell you the most expensive ones, Olay Regenerist will always be one of them. I can&#x27;t sing enough praises for Olay. I love whole line of the Regenerist products.</li>
            <li> Great Products and fast shipment. It works very well on my skins - I used it once or twice a day depending on how busy I am</li>
            <li> It is amazing! It&#x27;s so hydrating and Smells nice. The very Best part is it doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily.</li>
            <li> Oh my! I can&#x27;t believe the difference in my skin after only the first use!! I have very sensitive skin so I was hesitant to try yet another skin care product. Not one single sing of irritation and my skin looks amazing! My pores look smaller, my skin looks firmer, softer and smoother over all. I think I just found my perfect skin care match!!</li>
            <li> worked very well, skin is nice and soft. Use the pore scrub  on about once a mouth  both products work very well.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Love that they packaged it together at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> bought this for the cleanser. it has a great scent and tiny beads. Olay always a good product.</li>
            <li> Love the creme and like the wash.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so clean.</li>
            <li> I like the product. It works good. My face feels very clean after I use the face scrub.  Just top it off with the cream and you&#x27;re ready to go.  Gives my face a nice glow that during the summer months I don&#x27;t need any facial makeup just a little eye shadow and mascara, and I&#x27;m out the door.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, top price, happy to buy again</li>
            <li> Good price for a good product.</li>
            <li> At the age of 68 with badly sun damaged skin I find that the detoxifying pore scrub not only reduced size of pores but also has smoothed the dry rough skin along the jaw line.  I was amazed at the difference in touch and appearance in just a few days.  In the morning I use the micro-sculpting cream but at night I find great results with the use of the Burt&#x27;s Bees Intensive hydration -great moisture here.  Such a splendid difference in the skin with using these products along with use of a serum of course before the creams.</li>
            <li> I have an expensive microdermabrasion machine and this is almost as good...it&#x27;s faster and the moisturizer is thick but really soaks in fast.</li>
            <li> As of now, I must be honest. I haven&#x27;t been religious with the use of these products combined. However, when I do use them, I feel a slight tingling (almost tightening) sensation in my skin that makes me think I would see drastic results If I did. The cleanser alone is amazing, and I do get complimented on my skin all the time from the 2 -3 times I do use it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife she use it and likes it makes her skin feel smooth and tighter</li>
            <li> Its the best anti aging products I have used. my skin has really improved for the better. I thank my God</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I use it often. Love the combo.</li>
            <li> I used to buy Olay Definity. But, they stopped making it. And, maybe my skin has changed over the years, too. But, I always seem to feel like I have a film over my skin when I use over the counter creams now and alas, no more Olay creams for me. Maybe it&#x27;s the extra stuff put in it. And, the Regenerist Cream is no exception. Creates a film and I get little pimples from it. I do, however, like the Detoxifying Pore Scrub...that makes my skin feel clean</li>
            <li> Has a perfumy fragrance that I could do without, but the affect it has on my facial skin is very nice. Comparing this with the Olay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser to see which helps my face more in the long run. I use the Olay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser on the right half of my face, and the Olay Detoxifying Pore Scrub on the left for cleansing, and the Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting Cream over my entire face. Have been using these two for about two months now.</li>
            <li> Love the regenerist line! This is all I use to stay youthful....and its working!</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works! Makes your pores smaller unlike other products that claim it does. The face cream really does reduce wrinkles! I spend a lot on face creams that take forever to work or just don&#x27;t seem to work. I&#x27;ve used these for almost a month now. I can and feel the difference, I love these items.</li>
            <li> The best skin care I&#x27;ve used!  Noticed a difference in my skin in about 2 weeks of using this product. Lightened the skin discoloration I have from sun damage, texture of my skin is soft again. Love it so much I&#x27;ve set up subscribe &amp; save so I don&#x27;t run out..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these with the serum for about a year and a half now. I really love this line. I use all three daily and I have noticed a HUGE difference in my tone and complexion. I don&#x27;t feel horrible leaving the house in make up anymore. It gets better the longer you use it but I really did notice a difference in the first few weeks of using it, and I am still seeing improvement. It&#x27;s a great product at a great price.</li>
