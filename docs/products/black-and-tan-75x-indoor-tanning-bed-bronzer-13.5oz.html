            <li>Man am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions to a T (made sure I rubbed the lotion in well and all!)</li>
            <li>Love this tanning lotion and it is way cheaper on here than in stores!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Not Sticky Leaves Amazing Color</li>
            <li>But it says I bought it, I&#x27;m guessing it replaced something else, so for now until an update, I have nothing to review, 4 stars for the confusion and to be nice, can&#x27;t leave three stars for never having used this...</li>
            <li>This product does deliver a nice bronzing without turning orange.</li>
            <li>It smells good and goes on so smoothly!</li>
            <li>and this one is KIND OF one of them.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product based off many good reviews... but must say I am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tried about 20+ lotions over the years during tanning and this one is nice.</li>
            <li>It smells good too:)</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but just doesn&#x27;t deliver the desired color for me.</li>
            <li>nice lotion.</li>
            <li>it gives you a nice tan</li>
            <li>It does have a nice smell.</li>
            <li>This really is the best lotion for the price!</li>
            <li>Sure it was a good price</li>
            <li>Nice for getting to a medium/dark tan.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice - kind of like sugar.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good lotion just like most lotions..</li>
            <li>WORTH THE $$$!!!</li>
            <li>product smells pretty good, feels great and doesn&#x27;t sweat off and feel sticky.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, and the smell is pretty awesome too.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and leaves skin soft!!</li>
            <li>I can tan very easy.</li>
            <li>But the after tam smell was very strong and I feel like even after I showered I could still smell the burnt smell.</li>
            <li>and I must say best one I&#x27;ve ever had so far!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best indoor tanning lotion I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was hoping for more.</li>
            <li>This by far has the best scent, both before and after tanning.  </li>
            <li>I have used all kinds of tanning lotions, and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price, and the quantity is so worth the price.</li>
            <li>The warming beads sure do warm you up.</li>
            <li>smells great &amp; make you tan nice &amp; fast!</li>
            <li>It smells nice, not to strong and there is no burnt skin smell either which is nice.</li>
            <li>It smells sooooo good and it shows results very quickly :)</li>
            <li>Love love love this tanner!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I have tried a TON of lotions - popular tingles, regular lotions that are the newest and supposedly the best and let me say, that I am really glad I forgot my lotion because this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It spreads very evenly and it smells good too!</li>
            <li>I was super happy to find it on Amazon for such a great price!</li>
            <li>The service was great got my lotion very fast.  </li>

            <li>This smells good, and I felt like it helped me tan quickly and maintain my color.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice golden tan, also tan stays longer than most lotions !</li>
            <li>excly like in picture, fast shipping, good quality, good price, I am happy with this product, very practic, easy to use.</li>
            <li>this product is amazing and very reasonable on pricing!!</li>
            <li>I put the lotion on and LOVE the smell.</li>
            <li>This is my most favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Make sure to apply to skin evenly tho , and to waah your hands afterwards.</li>
            <li>as many have said.  </li>

            <li>However, I feel orangy when my sister has a better looking tan.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that on my feet if I don&#x27;t get it put on perfectly it leaves orange spots and the same on my wrists!</li>
            <li>and she plans to purchase more when it runs out.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product...</li>
            <li>It will make you darker, that is for sure.</li>
            <li>I was tan before using this, but after just one use of this stuff I received many compliments.</li>
            <li>It reminds me more of a sunless tanner you buy at walmart.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>

            <li>but I did take precautions to make sure that it was applied evenly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use better than this product.</li>
            <li>seems to do better than most lotions and for the money its quite the bargain.</li>
            <li>I am glad I decided on this one.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Its my favorite tanning lotion</li>
            <li>this gave me a wonderful and lasting brown color with no orange.  </li>
            <li>Love It Leaves My Skin</li>
            <li>And To Top It Of My Man Loves It</li>
            <li>Last For Hours Best Tanning Lotion</li>
            <li>More like a self tanner than an indoor tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a bit &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you wipe off the access lotion on your hands and in between your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Works better with upgrade bronzing beds.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>An OK product.</li>
            <li>Using the product I have noticed my tan increasing faster than not using anything make sure to rub it all the way in to avoid streaks.  </li>
            <li>Perfect lotion if you&#x27;re just starting out</li>
            <li>Another favorite lotion of mine.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love it but..</li>
            <li>still looking for better ones but not  spend alot of money.</li>
            <li>love it ...</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Used it all winter long at the tanning bed and was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>But it does it&#x27;s job and smells pretty good</li>
            <li>Great product, goes on good and it doesn&#x27;t give off that tan smell that you get from other products.  </li>
            <li>Great lotion (even for sensitive skin like mine).  </li>
            <li>Pleasant smell and a decent bronzer.</li>
            <li>No tingling, no bad smell!  </li>
            <li>Does blend in easily when applying.</li>
            <li>or after I got out of the bed... I&#x27;m happy with this cream so far, lets hope I get super tan :)</li>
            <li>Smells good going on, typical smell after tanning, bronzer in lotion works great, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>You notice a difference very quickly.</li>
            <li>Like most tanning bed lotions with a bronzer, you need to clean your hands and between your fingers after application.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan easy</li>
            <li>This was a great price for this same tanning product that my tanning salon charged a quite a bit more for.  </li>
            <li>, it comes out of the bottle easy and it makes you darker.</li>
            <li>so I tan easily, but</li>
            <li>Product is really great and actually protects some against being burnt BUT, make sure you immediately wash your hands because they can and will change orange.</li>
            <li>Smell is strong.</li>
            <li>I highly strongly recommend this lotion to everyone.</li>
            <li>This gets you a nice even color fast and I will never buy lotion in the store again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;VE BEEN USING SNOOKI AND LIKED IT PRETTY</li>
            <li>One of the best bronzers I have ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li>The scent is unremarkable, which is fine</li>
            <li>I received the lotion and all seemed fine but the color of the lotion is gray.</li>
            <li>well it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>If your looking to get tan quick, this is the lotion to use!</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and the results are better with each application.</li>
            <li>but.... sorta wish they would make one like this without the super chicka smell!</li>
            <li>This made me super tan expecially in the turbo bed!</li>
            <li>I love this product very much!</li>
            <li>I saw a huge difference with just one use, and you get darker with every use.</li>
            <li>and I am noticing a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>I am an advanced tanner</li>
            <li>Overall she is happy with it</li>
            <li>Definitely worth more than it cost.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and leaves skin moisturized silky.</li>
            <li>Have been the the tanner only 4 times and have a great tan going.  </li>
            <li>lotion goes on smooth</li>
            <li>I definitely am seeing some great color.  </li>
            <li>I like the results this lotion gives it goes on smooth</li>
            <li>and  gives instant results allowing you to tan once a week and still maintaining a great tan</li>
            <li>what I got and what is pictured here is not the same, however I have used both before and great products</li>
            <li>It smells really good &amp; makes my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>Has a great texture that poors smoothly from the bottle and speads over your body easily, so it lasts a long time..</li>
            <li>It never turned me orange , but the color I received was thrilling !!</li>
            <li>This lotion gives you a wonderful golden tan I haven&#x27;t gotten to dark with this one</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much it helps me tan, but it doesn&#x27;t have the strong smell that most lotions do.</li>
            <li>Black &amp; Tan has made me feel great &amp; look fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love the color I got just from the first session with it.</li>
            <li>Super quick delivery!</li>
            <li>The customer reviews were right!</li>
            <li>just becareful to make sure you rub this in very well or it will streak.  </li>
            <li>I have used this tanning lotion for 2 years now and love how fast you can see the difference.</li>
            <li>I have been tanning for 20 years and this is one of the better lotions I have tried and really like.  </li>
            <li>Only problem is you have to rub it in really good, because it does streak, but who cares when it gets ya tan.  </li>
            <li>This was a really good tanning lotion back when I used to tan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen tanning lotions to see which would be the best for getting darker and</li>
            <li>I actually just bought another bottle for my friend because she used it and loved it.</li>
            <li>I have spent LOTS of money on tanning lotions and products, and I&#x27;m so glad I finally found the perfect match!</li>
            <li>Also, you have to make sure you rub it in really well</li>
            <li>it will surely burn you if you set your minutes too high!</li>
            <li>I saw all the great reviews for their lotions and were so cheap I ended up  choosing black and tan.</li>
            <li>It smells good compared to other lotions that are extremely strong and leave the burnt smell.</li>
            <li>This lotion delivers a better quality than many lotions that are double or triple the price.</li>
            <li>No burning the skin and has a mild scent.  </li>
            <li>worked quickly</li>
            <li>Mild scent that goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>I am pretty light complected and using this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned but with the right lotions I can get pretty dark, this helped me achieve that.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon.couldn&#x27;t live without it.however</li>
            <li>I tanned and came home to a much darker difference than usual and was very impressed, as was my husband.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this to a lot of girls that are willing to get tanned fast :]</li>
            <li>the fragrance is REALLY girly and fairly strong.</li>
            <li>Idk if the bronzers are really that strong.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this with a tanning bed I saw color on my skin!</li>
            <li>Really accelerates your tan!!</li>
            <li>This is some good stuff, I usually use tinglers, but this is a great deep tanner.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, I saw a difference after the first visit to the tanning bed and after 6 (going every other or every 3 days)</li>
            <li>If you want to get a great tan and get dark, buy this product!  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and it hasn&#x27;t streaked on me at all and after only 3 10 min sessions</li>
            <li>Anyway, I am happy with the results~ as I am going on vacation in a few days and didn&#x27;t want to look like an oompa loompa on the beach.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery, cheap and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the price on amazon</li>
            <li>but after using it for a couple weeks I noticed marks on my legs like it didnt blend in my skin so not really crazy about it..</li>
            <li>I was looking more for a tanning accelerator and prefer clear lotions.</li>
            <li>But still worth the price I think.</li>
            <li>I do have to wipe off hands of course after applying, because it does stain palms, and around ankle and top of foot area it can be a real pain if not rubbed in really well.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this bronzer if you are in the market for some nice color without the tingle.</li>
            <li>,I gave it a 4 rating just because its a thick lotion which makes me use more to cover my whole body, but it works great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product many times and realized that it has a self tanner in it, which works really well and really fast.</li>
            <li>nice deep color right away....</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, it gives you a really dark bronze color and gets darker the longer you sit, I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my tan using this product</li>
            <li>So far this is only kind that doesn&#x27;t have the overly strong smell that gives me headaches...</li>
            <li>Wonderful bronze color will be achieved by the slightly above average tanner.</li>
            <li>It doesnt have a strong scent but it leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I needed a quick tan for my son&#x27;s wedding and I really don&#x27;t like to use tanning beds that often.</li>
            <li>I read all sorts of reviews, looking for my first lotion, and what I heard from  black and tan was good.</li>
            <li>ordered multiple times from my new friends at Thee Tan Man and extremely satisfied EVERY time!</li>
            <li>I am very (I mean VERY) fair complected and have a lot of sensitivities to lotions.  </li>
            <li>The price is so much cheaper than what you pay in a salon!</li>
            <li>A friend &amp; I both tried this lotion when I received it, and we both had visible results after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I just got home from the tanning salon and used this cream for the first time....</li>
            <li>On the front of the bottle it says the cream contains warming beads which I was a bit nervous about because I didn&#x27;t exactly know what they were...</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, I used it before my sister&#x27;s engagement party, and only went three times and was so amazed at the color I received!  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using this when I use the indoor tanning beds, it makes my skin soft and smells yummy.</li>
            <li>and I am already very noticeably darker!</li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>The first time you use, you will see it.</li>
            <li>I noticed some darkening after the first use.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as picture on Amazon and does exactly what it was designed to do.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a tan with the first application.</li>
            <li>I had before so the first time I put it on it</li>
            <li>I have tried many lotions and different bands.  </li>
            <li>I have bought several bottles of this lotion and will continue to buy more.</li>
            <li>AND SHIPPING WAS REALLY FAST!</li>
            <li>Thsi gives you intense hydration which is needed and leaves your body bronzed with a sun-kissed glow!  </li>
            <li>I really like the results i&#x27;m seeing with this product!</li>
            <li>Love this product will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>but you should wipe it off your hands after applying ;)</li>
            <li>:) I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin color!</li>
            <li>Thank you for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I really like this bronzer!  </li>
            <li>I can get pretty tan</li>
            <li>Works waaaay better than any designer lotion I&#x27;ve bought in salons, and only $15!</li>
            <li>Gets you tan real quick, will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>I love trying different tanning lotions...</li>
            <li>good not heavily fragranced and lasts a long time</li>
            <li>I was very excited to see the reviews prior to purchase.</li>
            <li>I love how you can buy products like this for so much cheaper than in the actual tanning places.  </li>
            <li>Because its pretty much all bronzer...</li>
            <li>This lotion WORKS and will help you to achieve a nice, dark tan.</li>
            <li>and it really looks very natural and works quickly.  </li>
            <li>gets you dark super fast for cheap !</li>
            <li>We have the same skin type and both tend to burn easily.</li>
            <li>but it makes your skin super soft when tanning</li>
            <li>I was really surprised how quickly a tan came with this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different lotions based on good reviews and am frankly tired of buying so many different lotions to achieve the results I want</li>
            <li>I could see a decent color after the first 10 minute session.</li>
            <li>so it is nice to have something with a little bronzer to get my skin browning.</li>
            <li>It works great and leaves your skin feeling soft and DARK!!!</li>
            <li>I understand that this has a bronzer element, but I must admit it was a huge shock to realize almost all of the tan was simply bronzer.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to help me get a darker tan and get ready for Spring and Summer coming up.  </li>
            <li>I was at a plateau and couldn&#x27;t really get any darker</li>
            <li>I am already very tan</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>No burning or tingling thanks</li>
            <li>Just be careful to rub off excess from your fingers :)</li>
            <li>Took a bath and rubbed off everything to find that I really hadn&#x27;t even tanned much at all...</li>
            <li>I just got it today and went straight to the tanning salon.  </li>
            <li>No orange color or staining, but I am much darker than I was before I went tanning today.  </li>
            <li>I got darker much faster than my sister did.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and worked way better than expected.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much color was in the product itself, so that resulted in streaking because of uneven/hurried application.</li>
            <li>Worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I NOTICED THE DIFFERECE THAT FAST.</li>
            <li>will get more when it is empty .</li>
            <li>keeps you from fading as fast</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I bet you could use this as tanless tanning lotion, because it seems to me whether or not you tan after applying this won&#x27;t make much difference</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion does not tan very well.  </li>
            <li>It stains really well though.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about my lotions.</li>
            <li>thing I don&#x27;t like as much about this lotion</li>
            <li>Really accelerated my tan.</li>
            <li>I really like the color this lotion gave me</li>
            <li>This really does accelerate the tanning process in bed and stand up tanners.</li>
            <li>and I am not bronzed much at all.  </li>
            <li>However, once you shower and really scrub yourself, you notice you lose all of your tan.</li>
            <li>Recieved product fast ...</li>
            <li>Lotion made me very orange and noticeable lines</li>
            <li>It smells good (at least to me) and</li>
            <li>Honestly I tan almost everyday.</li>
            <li>This stuff has a little self tanner in it to give you extra color and the smell is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>so I will never order a 2 yr old product without first checking the shelf life at a salon since that info is not disclosed with the product info.</li>
            <li>but I am purchasing a new one this weekend!</li>
            <li>BUT THE BLACK &amp; TAN IS WAY BETTER.</li>
            <li>You must make sure you apply it evenly on your skin or you might get a slight line.</li>
            <li>After using this lotion my skin gets red and irritated most likely from the warming beads.</li>
            <li>So mainly because of the after smell</li>
            <li>I tan pretty easily, but usually get to a certain point where I cant get any darker.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone who loves tanning</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this..</li>
            <li>and I usually tan pretty easily and fast.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I noticed a major difference of my skin color.</li>
            <li>so your hands don&#x27;t turn orange then rub a little on just the TOP of your hand to get an even color.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a little tingle in it as well.</li>
            <li>Is this normal for this lotion??  </li>
            <li>I think it is good, but not great.  </li>
            <li>I only notice a slight tingle warm feeling after I&#x27;m done tanning.</li>
            <li>Gives good color equal to some of the other brands I&#x27;ve used such as Designer Skin products (14K Gold).  </li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and hard to tan,  seriously one week of using this lotion and tanning on level 1, I got better color then ever before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to tanning beds, but I&#x27;ve used the sunless spray machines like Mystic Tan before.</li>
            <li>wish i new about this lotion earlery.</li>
            <li>I will be making this my new go-to lotion.</li>
            <li>Let me just say WOW!</li>
            <li>I can say, please do NOT waste your money!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely have no regrets about buying this product.</li>
            <li>I am completely amazed by the results!  </li>
            <li>I have been indoor tanning for several years now and have used dozens of lotions, but this lotion seems to fall short in giving me that rich color that I come to expect from a bronzing lotion.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>so I peeled the white label off of the back of the bottle that was put on by the seller and sure enough the shelf life was 12 months</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone first starting out with tanning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little strong, but not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Doing</li>
            <li>Nice tan with Black &amp; Tan but some streaking can occur and some of bronze comes off after showering and wiping dry with towel.</li>
            <li>I have been using Paint it Black for two years, but thought I would try Black &amp; Tan since it had good reviews, as well.  </li>
            <li>I received my black&amp;tan in the mail,and while it smells good it hardly has Any  color!!  </li>
            <li>Also, this product has a burning sensation that causes your skin to turn pink, as if you have a mild burn.</li>
            <li>, doesn&#x27;t require a lot, doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy on the skin, and doesn&#x27;t smell strong.</li>
            <li>This lotion helps get my skin a lot darker compared to many other popular lotions and the bottle lasts for a few months with a few sessions a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well, only down side is to make sure you rub it in well on hands and between fingers</li>
            <li>Great product when you have already have a small fair base tan</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen other reviews say that they hot really tan because of the lotion</li>
            <li>I am Irish decent and normally I cant tan.</li>
            <li>it smells like the original black and tan</li>
            <li>The only thing I can really complain about was it turned my skin between my fingers orange .</li>
            <li>I went from looking very tan to several shades lighter with just a bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it does give your skin a soft glow..</li>
            <li>I have noticed a considerable difference.</li>
            <li>I never buy tanning lotions from tanning salons since they are marked up.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you use it at least 2-3 times per week.</li>
            <li>so far this is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So Far</li>
            <li>and I still use it simply because it works really really well</li>
            <li>and I hold the tan very well w/ only a one week session.</li>
            <li>I really feel as though I&#x27;m putting on an instant tanner it leaves streaks,,any</li>
            <li>Seems to provide some extra color until you shower, but overall I&#x27;d say worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of tanning lotions but this one works great, and isn&#x27;t too expensive!</li>
            <li>My friends have even purchased them some as well due to its success.</li>
            <li>The first session I used this with showed results instantly and my color got darker in the following hours.</li>
            <li>will definitely buy again and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tanning for the first time in 13 yrs, and thus have no real experience with these types of products.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I expected when I received in in the mail and matched the description on the website</li>
            <li>I am looking super dark!</li>
            <li>Omg black &amp; Tan is a 100% golden winner for me.</li>
            <li>First time I used it left stricks, but as long as you rub \\&quot;really\\</li>
            <li>and I was super pale before...</li>
            <li>but if not careful does streak and stain in between fingers</li>
            <li>No expected tanning results.</li>
            <li>I get dark fast too!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise this got me pretty dark</li>
            <li>Or if you need to get dark fast for an even, this is your stuff!</li>
            <li>but apparently the fact that it had expired a year ago must have something to do with the lack of moisture.</li>
            <li>but If your not careful you will get the orange/brown streaks.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it truely is helping my skin tone get darker</li>
            <li>The first time I used Black and Tan, I immediately noticed my skin was tan.  </li>
            <li>after taking 6-8 weeks to get a good base, this stuff really \\&quot;keeps the tan in place\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Fast dark tan.</li>
            <li>Made me tan, just not as fast or as dark as some of the comments</li>
            <li>and I can do get pretty pale.</li>
            <li>It doesnt look orange like other high bronze tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>I really like the Black &amp; Tan bronzer.  </li>
            <li>This Black and Tan lotion made my whole body itch for a couple of days and my legs itched for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>The first few times used I was red and not a person to burn.</li>
            <li>I have tried every single one, from luminary to gilded and so far this one does it for me.</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty good and the smell isn&#x27;t very bad at all.</li>
            <li>I had plateaud with tanning having only a very light tan and used 2 full bottles of other products that didn&#x27;t help me get to the next step but after reading the reviews on this and even being a little skeptical I decided to try it</li>
            <li>and that is pretty dark!!</li>

            <li> Man am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to a T (made sure I rubbed the lotion in well and all!)</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion and it is way cheaper on here than in stores!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Not Sticky Leaves Amazing Color</li>
            <li> But it says I bought it, I&#x27;m guessing it replaced something else, so for now until an update, I have nothing to review, 4 stars for the confusion and to be nice, can&#x27;t leave three stars for never having used this...</li>
            <li> This product does deliver a nice bronzing without turning orange.</li>
            <li> It smells good and goes on so smoothly!</li>
            <li> and this one is KIND OF one of them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based off many good reviews... but must say I am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried about 20+ lotions over the years during tanning and this one is nice.</li>
            <li> It smells good too:)</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but just doesn&#x27;t deliver the desired color for me.</li>
            <li> nice lotion.</li>
            <li> it gives you a nice tan</li>
            <li> It does have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> This really is the best lotion for the price!</li>
            <li> Sure it was a good price</li>
            <li> Nice for getting to a medium/dark tan.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice - kind of like sugar.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion just like most lotions..</li>
            <li> WORTH THE $$$!!!</li>
            <li> product smells pretty good, feels great and doesn&#x27;t sweat off and feel sticky.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, and the smell is pretty awesome too.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and leaves skin soft!!</li>
            <li> I can tan very easy.</li>
            <li> But the after tam smell was very strong and I feel like even after I showered I could still smell the burnt smell.</li>
            <li> and I must say best one I&#x27;ve ever had so far!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best indoor tanning lotion I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was hoping for more.</li>
            <li> This by far has the best scent, both before and after tanning.  </li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of tanning lotions, and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price, and the quantity is so worth the price.</li>
            <li> The warming beads sure do warm you up.</li>
            <li> smells great &amp; make you tan nice &amp; fast!</li>
            <li> It smells nice, not to strong and there is no burnt skin smell either which is nice.</li>
            <li> It smells sooooo good and it shows results very quickly :)</li>
            <li> Love love love this tanner!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have tried a TON of lotions - popular tingles, regular lotions that are the newest and supposedly the best and let me say, that I am really glad I forgot my lotion because this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It spreads very evenly and it smells good too!</li>
            <li> I was super happy to find it on Amazon for such a great price!</li>
            <li> The service was great got my lotion very fast.  </li>

            <li> Make sure to apply to skin evenly tho , and to waah your hands afterwards.</li>
            <li> as many have said.  </li>

            <li> I thought Id love this lotion</li>
            <li> However, I feel orangy when my sister has a better looking tan.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that on my feet if I don&#x27;t get it put on perfectly it leaves orange spots and the same on my wrists!</li>
            <li> and she plans to purchase more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product...</li>
            <li> It will make you darker, that is for sure.</li>
            <li> I was tan before using this, but after just one use of this stuff I received many compliments.</li>
            <li> It reminds me more of a sunless tanner you buy at walmart.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>

            <li> It smells okay</li>
            <li> but I did take precautions to make sure that it was applied evenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use better than this product.</li>
            <li> seems to do better than most lotions and for the money its quite the bargain.</li>
            <li> I am glad I decided on this one.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Its my favorite tanning lotion</li>
            <li> this gave me a wonderful and lasting brown color with no orange.  </li>
            <li> Love It Leaves My Skin</li>
            <li> And To Top It Of My Man Loves It</li>
            <li> Last For Hours Best Tanning Lotion</li>
            <li> More like a self tanner than an indoor tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a bit &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you wipe off the access lotion on your hands and in between your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Works better with upgrade bronzing beds.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> An OK product.</li>
            <li> Using the product I have noticed my tan increasing faster than not using anything make sure to rub it all the way in to avoid streaks.  </li>
            <li> Perfect lotion if you&#x27;re just starting out</li>
            <li> Another favorite lotion of mine.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love it but..</li>
            <li> still looking for better ones but not  spend alot of money.</li>
            <li> love it ...</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Used it all winter long at the tanning bed and was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> But it does it&#x27;s job and smells pretty good</li>
            <li> Great product, goes on good and it doesn&#x27;t give off that tan smell that you get from other products.  </li>
            <li> Great lotion (even for sensitive skin like mine).  </li>
            <li> Pleasant smell and a decent bronzer.</li>
            <li> No tingling, no bad smell!  </li>
            <li> Does blend in easily when applying.</li>
            <li> or after I got out of the bed... I&#x27;m happy with this cream so far, lets hope I get super tan :)</li>
            <li> Smells good going on, typical smell after tanning, bronzer in lotion works great, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> You notice a difference very quickly.</li>
            <li> Like most tanning bed lotions with a bronzer, you need to clean your hands and between your fingers after application.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan easy</li>
            <li> This was a great price for this same tanning product that my tanning salon charged a quite a bit more for.  </li>
            <li> , it comes out of the bottle easy and it makes you darker.</li>
            <li> so I tan easily, but</li>
            <li> Product is really great and actually protects some against being burnt BUT, make sure you immediately wash your hands because they can and will change orange.</li>
            <li> Smell is strong.</li>
            <li> I highly strongly recommend this lotion to everyone.</li>
            <li> This gets you a nice even color fast and I will never buy lotion in the store again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING SNOOKI AND LIKED IT PRETTY</li>
            <li> One of the best bronzers I have ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li> The scent is unremarkable, which is fine</li>
            <li> I received the lotion and all seemed fine but the color of the lotion is gray.</li>
            <li> well it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> If your looking to get tan quick, this is the lotion to use!</li>
            <li> The scent is mild and the results are better with each application.</li>
            <li> but.... sorta wish they would make one like this without the super chicka smell!</li>
            <li> This made me super tan expecially in the turbo bed!</li>
            <li> I love this product very much!</li>
            <li> I saw a huge difference with just one use, and you get darker with every use.</li>
            <li> and I am noticing a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> I am an advanced tanner</li>
            <li> Overall she is happy with it</li>
            <li> Definitely worth more than it cost.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and leaves skin moisturized silky.</li>
            <li> Have been the the tanner only 4 times and have a great tan going.  </li>
            <li> lotion goes on smooth</li>
            <li> I definitely am seeing some great color.  </li>
            <li> I like the results this lotion gives it goes on smooth</li>
            <li> and  gives instant results allowing you to tan once a week and still maintaining a great tan</li>
            <li> what I got and what is pictured here is not the same, however I have used both before and great products</li>
            <li> It smells really good &amp; makes my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> Has a great texture that poors smoothly from the bottle and speads over your body easily, so it lasts a long time..</li>
            <li> It never turned me orange , but the color I received was thrilling !!</li>
            <li> This lotion gives you a wonderful golden tan I haven&#x27;t gotten to dark with this one</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much it helps me tan, but it doesn&#x27;t have the strong smell that most lotions do.</li>
            <li> Black &amp; Tan has made me feel great &amp; look fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love the color I got just from the first session with it.</li>
            <li> Super quick delivery!</li>
            <li> The customer reviews were right!</li>
            <li> just becareful to make sure you rub this in very well or it will streak.  </li>
            <li> I have used this tanning lotion for 2 years now and love how fast you can see the difference.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for 20 years and this is one of the better lotions I have tried and really like.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is you have to rub it in really good, because it does streak, but who cares when it gets ya tan.  </li>
            <li> This was a really good tanning lotion back when I used to tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen tanning lotions to see which would be the best for getting darker and</li>
            <li> I actually just bought another bottle for my friend because she used it and loved it.</li>
            <li> I have spent LOTS of money on tanning lotions and products, and I&#x27;m so glad I finally found the perfect match!</li>
            <li> Also, you have to make sure you rub it in really well</li>
            <li> it will surely burn you if you set your minutes too high!</li>
            <li> I saw all the great reviews for their lotions and were so cheap I ended up  choosing black and tan.</li>
            <li> It smells good compared to other lotions that are extremely strong and leave the burnt smell.</li>
            <li> This lotion delivers a better quality than many lotions that are double or triple the price.</li>
            <li> No burning the skin and has a mild scent.  </li>
            <li> worked quickly</li>
            <li> Mild scent that goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I am pretty light complected and using this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned but with the right lotions I can get pretty dark, this helped me achieve that.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon.couldn&#x27;t live without it.however</li>
            <li> I tanned and came home to a much darker difference than usual and was very impressed, as was my husband.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this to a lot of girls that are willing to get tanned fast :]</li>
            <li> the fragrance is REALLY girly and fairly strong.</li>
            <li> Idk if the bronzers are really that strong.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this with a tanning bed I saw color on my skin!</li>
            <li> Really accelerates your tan!!</li>
            <li> This is some good stuff, I usually use tinglers, but this is a great deep tanner.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I saw a difference after the first visit to the tanning bed and after 6 (going every other or every 3 days)</li>
            <li> If you want to get a great tan and get dark, buy this product!  </li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and it hasn&#x27;t streaked on me at all and after only 3 10 min sessions</li>
            <li> Anyway, I am happy with the results~ as I am going on vacation in a few days and didn&#x27;t want to look like an oompa loompa on the beach.  </li>
            <li> fast delivery, cheap and</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the price on amazon</li>
            <li> but after using it for a couple weeks I noticed marks on my legs like it didnt blend in my skin so not really crazy about it..</li>
            <li> I was looking more for a tanning accelerator and prefer clear lotions.</li>
            <li> But still worth the price I think.</li>
            <li> I do have to wipe off hands of course after applying, because it does stain palms, and around ankle and top of foot area it can be a real pain if not rubbed in really well.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this bronzer if you are in the market for some nice color without the tingle.</li>
            <li> ,I gave it a 4 rating just because its a thick lotion which makes me use more to cover my whole body, but it works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product many times and realized that it has a self tanner in it, which works really well and really fast.</li>
            <li> nice deep color right away....</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it gives you a really dark bronze color and gets darker the longer you sit, I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my tan using this product</li>
            <li> So far this is only kind that doesn&#x27;t have the overly strong smell that gives me headaches...</li>
            <li> Wonderful bronze color will be achieved by the slightly above average tanner.</li>
            <li> It doesnt have a strong scent but it leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I needed a quick tan for my son&#x27;s wedding and I really don&#x27;t like to use tanning beds that often.</li>
            <li> I read all sorts of reviews, looking for my first lotion, and what I heard from  black and tan was good.</li>
            <li> ordered multiple times from my new friends at Thee Tan Man and extremely satisfied EVERY time!</li>
            <li> I am very (I mean VERY) fair complected and have a lot of sensitivities to lotions.  </li>
            <li> The price is so much cheaper than what you pay in a salon!</li>
            <li> A friend &amp; I both tried this lotion when I received it, and we both had visible results after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I just got home from the tanning salon and used this cream for the first time....</li>
            <li> On the front of the bottle it says the cream contains warming beads which I was a bit nervous about because I didn&#x27;t exactly know what they were...</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I used it before my sister&#x27;s engagement party, and only went three times and was so amazed at the color I received!  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using this when I use the indoor tanning beds, it makes my skin soft and smells yummy.</li>
            <li> and I am already very noticeably darker!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> The first time you use, you will see it.</li>
            <li> I noticed some darkening after the first use.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as picture on Amazon and does exactly what it was designed to do.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a tan with the first application.</li>
            <li> I had before so the first time I put it on it</li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions and different bands.  </li>
            <li> I have bought several bottles of this lotion and will continue to buy more.</li>
            <li> AND SHIPPING WAS REALLY FAST!</li>
            <li> Thsi gives you intense hydration which is needed and leaves your body bronzed with a sun-kissed glow!  </li>
            <li> I really like the results i&#x27;m seeing with this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> but you should wipe it off your hands after applying ;)</li>
            <li> :) I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin color!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really like this bronzer!  </li>
            <li> I can get pretty tan</li>
            <li> Works waaaay better than any designer lotion I&#x27;ve bought in salons, and only $15!</li>
            <li> Gets you tan real quick, will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I love trying different tanning lotions...</li>
            <li> good not heavily fragranced and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I was very excited to see the reviews prior to purchase.</li>
            <li> I love how you can buy products like this for so much cheaper than in the actual tanning places.  </li>
            <li> Because its pretty much all bronzer...</li>
            <li> This lotion WORKS and will help you to achieve a nice, dark tan.</li>
            <li> and it really looks very natural and works quickly.  </li>
            <li> gets you dark super fast for cheap !</li>
            <li> We have the same skin type and both tend to burn easily.</li>
            <li> but it makes your skin super soft when tanning</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how quickly a tan came with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different lotions based on good reviews and am frankly tired of buying so many different lotions to achieve the results I want</li>
            <li> I could see a decent color after the first 10 minute session.</li>
            <li> so it is nice to have something with a little bronzer to get my skin browning.</li>
            <li> It works great and leaves your skin feeling soft and DARK!!!</li>
            <li> I understand that this has a bronzer element, but I must admit it was a huge shock to realize almost all of the tan was simply bronzer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help me get a darker tan and get ready for Spring and Summer coming up.  </li>
            <li> I was at a plateau and couldn&#x27;t really get any darker</li>
            <li> I am already very tan</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> No burning or tingling thanks</li>
            <li> Just be careful to rub off excess from your fingers :)</li>
            <li> Took a bath and rubbed off everything to find that I really hadn&#x27;t even tanned much at all...</li>
            <li> I just got it today and went straight to the tanning salon.  </li>
            <li> No orange color or staining, but I am much darker than I was before I went tanning today.  </li>
            <li> I got darker much faster than my sister did.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and worked way better than expected.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much color was in the product itself, so that resulted in streaking because of uneven/hurried application.</li>
            <li> Worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I NOTICED THE DIFFERECE THAT FAST.</li>
            <li> will get more when it is empty .</li>
            <li> keeps you from fading as fast</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bet you could use this as tanless tanning lotion, because it seems to me whether or not you tan after applying this won&#x27;t make much difference</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion does not tan very well.  </li>
            <li> It stains really well though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about my lotions.</li>
            <li> thing I don&#x27;t like as much about this lotion</li>
            <li> Really accelerated my tan.</li>
            <li> I really like the color this lotion gave me</li>
            <li> This really does accelerate the tanning process in bed and stand up tanners.</li>
            <li> and I am not bronzed much at all.  </li>
            <li> However, once you shower and really scrub yourself, you notice you lose all of your tan.</li>
            <li> Recieved product fast ...</li>
            <li> Lotion made me very orange and noticeable lines</li>
            <li> It smells good (at least to me) and</li>
            <li> Honestly I tan almost everyday.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a little self tanner in it to give you extra color and the smell is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> so I will never order a 2 yr old product without first checking the shelf life at a salon since that info is not disclosed with the product info.</li>
            <li> but I am purchasing a new one this weekend!</li>
            <li> BUT THE BLACK &amp; TAN IS WAY BETTER.</li>
            <li> You must make sure you apply it evenly on your skin or you might get a slight line.</li>
            <li> After using this lotion my skin gets red and irritated most likely from the warming beads.</li>
            <li> So mainly because of the after smell</li>
            <li> I tan pretty easily, but usually get to a certain point where I cant get any darker.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone who loves tanning</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this..</li>
            <li> and I usually tan pretty easily and fast.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I noticed a major difference of my skin color.</li>
            <li> so your hands don&#x27;t turn orange then rub a little on just the TOP of your hand to get an even color.</li>
            <li> I love that it has a little tingle in it as well.</li>
            <li> Is this normal for this lotion??  </li>
            <li> I think it is good, but not great.  </li>
            <li> I only notice a slight tingle warm feeling after I&#x27;m done tanning.</li>
            <li> Gives good color equal to some of the other brands I&#x27;ve used such as Designer Skin products (14K Gold).  </li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and hard to tan,  seriously one week of using this lotion and tanning on level 1, I got better color then ever before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to tanning beds, but I&#x27;ve used the sunless spray machines like Mystic Tan before.</li>
            <li> wish i new about this lotion earlery.</li>
            <li> I will be making this my new go-to lotion.</li>
            <li> Let me just say WOW!</li>
            <li> I can say, please do NOT waste your money!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely have no regrets about buying this product.</li>
            <li> I am completely amazed by the results!  </li>
            <li> I have been indoor tanning for several years now and have used dozens of lotions, but this lotion seems to fall short in giving me that rich color that I come to expect from a bronzing lotion.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> so I peeled the white label off of the back of the bottle that was put on by the seller and sure enough the shelf life was 12 months</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone first starting out with tanning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little strong, but not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Doing</li>
            <li> Nice tan with Black &amp; Tan but some streaking can occur and some of bronze comes off after showering and wiping dry with towel.</li>
            <li> I have been using Paint it Black for two years, but thought I would try Black &amp; Tan since it had good reviews, as well.  </li>
            <li> I received my black&amp;tan in the mail,and while it smells good it hardly has Any  color!!  </li>
            <li> Also, this product has a burning sensation that causes your skin to turn pink, as if you have a mild burn.</li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t require a lot, doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy on the skin, and doesn&#x27;t smell strong.</li>
            <li> This lotion helps get my skin a lot darker compared to many other popular lotions and the bottle lasts for a few months with a few sessions a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well, only down side is to make sure you rub it in well on hands and between fingers</li>
            <li> Great product when you have already have a small fair base tan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviews say that they hot really tan because of the lotion</li>
            <li> I am Irish decent and normally I cant tan.</li>
            <li> it smells like the original black and tan</li>
            <li> The only thing I can really complain about was it turned my skin between my fingers orange .</li>
            <li> I went from looking very tan to several shades lighter with just a bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it does give your skin a soft glow..</li>
            <li> I have noticed a considerable difference.</li>
            <li> I never buy tanning lotions from tanning salons since they are marked up.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you use it at least 2-3 times per week.</li>
            <li> so far this is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So Far</li>
            <li> and I still use it simply because it works really really well</li>
            <li> and I hold the tan very well w/ only a one week session.</li>
            <li> I really feel as though I&#x27;m putting on an instant tanner it leaves streaks,,any</li>
            <li> Seems to provide some extra color until you shower, but overall I&#x27;d say worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of tanning lotions but this one works great, and isn&#x27;t too expensive!</li>
            <li> My friends have even purchased them some as well due to its success.</li>
            <li> The first session I used this with showed results instantly and my color got darker in the following hours.</li>
            <li> will definitely buy again and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tanning for the first time in 13 yrs, and thus have no real experience with these types of products.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected when I received in in the mail and matched the description on the website</li>
            <li> I am looking super dark!</li>
            <li> Omg black &amp; Tan is a 100% golden winner for me.</li>
            <li> First time I used it left stricks, but as long as you rub \\&quot;really\\</li>
            <li> and I was super pale before...</li>
            <li> but if not careful does streak and stain in between fingers</li>
            <li> No expected tanning results.</li>
            <li> I get dark fast too!  </li>
            <li> Otherwise this got me pretty dark</li>
            <li> Or if you need to get dark fast for an even, this is your stuff!</li>
            <li> but apparently the fact that it had expired a year ago must have something to do with the lack of moisture.</li>
            <li> but If your not careful you will get the orange/brown streaks.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it truely is helping my skin tone get darker</li>
            <li> The first time I used Black and Tan, I immediately noticed my skin was tan.  </li>
            <li> after taking 6-8 weeks to get a good base, this stuff really \\&quot;keeps the tan in place\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Fast dark tan.</li>
            <li> Made me tan, just not as fast or as dark as some of the comments</li>
            <li> and I can do get pretty pale.</li>
            <li> It doesnt look orange like other high bronze tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> I really like the Black &amp; Tan bronzer.  </li>
            <li> This Black and Tan lotion made my whole body itch for a couple of days and my legs itched for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> The first few times used I was red and not a person to burn.</li>
            <li> I have tried every single one, from luminary to gilded and so far this one does it for me.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty good and the smell isn&#x27;t very bad at all.</li>
            <li> I had plateaud with tanning having only a very light tan and used 2 full bottles of other products that didn&#x27;t help me get to the next step but after reading the reviews on this and even being a little skeptical I decided to try it</li>
            <li> and that is pretty dark!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not really sure that&#x27;s true because I&#x27;m no Tanner than I would be with any other lotion.</li>
            <li> It does feel a little greasy after a few hours, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I would suggest something else if you are looking for something long term that will actually help you achieve your tanning goal.</li>
            <li> I understand that when I tan indoors it causes dry, itchy skin if not properly hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Sorry i can&#x27;t really give too much info here.</li>
            <li> After 8 weeks, I had a good medium-dark base (I&#x27;m Irish -</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this if you are impatient like me in the tanning process!</li>
            <li> The lotion went on nice and the smell before tanning wasnt bad, and I did like the color it gave me.</li>
            <li> I got this a few days early.</li>
            <li> It did not leave any streaks or turn my skin orange, lasted probably as long as a spray tan would have</li>
            <li> Standard shipping only took a few days.</li>
            <li> It definitely accelerated my tan after only a few sessions</li>
            <li> Had a nice base tan in only 3 - 4  9 minute visits.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal from this distributor and you will not be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Not worth the extra time to wipe it all off.</li>
            <li> and my skin is a deep bronze color that I&#x27;ve never gotten from any other lotion!</li>
            <li> I use snooki for legs on my legs and black &amp; tan on my upper body</li>
            <li> THE SOLID BLACK &amp; PAINT IT</li>
            <li> Tan less and moisturize at the same time.</li>
            <li> This has given me a nice golden brown color in just a few days, over the top of a nasty orange glow another indoor tanning bronzer left behind unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> I still have a little of this left</li>
            <li> Especially on my neck and under chin area that has always been hard to tan, it finally matches the rest of me.</li>
            <li> I am darker than I ever expected to be...</li>
            <li> and I usually use either spellbound or Australian gold which are pretty expensive especially in the salon.</li>
            <li> I was using another \\&quot;higher\\&quot; brand of lotion with absolutely NO results.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it does</li>
            <li> Knowing that it stated it was a 2011 product I was curious about the shelf life on this lotion</li>
            <li> This lotion has a bronzer, but I am not really seeing the results that  I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> well if you&#x27;re just looking to get a few shades darker in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Once I stopped it seemed that I didn&#x27;t stay dark very long.</li>
            <li> I am a customer for life now and want to try their other products.</li>
            <li> Spent money on some that were NOT worth it</li>
            <li> I bought this after I ran out of my other stuff.</li>
            <li> You have to be extremely careful because it will streak and leave dark spots around elbows, ankles, etc.</li>
            <li> uses the difference vs. my other tanning lotions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great price compared to other salon prices.</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping Item as expected!</li>
            <li> I went to tan the other day and forgot my lotion at home.</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Comparable to California tan and other products but at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I want the tanning bed to tan me, and the lotion to assist, not the other way around.</li>
            <li> But I used one bottle and gave my friend the other bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the other reviews.</li>
            <li> or it will streak, just like other self tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> and I swap it out with some of my other favorites.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never had that issue with other lotions.</li>
            <li> It would work very well if you had time to carefully apply and wanted to get dark with a mixture of tanning and fake tanning.</li>
            <li> Use this stuff after you have a base tan, works really well, deep long lasting results, very dark..</li>
            <li> but the color is not right.</li>
            <li> Used it a few times and noticed that my skin felt very dry after tanning.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give as much of a dark tan</li>
            <li> It NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> My legs were very streaky looking, my hands were orangeish and I looked silly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat dark completed</li>
            <li> I asked what would get me dark the quickest</li>
            <li> This is the type of lotion where you could tan 2 days a week and would stay dark.</li>
            <li> Dark after 3 uses..</li>
            <li> it will get u dark.</li>
            <li> I got really really dark just after 3 times using this.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is if you don&#x27;t wipe your hands after use they&#x27;ll streak.</li>
            <li> For those that want a dark tan, this lotion is one of the ones to get.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a base tan with the help of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pale, and it didn&#x27;t get me as dark as I expected it would.</li>
            <li> One down side is, if you don&#x27;t get the residue off of your hands, you will have orange palms...</li>
            <li> My fingers have little brown lines running along the sides where the fingers edges rub each other and where they meet my hand.</li>
            <li> other lotions I have had!  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see there was a slight tingle</li>
            <li> Tried Black &amp; Tan after reading reviews raving about it.  </li>
            <li> I received my bottle of Black and Tan a couple weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I WAS ALREADY TOAN AND BLACK &amp; TAN BROUGHT ME UP ANOTHER LEVEL IN ONE DAY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half hispanic</li>
            <li> BLACK</li>
            <li> I have used almost half of the bottle</li>
            <li> It does not stain my hands orange or leave a streaky mess on my skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth trying to dave a few dollars.  </li>
            <li> new lotion Ill let youll know how that goes.</li>
            <li> Everyday I use black &amp; Tan</li>
            <li> Scent is a little too perfumey for me.  </li>
            <li> I got so dark just after using it once!</li>
            <li> This product immediately had me browner than any other lotion I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> However, I would not reccommend this product, it did not give me the results of other tanning products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> The color was a little orange for me.</li>
            <li> I live in the wet, cold, gray sky northwest...</li>
            <li> and I am very dark.  </li>
            <li> Ive been using this lotion for 2 years now and I am very dark.  </li>
            <li> Smells tropical used in 3 times and was very dark.</li>
            <li> Honestly I feel like it didn&#x27;t do jack crap!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t tan year round</li>
            <li> She started to tan a few sessions after using it.</li>
            <li> however it is a streaky quite uneven tan.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to try something new without spending a fortune only to be disappointed</li>
            <li> A little darker of lotion than I like to use but not able to tell</li>
            <li> so I usually start out at like 10 minutes a few times.</li>
            <li> I didnt see any change in color, if anything I think I lost color... not very nice smelling after you get out.</li>
            <li> , u can still smell it a little after you shower!  </li>
            <li> Been using it for a month now, and I&#x27;m really dark!!</li>
            <li> but I do tan each year usually.</li>
            <li> I also usually drink</li>
            <li> i have used this lotion before and it has never left spots on me, so there is something wrong with the lotion i received from this company.</li>
            <li> It is a stronger bronzed than I have used in the past</li>
            <li> I did use a small amount on my face and had no problem.</li>
            <li> and I usually tan once a week.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying this product previously at the tanning salon, and I was charged $75!!</li>
            <li> and I always feel depleted of hard earned cash when I leave.</li>
            <li> I even put it on my face which I have a hell of a hard time tanning</li>
            <li> This lotion is not as thick as the jwwow</li>
            <li> but it definitely works like an expensive brand!</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than buying it in the salon</li>
            <li> i have bought black and tan lotion for a tanning salon here in my town and it was a brown color, but when i received my lotion for this company for some reason the color of the lotion is gray, i think it might be a fake lotion.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product was shelved in 2011 and typically has a 6-12 month shelf life.</li>
            <li> Seems a little weird</li>
            <li> It took me forever to decide which Indoor tanning bronzer to purchase after having such bad luck, and results with another one I had tried, so I decided to just wing it.  </li>
            <li> I have used a few types and brands of lotion and this one I am not impressed with.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> and my tan hardly faded!</li>
            <li> You do have to be very careful when you put it on because it will streak and make you look dirty if you dont get it rubbed in correctly.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference after just a couple uses however was a tiny bit disappointed it had self tanner in the ingredience.make</li>
            <li> Little disappointing</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that even with careful application and wiping between my fingers that I got streaks.</li>
            <li> I gave it a shot &amp; holy crap I am dark!</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t know any weird tingles or burns while I was tanning</li>
            <li> Ill just go ahead and get this and from reading the reviews I did.</li>
            <li> How sad it is...</li>
            <li> my thoughts on this is that it could be fake or expired.</li>
            <li> But nothing uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> And I am NOT happy!!</li>
            <li> Crazy people</li>
            <li> I have been using this one bottle for two years and afraid it would go bad or leave me Orange, but nope</li>
            <li> After tan smell not too bad either.</li>
            <li> But some reviews said they didn&#x27;t notice it or it wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Maybe it won&#x27;t be so bad when I get darker....</li>
            <li> this lotion will give you color and doesn&#x27;t smell that bad.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate buying lotion in the store-</li>
            <li> Holy crap</li>
            <li> If you are hesitant don&#x27;t be and try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> very disappointed -</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this order...</li>
            <li> I was miserable!</li>
            <li> It looks awful and it won&#x27;t wash off.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love love love this tanner! In just 4 sessions at 8 minutes each time I already had a beautiful bronze color!! It does stain hands so be sure to wash afterwards, but besides that it&#x27;s wonderful! Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Really loved the tan it gave me while using the bed.  Once I stopped it seemed that I didn&#x27;t stay dark very long.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than buying it in the salon and I love this lotion! The smell is good for both men and women.</li>
            <li> I got this a few days early. I put the lotion on and LOVE the smell. The first time I used this with a tanning bed I saw color on my skin! I will definitely purchase this lotion again!</li>
            <li> Smells fruity, more citrus tropical, works well!</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion it is awesome with the bronzer in it, can use with out tanning for a nice look</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it gives you a really dark bronze color and gets darker the longer you sit, I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my tan using this product</li>
            <li> I received my black&amp;tan in the mail,and while it smells good it hardly has Any  color!!  My brown sugar lotion is only x50 and its like 6 shades darker. Is this normal for this lotion??  I ordered it from thatanman.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite tanning lotion. Not only does It have a delious aroma but it also give a m great color! The first time I used it I noticed a major difference of my skin color. It never turned me orange , but the color I received was thrilling !! Make sure to apply to skin evenly tho , and to waah your hands afterwards. The only thing I can really complain about was it turned my skin between my fingers orange .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see there was a slight tingle so beware if u don&#x27;t like tingle in ur product.</li>
            <li> I like the way this smells even after tanning.  It&#x27;s a little strong, but not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Doing a good job on the tan,too.</li>
            <li> This tanning bronzer does a great job! The price is so much cheaper than what you pay in a salon! I will buy it again. No problems with delivery. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon.couldn&#x27;t live without it.however I have bought two different lotions here and both are fakes.I thought I was saving money but u get a bottle of hand lotion in an authentic bottle! Never again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I saw a difference after the first visit to the tanning bed and after 6 (going every other or every 3 days) I am darker than I ever expected to be... definetely the best tanning lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help me get a darker tan and get ready for Spring and Summer coming up.  This stuff is great!!!  After 1 use, I saw a difference.  Now I have used this product for 2 weeks and I am very dark.  People ask me if I have been on vacation?  If I have been out in the Sun?  Plus a lot of compliments on how great I look with the tan.  If you want to get a great tan and get dark, buy this product!  You will not be disapointed.</li>
            <li> Let me just say WOW! This tanning lotion is amazing! I am an advanced tanner and I usually use either spellbound or Australian gold which are pretty expensive especially in the salon. I was at a plateau and couldn&#x27;t really get any darker so I wanted to try something new without spending a fortune only to be disappointed and then I came across  millenium products.. I saw all the great reviews for their lotions and were so cheap I ended up  choosing black and tan. I went to the tanning bed in the same one I always go in and came out 3 shades darker!! Not orange at all but a deep bronze color! And it smells great too! I am a customer for life now and want to try their other products. If you are hesitant don&#x27;t be and try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Great lotion (even for sensitive skin like mine).  It smells good (at least to me) and you get color almost instantly since it&#x27;s a bronzer.  I keep ordering it...</li>
            <li> Love the color I got just from the first session with it. Purchase it you will not regret it. After tan smell not too bad either.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, excellent bronzer and moisturizers! Will buy this lotion again... and great price. After use and before tanning wash your hands.</li>
            <li> A friend &amp; I both tried this lotion when I received it, and we both had visible results after the first use.  I will definitely buy this again.  Great price too!!!</li>
            <li> But it says I bought it, I&#x27;m guessing it replaced something else, so for now until an update, I have nothing to review, 4 stars for the confusion and to be nice, can&#x27;t leave three stars for never having used this...</li>
            <li> Gives good color equal to some of the other brands I&#x27;ve used such as Designer Skin products (14K Gold).  I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Tried Black &amp; Tan after reading reviews raving about it.  I think it is good, but not great.  It doesn&#x27;t give as much of a dark tan as many have said.  I am already very tan so maybe it is just a matter of degree.  Because it is a bronzer it does come off on clothes and towels (even after showering.)  Scent is a little too perfumey for me.  Does blend in easily when applying.</li>
            <li> works great. Fast dark tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to tanning beds, but I&#x27;ve used the sunless spray machines like Mystic Tan before. This product does deliver a nice bronzing without turning orange. It does have the bronzer (burnt skin) smell people refer to, but I am use to it since it&#x27;s the same smell you have after Mystic Tanning. This product is a great price compared to the products sold at the salon for $35+! My order is always received sooner then what is promised online.. (:</li>
            <li> Leaves an orange tent!</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t do anything. It left streaks and went away next day. I&#x27;ve been taming for yars and I can say, please do NOT waste your money!</li>
            <li> This lotion has a wonderful scent and really has a nice bronzer in it! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Gretimmediate color but if not careful does streak and stain in between fingers</li>
            <li> Noticeable color in about a week. Will def buy again and recommend to my friends. No burning or tingling thanks</li>
            <li> I just got home from the tanning salon and used this cream for the first time.... It smells nice, not to strong and there is no burnt skin smell either which is nice. On the front of the bottle it says the cream contains warming beads which I was a bit nervous about because I didn&#x27;t exactly know what they were... But I didn&#x27;t know any weird tingles or burns while I was tanning or after I got out of the bed... I&#x27;m happy with this cream so far, lets hope I get super tan :)</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I used it before my sister&#x27;s engagement party, and only went three times and was so amazed at the color I received!  I will be ordering two more bottles to keep for when this one runs out! Just be careful to rub off excess from your fingers :)</li>
            <li> product smells pretty good, feels great and doesn&#x27;t sweat off and feel sticky. helps me maintain my tan but doesn&#x27;t take me to the next level though. it&#x27;s worth the price on amazon but i wouldn&#x27;t pay the salon price for this lotion.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I saw a huge difference with just one use, and you get darker with every use. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion and it has gotten me darker than I ever was and that is pretty dark!! It smells good and goes on so smoothly! I will definitely be buying this again!!</li>
            <li> Its really good but does leave hands orange so wipe them off throughly</li>
            <li> I bought this tanning lotion and I must say best one I&#x27;ve ever had so far! I LOVE it! and smells so yummy!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this item. I love the color I have gotten from using it. My friends have even purchased them some as well due to its success.</li>
            <li> One of the best bronzers I have ever used, hands down. It does not stain my hands orange or leave a streaky mess on my skin. I just reordered 2 bottles! I am a tan-o-holic and I absolutely have no regrets about buying this product.</li>
            <li> Honestly I tan almost everyday. I bought this from reading the reviews. I&#x27;m one that as tryd just about every tanning lotion. Spent money on some that were NOT worth it and this one is KIND OF one of them. I can tan very easy. Never had problems. I bought this after I ran out of my other stuff. It said it had warming beads. I never felt the warmth! This is great for people who tend to burn. Because its pretty much all bronzer...Well so they say. I already have a great tan and I figured hey what the heck Ill just go ahead and get this and from reading the reviews I did. Honestly I feel like it didn&#x27;t do jack crap! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. I leave for vaca at the end of may and I was hoping I would be darker. Nope that hasnt happend. So im going to try Pauly Ds new lotion Ill let youll know how that goes. Be ware....It NOT worth the money.</li>
            <li> My gym wanted 120.00 for this bottle!  Crazy people I shop Amamzon! Product works great, just becareful to make sure you rub this in very well or it will streak.  I tanned once and used a bunny sticker and you could see the outline!  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great lotion got tan in one use not streaky but doesnt smell the greatest worth it tho!  Love the price will definitly keep purchasing</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve been using this lotion that I got from Amazon last month with no RESULT! How sad it is... my thoughts on this is that it could be fake or expired.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tanned in awhile but I do tan each year usually. I am not the easiest tan so I usually start out at like 10 minutes a few times. I&#x27;ve been three or four times and noticed some darkening. I purchased this product based off many good reviews... but must say I am disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the product on and rubbed it in well. I tanned and came home to a much darker difference than usual and was very impressed, as was my husband. I didn&#x27;t have time to shower and woke up the next morning very disappointed - My legs were very streaky looking, my hands were orangeish and I looked silly. Took a bath and rubbed off everything to find that I really hadn&#x27;t even tanned much at all... I went from looking very tan to several shades lighter with just a bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I understand that this has a bronzer element, but I must admit it was a huge shock to realize almost all of the tan was simply bronzer. I will not buy again and do not think I will even finish the bottle - Not worth the extra time to wipe it all off.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this when I use the indoor tanning beds, it makes my skin soft and smells yummy. I am not sure if it truely is helping my skin tone get darker but you can tell there is some bronzing agent to the lotion so it does give your skin a soft glow..</li>
            <li> This is by far the best indoor tanning lotion I have ever used! I have only tanned 3 times (30 minutes total) within 2 weeks and I am already very noticeably darker! Smells good going on, typical smell after tanning, bronzer in lotion works great, goes on smooth. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I have been using Paint it Black for two years, but thought I would try Black &amp; Tan since it had good reviews, as well.  I just got it today and went straight to the tanning salon.  I am completely amazed by the results!  No orange color or staining, but I am much darker than I was before I went tanning today.  I am hooked!  It smells good and my color is amazing after one use.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this product very much! You notice a difference very quickly. I would definitely suggest this product to a friend</li>
            <li> I thought Id love this lotion but after using it for a couple weeks I noticed marks on my legs like it didnt blend in my skin so not really crazy about it..</li>
            <li> I got this to start tanning with. My sister and I  started tanning in the same bed the same day. We have the same skin type and both tend to burn easily. I got darker much faster than my sister did. However, I feel orangy when my sister has a better looking tan. I have noticed that on my feet if I don&#x27;t get it put on perfectly it leaves orange spots and the same on my wrists! I am getting snookie next time to see how I like that. I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> THis is the most AMAZING lotion! I am very (I mean VERY) fair complected and have a lot of sensitivities to lotions.  THis lotion makes me look brown after only 2 tanning sessions!! I quit going for 3 weeks and my tan hardly faded! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! ANd the price is awesome!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend and she loves it.  She said it goes on even, smells great, dosen&#x27;t turn her hands orange.  Overall she is happy with it and she plans to purchase more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product... It works great and leaves your skin feeling soft and DARK!!! I&#x27;m ordering my 2nd bottle NOW.</li>
            <li> Tried about 20+ lotions over the years during tanning and this one is nice. Smell is great and I could notice a difference after a couple days of using it. I wasn&#x27;t blown away so I&#x27;ll probably try a different one after I&#x27;m done with this one.</li>
            <li> The customer reviews were right! I got so dark just after using it once! I&#x27;ve tried a number of designer tanning lotions and this one is the greatest I&#x27;ve come across! I&#x27;m somewhat dark completed but I don&#x27;t tan year round and my skin is a deep bronze color that I&#x27;ve never gotten from any other lotion! Shipped fast! And my sister is going to buy too!</li>
            <li> I have used this tanning lotion for 2 years now and love how fast you can see the difference. The first time you use, you will see it. Have others using it now.</li>
            <li> It will make you darker, that is for sure. Not too fond of the smell but it works.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this lotion. No expiration date on the bottle. The item is not sealed. No expected tanning results. NO RETURNS!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this lotion for 2 years now and I am very dark.  I use snooki for legs on my legs and black &amp; tan on my upper body</li>
            <li> If your looking to get tan quick, this is the lotion to use! I decided to get this brand because of all the great reviews and was very impressed! I was tan before using this, but after just one use of this stuff I received many compliments. I only have to tan 2-3 times a week now as well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good indoor tanning lotion to use in my tanning bed. This lotion had great reviews which is why I decided to give it a try. Not that great. It smells good. I noticed some darkening after the first use. You have to be extremely careful because it will streak and leave dark spots around elbows, ankles, etc. It reminds me more of a sunless tanner you buy at walmart. Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I received my bottle of Black and Tan a couple weeks ago.  I was using another \\&quot;higher\\&quot; brand of lotion with absolutely NO results.  The first time I used Black and Tan, I immediately noticed my skin was tan.  I am going to get another bottle so I don&#x27;t run out.  This is the BEST lotion for the price.  It smells good too:)</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was hoping for more. I have been indoor tanning for several years now and have used dozens of lotions, but this lotion seems to fall short in giving me that rich color that I come to expect from a bronzing lotion. It smells nice, but just doesn&#x27;t deliver the desired color for me.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the BEST tanning lotion I have ever used. With one application I could see instant color. I reccommend this lotion to my friends and coworkers!</li>
            <li> Met my expectations. especially for the price. It doesnt have a strong scent but it leaves your skin feeling soft. The only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because results tookabout 3 sessions</li>
            <li> Tan does not hold and looks unnatural.  The scent is unremarkable, which is fine I&#x27;d rather not smell like tanning lotion.  Invest eslewhere - it&#x27;s not worth trying to dave a few dollars.  The first few times used I was red and not a person to burn.</li>
            <li> I saw this as a pin on pinterest and needed something to boost my tan. This did just that, great smell and I noticed after 2 uses the difference vs. my other tanning lotions.&lt;br /&gt;Great price compared to other salon prices.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I had never used it before but it darkens well and I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I really like the Black &amp; Tan bronzer.  Used it all winter long at the tanning bed and was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and worked way better than expected. Would recommend others to buy it. Definitely worth more than it cost.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as picture on Amazon and does exactly what it was designed to do.  I would recommend this item to anyone looking to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. Smells tropical used in 3 times and was very dark. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much color was in the product itself, so that resulted in streaking because of uneven/hurried application. It would work very well if you had time to carefully apply and wanted to get dark with a mixture of tanning and fake tanning. I was looking more for a tanning accelerator and prefer clear lotions.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. She started to tan a few sessions after using it.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying this product previously at the tanning salon, and I was charged $75!! I was super happy to find it on Amazon for such a great price! Definitely the way to go!</li>
            <li> I bought this tanning lotion and was very satisfied....nice deep color right away....&lt;br /&gt;Smells good and this is a very good purchase.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference after just a couple uses however was a tiny bit disappointed it had self tanner in the ingredience.make sure u wash ur hands after applying</li>
            <li> Absolutely love Balck &amp; Tan!! Will definately re-order once I run out! I received a fantastic color from this product!</li>
            <li> Great product, goes on good and it doesn&#x27;t give off that tan smell that you get from other products.  I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several seasons and like the color it gives me. Like most tanning bed lotions with a bronzer, you need to clean your hands and between your fingers after application.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion!! It smells sooooo good and it shows results very quickly :) love this product</li>
            <li> I love this stuff..I don&#x27;t know how I ever went tanning without it..I like the texture..the smell..n the color of ur tan when u r done!! I will b a return shopper for this item!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Its my 4th time ordering it!</li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than expected. I love the results with this product...I noticed a tan with the first application. The scent is mild and the results are better with each application.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a little self tanner in it to give you extra color and the smell is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> nice lotion. gets you darker. doesn&#x27;t streak or turn orange. I have been tanning for 20 years and this is one of the better lotions I have tried and really like.  price is perfect as well.</li>
            <li> it gives you a nice tan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but it does it&#x27;s job. I&#x27;ve seen other reviews say that they hot really tan because of the lotion and I&#x27;m not really sure that&#x27;s true because I&#x27;m no Tanner than I would be with any other lotion. But it does it&#x27;s job and smells pretty good and it&#x27;s a good sized bottle as well.</li>
            <li> I received the lotion and all seemed fine but the color of the lotion is gray. Seems a little weird but I have nothing to compare it to. The smell is amazing and it hasn&#x27;t streaked on me at all and after only 3 10 min sessions I have noticed a considerable difference. Would I say it&#x27;s a 75X bronzer..no. But still worth the price I think.</li>
            <li> The best Indoor Tanning Lotion that I have ever used.  This product immediately had me browner than any other lotion I have used in the past.  No orange coloring, no fading and it really looks very natural and works quickly.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quick tan that looks great!</li>
            <li> I truly love this tanning lotion. This is my second year purchasing this product and I will continue to use it for years to come.</li>
            <li> Worked better than I expected. Had a nice base tan in only 3 - 4  9 minute visits. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Good for the price. I don&#x27;t like tingle lotions and was worried about this one. But some reviews said they didn&#x27;t notice it or it wasn&#x27;t bad. I only notice a slight tingle warm feeling after I&#x27;m done tanning. But nothing uncomfortable. Now if you like the tingle, then you probably won&#x27;t like this lotion. It smells good compared to other lotions that are extremely strong and leave the burnt smell. This lotion is not as thick as the jwwow I had before so the first time I put it on it wasn&#x27;t rubbing all the way in. Goes on smooth and leaves skin moisturized silky. I do notice a difference when using the lotion. However it&#x27;s not drastic after 1 use. But after 4 uses, I am really starting to see my skin get darker. Especially on my neck and under chin area that has always been hard to tan, it finally matches the rest of me. I do wipe off with a towel after tanning so I don&#x27;t know if that affects anything. But I don&#x27;t look orange or have streaks. So far this is only kind that doesn&#x27;t have the overly strong smell that gives me headaches... I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I don&#x27;t tan easy but I definitely look tan after using this lotion!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is a great deal and it works so good! I only tanned for a week and it made me look like I had been tanning for  months. I went into my tanning salon and saw that they were selling this lotion and I asked the price and it was 69.99. So you definitely can&#x27;t beat this deal.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to see the reviews prior to purchase. they were 200% correct to what the product did for me. I am pasty white with freckles. I am Irish decent and normally I cant tan. I was able to get a base tan with the help of this product.</li>
            <li> ordered multiple times from my new friends at Thee Tan Man and extremely satisfied EVERY time! I work at a gym/tan salon and own my own bed, I wouldnt go anywhere but here!</li>
            <li> This was a great price for this same tanning product that my tanning salon charged a quite a bit more for.  This smells good, and I felt like it helped me tan quickly and maintain my color.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, wished it smelled better though.</li>
            <li> Prompt shipping Item as expected!</li>
            <li> It does give you color if you go tanning several days in a row. I was disappointed that even with careful application and wiping between my fingers that I got streaks. It does have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion only two weeks ago. I have been tanning only 3 times and I am noticing a HUGE difference. It doesnt look orange like other high bronze tanning lotions. I would highly recommend this if you are impatient like me in the tanning process! The color lasts too!! This really is the best lotion for the price!</li>
            <li> gets you dark super fast for cheap ! goes on smooth and smells great also! def sticking with this :)</li>
            <li> Smell is strong. but it makes your skin super soft when tanning</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different lotions based on good reviews and am frankly tired of buying so many different lotions to achieve the results I want but this one is really great. I had plateaud with tanning having only a very light tan and used 2 full bottles of other products that didn&#x27;t help me get to the next step but after reading the reviews on this and even being a little skeptical I decided to try it and I am so happy I did. This stuff smells good and works SO darn good. The first session I used this with showed results instantly and my color got darker in the following hours. I&#x27;m very fair skinned but with the right lotions I can get pretty dark, this helped me achieve that.</li>
            <li> I understand that when I tan indoors it causes dry, itchy skin if not properly hydrated.  I put on hydrating lotion every night before bed.  I also usually drink 80+ ounces of water a day.  I have never had such a reaction to a product before.  This Black and Tan lotion made my whole body itch for a couple of days and my legs itched for 2 weeks.  I was miserable!</li>
            <li> Favorite tanning product</li>
            <li> I have used a few types and brands of lotion and this one I am not impressed with. I didnt see any change in color, if anything I think I lost color... not very nice smelling after you get out.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions and different bands.  This by far has the best scent, both before and after tanning.  I get dark fast too!  Love, love, love!!!</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of tanning lotions, and this one is by far the best. It gives you instant color that lasts for awhile. It smells great, I&#x27;ve gotten compliments when I am in the tanning salon about the smell of it. The price is unbeatable. I have bought several bottles of this lotion and will continue to buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pale, and it didn&#x27;t get me as dark as I expected it would. The bronzer in it was good though.</li>
            <li> It seemed to help just not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I hate buying lotion in the store- they jack up the prices and I always feel depleted of hard earned cash when I leave. Then I thought, \\&quot;What about Amazon??!!\\&quot; I was skeptical at first, but for the price I was willing to give it a shot. Man am I glad I did! This gets you a nice even color fast and I will never buy lotion in the store again!</li>
            <li> The service was great got my lotion very fast.  This lotion gives you a wonderful golden tan I haven&#x27;t gotten to dark with this one but I like it.</li>
            <li> JUST RECEIVED THIS YESTERDAY AND IT IS WONDERFUL. I WAS ALREADY TOAN AND BLACK &amp; TAN BROUGHT ME UP ANOTHER LEVEL IN ONE DAY. I NOTICED THE DIFFERECE THAT FAST. I&#x27;VE BEEN USING SNOOKI AND LIKED IT PRETTY WELL BUT THE BLACK &amp; TAN IS WAY BETTER. DON&#x27;T HEITATE TO TRY THIS AND SHIPPING WAS REALLY FAST!</li>
            <li> I abs love this tanning lotion. I have tried every single one, from luminary to gilded and so far this one does it for me. I am fair skinned and hard to tan,  seriously one week of using this lotion and tanning on level 1, I got better color then ever before. Only problem is you have to rub it in really good, because it does streak, but who cares when it gets ya tan.  You will not regret it, this lotion is above awesome. :)</li>
            <li> i have bought black and tan lotion for a tanning salon here in my town and it was a brown color, but when i received my lotion for this company for some reason the color of the lotion is gray, i think it might be a fake lotion. it smells like the original black and tan but the color is not right. and this lotion will leave spots on you. i have used this lotion before and it has never left spots on me, so there is something wrong with the lotion i received from this company.</li>
            <li> I have tanned for many years and this lotion is the best I have used by far!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to order this product!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price, and the quantity is so worth the price. I would order this product again and again.</li>
            <li> This indoor tanning product works great. After just 3 tans, there was a noticeable difference. It doesn&#x27;t streak either. it looks so natural.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Works well, only down side is to make sure you rub it in well on hands and between fingers or they&#x27;ll look orange! Otherwise this got me pretty dark</li>
            <li> I never buy tanning lotions from tanning salons since they are marked up.  This lotion at my tanning salon starts at $60 a bottle...This is a great deal from this distributor and you will not be disappointed!  It truly works and does not leave streaking!  No tingling, no bad smell!  Thsi gives you intense hydration which is needed and leaves your body bronzed with a sun-kissed glow!  I love this product and will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> I really like the results i&#x27;m seeing with this product! It was a great price and it bronzes very well. Standard shipping only took a few days. I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> And I am NOT happy!! I would like the color it have me after one session however it is a streaky quite uneven tan. I have been indoor tanning for years and I have tried numerous products. I followed the directions to a T (made sure I rubbed the lotion in well and all!) and STREAKS!! EVERYWHERE!!!</li>
            <li> I loved this product saw results just after one use. I will definitely recommend this product to family and friends that use the tanning beds.</li>
            <li> i liked it had never used it just tried loved it had heard of them wish i new about this lotion earlery.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells awesome. You must make sure you apply it evenly on your skin or you might get a slight line. Be sure to always wash your hands after you apply the lotion. Wonderful bronze color will be achieved by the slightly above average tanner. Love this product will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> Last year I used Snooki and changed this year over to this stuff. Been using it for 2 weeks and have had amazing results! I haven&#x27;t burned with it but I worked my way up from 5 mins, to 7, to 10, to 15, and finally to 20. I&#x27;m half hispanic so i tend to tan a bit quicker. It doesn&#x27;t have a tingle factor, and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> this product gives you a great color . will get more when it is empty . keeps you from fading as fast</li>
            <li> excly like in picture, fast shipping, good quality, good price, I am happy with this product, very practic, easy to use. Love it</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion and it is way cheaper on here than in stores!</li>
            <li> It seams to be working , I have only used it a couple of times and look somewhat darker so we will see after a couple of weeks of use</li>
            <li> Really accelerates your tan!! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of tanning lotions but this one works great, and isn&#x27;t too expensive! So happy!!</li>
            <li> I went to tan the other day and forgot my lotion at home. I ended up having to buy a packet from the salon. I asked what would get me dark the quickest and they said this one would. All I can say is WOW! This stuff is amazing! I have tried a TON of lotions - popular tingles, regular lotions that are the newest and supposedly the best and let me say, that I am really glad I forgot my lotion because this stuff is amazing. I even put it on my face which I have a hell of a hard time tanning and my face was instantly bronzed as well. This is the type of lotion where you could tan 2 days a week and would stay dark. Or if you need to get dark fast for an even, this is your stuff! The color is perfect - a nice brown/bronze and not orange at all. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on the other reviews.  Am very pleased with the results.  Have been the the tanner only 4 times and have a great tan going.  Will be all set for my trip to Belize!</li>
            <li> This lotion is OK.  I don&#x27;t know how much it helps me tan, but it doesn&#x27;t have the strong smell that most lotions do.</li>
            <li> This is the one!!! Dark after 3 uses..and I was super pale before...love this lotion a lot...I will recommend this to a lot of girls that are willing to get tanned fast :]</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for.  It is a stronger bronzed than I have used in the past</li>
            <li> This was a really good tanning lotion back when I used to tan. Pleasant smell and a decent bronzer. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great I love it item as described will purchase again and again great price don&#x27;t raise please: ) love it</li>
            <li> Sorry i can&#x27;t really give too much info here. I&#x27;m tanning for the first time in 13 yrs, and thus have no real experience with these types of products. I&#x27;m tanning for a contest, and it seems be helping the process. Seems to provide some extra color until you shower, but overall I&#x27;d say worth the price.</li>
            <li> Nice tan with Black &amp; Tan but some streaking can occur and some of bronze comes off after showering and wiping dry with towel.</li>
            <li> Great product. Comparable to California tan and other products but at a fraction of the price. Just make sure you use it at least 2-3 times per week.</li>
            <li> does get you darker faster and it smells great. great price too for this product. i would definelty recomend getting this</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the reviews here and the first two times I used it, I was happy with it. It smells okay, it comes out of the bottle easy and it makes you darker. HOWEVER, you should know that it dyes your skin. My fingers have little brown lines running along the sides where the fingers edges rub each other and where they meet my hand. It looks awful and it won&#x27;t wash off. I bet you could use this as tanless tanning lotion, because it seems to me whether or not you tan after applying this won&#x27;t make much difference - you are going to get darker by putting it on and letting it soak into your skin.  That is NOT what I wanted. I want the tanning bed to tan me, and the lotion to assist, not the other way around. I am not purchasing this again. If you want a tanless tan, this is the product for you. It&#x27;s not the product for me.</li>
            <li> i gave this a 5 star!!! this product does the job.. this item is a great product as well as great price</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! Works very well. I have fairly white skin and I had an amazing gold tan within 2 weeks!! (Tan MWF, once a day for 10 minutes each session). One down side is, if you don&#x27;t get the residue off of your hands, you will have orange palms...&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this lotion!!!</li>
            <li> I needed a quick tan for my son&#x27;s wedding and I really don&#x27;t like to use tanning beds that often. I am pretty light complected and using this I could see a decent color after the first 10 minute session. It did not leave any streaks or turn my skin orange, lasted probably as long as a spray tan would have but I did take precautions to make sure that it was applied evenly. Use plastic gloves, like you see in Dr. office&#x27;s so your hands don&#x27;t turn orange then rub a little on just the TOP of your hand to get an even color. I did use a small amount on my face and had no problem. It&#x27;s all about the application and the bronzers did speed things up.</li>
            <li> I tried it and it didn&#x27;t give me the color that I was looking for. I&#x27;ve use better than this product.</li>
            <li> The product arrived ontime in great condition. I will utilize this retailer  for purchases of this nature in the future. However, I would not reccommend this product, it did not give me the results of other tanning products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> This is some good stuff, I usually use tinglers, but this is a great deep tanner. I even loaned it to a friend, who ended up ordering it from Amazon too.</li>
            <li> I do like the results from tanning with this lotion but it leaves your skin with a burnt smell. Not good.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion does not tan very well.  It stains really well though.  I&#x27;m going to order another brand. There!</li>
            <li> Read reviews and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this lotion. Used it a few times and noticed that my skin felt very dry after tanning. It seemed to provide no moisture at all. Knowing that it stated it was a 2011 product I was curious about the shelf life on this lotion so I peeled the white label off of the back of the bottle that was put on by the seller and sure enough the shelf life was 12 months so this lotion had been out dated for a year! Sure it was a good price but apparently the fact that it had expired a year ago must have something to do with the lack of moisture. Different lotions have different shelf lives so I will never order a 2 yr old product without first checking the shelf life at a salon since that info is not disclosed with the product info. I guess you get what you pay for after all.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty good and the smell isn&#x27;t very bad at all. Doesn&#x27;t tingle but you should wipe it off your hands after applying ;)</li>
            <li> Gives a nice golden tan, also tan stays longer than most lotions !</li>
            <li> THIS LOTION IS TOP OF THE LINE!!!  I USE IT THE SOLID BLACK &amp; PAINT IT BLACK ALL BY MILLENIUM TANNING.  I ROTATE ALL 3 &amp; HAVE GOTTEN FANTASTIC RESULTS!!!  WORTH THE $$$!!!</li>
            <li> seems to do better than most lotions and for the money its quite the bargain. I would recommend to indoor or outdoor tanning</li>
            <li> Omg black &amp; Tan is a 100% golden winner for me. Holy crap it will get u dark. I&#x27;m very picky about my lotions. I gave it a shot &amp; holy crap I am dark! I look like I&#x27;ve been on a tropical vacation. Everyday I use black &amp; Tan the darker I get. It smells really good &amp; makes my skin really soft. I highly strongly recommend this lotion to everyone. Black &amp; Tan has made me feel great &amp; look fantastic! 5 star winner</li>
            <li> This has given me a nice golden brown color in just a few days, over the top of a nasty orange glow another indoor tanning bronzer left behind unfortunately.  Anyway, I am happy with the results~ as I am going on vacation in a few days and didn&#x27;t want to look like an oompa loompa on the beach.  It took me forever to decide which Indoor tanning bronzer to purchase after having such bad luck, and results with another one I had tried, so I decided to just wing it.  I am glad I decided on this one. I do have to wipe off hands of course after applying, because it does stain palms, and around ankle and top of foot area it can be a real pain if not rubbed in really well. But I imagine all bronzers all like that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen tanning lotions to see which would be the best for getting darker and so far this is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t require a lot, doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy on the skin, and doesn&#x27;t smell strong. It does feel a little greasy after a few hours, but it&#x27;s not bad. This lotion helps get my skin a lot darker compared to many other popular lotions and the bottle lasts for a few months with a few sessions a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t like as much about this lotion that it can somewhat discolor the skin around my fingernails, but just wipe off around those areas after applying and it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> After using this lotion my skin gets red and irritated most likely from the warming beads. The warming beads sure do warm you up. Living in Minnesota this lotion would make my day if it wasn&#x27;t for the skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I got really really dark just after 3 times using this. Its my favorite tanning lotion I actually just bought another bottle for my friend because she used it and loved it.</li>
            <li> Great bronzer at a great price. Really accelerated my tan. I will be making this my new go-to lotion. The smell is not obnoxious either.</li>
            <li> Made me tan, just not as fast or as dark as some of the comments and I usually tan pretty easily and fast. Little disappointing</li>
            <li> I have tan skin already so I tan easily, but this lotion served it&#x27;s purpose &amp; I like the smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for about 2 weeks now, and I love it!! :) I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin color! I am looking super dark! Thank you for the fast shipping! Product was just as described. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed with it. Price was great. But I used one bottle and gave my friend the other bottle.</li>
            <li> Rather have 100 than 75</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best! It looks, smells and fells like a quality product. This lotion WORKS and will help you to achieve a nice, dark tan. I LOVE IT!! This lotion delivers a better quality than many lotions that are double or triple the price. BUY IT!! You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> this is a great lotion!  i am very fair and never tan, even in tanning beds.  this gave me a wonderful and lasting brown color with no orange.  it also works well as an after shower lotion the bronzing agents seem to work like a self tanner. will definitely buy again and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like this bronzer!  I definitely am seeing some great color.  I definitely recommend this bronzer if you are in the market for some nice color without the tingle.</li>
            <li> not to happy with this product. It doesn&#x27;t make you that tan. I will not purchase this brand again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love It Leaves My Skin Perfect Great Smell Not Sticky Leaves Amazing Color And To Top It Of My Man Loves It As Well The Smell Just Draws Him To Me Also The Smell Of The Lotion Last For Hours Best Tanning Lotion So Far</li>
            <li> More like a self tanner than an indoor tanning lotion.  Will enhance your tan when used properly...but If your not careful you will get the orange/brown streaks.</li>
            <li> Add that extra color to an already tone and I was pleased with the results using my tanning bed and was great outdoors too.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion gives you a tan only because it dyes your skin. I didn&#x27;t see any difference between tanning w this or using nothing. It works well as a self tanner.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product was shelved in 2011 and typically has a 6-12 month shelf life. Very disappointed with this order...</li>
            <li> Great on my skin. Tan less and moisturize at the same time. The smell is a bit &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s okay. It does not stink.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the other reviews. I was extremely disappointed with this product. I had orange streaks and spots. It also turned my hands orange even though I cleaned them immediately after applying. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product when you have already have a small fair base tan .smells good not heavily fragranced and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Nice for getting to a medium/dark tan.  No burning the skin and has a mild scent.  A lot of lotions leave a burnt smell to your skin after tanning, this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love how you can buy products like this for so much cheaper than in the actual tanning places.  I really like the color this lotion gave me</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected when I received in in the mail and matched the description on the website</li>
            <li> This really does accelerate the tanning process in bed and stand up tanners. I was really surprised how quickly a tan came with this. The only downside I see is I&#x27;m a boy and the fragrance is REALLY girly and fairly strong. Nothing I would worry about if I wasn&#x27;t a girl and I still use it simply because it works really really well but.... sorta wish they would make one like this without the super chicka smell!</li>
            <li> I bought this after using Monarchy 7x for about 8 weeks.  After 8 weeks, I had a good medium-dark base (I&#x27;m Irish - was very white to begin with) and I decided it was time for a darker bronzer and bought this based off of the reviews at Amazon.  I love this lotion! It definitely accelerated my tan after only a few sessions and I now only need it once a week on my body (still use the Monarchy on my face) and I hold the tan very well w/ only a one week session. I keep this bronzer on for hours after I tan and sometimes overnight and I do not break out and it isn&#x27;t greasy.  It smells nice - kind of like sugar.  Best selling point for me though... after taking 6-8 weeks to get a good base, this stuff really \\&quot;keeps the tan in place\\&quot; so to speak. I recommend it and will buy it (or its current version) again when I need to order.</li>
            <li> I can get pretty tan and I can do get pretty pale. These gives me a good boost to help me tan. Smells wonderful and leaves skin soft!! Perfect for tanning bed or laying out</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I tan 3 to 4 times a week and this lotion makes it look like I tan daily! I can see the results after one use. I have spent LOTS of money on tanning lotions and products, and I&#x27;m so glad I finally found the perfect match! It gives you a perfect brown color, not orange. Just make sure you wipe off the access lotion on your hands and in between your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this lotion is a STEAL! Works waaaay better than any designer lotion I&#x27;ve bought in salons, and only $15!</li>
            <li> This lotion has a bronzer, but I am not really seeing the results that  I had hoped for.  I have used almost half of the bottle and I am not bronzed much at all.  Also, this product has a burning sensation that causes your skin to turn pink, as if you have a mild burn.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells great. However, after sometime after my tanning session, I realized I had streaks! I&#x27;m so disappointed. Maybe it won&#x27;t be so bad when I get darker.... I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone first starting out with tanning.</li>
            <li> I like the results this lotion gives it goes on smooth and  gives instant results allowing you to tan once a week and still maintaining a great tan ,I gave it a 4 rating just because its a thick lotion which makes me use more to cover my whole body, but it works great so the trade off isn&#x27;t that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever! Gets you tan real quick, will continue to purchase in the future. I would highly recommend to anyone who loves tanning</li>
            <li> This stuff is &amp;#34;Awesome Sauce&amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion just like most lotions.. Idk if the bronzers are really that strong. Works better with upgrade bronzing beds. I would have preferred a different smell hut it smells good like bubble gum when you apply it. I like this lotion esp for the great price!!</li>
            <li> A little darker of lotion than I like to use but not able to tell before you buy - I am still using it</li>
            <li> Great lotion for the price!</li>
            <li> Have a great tan this summer</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Super quick delivery!</li>
            <li> was at the door 2days later</li>
            <li> This stuff works well if you&#x27;re just looking to get a few shades darker in a short amount of time. Otherwise, it&#x27;s not worth it. I&#x27;ve used this product many times and realized that it has a self tanner in it, which works really well and really fast. However, once you shower and really scrub yourself, you notice you lose all of your tan. You skin isn&#x27;t actually tanning while using this product. I would suggest something else if you are looking for something long term that will actually help you achieve your tanning goal. Also, you have to make sure you rub it in really well or it will streak, just like other self tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> An OK product. I was hoping this would be an inexpensive alternative to the $98 tanning product my salon offered. Does a good job keeping moisture in skin, but not so great with tanning.</li>
            <li> First time I used it left stricks, but as long as you rub \\&quot;really\\&quot; well it&#x27;s fine. Not a fan of the smell, u can still smell it a little after you shower!  Doesn&#x27;t tan as well as other lotions I have had!  I will still use it but just because but I am purchasing a new one this weekend!</li>
            <li> I loved this lotion! It smells really good, and works great! I love that it has a little tingle in it as well. I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Smells great! Great lotion. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel and doesn&#x27;t streak!</li>
            <li> I still have a little of this left and I swap it out with some of my other favorites. I do not tan often so it is nice to have something with a little bronzer to get my skin browning.</li>
            <li> Good tanning lotion, but I don&#x27;t notice the tingling effects it is supposed to have. Been using it for a month now, and I&#x27;m really dark!!</li>
            <li> The lotion went on nice and the smell before tanning wasnt bad, and I did like the color it gave me. But the after tam smell was very strong and I feel like even after I showered I could still smell the burnt smell. So mainly because of the after smell I just wont be using this lotion anymore.</li>
            <li> Using the product I have noticed my tan increasing faster than not using anything make sure to rub it all the way in to avoid streaks.  It is a browner tan and not orange which i like.</li>
            <li> I read all sorts of reviews, looking for my first lotion, and what I heard from  black and tan was good. I decided to just buy it, $15 was a good deal. I absolutely love it, and the smell is pretty awesome too. Perfect lotion if you&#x27;re just starting out</li>
            <li> Great color @ an awesome price. I love trying different tanning lotions...this lotion will give you color and doesn&#x27;t smell that bad.</li>
            <li> Smells &amp; works great. Only complaint is if you don&#x27;t wipe your hands after use they&#x27;ll streak.</li>
            <li> in the north, i looked like i was from the south.  worked quickly</li>
            <li> Another favorite lotion of mine. Great results. For those that want a dark tan, this lotion is one of the ones to get. At the tanning salon, I have received several compliments of the aroma. Will reorder.</li>
            <li> You do have to be very careful when you put it on because it will streak and make you look dirty if you dont get it rubbed in correctly. It does however work excellent.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing and very reasonable on pricing!!</li>
            <li> I really feel as though I&#x27;m putting on an instant tanner it leaves streaks,,any advise? I wanted to love it but..</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of this lotion it turned me orange and its stained my hands</li>
            <li> This lotion does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;Way,way cheaper than the tanning salon&lt;br /&gt;Only thing it does stain your hands a little.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend washing hands as soon as possible after applying.&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy this again</li>
            <li> fast delivery, cheap and it works great</li>
            <li> I love this product! I tan pretty easily, but usually get to a certain point where I cant get any darker. This lotion does WONDERS for that point! It spreads very evenly and it smells good too! Not the most expensive product on the market either but it definitely works like an expensive brand!</li>
            <li> like it .  still looking for better ones but not  spend alot of money. my husband only gets payed one day of the month</li>
            <li> Recieved product fast ...great price..good size bottle  ..love it ...reccomend for anyone wanting a good tan .no Orange color ..</li>
            <li> smells great &amp; make you tan nice &amp; fast!</li>
            <li> This made me super tan expecially in the turbo bed! Bedt product I have used buy it will surely burn you if you set your minutes too high!</li>
            <li> Has a great texture that poors smoothly from the bottle and speads over your body easily, so it lasts a long time..Mild scent that goes away quickly. Use this stuff after you have a base tan, works really well, deep long lasting results, very dark..I&#x27;m blonde and blue eyed and I look like a California surfer.. I live in the wet, cold, gray sky northwest... I highly recommend this..</li>
            <li> I have been using this one bottle for two years and afraid it would go bad or leave me Orange, but nope it didn&#x27;t... I mixed with an infuser lotion as well and I usually tan once a week. My tan last all week and there is no streaming or Orange color at all... Love it</li>
            <li> what I got and what is pictured here is not the same, however I have used both before and great products</li>
            <li> Lotion made me very orange and noticeable lines we it was blended as well but I&#x27;ve never had that issue with other lotions. Dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Product is really great and actually protects some against being burnt BUT, make sure you immediately wash your hands because they can and will change orange.</li>
            <li> The color was a little orange for me. I did not like the after odor at all and will not use this lotion for that reason.</li>
    </ol>
