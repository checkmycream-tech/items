            <li>This shampoo may preserve color better but it causes head to itch and flaking, would not buy again.  </li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>It cleans hair beautifully and leaves hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>First, this product does smell really good, because it&#x27;s Aveda.</li>
            <li>I switched to Aveda&#x27;s shampoo &amp; conditioner for curly hair, which smells citrusy and light.</li>
            <li>It was an overall good experience.</li>
            <li>Seemed like my hair didn&#x27;t fade as quickly.</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>it can really but a strain on my hair being strong.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this in the past and really loved it!</li>
            <li>then this shampoo is worth a lot to me.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo works well - smells fresh, cleans hair well and really does preserve color!  </li>
            <li>Normally, Aveda products smell clean.  </li>
            <li>Really helped my hair.  </li>
            <li>Geared for colored hair, don&#x27;t need to use much, fragrance is heavenly, and helps keep your color.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like all of these products.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great but don&#x27;t pay these ridiculous prices !</li>
            <li>The shampoo I used prior to this one left my hair slightly more unmanageable &amp; somewhat frizzy.</li>
            <li>it felt really clean, but thirsty and def not soft.</li>
            <li>i have to say, it smells nice but leaves my hair feeling dryer and dirtier than other similarly suited products.</li>
            <li>This one smells old and musty!</li>
            <li>but my hair is shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed because i am 67 years old and frankly never had shiny soft hair before.  </li>
            <li>(I have naturally curly hair.)</li>
            <li>When I rinsed my hair out from the shampoo, it didn&#x27;t feel soft-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle acting and leaves my hair manageable without fading.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and costs less than in the Aveda salon</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I just love this shampoo.  I first used it because I started going to an Aveda Salon or my hair cutting and color.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like this because I do get a dermatitis on my scalp that has caused severe itching and flaking and buildup.  I have been using a medicinal shampoo for several years but it can really but a strain on my hair being strong.  But i decided to try this since when I car home from the hair dresser my hair was feeling so nice.  So i have been using this shampoo for 6 months.  Now it might not be like this for everyone but for me I have not had to use my medicine shampoo once since I started using this Aveda Color Shampoo.  I have not had the buildup and not had episodes of itching.  My hair is looking better than it has in years.  It may be a combination of the Aveda Hair color my stylist uses and this shampoo but my hair is shiny and soft.  I am amazed because i am 67 years old and frankly never had shiny soft hair before.  It was baby fine and pretty much boring hair.  In the past 6 months I have had several people stop and ask not only about the color but because of the shine!  Keeping this in mind that I no longer have to use that strong, expensive, harsh medicine shampoo then this shampoo is worth a lot to me.  I also use a small amount of the conditioner as well, but not much.  Wouldn&#x27;t trade this shampoo for anything now.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful and it definitely extends my color. Arrived quickly and costs less than in the Aveda salon I go to.</li>
            <li> I loved it when I went to aveda salon my stylist used it on me. I decided to purchase it a bit cheaper here. Not sure my hair feels the same way but I guess that&#x27;s the magic of getting your hair done by a stylist...</li>
            <li> I have used this product periodically for the past several years- i have to say, it smells nice but leaves my hair feeling dryer and dirtier than other similarly suited products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a while. My hair is colored, &amp; it seems to help the color last a bit longer. The shampoo I used prior to this one left my hair slightly more unmanageable &amp; somewhat frizzy. (I have naturally curly hair.) This shampoo is great!</li>
            <li> Really helped my hair.  Seemed like my hair didn&#x27;t fade as quickly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product leaves hair so soft and doesn&#x27;t have any build up of product. Prompt delivery</li>
            <li> Leaves a residue I feel like I can not fully get out of my hair. My hair would feel greasy by mid-day.</li>
            <li> Love this on so many levels. Geared for colored hair, don&#x27;t need to use much, fragrance is heavenly, and helps keep your color. Will continue to buy from now on.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo I ever used before! It is good to my hair! I like it very much! so good</li>
            <li> just used and its great. feels good and managed my colored hair well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and really loved it! I only stopped using it because my hours at work were cut for awhile but I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll be going back to it! It made my hair so soft,shiny,and bouncy and I didn&#x27;t even have to use a conditioner! ALL Aveda products smell fantastic! The Rosemary Mint shampoo is awesome!! I give it an A!</li>
            <li> ...why would you buy here for $31 when you can get it for almost 1/2 that on the Aveda website?  Good product and it does make the color last a little longer.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was just ok for me. I have found something else I like better.  But it did have a good \\&quot;Aveda\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great but don&#x27;t pay these ridiculous prices ! Go to a hair salon or order from Aveda - it&#x27;s only 19.50.</li>
            <li> It cleans hair beautifully and leaves hair soft and shiny.  I did tire of the spicy scent after several months, and now that my hair is permed I switched to Aveda&#x27;s shampoo &amp; conditioner for curly hair, which smells citrusy and light.</li>
            <li> Great product, have trusted Aveda for years.&lt;br /&gt;Makes your hair feel nice, even the smell is nice (not always the case for Aveda).</li>
            <li> great shampoo, it leaves my hair feeling clean and smelling nice.  I hope it keeps the color.  what else can I say?????</li>
            <li> My go to for color treated hair! Will buy again as always :)</li>
            <li> This shampoo may preserve color better but it causes head to itch and flaking, would not buy again.  I also bout the Aveda conditioner and used them together, over-priced and they are not worth paying the extra $$.</li>
            <li> First, this product does smell really good, because it&#x27;s Aveda. I feel like the shampoo is too stripping somehow. When I rinsed my hair out from the shampoo, it didn&#x27;t feel soft- it felt really clean, but thirsty and def not soft. A little disappointed because it&#x27;s Aveda. ;(</li>
            <li> Item was received as advertised.  It shipped timely.  I would do business again.  It was an overall good experience. MD</li>
            <li> This is a great color conserve shampoo. It makes my hair shiny, and silky.  I just love it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works well - smells fresh, cleans hair well and really does preserve color!  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like all of these products.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars for the quality of Aveda products. However, this is quite a bit cheaper ordered off of their website.</li>
            <li> love this product works great and keeps my scalp from itching.</li>
            <li> The perfect shampoo for people to color their hair.  It&#x27;s gentle acting and leaves my hair manageable without fading.  It&#x27;s a winner in my book.</li>
            <li> Nothing like Aveda shampoo.  Does not strip color and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Normally, Aveda products smell clean.  This one smells old and musty!</li>
