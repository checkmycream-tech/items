    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I bought this and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>happy with product and shipment</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so it seems like a good value.  </li>
            <li>Great product and love the texture and smell.</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Feels great, goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t burn the eyes</li>
            <li>Lightweight, and nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is so pleasant and clean on my skin and it has just a tinge of pomegranate fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Very light moisturizer with sun screen.</li>
            <li>I think the fragrance is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>I love that their products are not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>I love non-toxic sunscreens that have zinc in them.</li>
            <li>It is just LOVELY for the face &amp; neck but can be used elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Works great for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I love this product so much</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite sun-screening moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this Ann Webb product, and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Nothing super perfumey.</li>
            <li>This is not a big-gun sunscreen for direct or extended exposure to the hot, bright sun in central Texas, but if like me all you do is go from the air-conditioned house to the air conditioned car, and you stay mostly in the shade while you&#x27;re outdoors, it&#x27;s a fine addition to the beauty product artillery.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are clean, the tube is large and it has a light fruity scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The scent is not perfum-y, just fresh and mild.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly without leaving a heavy or whitish residue, and it affords great protection from the sun.  </li>
            <li>Organic and healthy ingredients including natural skin protection from the sun.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m being too dramatic for my own good</li>
            <li>It has a very, very mild smell but the smell is nice and a little fruity.</li>
            <li>I have been allergic/sensitive to most products and this product is natural and gentle while truly moisturizing and protecting my face from the elements.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive and finicky skin with pores that get clogged easily, but haven&#x27;t had any problems with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I use this daily and it does seem to smoothen out some of the fine wrinkles, and my skin seems to drink it up!</li>
            <li>That said, it provides lightweight moisturization and natural, non-chemical based sun protection, so there&#x27;s no funky sunscreen odor, just a peculiar sort of berry-like fragrance which fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I have been using it over a month and don&#x27;t really see a change.</li>
            <li>My face really loves it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>SKIN has proven to be even better and costs less.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a few years, and I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and a little goes a long way, making it more economical.</li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;ll look for something new after I run out.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen does not make my skin white like some natural sunscreens and the moisturizer is very lightweight and not greasy.</li>
            <li>The Hotel San Jose in Austin uses all of these products and naturally I took the skin care ones as a souvenir.</li>
            <li>I  now use no other moisturizer or sun block on my face during the day.  </li>
            <li>Most non-toxic sunscreens are very thick and oil however.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful about how you apply it to your face, because the high concentration of zinc and titanium oxide color the product white, so you have to gently rub it in to avoid leftover white streaks or residue.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re not careful you&#x27;ll leave white patches on your face.</li>
            <li>This is light enough for hot, humid summers in NY but moisturizing enough for our horribly cold winters.</li>

            <li> It is on the thick side</li>
            <li> but I put a less-than-dime-size squirt in my hand and add a few drops of water to thin it out, then spread over my face.  </li>
            <li> Its not runny or to thick.</li>
            <li> I used to use Oil of Olay Moisturizer with SPF until I discovered that the sunscreen ingredients are actually unhealthy.</li>

            <li> I think the fragrance is overwhelming. I like the feel of this product once it&#x27;s absorbed into my skin, but it is very thick. I have to be careful to rub it in thoroughly so my face isn&#x27;t white. I would purchase the product again if there were a fragrance-free version.</li>
            <li> Tip: Shake the tube before squeezing out lotion.  It is on the thick side but I put a less-than-dime-size squirt in my hand and add a few drops of water to thin it out, then spread over my face.  The lotion is so pleasant and clean on my skin and it has just a tinge of pomegranate fragrance.  Nothing super perfumey. Organic and healthy ingredients including natural skin protection from the sun.  The skin care person at my local health food store recommended it.  I was hesitant because I had been using a VERY expensive lotion purchased at a doctor&#x27;s office...but I was sicking of paying the price.  SKIN has proven to be even better and costs less.  The tube lasts for months because you only need to use a little bit.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and it does seem to smoothen out some of the fine wrinkles, and my skin seems to drink it up!</li>

The sunscreen does not make my skin white like some natural sunscreens and the moisturizer is very lightweight and not greasy. I haven&#x27;t tried this is the summer sun yet, but it seems to work. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very light moisturizer with sun screen. Gray for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The Hotel San Jose in Austin uses all of these products and naturally I took the skin care ones as a souvenir. I&#x27;m in love. I&#x27;m 22 with combo skin, and get the occasional breakout. This is light enough for hot, humid summers in NY but moisturizing enough for our horribly cold winters. It has a very, very mild smell but the smell is nice and a little fruity. Not too thick but not gross and watery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been experimenting with moisturizers since I was 15 or 16 and never found one I can use year round. I&#x27;m being too dramatic for my own good but finally this one has got me!</li>
            <li> I  now use no other moisturizer or sun block on my face during the day.  I have been allergic/sensitive to most products and this product is natural and gentle while truly moisturizing and protecting my face from the elements.  I love this product so much&lt;br /&gt;that I have been giving it as a gift to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a few years, and I love it. I&#x27;m 37 and have medium-toned Caucasian skin. This is not a big-gun sunscreen for direct or extended exposure to the hot, bright sun in central Texas, but if like me all you do is go from the air-conditioned house to the air conditioned car, and you stay mostly in the shade while you&#x27;re outdoors, it&#x27;s a fine addition to the beauty product artillery. It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and a little goes a long way, making it more economical.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer. Its not runny or to thick. I have been using it over a month and don&#x27;t really see a change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this line but I don&#x27;t like this moisturizer. The sunscreen doesn&#x27;t blend well so if you&#x27;re not careful you&#x27;ll leave white patches on your face. Or if you don&#x27;t blend enough it starts to flake on you. I wear it during errands if I don&#x27;t care what I look like but I&#x27;m going back to Oil of Olay SPF30.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to moisturizer after washing my face day and night.  Softens my skin without being greasy and I am less susceptible to burning.  A little goes a long way.  One bottle last for several months.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has a peculiarly \\&quot;thick\\&quot; and dense sort of feeling out of the tube, and occasionally you may have to shake it a little bit to prevent water settling out of it. You have to be careful about how you apply it to your face, because the high concentration of zinc and titanium oxide color the product white, so you have to gently rub it in to avoid leftover white streaks or residue. I have problems with it pilling/rolling up into white stripes that fall off my skin if I apply this over a serum or otherwise too-damp face. That said, it provides lightweight moisturization and natural, non-chemical based sun protection, so there&#x27;s no funky sunscreen odor, just a peculiar sort of berry-like fragrance which fades quickly. I have sensitive and finicky skin with pores that get clogged easily, but haven&#x27;t had any problems with this moisturizer. All in all I&#x27;ll use up my tube - I&#x27;ve been using this for almost three months now - but I think I&#x27;ll look for something new after I run out.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite sun-screening moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years, and each tube lasts awhile so it seems like a good value.  It is non-irritating and works well for my combination skin.  It absorbs quickly without leaving a heavy or whitish residue, and it affords great protection from the sun.  I wear it everyday on face and neck, and it performs very well under makeup.</li>
            <li> Great product and love the texture and smell. Works great for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Lightweight, and nice fragrance.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this Ann Webb product, and so far, so good.  I love that their products are not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> Great product. My face really loves it. I only would like to see no soy anything in their ingredients.</li>
            <li> happy with product and shipment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this every day for a year and it has transformed my skin</li>
            <li> See my other Ann Webb review. Great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I would give this 10 stars if I could! I love non-toxic sunscreens that have zinc in them. They brighten the skin and cover imperfections as well. It is just LOVELY for the face &amp; neck but can be used elsewhere. Most non-toxic sunscreens are very thick and oil however. This one is the lightest weight formula I have used. The scent is not perfum-y, just fresh and mild. I highly recommend this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer! Feels great, goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t burn the eyes (in case you rub some into eyes).  It&#x27;s my new favorite daytime moisturizer.</li>
