            <li>This is amazing and works wonders.</li>
            <li>Ive used it for almost a month now and its been amazing.</li>
            <li>Plus I have nails that look nice</li>
            <li>I even received a compliment about how nice they look from a customer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my own nails</li>
            <li>wonderful product, highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Nailtiques, it&#x27;s excellent!</li>
            <li>but they are so strong, smooth, and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Cute and works nicely</li>
            <li>have beautiful nails for the first time in my LIFE</li>
            <li>I have never been able to grow my own nails until I started using Nailtiques</li>
            <li>I was using the Nailtiques Formula 2 with great success and thought the plus would be that much better.  </li>
            <li>I used it every day as directed for three months with no nail polish to get my nails healthy.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>After a couple months, my nails looked so much better.</li>
            <li>and then I put color on top of it on the weekends.</li>
            <li>Not so sure.</li>
            <li>Then as top coat.</li>
            <li>My polish stays on better and doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li>I canâ€™t keep polish on them for more than a couple of days, because the nails bend, causing the polish to flake off.</li>
            <li>2 Plus works better than the knock-off Nail Tek product.</li>
            <li>The price sure beats having your nails done.  </li>
            <li>Just okay.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li>I have just been using it for a week and my nails look better already.  </li>
            <li>It made most of my nails peel, and the others break even more often.  </li>
            <li>better v</li>
            <li>I will probably order more.</li>
            <li>so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Its a fantastic strengthener!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews both pro and con i decided to take a leap of faith and try it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the pricing is better here on Amazon, as I used to purchase it at beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>I sure recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>I work in a restaurant and if it can help keep my nails from breaking and splitting, it should work for most anyone.</li>
            <li>I think this product is amazing and would recommend it to anyone who lives a &amp;#34;normal &amp;#34; life like dealing with everyday things and doesnt sit drinking tea all day as it keeps your nails in excellent condition!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have strong, healthy looking nails.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s supposed to make the color come off just as easily.</li>
            <li>After using my nails don&#x27;t break that easily and is a lot stronger.</li>
            <li>Dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>, so they easily broke off, tore, &amp; split.</li>
            <li>They would break easily, peel, and bend.</li>
            <li>My nails are now strong and the ridges in my thumbs are almost gone.</li>
            <li>, they are strong</li>
            <li>I always felt strong nails are based on nutrition solely, I have absorbency issues.</li>
            <li>My nails are now looking natural and beautiful, and are super strong.</li>
            <li>beautiful nails all at the same time!  </li>
            <li>Works super well and very quickly, just make sure to follow directions.</li>
            <li>All are growing again without breaking, I still have problems with 2 of them, but, they are coming along, and will be fine.</li>
            <li>They were chipped off to the quick when I started!  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Plus is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>Waste of cash, I should just realize that Nailtiques is the best product for me.</li>
            <li>Its done a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>Works very well!!!</li>
            <li>A like pricey but product really works!!!</li>
            <li>In any case, this really assists in keeping my nails strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>There are not enough STARS to give this amazing product!  </li>
            <li>But Nail Tek is a knock-off of Nailtiques protein formulas, so I wondered if I should try the original.</li>
            <li>2 days worth works well without removing in between!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I came across the great reviews for Nailtiques Formula 2, but I&#x27;d read that it takes like 3 weeks and thought that&#x27;s a long time for something to work!</li>
            <li>The new nail is adhering beautifully to the nail bed, allowing me to trim the old, damaged nails off.  </li>
            <li>product has really held up and made a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I think another week or two I will be able to really tell  a difference.</li>
            <li>I used to use this product years ago and loved it back then.  </li>
            <li>Nailtiques is just as good today as it was back then.  </li>
            <li>My daughter told me about it, she had bough a smaill bottle at a local drug store and thought it was good and so&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have gorgeous natural nails thanks to Nailtique!</li>
            <li>It is also extremely easy to remove with non-acetone (and therefore gentle!)</li>
            <li>It feels like your nails have been torn into the quick.  </li>
            <li>QUICK DELIVERY.</li>
            <li>Forever I have not been able to have decent nails</li>
            <li>My nails are all long and very strong!  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t take much time at all and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>My nails are much stronger, healthier and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>i havent applied any color polish yet on top of the clear yet because i didnt want anything to effect the results.</li>
            <li>but when i remove my nail polish (to reapply fresh coat)</li>
            <li>I read a lot of the reviews and with a recommendation i figured its worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Friends and co-workers are actually commenting how nice they look.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any better product on the market today to grow long and strong nails.  </li>
            <li>It also assists in strengthening the nail to grow long, strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>After a week, I didn&#x27;t really see a significant difference</li>
            <li>right now it&#x27;s a miracle worker</li>
            <li>This stuff does an amazing job on pretty fragile nails.</li>
            <li>I have very soft nails that break easily.</li>
            <li>I took my acrylic nails off some time ago and discovered I can grow my own long nails with Nailtiques.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product based on a recommendation received by a friend to assist in making my nails more healthy and less brittle!</li>
            <li>it got here very fast also a++++</li>
            <li>I test out a new Nail Aid (works better than you think) or a new Sally Hansen product.</li>
            <li>Plus and a quick dry top coat.  </li>
            <li>I used it exactly as directed.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use it daily as instructed.</li>
            <li>My nails are back to being healthy like before.</li>
            <li>Love it when a product actually works!!</li>
            <li>So glad I tried this because it literally makes my polish last for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>It can be used as a basecoat, but it is not recommended to put polish on top for the initial treatment.</li>
            <li>I usually apply three coats and top that with color or top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a avid nail polish addict, I have tried everything under the sun to get my nails in shape.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I have used this for a couple months now and my nails have not broken once!</li>
            <li>The first day i would apply two coats and then after 5 days i would remove it and start again with two and so on.</li>
            <li>Some of you might be thinking that my nails are growing because of the supplement and you&#x27;re probably right to a certain extent.</li>
            <li>Know I have pretty nails</li>
            <li>This is the first time that my nail have grown.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews, and I am pleased to say that this product actually works!  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions and used consistently until I received the desired effect.</li>
            <li>I have tried many nail products, and this is the only one that produced results!</li>
            <li>The other day I was able to open a pop top can without breaking the nail!  </li>
            <li>PLUS there is NO MORE peeling, just strong, healthy nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to grow long nails.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a good measure as nothing would help in the past.</li>
            <li>My nails are very brittle and always split vertically.  </li>
            <li>This product really works...</li>
            <li>This formula really works-</li>
            <li>My nails arenâ€™t bending nearly as much.</li>
            <li>My nails have always grown fast.</li>
            <li>I really like buying it online</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>and I thought I&#x27;d never see a real nail.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This is the most money i ever spent on nail polish</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but it works very well</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My nails have grown and are much stronger</li>
            <li>This product helps so much.  </li>
            <li>However, if you have nails like mine that split and break just as fast as they grow, the supplement you take doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Very week, I&#x27;m talking couldn&#x27;t even make a bed without nail flipping inside out.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works</li>
            <li>I liked that it dried fast.</li>
            <li>Every other day I add another coat of Formula 2 Plus and top coat.  </li>
            <li>I have tried MANY other name brands, gone to nail tech&#x27;s and tried drugstore varieties.</li>
            <li>Must buy if used regularly will have tout nail nice &amp; long...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything special, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>This formula, applied as directed, helps my nails grow long and strong, I love this little size, too, cuz I use it up before it can get sticky.</li>
            <li>After week 2, I noticed there wasn&#x27;t as much peeling and by week 3, I was able to grow my nails out just a little bit</li>
            <li>but I still needed enough growth to be able to trim off the parts that had peeled back.</li>
            <li>finally I am starting to get longer pretty *real* nails!  </li>
            <li>The product seems to go a long way, it drys quickly and has really made a difference in the strength of my nails.  </li>
            <li>and my nails are hard, strong, and rarely break.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff anymore.</li>
            <li>The first 2 weeks, I used it every single day, religiously, applying one coat on top of another and removing it and starting over after about every five days.  </li>
            <li>I am a 68 year old grandmother and have soft nails my whole life.  </li>
            <li>I will probably need to use this stuff for about 6 weeks before I really notice anything major</li>
            <li>I have long, extremely strong nails that I simply put one coat of Nailtiques on every morning.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have found that seems to actually work for me!  </li>
            <li>This is the first nail hardener I have ever used that actually worked.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re are willing to hang in there for several months, it does work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and it really works!</li>
            <li>I finf myself trimming them more then usual.</li>
            <li>I take it off about every 7 to 8 days (regular remover works fine) for a just day and then put new coats right back on (especially in dry weather).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, just as I expected</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive for what it is, it peels off like any other clear top coat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a overnight fix but in the long run, it really helped me through process of getting my nails looking decent again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had the strongest nails but in recent months, my nails turned very brittle.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s being directly applied to your nails for absorption.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to fight the busy parking lot at the store that carries it.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.....</li>
            <li>Regular use really made my nails stronger and protected against chipping.</li>
            <li>i completely remove the product about every four days or</li>
            <li>A big plus is my polish lasts so much longer because my nails aren&#x27;t bending all the time.</li>
            <li>I have had splitting and soft nails all my life until this products.</li>
            <li>This formula treats nails that are naturally soft, peeling, split or just won&#x27;t grow.</li>
            <li>For about five years in the early 90&#x27;s --and for no reason--my fingernails peeled and split.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that really works.  </li>
            <li>The only one I really recommend is the Formula Fix as the product does tend to thicken and this thins it</li>
            <li>The tips are white, they are strong and I actually have to clip them because they grow too long now.</li>
            <li>I am using it every other day or every third day, still one coat on top of another each use, then removing and starting all over.  </li>
            <li>She explained to me that birth control blocks the bodies ability to properly absorb folic acid, which is the main \\&quot;vitamin\\&quot; responsible for healthy skin and nails and which is why my hair and nails became so thin and malnourished.</li>
            <li>After Using this product daily, I have pretty enough nails to paint.</li>
            <li>After the first week, my nails started to get harder.</li>
            <li>My nails are actually too long now -- I&#x27;d better go file them down.  </li>
            <li>Each week, I just cleaned off the left over polish and applied a new layer.</li>
            <li>I had spent so much money on every Sally Hanson nail product and none of them fixed my nails.</li>
            <li>BUT several months later I can tell my nails are much much stronger and are not peeling at all.  </li>
            <li>I have had long nails that need to be filed regularly for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>I ended up with white streaks right in the center of my nails.  </li>
            <li>Well, that&#x27;s only half true.</li>
            <li>apparently, there is protein in the polish</li>
            <li>so I wash my dishes with bare</li>
            <li>They barely bend when I push on them now.</li>
            <li>Magic in a bottle for my poor nails.</li>
            <li>the process is kind of tedious</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this since it was such a small bottle for $9, but it was completely worth it</li>
            <li>Nailtiques 2 plus is the only product I found to make my thin split frail nails strong again.</li>

            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> After reading all the good reviews and having tried a bunch of dud products, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the nail strengthener.</li>
            <li> am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This will give you strong, beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Nothing better in the world for problem nails!  </li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing and works wonders.</li>
            <li> Ive used it for almost a month now and its been amazing.</li>
            <li> Plus I have nails that look nice</li>
            <li> I even received a compliment about how nice they look from a customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my own nails</li>
            <li> wonderful product, highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Nailtiques, it&#x27;s excellent!</li>
            <li> but they are so strong, smooth, and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Cute and works nicely</li>
            <li> have beautiful nails for the first time in my LIFE</li>
            <li> I have never been able to grow my own nails until I started using Nailtiques</li>
            <li> I was using the Nailtiques Formula 2 with great success and thought the plus would be that much better.  </li>
            <li> I used it every day as directed for three months with no nail polish to get my nails healthy.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> After a couple months, my nails looked so much better.</li>
            <li> and then I put color on top of it on the weekends.</li>
            <li> Not so sure.</li>
            <li> Then as top coat.</li>
            <li> My polish stays on better and doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> I canâ€™t keep polish on them for more than a couple of days, because the nails bend, causing the polish to flake off.</li>
            <li> 2 Plus works better than the knock-off Nail Tek product.</li>
            <li> The price sure beats having your nails done.  </li>
            <li> Just okay.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li> I have just been using it for a week and my nails look better already.  </li>
            <li> It made most of my nails peel, and the others break even more often.  </li>
            <li> better v</li>
            <li> I will probably order more.</li>
            <li> so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Its a fantastic strengthener!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews both pro and con i decided to take a leap of faith and try it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the pricing is better here on Amazon, as I used to purchase it at beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> I sure recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I work in a restaurant and if it can help keep my nails from breaking and splitting, it should work for most anyone.</li>
            <li> I think this product is amazing and would recommend it to anyone who lives a &amp;#34;normal &amp;#34; life like dealing with everyday things and doesnt sit drinking tea all day as it keeps your nails in excellent condition!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have strong, healthy looking nails.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s supposed to make the color come off just as easily.</li>
            <li> After using my nails don&#x27;t break that easily and is a lot stronger.</li>
            <li> Dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> , so they easily broke off, tore, &amp; split.</li>
            <li> They would break easily, peel, and bend.</li>
            <li> My nails are now strong and the ridges in my thumbs are almost gone.</li>
            <li> , they are strong</li>
            <li> I always felt strong nails are based on nutrition solely, I have absorbency issues.</li>
            <li> My nails are now looking natural and beautiful, and are super strong.</li>
            <li> beautiful nails all at the same time!  </li>
            <li> Works super well and very quickly, just make sure to follow directions.</li>
            <li> All are growing again without breaking, I still have problems with 2 of them, but, they are coming along, and will be fine.</li>
            <li> They were chipped off to the quick when I started!  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Plus is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> Waste of cash, I should just realize that Nailtiques is the best product for me.</li>
            <li> Its done a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> Works very well!!!</li>
            <li> A like pricey but product really works!!!</li>
            <li> In any case, this really assists in keeping my nails strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> There are not enough STARS to give this amazing product!  </li>
            <li> But Nail Tek is a knock-off of Nailtiques protein formulas, so I wondered if I should try the original.</li>
            <li> 2 days worth works well without removing in between!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I came across the great reviews for Nailtiques Formula 2, but I&#x27;d read that it takes like 3 weeks and thought that&#x27;s a long time for something to work!</li>
            <li> The new nail is adhering beautifully to the nail bed, allowing me to trim the old, damaged nails off.  </li>
            <li> product has really held up and made a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I think another week or two I will be able to really tell  a difference.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product years ago and loved it back then.  </li>
            <li> Nailtiques is just as good today as it was back then.  </li>
            <li> My daughter told me about it, she had bough a smaill bottle at a local drug store and thought it was good and so&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have gorgeous natural nails thanks to Nailtique!</li>
            <li> It is also extremely easy to remove with non-acetone (and therefore gentle!)</li>
            <li> It feels like your nails have been torn into the quick.  </li>
            <li> QUICK DELIVERY.</li>
            <li> Forever I have not been able to have decent nails</li>
            <li> My nails are all long and very strong!  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t take much time at all and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> My nails are much stronger, healthier and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> i havent applied any color polish yet on top of the clear yet because i didnt want anything to effect the results.</li>
            <li> but when i remove my nail polish (to reapply fresh coat)</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews and with a recommendation i figured its worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Friends and co-workers are actually commenting how nice they look.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any better product on the market today to grow long and strong nails.  </li>
            <li> It also assists in strengthening the nail to grow long, strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> After a week, I didn&#x27;t really see a significant difference</li>
            <li> right now it&#x27;s a miracle worker</li>
            <li> This stuff does an amazing job on pretty fragile nails.</li>
            <li> I have very soft nails that break easily.</li>
            <li> I took my acrylic nails off some time ago and discovered I can grow my own long nails with Nailtiques.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on a recommendation received by a friend to assist in making my nails more healthy and less brittle!</li>
            <li> it got here very fast also a++++</li>
            <li> I test out a new Nail Aid (works better than you think) or a new Sally Hansen product.</li>
            <li> Plus and a quick dry top coat.  </li>
            <li> I used it exactly as directed.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use it daily as instructed.</li>
            <li> My nails are back to being healthy like before.</li>
            <li> Love it when a product actually works!!</li>
            <li> So glad I tried this because it literally makes my polish last for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> It can be used as a basecoat, but it is not recommended to put polish on top for the initial treatment.</li>
            <li> I usually apply three coats and top that with color or top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a avid nail polish addict, I have tried everything under the sun to get my nails in shape.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple months now and my nails have not broken once!</li>
            <li> The first day i would apply two coats and then after 5 days i would remove it and start again with two and so on.</li>
            <li> Some of you might be thinking that my nails are growing because of the supplement and you&#x27;re probably right to a certain extent.</li>
            <li> Know I have pretty nails</li>
            <li> This is the first time that my nail have grown.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, and I am pleased to say that this product actually works!  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and used consistently until I received the desired effect.</li>
            <li> I have tried many nail products, and this is the only one that produced results!</li>
            <li> The other day I was able to open a pop top can without breaking the nail!  </li>
            <li> PLUS there is NO MORE peeling, just strong, healthy nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to grow long nails.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a good measure as nothing would help in the past.</li>
            <li> My nails are very brittle and always split vertically.  </li>
            <li> This product really works...</li>
            <li> This formula really works-</li>
            <li> My nails arenâ€™t bending nearly as much.</li>
            <li> My nails have always grown fast.</li>
            <li> I really like buying it online</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> and I thought I&#x27;d never see a real nail.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is the most money i ever spent on nail polish</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but it works very well</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My nails have grown and are much stronger</li>
            <li> This product helps so much.  </li>
            <li> However, if you have nails like mine that split and break just as fast as they grow, the supplement you take doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very week, I&#x27;m talking couldn&#x27;t even make a bed without nail flipping inside out.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works</li>
            <li> I liked that it dried fast.</li>
            <li> Every other day I add another coat of Formula 2 Plus and top coat.  </li>
            <li> I have tried MANY other name brands, gone to nail tech&#x27;s and tried drugstore varieties.</li>
            <li> Must buy if used regularly will have tout nail nice &amp; long...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything special, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> This formula, applied as directed, helps my nails grow long and strong, I love this little size, too, cuz I use it up before it can get sticky.</li>
            <li> After week 2, I noticed there wasn&#x27;t as much peeling and by week 3, I was able to grow my nails out just a little bit</li>
            <li> but I still needed enough growth to be able to trim off the parts that had peeled back.</li>
            <li> finally I am starting to get longer pretty *real* nails!  </li>
            <li> The product seems to go a long way, it drys quickly and has really made a difference in the strength of my nails.  </li>
            <li> and my nails are hard, strong, and rarely break.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff anymore.</li>
            <li> The first 2 weeks, I used it every single day, religiously, applying one coat on top of another and removing it and starting over after about every five days.  </li>
            <li> I am a 68 year old grandmother and have soft nails my whole life.  </li>
            <li> I will probably need to use this stuff for about 6 weeks before I really notice anything major</li>
            <li> I have long, extremely strong nails that I simply put one coat of Nailtiques on every morning.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have found that seems to actually work for me!  </li>
            <li> This is the first nail hardener I have ever used that actually worked.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re are willing to hang in there for several months, it does work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and it really works!</li>
            <li> I finf myself trimming them more then usual.</li>
            <li> I take it off about every 7 to 8 days (regular remover works fine) for a just day and then put new coats right back on (especially in dry weather).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, just as I expected</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive for what it is, it peels off like any other clear top coat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a overnight fix but in the long run, it really helped me through process of getting my nails looking decent again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had the strongest nails but in recent months, my nails turned very brittle.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s being directly applied to your nails for absorption.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to fight the busy parking lot at the store that carries it.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.....</li>
            <li> Regular use really made my nails stronger and protected against chipping.</li>
            <li> i completely remove the product about every four days or</li>
            <li> A big plus is my polish lasts so much longer because my nails aren&#x27;t bending all the time.</li>
            <li> I have had splitting and soft nails all my life until this products.</li>
            <li> This formula treats nails that are naturally soft, peeling, split or just won&#x27;t grow.</li>
            <li> For about five years in the early 90&#x27;s --and for no reason--my fingernails peeled and split.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that really works.  </li>
            <li> The only one I really recommend is the Formula Fix as the product does tend to thicken and this thins it</li>
            <li> The tips are white, they are strong and I actually have to clip them because they grow too long now.</li>
            <li> I am using it every other day or every third day, still one coat on top of another each use, then removing and starting all over.  </li>
            <li> She explained to me that birth control blocks the bodies ability to properly absorb folic acid, which is the main \\&quot;vitamin\\&quot; responsible for healthy skin and nails and which is why my hair and nails became so thin and malnourished.</li>
            <li> After Using this product daily, I have pretty enough nails to paint.</li>
            <li> After the first week, my nails started to get harder.</li>
            <li> My nails are actually too long now -- I&#x27;d better go file them down.  </li>
            <li> Each week, I just cleaned off the left over polish and applied a new layer.</li>
            <li> I had spent so much money on every Sally Hanson nail product and none of them fixed my nails.</li>
            <li> BUT several months later I can tell my nails are much much stronger and are not peeling at all.  </li>
            <li> I have had long nails that need to be filed regularly for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> I ended up with white streaks right in the center of my nails.  </li>
            <li> Well, that&#x27;s only half true.</li>
            <li> apparently, there is protein in the polish</li>
            <li> so I wash my dishes with bare</li>
            <li> They barely bend when I push on them now.</li>
            <li> Magic in a bottle for my poor nails.</li>
            <li> the process is kind of tedious</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this since it was such a small bottle for $9, but it was completely worth it</li>
            <li> Nailtiques 2 plus is the only product I found to make my thin split frail nails strong again.</li>
            <li> It smells similar to all other nail products as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll need to grow out all of the nails before the damaged parts are long enough to cut off, but this product saved my nails.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this will last long term</li>
            <li> I finally am getting my nails back when nothing else - even the more expensive products did not work!</li>
            <li> but it is the only thing that worked on my dry brittle hideous nails.  </li>
            <li> They will grow and aren&#x27;t super thin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn at all, but then, I&#x27;m not applying it on top of nail beds that have had artificial nails on them.  </li>
            <li> within 2 weeks I had stong, long nails.  </li>
            <li> I never had long nails until I used nailtiques formula 2 plus.</li>
            <li> I always end up taking a break from it, because it causes my nails to grow way too long</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t manage long nails.</li>
            <li> and I ended up filing them as they were getting too long.  </li>
            <li> They are stronger than I have ever seen them and are really long.</li>
            <li> Use as directed and you will have long nails.</li>
            <li> Last week I actually had to file my nails down because they were getting too long....</li>
            <li> Plain clear nail polish works</li>
            <li> i use to get acrylic nails because my own nails were too thin &amp; weak</li>
            <li> So as long as you apply it, it works!</li>
            <li> I was trying to repair my dry, cracking nails by using another product (Sally Hansen).  </li>
            <li> This nailtiques not only stopped them from chipping (I was shocked) but keeps the strong enough to gain length.</li>
            <li> i have noticed its more beneficial to try and apply a thin coat verse thick layer each day</li>
            <li> I have super brittle hair and nails that can&#x27;t grow out because they&#x27;re weak and bend and break!</li>
            <li> I usually have soft, bendy, peeling nails.  </li>
            <li> I started taking vitamins but realized the vitamins only help with the new growth of my nail, so the ends were still weak and splitting.</li>
            <li> AND I still have half a bottle left of the 2 plus.</li>
            <li> &amp; i didnt want to buy it, especially because its such a small amount.</li>
            <li> Now there is no peeling, they are less bendy, and I&#x27;ve only had three breaks.</li>
            <li> but it my nails were a mess after a short time using acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> Plus is the only thing that has ever fixed my weak, peeling nails.</li>
            <li> It seems so stupid to shell out this much cash for such a teeny tiny bottle of clear polish.</li>
            <li> Arrived when expected.</li>
            <li> I definitely saw some improvement  in the peeling after a couple of weeks but it wasn&#x27;t the miracle I had hoped for because I am impatient.  </li>
            <li> As I have aged, my nails have become brittle and they peel.  </li>
            <li> After about 5 applications, my nails were noticeably harder.  </li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of nail products that promise to give me harder, stronger, and longer nails.</li>
            <li> The product helped a bit with the peeling but didn&#x27;t strengthen my nails as much as I expected.</li>
            <li> I have thin brittle nails, this works at keeping my nails from breaking and making them much lo get and stronger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at how slow my nails have been growing since I&#x27;ve started using this product</li>
            <li> So after a few days of use it tends to peel off fairly easily due to the extra thickness.</li>
            <li> Now I look down to find that my nails have gotten too long!</li>
            <li> My nails had been peeling for the last couple years and as soon as they grew past my fingertip, they would break.</li>
            <li> but after about 3 months, I started looking for other products on Amazon and reading reviews.</li>
            <li> One- The price for such a SMALL bottle.</li>
            <li> My nails began separating from the nail bed due to the shock to my system.  </li>
            <li> Regular Formula 2 works just as well as plus, if not better.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of other products on the market and this one out shines them all.</li>
            <li> Due to meds I take my nails would never grow and would split and chip....</li>
            <li> I usually get the larger size, .5 fl oz, but I suppose I had a senior moment.</li>
            <li> No need to read any other review after this.</li>
            <li> You do need to apply daily (or at least every other day)</li>
            <li> I have extremely paper thin natural nails that are see-thru.</li>
            <li> Religiously used this every day and now my nails are hard as well...</li>
            <li> The manicure should last at least 10 days.</li>
            <li> Love Nailtiques, My nail became weak and always splitting due to artificial nail&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> They have always been very pliable so after adding fake nails</li>
            <li> Now I use it as a base coat and top coat with polish.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the brush doesn&#x27;t reach the bottom of the bottle and it gets thick after several weeks</li>
            <li> ( they used low &amp; slow settings for me still never stopped my nail bed from hurting)</li>
            <li> I used it everyday til the bottle was empty.</li>
            <li> Yes, file them down.</li>
            <li> i still haven&#x27;t found anything to help me grow strong nails :(</li>
            <li> I was taking birth control for about 4 years and noticed that not long after starting birth control that my nails had become very thin, almost like paper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so weird, I actually have to cut them back at times!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference in the strength of my nails</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life my nails started breaking and were weak and thin.  </li>
            <li> I used it as a treatment at first following the directions then transitioned to using it as a base coat.</li>
            <li> I put in on my little stubs of a nail and</li>
            <li> My nails have had little improvement even while taking a folic acid supplement.</li>
            <li> I now have to file my nails down!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on nail products, but finally gave up, thinking there was just something wrong with me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to improve my nails including taking 5000 mcg biotin everyday and nothing has made a noticeable difference until I read a review on this product and tried it for myself!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month.</li>
            <li> so I used my hands a lot, opening and lifting every day, often heavy items.</li>
            <li> You have to be faithful about applying it each day and removing it after a few days to start the process over again.</li>
            <li> And Two- A few days after I stopped using the product (ran out)</li>
            <li> My nails have always been short and thin and tend to split and peel.  </li>
            <li> and now I still put it on everyday.</li>
            <li> They become firm and grow faster within a week.  </li>
            <li> I am dealing with a few health issues.  </li>
            <li> First I eat my nails, that was so bad.  </li>
            <li> It is for soft, peeling, weak, or thin nails that have not responded satisfactorily to the Formula 2 treatment.</li>
            <li> Before this product I wan never able to grow my nails out.</li>
            <li> My nails have chipped and broken off for the last 10 years at least.</li>
            <li> Little to my knowledge I DID!</li>
            <li> and I can maintain with very little effort.</li>
            <li> but these are small annoyances compared to the money I&#x27;m saving by not going to the nail salon.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that the product could have any lasting effect, once it was removed or wore off my nails, but the hardening effect persists after I remove the polish.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it comes in tiny 0.25 fl.</li>
            <li> NO peeling, even with the tips grown out past the tip of my fingers.  </li>
            <li> No more splits either.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure how/</li>
            <li> Could have probably done just as well with one of the ordinary product lines out there.</li>
            <li> so I usually order online.  </li>
            <li> I went to a doctor(different from my usual) and explained to her that I had noticed these changes in my nails and hair and wondered if I had a deficiency.</li>
            <li> I have very thin nails that bend and tear, even if I keep them relatively short.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I canâ€™t go without polish, as the tearing will be worse.</li>
            <li> I am actually amazed how it transformed my nails from paper thin to very hard!  </li>
            <li> made my nails too hard and brittle.  </li>
            <li> my nails remainl hard.</li>
            <li> so I was afraid my nails would revert back...</li>
            <li> when it gets too thick, you can peel it off.  </li>
            <li> I was not able to grow nails because they were too weak &amp; brittle.  </li>
            <li> For a week, I was unable to use the product due to traveling (I forgot to pack it)</li>
            <li> I went to the nailtiques web page and decided to go for the extra umph since i felt my nails were in just that bad of a shape.</li>
            <li> finally stopped and decided to just deal with having ugly nails.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what was wrong since this hadn&#x27;t been a common problem of mine in the past, so I tried Sally Hansen nail growth and Essie&#x27;s grow stronger.</li>
            <li> I bought this due to the crazy extent of peeling on my fingernails and even my toenails.  </li>
            <li> but it definitely does what it says it does and would recommend this to anyone who suffers from paper thin nails!</li>
            <li> I have always had weak nails that peeled.  </li>
            <li> As a healthcare provider, I wash my hands dozens of times each day, which may contribute to my difficulty with my weak nails.</li>
            <li> I had weak nails, which often broke.  </li>
            <li> No more drills or fake nails for me.</li>
            <li> My nails are stronger and the worst nail has stop splitting down the middle.</li>
            <li> I have always had weak, thin nails.</li>
            <li> This is SO MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE than salon manicures!</li>
            <li> I use this as my base coat and it makes my manicure last almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I use a base coat, a french manicure, one coat of Nailtiques Formula 2  </li>
            <li> The problem is that they are paper thin.</li>
            <li> Last summer I suffered a terrible illness, and as I recovered I developed a painful condition called onycholysis.  </li>
            <li> my situation got worse.  </li>
            <li> one more thing, my nails were so thin the worst part of me visiting the nail salon was the nail drill, just painful.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working on my really thin nails.</li>
            <li> My nails have always been thin and would break when they would grow out which bummed me out.</li>
            <li> Years of acrylics made them worse.</li>
            <li> After quitting biting my nails, my nails kept peeling and were paper thin.</li>
            <li> My profession bans false nails</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very subtle.</li>
            <li> After stopping use of the product nails went back to their ugly self&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I had very weak nails and lots of ridges in my thumbnails.  </li>
            <li> I have very weak nails.  </li>
            <li> less expensive and time consuming than getting those ugly fake ones!</li>
            <li> and now I apply it randomly</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that brand made my nails even worse!  </li>
            <li> and I did not want the fake ones...</li>
            <li> My theory was that if my nails were stronger, then at least it would provide some protection for my bloody, painful fingers.  </li>
            <li> It helped me a lot after I removed my artificial nails.</li>
            <li> After having gel nail polish scraped off my nails a few times, they were in terrible condition.</li>
            <li> I have awful, paper thin, brittle, peeling, chipping nails!</li>
            <li> Yes horrible and scary.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used color polish with it as the base coat yet</li>
            <li> I use as base coat.</li>
            <li> so now i just use it as base coat when i paint my nails.</li>
            <li> I use this as a base coat if I color my nails, and always have it on anyway.</li>
            <li> I am going to try to use it as a base coat and nail polish over to see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait to buy this product as you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have always had horrible peeling nails and have tried every product on the market.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible nails, from having acrylic.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome product!!!! I am finally getting my nails back from years of acrylic damage.  I use this as my base coat and it makes my manicure last almost 2 weeks. I also put it underneath the nail and it makes them virtually indestructible.</li>
            <li> This product seems to peel which is why I purchased this product to begin with....my nails were peeling and this product was to help but it seems to peel too.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I actually had 10 nails all at the same time using this stuff!  My nails are very brittle and always split vertically.  I thought I would give this a try.  I put in on my little stubs of a nail and within 2 weeks I had stong, long nails.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> This will give you strong, beautiful nails. I took my acrylic nails off some time ago and discovered I can grow my own long nails with Nailtiques. I used it every day as directed for three months with no nail polish to get my nails healthy. Now I use it as a base coat and top coat with polish. I am a believer! I have gorgeous natural nails thanks to Nailtique! My only complaint is the brush doesn&#x27;t reach the bottom of the bottle and it gets thick after several weeks but these are small annoyances compared to the money I&#x27;m saving by not going to the nail salon. Don&#x27;t wait to buy this product as you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This product is great!</li>
            <li> Works well to strength my nails.</li>
            <li> Still waiting for the results I was expecting but it my nails were a mess after a short time using acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> I have always had horrible peeling nails and have tried every product on the market.  This is the only product that has ever worked for me.  I use a base coat, a french manicure, one coat of Nailtiques Formula 2  Plus and a quick dry top coat.  Every other day I add another coat of Formula 2 Plus and top coat.  The manicure should last at least 10 days.</li>
            <li> Nothing better in the world for problem nails!  I finally am getting my nails back when nothing else - even the more expensive products did not work!</li>
            <li> the only one I buy...been using for almost a year...love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to grow long nails.  This product really works... yay.  My nails are actually too long now -- I&#x27;d better go file them down.  Bye...</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this since it was such a small bottle for $9, but it was completely worth it and I&#x27;m already on my third bottle. I had spent so much money on every Sally Hanson nail product and none of them fixed my nails. My nails had been peeling for the last couple years and as soon as they grew past my fingertip, they would break. I started to see an improvement in my nails after 2 weeks of using this. I used it exactly as directed. Every week that went by, I noticed fewer &amp; fewer of my nails were peeling. After a month, none of them were peeling. After a couple months, my nails looked so much better. Now it&#x27;s been 8 months and my nails are beautiful. The tips are white, they are strong and I actually have to clip them because they grow too long now. Just make sure you use it daily as instructed. I wear only this during the week and then I put color on top of it on the weekends.</li>
            <li> Hmmm. Not so sure. This product has definitely helped my nails a bit- they seem to grow faster and stronger, but I still have quite a bit of peeling. I will continue use and report back if it improves. Would probably be ideal for those looking for faster growth and stronger nails, but without the peeling issue.</li>
            <li> Arrived when expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had the strongest nails but in recent months, my nails turned very brittle. They kept cracking and peeling and I was constantly having to trim them to avoid my nails getting snagged on everything. I didn&#x27;t know what was wrong since this hadn&#x27;t been a common problem of mine in the past, so I tried Sally Hansen nail growth and Essie&#x27;s grow stronger. Still, my nails would crack and peel. I started taking vitamins but realized the vitamins only help with the new growth of my nail, so the ends were still weak and splitting.I kept thinking with time, the problem would go away but after about 3 months, I started looking for other products on Amazon and reading reviews. I came across the great reviews for Nailtiques Formula 2, but I&#x27;d read that it takes like 3 weeks and thought that&#x27;s a long time for something to work! I finally just purchased it and tried it. After a week, I didn&#x27;t really see a significant difference and I had to trim my nails again to avoid snagging. After week 2, I noticed there wasn&#x27;t as much peeling and by week 3, I was able to grow my nails out just a little bit but I still needed enough growth to be able to trim off the parts that had peeled back. This formula really works- apparently, there is protein in the polish so it&#x27;s being directly applied to your nails for absorption. Makes sense that it would work. Each week, I just cleaned off the left over polish and applied a new layer. My nails are back to being healthy like before. Love it when a product actually works!!</li>
            <li> I have had fragile nails my entire life.  This is the first product I have found that seems to actually work for me!  As I type this I have 10! beautiful nails all at the same time!  This is SO MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE than salon manicures!</li>
            <li> I have awful, paper thin, brittle, peeling, chipping nails! I&#x27;ve tried everything to improve my nails including taking 5000 mcg biotin everyday and nothing has made a noticeable difference until I read a review on this product and tried it for myself!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month. I started by applying daily and now I apply it randomly but about 3+ times a week. I&#x27;m surprised at how slow my nails have been growing since I&#x27;ve started using this product but they are so strong, smooth, and beautiful. My tips are solid white (no see-through and splotchy like before).&lt;br /&gt;I work retail so I used my hands a lot, opening and lifting every day, often heavy items. I also do not have a dishwasher and latex gloves creep me out so I wash my dishes with bare hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has really held up and made a huge difference! It is also extremely easy to remove with non-acetone (and therefore gentle!) remover. I haven&#x27;t used color polish with it as the base coat yet but it&#x27;s supposed to make the color come off just as easily. Great product!</li>
            <li> This product helps protect my nails from breaking</li>
            <li> I bought this at ulta so it won&#x27;t show verified purchase.  I bought this due to the crazy extent of peeling on my fingernails and even my toenails.  I definitely saw some improvement  in the peeling after a couple of weeks but it wasn&#x27;t the miracle I had hoped for because I am impatient.  BUT several months later I can tell my nails are much much stronger and are not peeling at all.  Don&#x27;t get discouraged from weeks 2-3.  Stay with it and give it a couple months before you make a final decision.  I am now very happy with this.</li>
            <li> Great price and great product.</li>
            <li> Nailtiques 2 plus is the only product I found to make my thin split frail nails strong again. It Truly works. You have to be faithful about applying it each day and removing it after a few days to start the process over again. In just a week or so, you will see improvement in your nails.</li>
            <li> So glad I tried this because it literally makes my polish last for 2 weeks.  You do need to apply daily (or at least every other day) but it doesn&#x27;t take much time at all and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> This formula heals and seals my nails. I use as base coat. Then as top coat. My polish stays on better and doesn&#x27;t chip. My nails have stopped breaking too.</li>
            <li> This is the first nail hardener I have ever used that actually worked. I have very soft nails that break easily. I never had long nails until I used nailtiques formula 2 plus. After using my nails don&#x27;t break that easily and is a lot stronger. This is a great product and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love Nailtiques, My nail became weak and always splitting due to artificial nail&#x27;s. Been using for about 5 month&#x27;s now and my nail&#x27;s are getting stronger.  Good product!</li>
            <li> I have very thin nails that bend and tear, even if I keep them relatively short. I canâ€™t keep polish on them for more than a couple of days, because the nails bend, causing the polish to flake off. On the other hand, I canâ€™t go without polish, as the tearing will be worse. Iâ€™ve been using Nail Tek Xtra for about ten years. Several coats extend the length of my manicures by a couple of days. But Nail Tek is a knock-off of Nailtiques protein formulas, so I wondered if I should try the original. I tried the Formula 2 Plus, because the description seemed comparable to Nail Tek Xtra. It is for soft, peeling, weak, or thin nails that have not responded satisfactorily to the Formula 2 treatment. Instructions say to apply one coat daily. It can be used as a basecoat, but it is not recommended to put polish on top for the initial treatment. I usually apply three coats and top that with color or top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upshot is that Nailtiques Formula 2 Plus works better than the knock-off Nail Tek product. My manicures are lasting longer. My nails arenâ€™t bending nearly as much. Now, when my nails grow out, they are not tearing before I get around to trimming them. There is still some fraying on the sides of the nails, where they are thinnest. But there is remarkable improvement. My nails have always grown fast. The problem is that they are paper thin. Now I look down to find that my nails have gotten too long! I was skeptical that the product could have any lasting effect, once it was removed or wore off my nails, but the hardening effect persists after I remove the polish. Nailtiques Formula 2 Plus yellows after two weeks on my nails, by the way. But it does wonders. Unfortunately, it comes in tiny 0.25 fl. oz. (7 ml) bottles that are four times the price per ounce of the inferior Nail Tek knock-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients are: Ethyl Acetate, Butyl Acetate, Nitrocellulose, Tosylamide Formaldehyde Resin, Isopropyl Alcohol, Acrylates Copolymer, Epoxidized Soybean Oil, Wheat Amino Acids, Calcium Pantothenate, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Gelatin, Benzophenone-1, Etocrylene, Formalin, Violet 2/Cl 60725, Dimethicone., Calcium Pantothenate, Hydrolyzed Keratin, Gelatin, Benzophenone-1, Etocrylene, Formalin, Violet 2/Cl 60725, Dimethicone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it&#x27;s great!  I&#x27;m a nurse and the hand washing takes it&#x27;s toll on both hands and nails.  My nails peel and crack if I stop using this product for any length of time.  The price sure beats having your nails done.  My profession bans false nails so I&#x27;ve never tried that.  This product makes the nails stronger so they don&#x27;t break every time you hit them.  I really like buying it online so I don&#x27;t have to fight the busy parking lot at the store that carries it.</li>
            <li> I had very weak nails and lots of ridges in my thumbnails.  My nails are now strong and the ridges in my thumbs are almost gone.</li>
            <li> This stuff does work. But, I had to apply it daily. After stopping use of the product nails went back to their ugly self&#x27;s! So as long as you apply it, it works! It cost me about $12 a month for it, I always got it from Walgreens. I liked that it dried fast. Also made the white of my nails very white.</li>
            <li> You have to keep using it for the effects to last but it is the only thing that worked on my dry brittle hideous nails.  They were chipped off to the quick when I started!  After using it a couple of weeks I actually had nails again.</li>
            <li> This stuff does an amazing job on pretty fragile nails.</li>
            <li> As a avid nail polish addict, I have tried everything under the sun to get my nails in shape. They will grow and aren&#x27;t super thin. But oh boy do they peel!! I have tried MANY other name brands, gone to nail tech&#x27;s and tried drugstore varieties. Nothing worked. Until now. This product is absolutely amazing. Within a week my nails were longer than they had ever been and no peeling or breaking in sight! Magic in a bottle for my poor nails. I used it as a treatment at first following the directions then transitioned to using it as a base coat. There are only two cons I found. One- The price for such a SMALL bottle. And Two- A few days after I stopped using the product (ran out) my nails immediately started peeling. But I would definitely repurchase in the future and recommend to anyone with problem nails.</li>
            <li> There are not enough STARS to give this amazing product!  I have always had weak nails that peeled.  I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on nail products, but finally gave up, thinking there was just something wrong with me.  Last summer I suffered a terrible illness, and as I recovered I developed a painful condition called onycholysis.  My nails began separating from the nail bed due to the shock to my system.  According to my MD and dermatologist, it is irreversible.  And it HURTS!  It feels like your nails have been torn into the quick.  And then the nails fall off and you have no protection.  I researched, found there is no cure, BUT I decided to give this a chance.  My theory was that if my nails were stronger, then at least it would provide some protection for my bloody, painful fingers.  In just a week or two the nails seemed stronger.  Now, after 2 months my nails are growing!  The new nail is adhering beautifully to the nail bed, allowing me to trim the old, damaged nails off.  PLUS there is NO MORE peeling, just strong, healthy nails.  The product says it does NOT claim to cure onycholysis.  But I claim that it does! AND I still have half a bottle left of the 2 plus. I say a BIG THANK YOU to the company and I believe THIS product is a bargain at a 100 times the price!</li>
            <li> Cute and works nicely</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time. My nails are much stronger, healthier and it&#x27;s easy to use. Dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> If you have shabby nails, this stuff will change that. I always end up taking a break from it, because it causes my nails to grow way too long and I can&#x27;t manage long nails. Regular Formula 2 works just as well as plus, if not better.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff!  I have tried for years to find a product that would strengthen my nails and keep them from peeling.  My nails have always been short and thin and tend to split and peel.  Even when I could grow them out, they would start splitting at the ends and then, like dominoes, they all fell apart.  Not with this product!  After about 2 weeks of use, my nails showed a definite improvement and were no longer peeling.  The first 2 weeks, I used it every single day, religiously, applying one coat on top of another and removing it and starting over after about every five days.  Now have been using it for about one month.  My nails are all long and very strong!  NO peeling, even with the tips grown out past the tip of my fingers.  I am using it every other day or every third day, still one coat on top of another each use, then removing and starting all over.  I don&#x27;t know what smell people are complaining about.  It smells similar to all other nail products as far as I can tell. It doesn&#x27;t burn at all, but then, I&#x27;m not applying it on top of nail beds that have had artificial nails on them.  As a healthcare provider, I wash my hands dozens of times each day, which may contribute to my difficulty with my weak nails. My nails are now looking natural and beautiful, and are super strong. This will definitely be a staple for me.</li>
            <li> wonderful product, highly recommend</li>
            <li> made my nails too hard and brittle.  Should have stuck with regular Nailtiques Formula 2</li>
            <li> Just okay.  Kind of expensive for what it is, it peels off like any other clear top coat. Would not buy again</li>
            <li> I hope to see some results with nail growth soon. So far I like it.....</li>
            <li> I was using the Nailtiques Formula 2 with great success and thought the plus would be that much better.  It peels off my nails so I&#x27;m going back to the regular formula.</li>
            <li> This product really works. I have nails that sometimes peel or get brittle. This formula, applied as directed, helps my nails grow long and strong, I love this little size, too, cuz I use it up before it can get sticky.</li>
            <li> This is the only nail formula I ever tried that actually worked. I have had long nails that need to be filed regularly for the first time in my life. I had acrylics for years that damaged them and I thought I&#x27;d never see a real nail. Nailtiques does what it says and it does it well. You have to apply it every day but it dries almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;I started using it back in December and my nail bed has \\&quot;grown\\&quot; as well. The whites of my nails are closer to the tip of my finger than before. This stuff is magic. Both my daughter and my  son&#x27;s girlfriend have been poaching my bottle and both have seen noticeable growth and strength. I highly recommend Nailtiques, it&#x27;s excellent!</li>
            <li> Regular use really made my nails stronger and protected against chipping. The only downside is that this is not to be used with colored polish, and my nails get weaker as soon as I stop using this and expose them to regular nail polish, remover, etc.</li>
            <li> This formula has given me the gift of fingernails.  I was not able to grow nails because they were too weak &amp; brittle.  After Using this product daily, I have pretty enough nails to paint.</li>
            <li> I think this nailtiques is a great product.  I have been looking for a product like this for years.  It is wonderful.  I have just been using it for a week and my nails look better already.  They are not splitting or peeling now.  I think another week or two I will be able to really tell  a difference.</li>
            <li> I have extremely paper thin natural nails that are see-thru. I started using this product two weeks ago and my nails are hard, strong, and rarely break. If they break, it&#x27;s because I did something with my nails that I shouldn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> I had weak nails, which often broke.  However, I never had issues with peeling, until I tried this stuff.  It made most of my nails peel, and the others break even more often.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was trying to repair my dry, cracking nails by using another product (Sally Hansen).  Unfortunately, that brand made my nails even worse!  I ended up with white streaks right in the center of my nails.  Switched over to 2 Plus and within two weeks, I saw an improvement.  I&#x27;ll need to grow out all of the nails before the damaged parts are long enough to cut off, but this product saved my nails.  I&#x27;ll switch over to #2 later.</li>
            <li> As I have aged, my nails have become brittle and they peel.  I put two coats of the Nailtiques Formula Plus 2 and my nails have become stronger and they don&#x27;t peel.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> GREAT ITEM.  QUICK DELIVERY.</li>
            <li> Works very well!!! I had acrylics for ten years and took them off... Religiously used this every day and now my nails are hard as well... Nails ;) I switched to formula 2 after the bottle was gone and now I still put it on everyday. I have to cut my nails all the time ... They do not break.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, just as I expected</li>
            <li> I am a 68 year old grandmother and have soft nails my whole life.  I used acrylic nails for years, but it was such a hassle that&lt;br /&gt;I finally stopped and decided to just deal with having ugly nails.  I read about this product on line and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;My nails starting growing and I ended up filing them as they were getting too long.  I just can&#x27;t stop admiring them now.  Try&lt;br /&gt;it.. you&#x27;ll like it.....</li>
            <li> This definitely strengthens your nails! I have super brittle hair and nails that can&#x27;t grow out because they&#x27;re weak and bend and break! However, I can&#x27;t decide it you&#x27;re supposed to remove the layer before reapplying it though... The directions don&#x27;t specify... So after a few days of use it tends to peel off fairly easily due to the extra thickness. 2 days worth works well without removing in between!</li>
            <li> Gel nail polish ruined my nails. Someone recommended this product to me however it did not work. Plain clear nail polish works better v</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the nail strengthener.Great Product!! I will probably order more. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I have found that works on my nails.  My nails were always splitting, tearing and breaking.  Could never get them to grow to any length.  With the Nailiques Formula 2 Plus I have nails that look nice and I can maintain with very little effort.</li>
            <li> I have problem nails.  Until Nailtique nothing worked for me.  Now it is the only nail product I will use.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target out of sheer desperation so glad I did. Its a fantastic strengthener! In no time my nails were stronger. They no longer peeled or chipped. No more splits either. I have tried a lot of other products on the market and this one out shines them all. Will purchase again and again!</li>
            <li> Nailtiques Formula 2 Plus is a fantastic product.  watch the size you are ordering - I did not pay attention &amp; it was smaller than I realized.  The product seems to go a long way, it drys quickly and has really made a difference in the strength of my nails.  I will purchase again once I run out!!</li>
            <li> this product was recommended to me years ago by a co- worker. i use to get acrylic nails because my own nails were too thin &amp; weak, so they easily broke off, tore, &amp; split. They have always been very pliable so after adding fake nails my situation got worse.  i could not find nailtiques in my area so i never purchased it until now. i  been using this daily on my nails for bout a month now and i already have stronger, longer nails. my fingernails dont split from the side or tip anymore. i completely remove the product about every four days or when ever i notice the polish starts to wear off. i havent applied any color polish yet on top of the clear yet because i didnt want anything to effect the results. i have noticed its more beneficial to try and apply a thin coat verse thick layer each day cause it last longer. i had thought  a thicker layer would make my nails thicker but there is no need because each layer added bonds to the last layer. i&#x27;m not sure how/why, but when i remove my nail polish (to reapply fresh coat) my nails remainl hard.This is the most money i ever spent on nail polish &amp; i didnt want to buy it, especially because its such a small amount. I read a lot of the reviews and with a recommendation i figured its worth a shot. this product exceeds my expectations because i didn&#x27;t think it would work. one more thing, my nails were so thin the worst part of me visiting the nail salon was the nail drill, just painful.( they used low &amp; slow settings for me still never stopped my nail bed from hurting) No more drills or fake nails for me.</li>
            <li> This is amazing and works wonders. Due to meds I take my nails would never grow and would split and chip....now I have to cut them back weekly!  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This did nothing to improve my peeling nails others said it worked great for them which is why I bought it, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Nailtiques 2 Plus is the only thing that has ever fixed my weak, peeling nails. The only catch is that it took about two months of use to see results. But it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> This actually works!  After about 5 applications, my nails were noticeably harder.  I usually have soft, bendy, peeling nails.  This changed all that.  A big plus is my polish lasts so much longer because my nails aren&#x27;t bending all the time.</li>
            <li> A like pricey but product really works!!! Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> the process is kind of tedious but it works very well</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of nail products that promise to give me harder, stronger, and longer nails. I always return to Nailtiques. I have nails that take forever to grow and peel at the tips. It seems so stupid to shell out this much cash for such a teeny tiny bottle of clear polish. I test out a new Nail Aid (works better than you think) or a new Sally Hansen product. Waste of cash, I should just realize that Nailtiques is the best product for me.</li>
            <li> I had always had weak,peeling nails which seldom grew any length,  After finding nailtiques my biggest problem is keeping them short enough so that they are not claws getting in my way.  I have recommended to several friends already and they like the polish too.</li>
            <li> Forever I have not been able to have decent nails and I did not want the fake ones...finally I am starting to get longer pretty *real* nails!  I even received a compliment about how nice they look from a customer. Go a head, try this product...less expensive and time consuming than getting those ugly fake ones!</li>
            <li> Before this product I wan never able to grow my nails out. They would break easily, peel, and bend. I used it everyday til the bottle was empty. Now there is no peeling, they are less bendy, and I&#x27;ve only had three breaks. My nails are the longest they have ever been.</li>
            <li> Love it. It seems to be working on my really thin nails. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have had splitting and soft nails all my life until this products. Tried it before with no luck but did not follow the directions ot put a coat a day on. They should have directions on the bottle!</li>
            <li> I have tried about everything to grow my nails. My nails would just peel and break all the time and they would just hurt. I ended up getting acrylic nails for about a year and that only helped when I had them on. I have tried oils, and OPI products but nothing worked. I have used this for a couple months now and my nails have not broken once! They are stronger than I have ever seen them and are really long. ABSOLUTELY recommend this product. If it can help my nails then it can help anyone&#x27;s!!!!</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews both pro and con i decided to take a leap of faith and try it out. My nails have always been thin and would break when they would grow out which bummed me out. I went to the nailtiques web page and decided to go for the extra umph since i felt my nails were in just that bad of a shape. Ive used it for almost a month now and its been amazing. I used it for 2 weeks without color just the nailtiques. The first day i would apply two coats and then after 5 days i would remove it and start again with two and so on. My nails have grown and are much stronger so now i just use it as base coat when i paint my nails. I will try to work into atleast once every month or two just do the treatment just to keep my nails strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con i would say is the price. For the tiny bottle you get it is a bit of a splurge but its something i would recommend in taking the dive and trying it.</li>
            <li> Perfect just as described! it got here very fast also a++++</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product to help me stop picking at my nails. Its done a fantastic job. After the first week, my nails started to get harder. They barely bend when I push on them now. I use this as a base coat if I color my nails, and always have it on anyway. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always has brittle, peeling nails. Years of acrylics made them worse. I started with Formula 1, but that made no difference at all. I&#x27;ve been using Formula 2 Plus as directed for 3 months and I am finally starting to see a difference. My nails are stronger and the worst nail has stop splitting down the middle. I am going to try to use it as a base coat and nail polish over to see how it goes. If you&#x27;re are willing to hang in there for several months, it does work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any better product on the market today to grow long and strong nails.  I used to use this product years ago and loved it back then.  Nailtiques is just as good today as it was back then.  What a great product.</li>
            <li> I have terrible nails, from having acrylic. Nails for over 25 years.  This product helps so much.  All are growing again without breaking, I still have problems with 2 of them, but, they are coming along, and will be fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and it really works! I usually get the larger size, .5 fl oz, but I suppose I had a senior moment. In any case, this really assists in keeping my nails strong and healthy. It helped me a lot after I removed my artificial nails. It&#x27;s not a overnight fix but in the long run, it really helped me through process of getting my nails looking decent again. I&#x27;ve found the pricing is better here on Amazon, as I used to purchase it at beauty supply stores. I recommend Nailtiques!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried doing a lot of guitar playing with my nails yet, but they definitely feel stronger. Even the ones that were peeling before.</li>
            <li> This stuff transforms your nails.  They become firm and grow faster within a week.  I can&#x27;t live without this stuff anymore.</li>
            <li> Its taking a while but it does work</li>
            <li> Great product. This formula treats nails that are naturally soft, peeling, split or just won&#x27;t grow. The protein immediately acts to help bond nails that are splitting or peeling. It also assists in strengthening the nail to grow long, strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing! I swear by it and I&#x27;ve been talking it up to everyone I know.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to using the formula I&#x27;ve been taking a Nail, Hair and Skin supplement from Costco. Some of you might be thinking that my nails are growing because of the supplement and you&#x27;re probably right to a certain extent. However, if you have nails like mine that split and break just as fast as they grow, the supplement you take doesn&#x27;t matter. I use this formula religiously. I take it off about every 7 to 8 days (regular remover works fine) for a just day and then put new coats right back on (especially in dry weather).&lt;br /&gt;I have beautiful nails for the first time in my LIFE and I&#x27;m 57. Friends and co-workers are actually commenting how nice they look. It&#x27;s so weird, I actually have to cut them back at times! I&#x27;m loving it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wish I could buy it in bigger sizes.</li>
            <li> Must buy if used regularly will have tout nail nice &amp; long... Very nice product I sure recommend it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything special, especially for the price.  Could have probably done just as well with one of the ordinary product lines out there.</li>
            <li> For about five years in the early 90&#x27;s --and for no reason--my fingernails peeled and split. I was embarrassed to show my hands in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Then, in 2006 I bought several products at the same time (once again) that promised to solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is, in my opinion, a miracle. I have long, extremely strong nails that I simply put one coat of Nailtiques on every morning. It dries quickly--I do it while checking email in the morning--and when it gets too thick, you can peel it off.  (That&#x27;s a good thing for fidgety people like me!) Last week I actually had to file my nails down because they were getting too long....</li>
            <li> I have never been able to grow my own nails until I started using Nailtiques and now I have  my own nails, they are strong&lt;br /&gt;and I love them.  My daughter told me about it, she had bough a smaill bottle at a local drug store and thought it was good and so&lt;br /&gt;I went online to Amazon and ordered it, and I have been ordering it every since. Thanks for a great product. Betty Walker</li>
            <li> First I eat my nails, that was so bad.  With this product they grow strong and perfect. Know I have pretty nails</li>
            <li> Works super well and very quickly, just make sure to follow directions. I work in a restaurant and if it can help keep my nails from breaking and splitting, it should work for most anyone.</li>
            <li> I have used it before and it works for me. This is the first time that my nail have grown.</li>
            <li> does wonders for m nails</li>
            <li> Nailtique products are excellent.</li>
            <li> After quitting biting my nails, my nails kept peeling and were paper thin. I decided to try Nailtiques. The product helped a bit with the peeling but didn&#x27;t strengthen my nails as much as I expected.</li>
            <li> Have helped my peeling, splitting nails alot. Great product.</li>
            <li> No need to read any other review after this. My nails have chipped and broken off for the last 10 years at least. Very week, I&#x27;m talking couldn&#x27;t even make a bed without nail flipping inside out. Yes horrible and scary. I am dealing with a few health issues.  I always felt strong nails are based on nutrition solely, I have absorbency issues. Well, that&#x27;s only half true. This nailtiques not only stopped them from chipping (I was shocked) but keeps the strong enough to gain length. I&#x27;m talking I now have to file my nails down!  Yes, file them down. I don&#x27;t know if this will last long term I just know right now it&#x27;s a miracle worker and I&#x27;m a good measure as nothing would help in the past. Not even intravenous vitamin therapy!  Buy this!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on a recommendation received by a friend to assist in making my nails more healthy and less brittle! Within one week, I could notice a difference! For a week, I was unable to use the product due to traveling (I forgot to pack it) so I was afraid my nails would revert back...not at all!!! Great buy!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, and I am pleased to say that this product actually works!  I am actually amazed how it transformed my nails from paper thin to very hard!  I followed the directions and used consistently until I received the desired effect. I have tried many nail products, and this is the only one that produced results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference in the strength of my nails but it&#x27;s very subtle. I do think it has made my nails grow faster though. I finf myself trimming them more then usual. Good but would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I think this product is amazing and would recommend it to anyone who lives a &amp;#34;normal &amp;#34; life like dealing with everyday things and doesnt sit drinking tea all day as it keeps your nails in excellent condition!</li>
            <li> I have very weak nails.  This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that really works.  The only problem I have is finding it in stores so I usually order online.  Just follow the directions and you&#x27;ll have strong, healthy looking nails.</li>
            <li> I was taking birth control for about 4 years and noticed that not long after starting birth control that my nails had become very thin, almost like paper. My hair also became thinner after about 2 years and fell out all the time. I went to a doctor(different from my usual) and explained to her that I had noticed these changes in my nails and hair and wondered if I had a deficiency. Little to my knowledge I DID! She explained to me that birth control blocks the bodies ability to properly absorb folic acid, which is the main \\&quot;vitamin\\&quot; responsible for healthy skin and nails and which is why my hair and nails became so thin and malnourished. So I stopped taking birth control and have been off of it for about 6 months. My nails have had little improvement even while taking a folic acid supplement. I came across this nail formula in the clearance rack at my walgreens store and thought I would try it. I have been using for about 3 weeks now and have noticed longer nails, there appear to be a bit thicker but than before but still break. I will probably need to use this stuff for about 6 weeks before I really notice anything major but it definitely does what it says it does and would recommend this to anyone who suffers from paper thin nails!</li>
            <li> tiny bottle!! i&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and it hasn&#x27;t helped with peeling at the tip of my nail at all. i still haven&#x27;t found anything to help me grow strong nails :(</li>
            <li> I have always had weak, thin nails. After having gel nail polish scraped off my nails a few times, they were in terrible condition. I tried Nailtiques Formula 2 for several weeks and my nails improved. However after reading reviews I decided the try Formula 2 Plus. I have seen a drastic improved in the strength and length of my nails. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Use as directed and you will have long nails. Nothing but this product has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Good makesnur nails grow a lot</li>
            <li> Priced fairly.  Good product</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life my nails started breaking and were weak and thin.  After reading all the good reviews and having tried a bunch of dud products, I decided to try it.  This is the only one that I have found to work.  Use as directed.  The other day I was able to open a pop top can without breaking the nail!  It&#x27;s been a while since I could do that!!!&lt;br /&gt;I bought the kit: cuticle oil, cuticle cream and the Formula Fix.  The only one I really recommend is the Formula Fix as the product does tend to thicken and this thins it out.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I have thin brittle nails, this works at keeping my nails from breaking and making them much lo get and stronger.</li>
