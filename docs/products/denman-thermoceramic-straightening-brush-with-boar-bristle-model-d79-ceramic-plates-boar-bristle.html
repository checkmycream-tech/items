            <li>First of all the price is excellent.</li>
            <li>i am sure the idea is correct but the materials and the design did not straighten my ethnic  hair  - this product is for finer hair !</li>
            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>it is amazing.</li>
            <li>so it opens on its own</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li>Best item i have ever brought gets my hair nice and straight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to maneuver and store.</li>
            <li>The purchase was also very very smooth.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t remove too many hairs as well when using as well, which makes it hair</li>
            <li>Works better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Love it and will recommend this product.</li>
            <li>probably better use on someone else.</li>
            <li>I get much better results with this brush, no breakage and not as many lost hair.</li>
            <li>I have more curl at the root</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m not that skilled with the blow dryer and brush.</li>
            <li>It worked better that way.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite interesting technology</li>
            <li>This is the best product for hair straightening with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have 4a/afro textured hair (roots natural &amp; ends texturized), and this works great.</li>
            <li>I have no concerns so far, it did a great job smoothing out my hair</li>
            <li>Great for natural hair.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t easy for me to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does not seem to damage my hair.  </li>
            <li>but it is easy to close.</li>
            <li>Works great will do more business in future</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick as we&#x27;ll!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and great results, hair is smooth because of the double sides you don&#x27;t get the frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Would and will buy this again.</li>
            <li>Who needs a huge brush collection, anyway?</li>
            <li>The brush meets all my expectations and is very useful.</li>
            <li>It makes straightening my hair so quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>It Minimizes the time yet creates a more sleek, bone straight style.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t lose so much hair and my hair is more manageable.</li>
            <li>I think this brush is more for people with straight or just wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Love it , very sturdy</li>
            <li>This makes my hair sleek and shiny, most importantly, it looks natural and retains bounce.</li>
            <li>Also I use my dryer on a cooler setting not to damage my hair so the brush never got very hot.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite brush.  </li>
            <li>but I really like it!!</li>
            <li>Not as good as expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m african-american transitioning to natural and was looking for a way to keep tension on my roots while blow drying and this thing just makes more work for me.</li>
            <li>I didnt think it would be that useful</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many straightening brushes of similar design over the years and am quite familiar with them.</li>
            <li>I tried this, and it works effectively with a flat iron as well.</li>
            <li>its Really nessascry to try it out before you ship it,  clean it to where it&#x27;s.not  noticeable.</li>
            <li>It was delivered super fast.</li>
            <li>gets super straight hair</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery</li>
            <li>I am a type 4 natural and this item worked great in aiding my hair straight during the flat iron process from root to tip!!!!</li>
            <li>I use it to hold my hair taut while using my straightener and it works so much better than with just my regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>When i first opened the package i thought i was gonna rip my hair out</li>
            <li>So, you have to use a straightener first, and then brush your hair with this.</li>
            <li>Since your hair is hot, the thermoceramic design will use the heat to help straighten your hair.</li>
            <li>and it worked very well!</li>
            <li>I return to my good ol&#x27; round brush.</li>
            <li>I can see how this would be easy to use if you were styling someone else&#x27;s hair, but I found this tool to be extremely hard to use on my own hair.</li>
            <li>I am able to have the end curl just slightly by positioning it right.</li>
            <li>Your hair becomes very sleek and silky.</li>
            <li>It helps so that I do not have to use the straight iron as much.  </li>
            <li>Got ends straight with one pass.</li>
            <li>As well as the shipping, was very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so much easier to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>not that it really matters</li>
            <li>i do nt know if i really like this brush</li>
            <li>It gets all the hair straight</li>
            <li>This is really cumbersome to use.  </li>
            <li>It works but it rips out hair..and if your trying to get a really straight look then don&#x27;t use this, it gives it to much volume.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the bone straight hair</li>
            <li>My hair is really curly and my ends will stay kinky/curly even after blow drying and ironing for 2 hours and having bone straight roots.</li>
            <li>it is very efficient with the straightener.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really easy to blow dry your hair and get a polished look.</li>
            <li>I hold my hair with the Denman brush in my left hand and follow with my hot iron in the right.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I used this brush with my flat iron for the chase method and it left my hair smooth and straight!</li>
            <li>This brush works very well when heat styling relaxed or natural hair.</li>
            <li>It works better than my round brush to help straighten my hair when I am drying it.  </li>
            <li>but it did get straighter than normal.</li>
            <li>Meant to be brand new.</li>
            <li>It would have been a better product if it functioned like the curling iron or flat iron so that you could use it with dry hair.</li>
            <li>but it helps out alot on straightening natural hair!</li>
            <li>I straighten my hair nearly every day and this cut my time in 1/2!</li>
            <li>The brush split cleanly at the inner inner hinge.</li>
            <li>It works the same as a round bristle brush or a fine tooth comb, except it is much easier to use.</li>
            <li>If you want to spend the time constantly turning the dryer on and off to get the hair ready</li>
            <li>I also think the bristles are too far apart.</li>
            <li>I have to go over a section of my hair multiple time before getting it bone straight like the way I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>took it straight out of the packet and found blonde hair in the bristals of the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old brush, which was identical, broke after 7 years of use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s much easier than using a regular brush while blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li>given it two stars because the cushioned covering did make it comfortable in the hand, and it didn&#x27;t do any worse (or better) than the other ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I mean what girl wouldn&#x27;t love having this brush.</li>
            <li>I use it to straighten my hair while i pass a flat iron through it for a bone straight look.</li>
            <li>I really think it has helped to limit the heat damage because it helps my flat iron to do it thing with one pass.</li>
            <li>I really thought it would be like a curling iron or flat iron with an electic cord.</li>
            <li>This is a easier way to blow dry hair straight with no help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>use it to blow dry my hair straight with a blow dryer and product (leave-in + heat protection serum).</li>
            <li>kinda difficult to use on your self for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>It certainly didn&#x27;t make blow drying my hair as other people have said.</li>
            <li>but I really like the dark colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a spring to pop it open like others do; in order to get it open far enough to hold the section of hair I had to stop drying, then manually pull it open with both hands, then resume drying.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a spring to pop it open like others do; in order to get it open far enough to hold the section of hair I had to stop drying, then manually pull it open with both hands, then resume drying.</li>

            <li> Usually, I can skip the flat iron, because this gets my hair straight with the hand dryer.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of how the brush basically stays open all the time.</li>
            <li> I like how the brush is not that big or wide</li>

            <li> I had no issues with pull out, just the typical few strands that may normally come out from any other brush.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice, but once you get it, there&#x27;s no way back!!!</li>
            <li> I like the brushes intentions and I am partial to Denman products.</li>
            <li> Not really for people with kinky hair.</li>
            <li> So much harder to use then round/straight brush.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times but its just as I expected it would work.  </li>
            <li> It helps me to dry my hair straighter, than with a round brush.  </li>
            <li> im a dark burnette</li>
            <li> I gave it a few tries and gave up</li>
            <li> Part of my problem is that I found it harder to use than a round bristle brush.</li>
            <li> I can use it without having to put it down between sections.  </li>
            <li> All my other brushes of this type had a spring in them that popped them open (this also does not have a locking button -- it came with a thin pony tail elastic around it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it holds the hair tight</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using brushes like this one on my hair for a few years now.</li>
            <li> am considering buying a few of these and using them as stocking stuffers at Christmas.</li>
            <li> and I do not like a round brush because I tend to get my hair tangled in it.</li>
            <li> I only used it once and my poor hair started falling off as I was doing my hair.</li>
            <li> Expensive, Barely know how to use it.</li>
            <li> My previous brush lasted 7 years, so it is very disappointing that this one lasted such a short time.</li>
            <li> No more burnt hand.</li>
            <li> A hard grip does not need to be used at all.</li>
            <li> Also not as hard on the hair as a straightener</li>
            <li> The bristles are too hard for my hair, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this brush for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> of which I am disappointed because I have only owned it for about 10 months.</li>
            <li> but it also made my hand holding the brush tired.</li>
            <li> and it can be somewhat difficult to remove thick hair from the brush after use.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use it to assist in flat ironing my hair. It Minimizes the time yet creates a more sleek, bone straight style. I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well when heat styling relaxed or natural hair. Your hair becomes very sleek and silky.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t easy for me to use. I need 1 hand to hold the dryer,1 hand to hold the brush and 1 hand to get smaller sections of hair. Also I use my dryer on a cooler setting not to damage my hair so the brush never got very hot. If you want to spend the time constantly turning the dryer on and off to get the hair ready it holds the hair tight but it also made my hand holding the brush tired. This could all be that I have the wrong technic using it.</li>
            <li> I have 4a/afro textured hair (roots natural &amp; ends texturized), and this works great. I like this better than round brushes, because I am not ambidextrous, and it is hard to curve the round brush while drying the hair. This is a easier way to blow dry hair straight with no help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to blow dry my hair straight with a blow dryer and product (leave-in + heat protection serum). It works the same as a round bristle brush or a fine tooth comb, except it is much easier to use. It takes a few strokes to get the hang of it (use brush in one hand, hand dryer in other) but it gets my hair sleek shiny and straight. A hard grip does not need to be used at all. It doesn&#x27;t remove too many hairs as well when using as well, which makes it hair friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other people use it when flat ironing, to get the hair taught. I tried this, and it works effectively with a flat iron as well. Usually, I can skip the flat iron, because this gets my hair straight with the hand dryer.</li>
            <li> Works better than I thought it would. Easy to use and great results, hair is smooth because of the double sides you don&#x27;t get the frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Would and will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I can see how this would be easy to use if you were styling someone else&#x27;s hair, but I found this tool to be extremely hard to use on my own hair. I don&#x27;t ever use it. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using brushes like this one on my hair for a few years now. I&#x27;m not really a fan of how the brush basically stays open all the time. I also think the bristles are too far apart. I have to go over a section of my hair multiple time before getting it bone straight like the way I&#x27;m used to. It&#x27;s very easy to maneuver and store.</li>
            <li> Only used it twice...then it just fell apart</li>
            <li> Must. Say I&#x27;m. Disappointed to. Find several strands of hair in a product that&#x27;s. Meant to be brand new. took it straight out of the packet and found blonde hair in the bristals of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;. im a dark burnette .if its Really nessascry to try it out before you ship it,  clean it to where it&#x27;s.not  noticeable.</li>
            <li> Great product, helps in the straightening process. No straightener needed if used correctly</li>
            <li> Expensive, Barely know how to use it.</li>
            <li> I am a type 4 natural and this item worked great in aiding my hair straight during the flat iron process from root to tip!!!! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> False advertising ... nothing ceramic about these .. plastic with metal plate inside. No ceramic at all.</li>
            <li> It helps me to dry my hair straighter, than with a round brush.  Also not as hard on the hair as a straightener</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite brush.  It works better than my round brush to help straighten my hair when I am drying it.  It is easy to use and does not seem to damage my hair.  It helps so that I do not have to use the straight iron as much.  I can use it without having to put it down between sections.  There is a spring so it opens on its own but it is easy to close.</li>
            <li> Not as good as expected.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well blow drying. Hair was caught inside and ends were still curly. Had to use a blow dryer with a comb attachment. But worked well with the flat iron. Got ends straight with one pass.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t get it. I&#x27;m african-american transitioning to natural and was looking for a way to keep tension on my roots while blow drying and this thing just makes more work for me. I&#x27;d rather blowout my &#x27;fro and flat iron it than try and use this contraption. Sorry but this was a no for me.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome.  It makes straightening my hair so quick and easy.  I hold my hair with the Denman brush in my left hand and follow with my hot iron in the right.  No more burnt hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many straightening brushes of similar design over the years and am quite familiar with them. I was disappointed with this brush for several reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a spring to pop it open like others do; in order to get it open far enough to hold the section of hair I had to stop drying, then manually pull it open with both hands, then resume drying. All my other brushes of this type had a spring in them that popped them open (this also does not have a locking button -- it came with a thin pony tail elastic around it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this I found it cumbersome to hold and ineffective for the job it&#x27;s designed to do. Because of having to constantly stop and start as mentioned above, it actually added quite a bit of time to the daily regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given it two stars because the cushioned covering did make it comfortable in the hand, and it didn&#x27;t do any worse (or better) than the other ones I&#x27;ve used. However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was delivered super fast. It was everything a girl like me (curly, frizzy, unruly, unmanageable hair) was looking for. Love it and will recommend this product. It takes a little practice, but once you get it, there&#x27;s no way back!!!</li>
            <li> I got this brush last year in December. I used a lot and it did a good job with my hair. A couple months ago it suddenly broke.</li>
            <li> I received this Denman Thermoceramic Straightening Brush with Boar Bristles this afternoon. And I have to say it is a very good purchase. First of all the price is excellent. As well as the shipping, was very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this brush it is amazing. I use it to hold my hair taut while using my straightener and it works so much better than with just my regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am considering buying a few of these and using them as stocking stuffers at Christmas. I mean what girl wouldn&#x27;t love having this brush. It makes my hair so much easier to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also not that it really matters but I really like the dark colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent purchase, if you straighten your hair, buy this you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I like the brushes intentions and I am partial to Denman products. Mine&#x27;s broke into two because of the spring in it of which I am disappointed because I have only owned it for about 10 months.</li>
            <li> kinda difficult to use on your self for it to be effective. probably better use on someone else. so I gave three stars</li>
            <li> i do nt know if i really like this brush i am sure the idea is correct but the materials and the design did not straighten my ethnic  hair  - this product is for finer hair !</li>
            <li> Too rough on the hair :-(</li>
            <li> works great does straighten my hair</li>
            <li> Great price, great product! The brush meets all my expectations and is very useful. Shipping was quick as we&#x27;ll! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I have ever used! I have waist length wavy hair of medium thickness and I do not like a round brush because I tend to get my hair tangled in it. I get much better results with this brush, no breakage and not as many lost hair. My old brush, which was identical, broke after 7 years of use.&lt;br /&gt;I semi dry my hair, use a straightening product and then use this brush on sections of hair to finish the hairstyle. I have more curl at the root and I have never found another brush that straightens it quite as well. I am able to have the end curl just slightly by positioning it right. I do not need a flat iron after I have used it. This makes my hair sleek and shiny, most importantly, it looks natural and retains bounce. Not lifeless like with a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;For the times I do use a flat iron, I use this brush to guide the iron. It gets all the hair straight and I do not have to use the flat iron multiple times on the same section. Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I didnt think it would be that useful but it helps out alot on straightening natural hair! the shipping was great too!</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair nearly every day and this cut my time in 1/2!</li>
            <li> Great item. Performs well. I got really good results! Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is really cumbersome to use.  I gave it a few tries and gave up</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times but its just as I expected it would work.  It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to replace one that I had for years that broke.  It does a good job straighening hair without adding poof.</li>
            <li> Works great will do more business in future thank you</li>
            <li> It works but it rips out hair..and if your trying to get a really straight look then don&#x27;t use this, it gives it to much volume.</li>
            <li> I hated this brush. I ended up trashing it or returning it. I found it useless. I got a much smoother look using my round bristle brush. I hoped it would have the same results for me that using a flat iron would have, but it didn&#x27;t work for my hair. I am African American with hair that frizzes and that I perm every few months so I don&#x27;t lose so much hair and my hair is more manageable. I think this brush is more for people with straight or just wavy hair. Not really for people with kinky hair. This product didn&#x27;t work for me, but it might work for you. Part of my problem is that I found it harder to use than a round bristle brush. I have used round bristle brushed for as long as I can remember, so readjusting to this brush was touch for me.</li>
            <li> I guess it works. It certainly didn&#x27;t make blow drying my hair as other people have said. But I&#x27;m not that skilled with the blow dryer and brush. I found it difficult to use that way with separating my hair and having to run the brush over the section so many times. So I used it as a flat ironing helper instead. It worked better that way. I didn&#x27;t get the bone straight hair there&#x27;s were raving about but it did get straighter than normal. My hair is really curly and my ends will stay kinky/curly even after blow drying and ironing for 2 hours and having bone straight roots.</li>
            <li> This seemingly ingenious brush is awkward to use. Got returned. I return to my good ol&#x27; round brush. Who needs a huge brush collection, anyway?</li>
            <li> I have 3c textured curls and although it goes through a lot of abuse, it has definitely held up! I use it to straighten my hair while i pass a flat iron through it for a bone straight look. I really think it has helped to limit the heat damage because it helps my flat iron to do it thing with one pass. So the results are straighter and shinier.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the purchase was absolutely great. I love this brush! The purchase was also very very smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for hair straightening with a flat iron. It&#x27;s great except, depending on the heat setting the plastic will burn some and it can be somewhat difficult to remove thick hair from the brush after use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush on January 8th and it just arrived yesterday, January 12th!! Very fast delivery and I have already tried it out! I like how the brush is not that big or wide &amp; it&#x27;s much easier than using a regular brush while blow drying my hair. I have no concerns so far, it did a great job smoothing out my hair but of course I went back over it with a flatiron. I had no issues with pull out, just the typical few strands that may normally come out from any other brush. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I just received it and have only used it one time but I really like it!!</li>
            <li> it is very efficient with the straightener. If I am just blow drying it helps me style the hair at the end.</li>
            <li> I really thought it would be like a curling iron or flat iron with an electic cord. You must use it with a blow dryer and it is too cumbersome to use with your blow dryer.  A round brush is much easier.  It would have been a better product if it functioned like the curling iron or flat iron so that you could use it with dry hair.</li>
            <li> So much harder to use then round/straight brush. I waited to long to return.</li>
            <li> I only used it once and my poor hair started falling off as I was doing my hair. The bristles are too hard for my hair, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I gave it another try and now I use it every day.</li>
            <li> The best...It is an attention getta.....I love it</li>
            <li> When i first opened the package i thought i was gonna rip my hair out but it didn&#x27;t. Best item i have ever brought gets my hair nice and straight.</li>
            <li> Great for natural hair. I used this brush with my flat iron for the chase method and it left my hair smooth and straight!</li>
            <li> Love it , very sturdy</li>
            <li> Excellent straightening brush. Highly recommended.  Will purchase again if needed.</li>
            <li> gets super straight hair</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this brush if you want a long lasting quality product. The bristles are a mix of boar and plastic.The brush is made of a lighter plastic, which might explain why it broke after 4 months of use. The brush split cleanly at the inner inner hinge. I only used it once a week after a wash. My previous brush lasted 7 years, so it is very disappointing that this one lasted such a short time. I requested a replacement, but I was denied because they do not do Refunds. Please note that I asked for a Replacement.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my girlfriend and I had no idea what it was. The idea behind this brush is to use the heat of your hair and help straighten it. So, you have to use a straightener first, and then brush your hair with this. Since your hair is hot, the thermoceramic design will use the heat to help straighten your hair. It&#x27;s quite interesting technology and it worked very well! She still uses it often and has had no problems with the product.</li>
            <li> I order this product for my mother....and now I want to purchase one for myself!&lt;br /&gt;It is really easy to blow dry your hair and get a polished look.</li>
