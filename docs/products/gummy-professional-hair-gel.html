            <li>best hair gel for my 5 yr old - always stays.</li>
            <li>Gummy is by far the best gel on the market.</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>this product is the best I used so far</li>
            <li>Just love it, best gel i ever used, smells like just go out fron the barbershop, no white thing on your head and so sticky</li>
            <li>My barber showed me this stuff, I paid more when I bought it from him.  </li>
            <li>This does not smell like girl gel  like most hair gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 years now :)</li>
            <li>this gel sure holds it down.&lt;br /&gt;Kinda sticky..</li>
            <li>I love this gel.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love.</li>
            <li>I love this hair product, and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li>i love this product it seals braids</li>
            <li>Love this gel.</li>
            <li>but if I take more than 6 minutes doing my hair....it&#x27;s a problem what am I going to prom.  </li>
            <li>I love this gel, what more can i say.</li>
            <li>I use this gel for my curls and I love that it tames the frizz while also not giving my hair the &amp;#34;Crunchy&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li>I love this gel.</li>
            <li>I bought this after seeing my barber use it on my haircuts love the product ..although he seemed to get it a lot cheaper than I did</li>
            <li>I love Gummy hair gel.  </li>
            <li>I Love GUMMY Gel</li>
            <li>hold is very good and not very stiff.</li>
            <li>This tub will probably last more than a year!!!</li>
            <li>Also washes out easy when you wash your hair.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t fit in your shaving bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally was given this gel by my barber when I was 18 in Florida.  </li>
            <li>i was excited to get this product</li>
            <li>It comes right off in the shower too!</li>
            <li>like the big container..that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>when he wakes up the next day still looks good</li>
            <li>this gel leaves your hair nice and soft and never flakes</li>
            <li>And as mentioned in other reviews it smells great.  </li>
            <li>Works great even when hair is dry!!!</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not afraid that i&#x27;ll lose my hair.</li>
            <li>Kind of puzzling since I wasn&#x27;t attempting to spike my hair or anything drastic, just placing it straight back</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant smell, stays stiff all day</li>
            <li>Better than the stuff you can buy in the big box stores.</li>
            <li>This gel does really hold!</li>
            <li>this isn&#x27;t the first time I had issues sold and shipped by them).</li>
            <li>At 2 inches it holds the hair pretty well</li>
            <li>I was a clubman hair gel guy until I tried this product, Gummy has no alcohol and holds better than any other gel I&#x27;ve tired and for the price you&#x27;re getting an excellent value.</li>
            <li>(the style kept shifting as it would dry) and I needed more reinforcement.</li>
            <li>Place the large jar in the refrigerator.  </li>
            <li>It works on wet or dry hair, and does a great job with hold.</li>
            <li>Smells like you walked out of a barbershop and holds pretty much all day with no nasty drip or grease like other gels.</li>
            <li>very sticky stuff.</li>
            <li>It is great for anyone with less than 1 inch long hair.</li>
            <li>If you go more than a day without washing your hair it will be extremely flaky afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was true as long as you washed it out after the first day.</li>
            <li>Cant live without it!</li>
            <li>cost less than some of the competing brands, and works better.</li>
            <li>Able to save half the product...</li>
            <li>I work in a high wind area, this stuff holds in high winds.  </li>
            <li>Really holds my 3 year old son&#x27;s hair in place all day.</li>
            <li>and it seems worth the price for such a quantity.</li>
            <li>so if the tub is turned over, turn it right side up and wait 10 seconds or so for it to sink back to the bottom.</li>
            <li>so it looks natural, but it keeps it in shape!  </li>
            <li>Moved to Oz and the first thing i ordered was 3 big jars of this...</li>
            <li>Also the lid is a little too easy to remove</li>
            <li>if left in the large container it comes in.  </li>
            <li>for the condition of the item when I received it: It was sold and shipped by Amazon, so I am somewhat surprised...</li>
            <li>I like to look professional</li>
            <li>I bought it originally in Ft. Lauderdale for $20 at a hair salon but found it on amazon for half the cost!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know where exactly to get it in Boston and tried several other products for the kind of hair style that I wanted (undercut, slick back professional look)</li>
            <li>No other gel can compare.</li>
            <li>sure all the lids are closed and tight, it should of been something basic.</li>
            <li>Do not need to use much and last for a long time.</li>
            <li>I take a little glob and comb it how I want it, go to bed when it&#x27;s dry, then after I wake up, I lightly comb it the same way so my hair separates from the gel</li>
            <li>.very strong gluey gel</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It really holds, but your hair is really stiff.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering on amazon for a long time...</li>
            <li> Just really strange.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t leave the cover off for too long or it will lose that smell.</li>
            <li> it does have a tendency to dry out</li>
            <li> it IS a bit difficult to remove but not impossible.</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to travel with such a big tub.</li>
            <li> Customer is very dissatisfied and will never order this product again after poor caring for the product.</li>
            <li> When your hair gets messed, you can get it wet and restyle because the gel stays put.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> the customer (not me, father) is extremely irritated but doesn&#x27;t want to return because he believes it will be a hassle.</li>
            <li> Try it, I promise you won&#x27;t go to any other product after using Gummy hair gel.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, it works!</li>
            <li> , I tried wax, water based pomade, fructis gel, other gels, and texture lotions.  </li>
            <li> I use this gel daily, but have had a hard time finding it, now i can get it here</li>
            <li> good product, horrible packaging.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother to check because of the mess in the box.</li>
            <li> It works well, doesn&#x27;t leave a flakey mess.</li>
            <li> Both came open, broken, and all of the gel was on the cardbord box.</li>
            <li> The gel holds all day, I use it everyday</li>
            <li> The order was for 2 of this item and 1 of the green Fonex gel.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this gel does wonders compared to other brand gels.</li>
            <li> I usually dilute it.  </li>
            <li> , i like the texture and the small amount needed to do the job</li>
            <li> NOT SATISFIED</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling stiff and hard..</li>
            <li> I found that with the pomades and other gels the time I was taking was just to long and annoying</li>
            <li> Also I used other products and they kind of damaged my hair (got 2b glued is a terrible terrible product)</li>
            <li> It is very thick</li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning, this stuff is fairly thin</li>
            <li> Box broken gel all over the place.  </li>
            <li> but when i received it,  the seal was broken and the gel had spilled all in the plastic bag.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of being refunded, but a bad experience should be documented</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE PACKAGING!!!</li>

This does not smell like girl gel  like most hair gel. scent of a mens barber shop.  cost less than some of the competing brands, and works better.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this gel does wonders compared to other brand gels. Also smells nice.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product for men. The gel is awesome and leaves your hair smelling great with a nice wet look</li>
            <li> Really holds my 3 year old son&#x27;s hair in place all day. Better than the stuff you can buy in the big box stores.</li>
            <li> The best Hair Gel I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life . I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 years now :)</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling stiff and hard..this gel sure holds it down.&lt;br /&gt;Kinda sticky..&lt;br /&gt;I like the big container..that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I love this gel. Not greasy and no flakes. Perfect hold. Long lasting. All at a good price. What&#x27;s not to love.</li>
            <li> best hair gel for my 5 yr old - always stays. when he wakes up the next day still looks good</li>
            <li> I love this hair product, and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li> Great products. Controls frizzies &amp; holds hair well without stiffness.</li>
            <li> Greatest gel ever! I have been using it for over a year now &amp; must I say my hair just stays put for hours. Although the smell is not the greatest, I can deal with how perfect my hair comes out daily.</li>
            <li> This gel does really hold!</li>
            <li> I use this gel daily, but have had a hard time finding it, now i can get it here I will order it always !</li>
            <li> this gel leaves your hair nice and soft and never flakes, i like the texture and the small amount needed to do the job</li>
            <li> Both came open, broken, and all of the gel was on the cardbord box. Customer is very dissatisfied and will never order this product again after poor caring for the product. it&#x27;s gel - make sure all the lids are closed and tight, it should of been something basic. the customer (not me, father) is extremely irritated but doesn&#x27;t want to return because he believes it will be a hassle.</li>
            <li> This stuff rules. I bought it originally in Ft. Lauderdale for $20 at a hair salon but found it on amazon for half the cost!</li>
            <li> Its a very good product to use.&lt;br /&gt;I like it .... I might even just go head and buy snother one :p</li>
            <li> Great product thank you</li>
            <li> I was a clubman hair gel guy until I tried this product, Gummy has no alcohol and holds better than any other gel I&#x27;ve tired and for the price you&#x27;re getting an excellent value. The gel holds all day, I use it everyday and I&#x27;m not afraid that i&#x27;ll lose my hair. Try it, I promise you won&#x27;t go to any other product after using Gummy hair gel.</li>
            <li> good product, horrible packaging.</li>
            <li> Gummy is by far the best gel on the market. No other gel can compare. (there is nothing to talk about)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Scott Schwartz</li>
            <li> I use it to help shape my hair to stay where I want it.  I take a little glob and comb it how I want it, go to bed when it&#x27;s dry, then after I wake up, I lightly comb it the same way so my hair separates from the gel so it looks natural, but it keeps it in shape!  It comes right off in the shower too!</li>
            <li> Not much to say, it works!</li>
            <li> i love this product it seals braids well ..at ends ..and also great for edge control also good for just keeping your hair locked if u like wearing pony tails….very strong gluey gel</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and perfect item.</li>
            <li> As the heading reads, this is pertaining to the item upon arrival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, I have used it before and it holds well.. it IS a bit difficult to remove but not impossible. It is very thick so you may want to dilute it a bit with some water before applying it to your hair. And definitely wash your before going to sleep, as this WILL stain your pillow case!&lt;br /&gt;I (personally) found that I needed to use some mouse in addition to the gel because it didn&#x27;t freeze hold the style (the style kept shifting as it would dry) and I needed more reinforcement. Kind of puzzling since I wasn&#x27;t attempting to spike my hair or anything drastic, just placing it straight back&lt;br /&gt;As for the condition of the item when I received it: It was sold and shipped by Amazon, so I am somewhat surprised...(although this isn&#x27;t the first time I had issues sold and shipped by them). The order was for 2 of this item and 1 of the green Fonex gel. All of them were leaking out of their respective containers, and they didn&#x27;t have any seal protecting them from accidentally opening- they all did just that. There &amp;#34;may&amp;#34; have been a crack in 1 of these containers, but I didn&#x27;t bother to check because of the mess in the box. I am in the process of being refunded, but a bad experience should be documented</li>
            <li> After reading the description saying no flakes I bought this product. It was true as long as you washed it out after the first day. If you go more than a day without washing your hair it will be extremely flaky afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold is very good and not very stiff. It is great for anyone with less than 1 inch long hair. At 2 inches it holds the hair pretty well but it will sink a bit after 15 minutes or so. In this case, apply the gel, wait 15 minutes and reapply gel and you should be good. The tub is definitely a lot and it seems worth the price for such a quantity. Kinda hard to travel with such a big tub. It won&#x27;t fit in your shaving bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning, this stuff is fairly thin so if the tub is turned over, turn it right side up and wait 10 seconds or so for it to sink back to the bottom. Also the lid is a little too easy to remove so if you are traveling with it, put it in its own plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Great product and smell good</li>
            <li> Love this gel. Works great even when hair is dry!!!</li>
            <li> I originally was given this gel by my barber when I was 18 in Florida.  I stuck with it until I was 21 and then headed to Boston for dental school.  Since I bought this product exclusively at my barbers I didn&#x27;t know where exactly to get it in Boston and tried several other products for the kind of hair style that I wanted (undercut, slick back professional look), I tried wax, water based pomade, fructis gel, other gels, and texture lotions.  I like to look professional but if I take more than 6 minutes doing my hair....it&#x27;s a problem what am I going to prom.  I found that with the pomades and other gels the time I was taking was just to long and annoying and then the product wouldn&#x27;t hold the hair how I styled it.  I went online found it and that&#x27;s that.  Also I used other products and they kind of damaged my hair (got 2b glued is a terrible terrible product) but with this one not an issue ever with hair health.  And as mentioned in other reviews it smells great.  It has never flaked on me and last all day.</li>
            <li> My barber uses this product so I decided to try it out and it works great!! I recommend to anyone that uses gel.</li>
            <li> Smells like you walked out of a barbershop and holds pretty much all day with no nasty drip or grease like other gels. Only way to find out is to try it and take my word for it.</li>
            <li> This product is the longest blasting gel I&#x27;ve ever used. Has a pleasant smell, stays stiff all day no need to reapply and does not flake or irritate your scalp.</li>
            <li> Perfect transaction!! Love this product!  I have been ordering on amazon for a long time... One of the containers were opened upon delivery... Able to save half the product... Just really strange.</li>
            <li> Love this gel! Best I&#x27;ve used so far. Found out about it from my barber, and have been meaning to get it! Finally got it and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Great product , smells wonderful! Prefer&lt;br /&gt;. This than  eco style gel</li>
            <li> This hair gel was absolutely amazing. It works on wet or dry hair, and does a great job with hold. I spike the front of my hair and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I love this gel, what more can i say. Moved to Oz and the first thing i ordered was 3 big jars of this...Cant live without it!</li>
            <li> I use this gel for my curls and I love that it tames the frizz while also not giving my hair the &amp;#34;Crunchy&amp;#34; look.  I love this gel.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. A tiny bit goes a long way. This tub will probably last more than a year!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It works well, doesn&#x27;t leave a flakey mess. When your hair gets messed, you can get it wet and restyle because the gel stays put.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing my barber use it on my haircuts love the product ..although he seemed to get it a lot cheaper than I did</li>
            <li> This will last me for 3 to 4 months. The smell is great, it&#x27;s like coming out of a barbershop. Just don&#x27;t leave the cover off for too long or it will lose that smell.</li>
            <li> Hold is great &amp; smells amazing, I&#x27;m a barber and I use it for work. Not sticky or flaky A+++++++</li>
            <li> It really holds, but your hair is really stiff. It doesn&#x27;t go any where.</li>
            <li> Product was a disaster. Box broken gel all over the place.  Took over 2 weeks to come in</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!  It smells really good and holds nicely.  I am African American and I use this product for my hairline (edges).  And unlike &amp;#34;Gorilla Snot&amp;#34;  you do not experience product build up.  it does have a tendency to dry out if left in the large container it comes in.  So iI suggest you take some out an put it in a smaller container.  Place the large jar in the refrigerator.  This will help prolong the product longer.</li>
            <li> Best Hair gel. Do not need to use much and last for a long time. Great deal also. Keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I love Gummy hair gel.  I asked my barber what he used and Gummy is what he told me.  The product arrived quickly and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I Love GUMMY Gel</li>
            <li> Worked great in my son&#x27;s hair! Held style all day! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t like the product. It wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> this product is the best I used so far even my kid tell me daddy you hair smell sooooo good and look so shiny. I recommende</li>
            <li> I have tried all differant kinds of gel, this is the only one Ive found that doesnt leave flakes in your hair &amp; is almost like cement. Also washes out easy when you wash your hair. Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> i was excited to get this product but when i received it,  the seal was broken and the gel had spilled all in the plastic bag. TERRIBLE PACKAGING!!! NOT SATISFIED AT ALL!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!</li>
