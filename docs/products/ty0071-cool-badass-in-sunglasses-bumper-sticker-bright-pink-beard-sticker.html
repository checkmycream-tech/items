            <li>Great sticker!</li>
            <li>I was really impressed with how sturdy this was.</li>
            <li>This is a great quality sticker.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it seems to be great quality.</li>
            <li>Great addition to the beer fridge out in the garage.</li>
            <li>The company said it would take 4-6 weeks to arrive, so I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>It fit perfectly on the side of the door.</li>
            <li>my beer mug looks as good as I feel when I wake up after sleeping in my rotating leopard print bed, with silk sheets.&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li>Bought this for a friend of mine who looks suspiciously like the model for it, and he loved it.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Totally love this one!</li>
            <li>I really liked this sticker because it reminded me of Zach Galifianakis&#x27; character, Alan, in The Hangover series.</li>
            <li>If you buy this sticker you can do all of this and more.</li>
            <li>I love the look and thickness.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Make sure to check the dimensions.</li>
            <li>As long as the sticker doesn&#x27;t fade completely I am very happy with this buy.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>So was excited when I did get it because was getting worried that I had gotten Screwed.</li>
            <li>So you want to be cool?</li>
            <li>It is a cute sticker but it doesn&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
            <li>I am currently in the process of sticker bombing my beer fridge in the Man Cave and this has been one of my favorite additions to my sticker bombed beer fridge!</li>
            <li>I would like something bigger, but still amazing look.</li>
            <li>First off its a sweet sticker just like the picture shows.</li>
            <li>All around the sticker is faded, but it actually has a nice effect.</li>
            <li>It would not stick to anything at all and peeled right off.</li>
            <li>Also shipping is very very fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a big sticker, so keep that in mind, but it would fit nicely in the corner of a back window on your truck.</li>
            <li>EVERY ONE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE I PURCHASED THIS STICKER.</li>
            <li>The pink offered a nice contrast to the other stickers already on it.</li>
            <li>Great sticker for my board but a little on the small side</li>
            <li>The hot pink color really makes this sticker stand out.</li>
            <li>About half the size of regular stickers, but great empty space filler and small spaces that the average-sized stickers can&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>High quality good adhesion and was quite thick and long lasting.</li>
            <li>classy Amazon.</li>
            <li>only I wished it was a little bigger :)</li>
            <li>I put the sticker on the back of my phone and within a month it has completely faded away into a white sticker.</li>

            <li> so everyone knows I am a pink bearded furious tiger slaying man.&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware that this is small, much smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> and it took a long time to receive it in the mail.</li>
            <li> The next day I noticed that the edges of the pink lost their sharpness.</li>
            <li> Very small and takes sun damage fast.</li>
            <li> This sticker is much smaller than the average sized sticker.</li>
            <li> **! Thought it would be just a little bigger</li>
            <li> Love this sticker, It&#x27;s BAD</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s maybe 3 inches tall and 2 inches wide.</li>
            <li> My only con is that is is quite small like a 2x2 inch.</li>
            <li> Small, flimsy, basic paper sticker.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> This thing is small and fades within a few weeks if you dare to place on something outside.  </li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;bumper sticker&amp;#34; is the size of a small sticker a child would get from a bank visit.</li>
            <li> This bumper sticker was absolutely what it looked like it was supposed to be, but I was extremely disappointed in its adhesion.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in that.</li>

            <li> I am currently in the process of sticker bombing my beer fridge in the Man Cave and this has been one of my favorite additions to my sticker bombed beer fridge! This sticker is much smaller than the average sized sticker. I would say it measures about 3&amp;#34; in height and 1 1/2&amp;#34; in width. It fit perfectly on the side of the door. I really liked this sticker because it reminded me of Zach Galifianakis&#x27; character, Alan, in The Hangover series. This is a great quality sticker. About half the size of regular stickers, but great empty space filler and small spaces that the average-sized stickers can&#x27;t fit. The hot pink color really makes this sticker stand out. I would recommend this sticker for any occasion and to all of you &amp;#34;Alan&amp;#34; fans!</li>
            <li> First off its a sweet sticker just like the picture shows. My only con is that is is quite small like a 2x2 inch.Otherwise it seems to be great quality.</li>
            <li> Love this sticker, It&#x27;s BAD A**! Thought it would be just a little bigger and it took a long time to receive it in the mail. So was excited when I did get it because was getting worried that I had gotten Screwed. Looks Great on my laptop!!!</li>
            <li> So you want to be cool? Think you&#x27;re dope enough to rock double popped collars? Want to shred on the guitar with Marty McFly in 1955? If you buy this sticker you can do all of this and more. I bought one for my beer mug at my local watering hole so everyone knows I am a pink bearded furious tiger slaying man.&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware that this is small, much smaller than I thought it would be. It&#x27;s maybe 3 inches tall and 2 inches wide. But the inches are furious and ooze 70&#x27;s beard power. Also shipping is very very fast. I ordered on 7/4/2013 and got it 7/15/2013. The company said it would take 4-6 weeks to arrive, so I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;Now my beer mug looks as good as I feel when I wake up after sleeping in my rotating leopard print bed, with silk sheets.&lt;br /&gt;Stay classy Amazon.</li>
            <li> Small, flimsy, basic paper sticker. Came crumpled.</li>
            <li> I put the sticker on the back of my phone and within a month it has completely faded away into a white sticker. I would not recommend this to occur to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> This bumper sticker was absolutely what it looked like it was supposed to be, but I was extremely disappointed in its adhesion. It would not stick to anything at all and peeled right off.</li>
            <li> Great sticker! I love the look and thickness. I would like something bigger, but still amazing look. However, after placing the sticker on my car there was a storm. The next day I noticed that the edges of the pink lost their sharpness. All around the sticker is faded, but it actually has a nice effect. As long as the sticker doesn&#x27;t fade completely I am very happy with this buy.</li>
            <li> Got it today, as the description says. I love it! only I wished it was a little bigger :) might buy another one.</li>
            <li> EVERY ONE WANTS TO KNOW WHERE I PURCHASED THIS STICKER. I LOVE IT. ITS ON THE SIDE OF OUR KAYAK! I DO WIDH THERE WAS AN OPTION NOT TO HAVE THE WORDS WRITTEN ON THE SUNGLASSES</li>
            <li> Make sure to check the dimensions. This thing is small and fades within a few weeks if you dare to place on something outside.  Other than that, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> High quality good adhesion and was quite thick and long lasting. I was really impressed with how sturdy this was.</li>
            <li> Very small and takes sun damage fast.</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I expected...3&amp;#34;x1.5&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It is a cute sticker but it doesn&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
            <li> Great sticker for my board but a little on the small side</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;bumper sticker&amp;#34; is the size of a small sticker a child would get from a bank visit.</li>
            <li> This thing is the size of a 2 year Olds palm. Disappointed in that. Also alot of people say the sun kills this thing.</li>
            <li> Great addition to the beer fridge out in the garage. The pink offered a nice contrast to the other stickers already on it.</li>
            <li> Totally love this one!</li>
