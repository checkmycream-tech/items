            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t sharp enough.</li>

            <li> Handel broke the first day The handle was very thin and when I opened it the handle cracked shortly thereafter fell to pieces!!!!!</li>
            <li> Take care because it&#x27;s not stainless</li>
            <li> came decently sharp.  </li>
            <li> Sharp blade.</li>
            <li> The first item I received was broken from the handle, as it was sent with absolutely no cuhioning, simply in a small bag.  </li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t have anyone in our area to create the sharp edge, so will need to purchase a stone specifically for this</li>
            <li> and it is still razor sharp.</li>
            <li> it keeps a sharp edge with little  honing.</li>

            <li> Sharp very sharp !</li>

            <li> not for amateur shavers.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still not good.  </li>
            <li> It looks nothing like the picture and it was broken when I got it.</li>
            <li> I have honed this blade for hours and it produces a shave, worse than a dual blade disposable.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a man that had listed it on his wish list on our secret Santa  </li>
            <li> I read several very bad reviews on it.</li>
            <li> Very very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Poor quality steel, terrible quality handle.</li>
            <li> This is crap.</li>

            <li> This is a good straight razor to learn with.  came decently sharp.  Take care because it&#x27;s not stainless so it will quickly corrode.</li>
            <li> Other than having to hone and sharpen the razor it works great.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but I need to on this one. It looks nothing like the picture and it was broken when I got it. Do not waste your time or money. If you are looking for a cheap razor, you can find ones better than this one. I REPEAT! PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> needs to be sharpened before using,  not really sharp enough to get a good shave right out of the box.</li>
            <li> cheap handle, cheap steel, shovels like a shovel one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve</li>
            <li> Very sharp and it looks good.</li>
            <li> It is a reasonable price for something that will probably never cut. I have honed this blade for hours and it produces a shave, worse than a dual blade disposable. Do not buy</li>
            <li> I gave it a three because this was my first straight razor and it didn&#x27;t cut as easy as I thought it would, maybe cause it wasn&#x27;t sharp enough, I also rusts quickly so just have in mind your probably going to buy a new one after weeks of use.</li>
            <li> seller was great - the razor is reflective of the cost with respect to the quality - it leaves a lot to be desired I guess you get what you pay for - so save your money this one didn&#x27;t hold its edge well at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner straight/safety razor shaving, this is nice and sharp just give it a good strop and shave . I recommend this for beginners, also prosoa shave soap!!</li>
            <li> The plastic handle broke off in little pieces and the blade fell out within two weeks of my purchase. The blade was very sharp though.</li>
            <li> Made in Pakistan.  Absolute garbage. Poor quality steel, terrible quality handle.</li>
            <li> Works for a first time straight razor, the handle is not the same color as pictured at all, its more of a yellow orange, but that wasn&#x27;t a problem for me.</li>
            <li> save your money this razor is not even sharp I wish I never ordered it and there is better razors out there it&#x27;s a piece of junk but I&#x27;m stuck with it now</li>
            <li> Handel broke the first day The handle was very thin and when I opened it the handle cracked shortly thereafter fell to pieces!!!!!</li>
            <li> razor is well made . it keeps a sharp edge with little  honing. looks great and works great. what else can isay.</li>
            <li> I ordered one and it was cracked and broke when it arrived. Salon Supply then sent me a new one free of charge and the second one arrived broken as well. I don&#x27;t blame them I think it was a shipping and handling thing, just know they are fragile. Also know the handle is plastic not wood</li>
            <li> Very very poor quality. I could do a better job and i&#x27;m not a knife maker. The 2 star is only because of the price and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Sharp blade. nice for the price.  handle could be nicer. Non locking blade uses thumb for blade positioning. not for amateur shavers.</li>
            <li> Was not shave ready as stated... Not sharp and no visual signs of being honed... Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this cheap razor.</li>
            <li> Great razor! It comes shave ready and it has a good weight and balance to it. Has a nice feel to it while handling it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor with no expectation of quality. I read several very bad reviews on it. I have to say after receiving this razor I am actually impressed. With very little work I was able to put a &amp;#34;Gillette Edge&amp;#34; on it and shave. The handle is flimsy but if taken care of properly that should not be an issue. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Dont buy if you plan on shaving</li>
            <li> Good product, very pleased. Would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> My dad Love it easy to use clean shave love the color I use it every day stainless steel good and strong</li>
            <li> Mine came shave ready and the scales to the one I purchase came intact I was pleased with the purchase</li>
            <li> Would give it no stars of that was possible. This razor is one of the worst I&#x27;ve used. I guess the saying is true,&amp;#34; you get what you pay for&amp;#34;. Save your money and purchase a better one.</li>
            <li> This is crap. I tried shaving with it when it first arrived but it wasn&#x27;t sharp enough. I sent it out to be sharpened professionally but it&#x27;s still not good.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> this product is not shave ready. they are lying in the description. it is sharp enough to cut yourself but not shave</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was an inexpensive way to begin straight razor shaving. It turns out that the price and quality are one in the same...cheap. Two minutes into shaving the handle fell apart in my hand. The handle seems to be made of a very flimsy plastic. I am returning this product and buying a better quality straight razor. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Handle made of plastic, blade wasn&#x27;t shave ready.</li>
            <li> The first item I received was broken from the handle, as it was sent with absolutely no cuhioning, simply in a small bag.  The seller promptly sent a new item, this time with the half sheet paper receipt wrapped around it.  On the receipt it had a note for the shipper to include additional packaging, which didn&#x27;t happen.  Also, the description indicated this was shave ready, and it is nowhere near that.  We don&#x27;t have anyone in our area to create the sharp edge, so will need to purchase a stone specifically for this (we already have a strop to hone once the edge is there).</li>
            <li> For the money this straight razor is a great deal, I have shaved with it multiple times and stropped it every other time that i used it and it is still razor sharp. The handle material is really cheap and is the biggest draw back of the knife, and I plan on making my own handles for it. but the blade itself is great, it came shave ready, and has been able to keep an edge. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is curious about starting straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a man that had listed it on his wish list on our secret Santa  He was happy with it</li>
            <li> Its decent it gets the job done.But its starting to rust already and I took every precaution from the first shave for it not to rust</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok nothing special</li>
            <li> It was not shave ready , but after puttig an edge on it , it did a great job. Happy.</li>
            <li> Sharp very sharp ! If you want a close shave this is the way to go. Just make sure that your hand isn&#x27;t shaking.</li>
            <li> This razor is alright.I like it.Nice balance.Decent made .Sharpens ok.Do not use the any products from the Asp that sold me the Red paste.It is ok.nothing great.it is $7.99</li>
            <li> It as nice looking but not sharp enough it cut the hairs on the back of my neck.</li>
            <li> Blade is OK, sharp but not shave ready, but handle is cheap and thin and flimsy</li>
