            <li>These were well made and had nice gel heel pads.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for :)</li>
            <li>Great seller, fast shipping</li>
            <li>and I bought a bunch more pairs.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>After showering, I moisturize my heels and sleep in these and wake up with smooth feet!</li>
            <li>LOVED these until they unraveled when I washed them the first time.</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly and is nice quality.  </li>
            <li>Find these more comfortable in bed than the socks I use for moisturizing my feet</li>
            <li>Really loved it, very moisturizing and soothing for the feet.</li>
            <li>My feet improved right away.</li>
            <li>I expect more for ten bucks a pair.</li>
            <li>They are baby soft!!!!</li>
            <li>Positively Perfect&lt;br /&gt;GREAT</li>
            <li>I do not understand the science, or the magic, but they honestly closed the cracks.  </li>
            <li>I gave two stars for fast arrival of product and the concept.</li>
            <li>Does not seem to have much effect.</li>
            <li>But, it is comfortable to wear and maybe needs several days to fully work.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t see spending this much money on something that is defective.</li>
            <li>I wore them in the day too, with other socks over the top.</li>
            <li>The first pair began to unravel from the top within a few days of part time wearing.</li>
            <li>I washed the socks inside a mesh lingerie bag and then allowed them to air dry -- they cleaned up fine with no additional damage.</li>
            <li>unraveled a little more no matter how gentle I was with them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a pair that hasn&#x27;t unraveled and several no longer have the white band at the top.</li>
            <li>I was even going to buy a few more pair.</li>
            <li>The sticking on the top rim of both of the socks came out and is now just a raw edge.  </li>
            <li>Just be aware that they only last about a week or so and the price is pretty high for that.</li>
            <li>First off, let me say that my heels are gross and I&#x27;ve tried every moisturizer known to man.</li>
            <li>Constant &amp;#34;sanding&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t really work in the winter.  </li>
            <li>They also tend to hold onto foot smell, so they have to be washed frequently</li>
            <li>I was surprised because it does moisturize your feet.</li>
            <li>Yes, they quickly fall apart and are not worth the cost.</li>
            <li>was received on time my wife loves it she had akelies tenden surgery and was in a boot for along time they took her akelies tendon loose from her heel and took off a bone spur then re attached her tendon to her heel when she got out of the boot her heel was sore but with the sock she can wear her shoes and her heal dont hurt as much would defintley buy from you again</li>
            <li>and I spent quite a bit of money, despite buying these when they were much cheaper than today.  </li>
            <li>but  they fit  a little tight on  my ankle</li>

            <li> my mom had the worsed dry cracked feet.i bought her these they helped her</li>
            <li> I used every day and Im seen the results on my dry feet.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to help with my dry cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pity.</li>
            <li> This item IS NOT WORTH the $10 they are asking for.</li>
            <li> I have average women&#x27;s ankles and these can be uncomfortably tight after a day on my feet if I experience swelling at all.</li>
            <li> Tore within a half hour and silicone began to seep out.</li>
            <li> But they were way too small and tight for a man&#x27;s foot.</li>
            <li> It does start to peel off and pill, but not more than I would expect.</li>
            <li> I was starting to get desperate because they had turned black permanently and were cracked to the point of bleeding.</li>
            <li> None of my dollar a pair socks do that, so I assume it&#x27;s not that hard to avoid.  </li>
            <li> I had a couple of fairly deep painful cracks on my heels.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m tired of complaining and dealing with shoddy products.  </li>
            <li> The only other real complaint I have is that the silicone area is quite small and sometimes the heel slides inward a bit during the day, leaving my outer heel exposed and that is where it is cracked the worst.</li>
            <li> whose feet are painfully and relentlessly dry.</li>
            <li> Not really happy with these.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m a little disappointed</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> But for this price, I can&#x27;t justify their purchase for &#x27;one&#x27; use socks. :(</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My second pair. Find these more comfortable in bed than the socks I use for moisturizing my feet</li>
            <li> Positively Perfect&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Poor quality - fell apart quickly.</li>
            <li> After suffering from cracked heels for the last five years AND trying everything on the market, I tried these with CeraVe every night for a week now. My heels no longer feel like sandpaper!  They are not cracked and splintered. They are baby soft!!!!</li>
            <li> Got these for my husband and they do the job as advertised.</li>
            <li> I had a couple of fairly deep painful cracks on my heels.  Constant &amp;#34;sanding&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t really work in the winter.  But these socks, with their gel heels actually worked.  I do not understand the science, or the magic, but they honestly closed the cracks.  Wish I would have had them last winter when I bled through all my white socks.  I wore them to bed.  With the open toe, I didn&#x27;t get overheated.</li>
            <li> There socks are comfortable and they have been helpful in moisturizing my feet, but they are poorly constructed. I wore the socks overnight three times and then decided to wash them. Before placing them in the washing machine, I noticed two problems: the silicone oozed through to the outside of the sock and one of the seams unravelled. I washed the socks inside a mesh lingerie bag and then allowed them to air dry -- they cleaned up fine with no additional damage.</li>
            <li> Really loved it, very moisturizing and soothing for the feet. Just what I was looking for :)</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before making purchase but I thought the maker/seller would have improved the product. I was wrong. Out of the package one sock began unraveling. Then each time I put it on it unraveled a little more no matter how gentle I was with them. I should have contacted the seller straightaway but I&#x27;m tired of complaining and dealing with shoddy products.  This item IS NOT WORTH the $10 they are asking for. I gave two stars for fast arrival of product and the concept. If only....</li>
            <li> Not really happy with these.  I&#x27;m getting tiny gel bubbles coming through the fabric.  The sticking on the top rim of both of the socks came out and is now just a raw edge.  Would not buy them again</li>
            <li> I purchased these socks for my husband whose feet are painfully and relentlessly dry. Yes, they work (except for the toes, of course). Yes, they quickly fall apart and are not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to have much effect. But, it is comfortable to wear and maybe needs several days to fully work.</li>
            <li> was received on time my wife loves it she had akelies tenden surgery and was in a boot for along time they took her akelies tendon loose from her heel and took off a bone spur then re attached her tendon to her heel when she got out of the boot her heel was sore but with the sock she can wear her shoes and her heal dont hurt as much would defintley buy from you again</li>
            <li> Tore within a half hour and silicone began to seep out. Helped my skin while they were on my feet, but it durable at all.</li>
            <li> The reason for one star is that these lasted me only 2 wearing&#x27;s before the gel separated from the sock. Otherwise, they seem to work great. But I can&#x27;t see spending this much money on something that is defective.</li>
            <li> my mom had the worsed dry cracked feet.i bought her these they helped her and shes very happy with them.</li>
            <li> These were well made and had nice gel heel pads.  But they were way too small and tight for a man&#x27;s foot.</li>
            <li> I like the sock but  they fit  a little tight on  my ankle I used every day and Im seen the results on my dry feet. Great seller, fast shipping</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly and is nice quality.  I have not used them yet, however, look forward to it.  thank you!</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that my heels are gross and I&#x27;ve tried every moisturizer known to man. I was starting to get desperate because they had turned black permanently and were cracked to the point of bleeding. I decided to try a multi product emergency program and I spent quite a bit of money, despite buying these when they were much cheaper than today.  I used heel cream, the foot grater and these socks. My feet improved right away. I told everyone about it and I bought a bunch more pairs. I was thrilled. I cannot wear socks at night, my feet must stick out the bottom of the blanket, but these didn&#x27;t bother me. I wore them in the day too, with other socks over the top. But it was short lived.  The concept is great. It&#x27;s a bit of silicone inside the sock that covers your heel and keeps it from drying out. It also provides some cushion and reduced the pain of walking on cracked, bleeding heels during the healing. The execution, however, needs work. The first pair began to unravel from the top within a few days of part time wearing. The white part came apart while wearing them. They were never even washed. I put another pair in the wash and they unraveled as well, wrapping all my laundry in string. I don&#x27;t have a pair that hasn&#x27;t unraveled and several no longer have the white band at the top. None of my dollar a pair socks do that, so I assume it&#x27;s not that hard to avoid.  The silicone itself has held up okay. It does start to peel off and pill, but not more than I would expect. I have average women&#x27;s ankles and these can be uncomfortably tight after a day on my feet if I experience swelling at all. They also tend to hold onto foot smell, so they have to be washed frequently which probably makes them unravel faster. The only other real complaint I have is that the silicone area is quite small and sometimes the heel slides inward a bit during the day, leaving my outer heel exposed and that is where it is cracked the worst. I expect more for ten bucks a pair. I would not pay what they are charging today.  So. Yes, they do work. Just be aware that they only last about a week or so and the price is pretty high for that. Happy Healing!!</li>
            <li> not satisfied,took swelling out of my feet but doubled it in my legs and they claim to be cooling, I didnt find this.</li>
            <li> LOVED these until they unraveled when I washed them the first time. They truly helped my heels a ton. I just wish I could have used them for a longer period of time. I was even going to buy a few more pair. But for this price, I can&#x27;t justify their purchase for &#x27;one&#x27; use socks. :(</li>
            <li> I was surprised because it does moisturize your feet. But I&#x27;m a little disappointed cause the sock is tearing and I&#x27;ve  only used it twice. And the gel that moisturizes is separating from the sock. It&#x27;s a pity.</li>
            <li> these feel wonderful on and i am very happy with the look of them.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to help with my dry cracked heels.  After showering, I moisturize my heels and sleep in these and wake up with smooth feet!</li>
