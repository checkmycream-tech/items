            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This hair comb was better in person than shown.  </li>
            <li>I get more compliments from this seller&#x27;s hair clips when I wear them.  </li>
            <li>I have many of them and still will buy more.  </li>
            <li>It looks elegant when in the hair, and cost about a tenth what the France Luxe ones do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;shipping would have cost more.</li>
            <li>With the beautiful natural colors, goes with all my Native American-inspired outfits.</li>
            <li>Plastic comb is not sturdy or smooth.  </li>
            <li>Does not slide into my hair easily, and I have very slippery, Fine hair!  </li>
            <li>They are fun to use as well!</li>
            <li>very plastic appearance, but cute and functional.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;teeth are a good length for my heavy hair, pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>It is pretty, but I don&#x27;t think it will be very useful.</li>
            <li>It does not look cheap at all and the colors are vibrant and rich.</li>
            <li>But it is fun and when I am in a fun mood, I add it to my hair do.</li>
            <li>, I can pull my hair back, this comb holds it and have a nice look where both sides of my hair are not fallikng into my face.</li>
            <li>Fun, festive.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m keeping it to give as a gift...just have to find the right person.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and large.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone looking for a unique hair comb.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun and colorful, but still really romantic/elegant.</li>
            <li>Most of the side dombs I have are plain, that is all I used to be able to find other than elaborate sparkly wedding ones, which is fine</li>
            <li>to my surprise it arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>I had shoulder length, straight, fine hair that works well with any high quality combs.  </li>
            <li>The decoration is really pretty and metal.  </li>
            <li>This item was surprisingly light on the price, considering how professionally made it is.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty online</li>
            <li>but when I received the comb, it was just too much for me!  </li>
            <li>The comb is a good plastic--not too stiff, not too flexible.  </li>
            <li>Pretty, little difference, great for long hair</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the size listed in the description when I purchased the clips, I just went off the picture.  </li>
            <li>Can use this to decorate after I hold my hair up with other pins or clips, but the teeth are not substantial enough to hold my hair on its own.</li>
            <li>I took away one star because one of the smaller gems has fallen out, but it is very hard to tell and is still very nice for how much it costs.</li>
            <li>A lovely side or back comb to pull my long hair away from my face on one side</li>
            <li>Pretty enough to wear to my nieces wedding.</li>
            <li>Its also nice that it is larger than the small ones</li>
            <li>I also received another one that is smaller and looks like a peacock, and it dresses up my hair, with my summer clothes, or black leggings and a top;  </li>
            <li>This is lovely, it arrived yesterday, I have another one on the way, and I bought a few others in different styles...</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used much yet but look forward to a long time.</li>
            <li>what a way to add color to a summer fall or wint4r day, and not have the same old look.  </li>
            <li>This comb is pretty, as pictured, but the metal/stone portion is a bit too heavy for the plastic teeth, the balance feels off when using it.</li>
            <li>The beads are fine, but they stuck out at an odd angle because the comb does not fit snugly enough against my head.  </li>
            <li>The comb is plastic AND has wide teeth, so it is hard to put in your hair, and feels like it may break if you push it in securely.  </li>

            <li> My hair is thick long and heavy.  </li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> Although the teeth are plastic it is heavy and well made</li>

The teeth show black through my hair; don&#x27;t care for that aspect.  To much hassle to return for such small package, so I just use them.  Could have been happier with metal.</li>
            <li> very plastic appearance, but cute and functional.</li>
            <li> Works to hold hair just where I like it and look good doing it</li>
            <li> A beautiful gift for my friend at a super great price. It does not look cheap at all and the colors are vibrant and rich. I love it. I should of bought two! LOL!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay much attention to the size listed in the description when I purchased the clips, I just went off the picture.  When I received the clips they were way too big for my shoulder-length hair.  I would recommend this clip to anyone who has long thick hair.</li>

            <li> to my surprise it arrived very fast. and this comb has a beautiful looking just like the one on the pic.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my soulmate as part of her Christmas present. It is just as described and if she doesn&#x27;t like it I&#x27;d love to keep it! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter who has very long heavy hair.  Plastic combs break and this one was listed as a metal comb. I was VERY disappointed to receive a plastic comb. It was not as advertised.</li>
            <li> The comb is a good plastic--not too stiff, not too flexible.  The decoration is really pretty and metal.  I received several compliments when I wore this.</li>
            <li> Holds tightly. Pretty enough to wear to my nieces wedding.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments from this seller&#x27;s hair clips when I wear them.  I have many of them and still will buy more.  They are fun to use as well!</li>
            <li> I just received this item and it was broken inside the package!! Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> With the beautiful natural colors, goes with all my Native American-inspired outfits.</li>
            <li> A little bigger than I expected (about 4\\&quot; long with teeth of about 3.5\\&quot;), but I can still wear it if there is a band in my hair. It&#x27;s fun and colorful, but still really romantic/elegant. I like to put my hair in a low ponytail, seperate the part university the band into two sections, flip the lower part up then towards my head and through the hole between sections, then stick this in the middle. I took away one star because one of the smaller gems has fallen out, but it is very hard to tell and is still very nice for how much it costs.</li>
            <li> awesome quality and color. it was more beautiful than was displayed in the photo. I will wear it a lot..Awsome</li>
            <li> trash. waste of money.</li>
            <li> Pretty, little difference, great for long hair</li>
            <li> Like the way it looks. Haven&#x27;t used much yet but look forward to a long time. Great service.</li>
            <li> Nice, well made, decorative comb.</li>
            <li> This is not a practical comb; it is a little larger than I expected. But it is fun and when I am in a fun mood, I add it to my hair do.</li>
            <li> Finally!  A lovely side or back comb to pull my long hair away from my face on one side, that doesnt look like a wedding comb.  This is lovely, it arrived yesterday, I have another one on the way, and I bought a few others in different styles...what a way to add color to a summer fall or wint4r day, and not have the same old look.  Ponytail, bun or hair hanging down on both sides.  It gives a neater look, and I love it!  Most of the side dombs I have are plain, that is all I used to be able to find other than elaborate sparkly wedding ones, which is fine but, I couldnt find anything just in between plain, and wedding...now I have. Its also nice that it is larger than the small ones, I can pull my hair back, this comb holds it and have a nice look where both sides of my hair are not fallikng into my face. Its a timelesds look and Im delighted with this one.  I also received another one that is smaller and looks like a peacock, and it dresses up my hair, with my summer clothes, or black leggings and a top;  Yes, I dont have to have the same boring look everyday.  The prices were great too!</li>
            <li> This item was surprisingly light on the price, considering how professionally made it is. It looks elegant when in the hair, and cost about a tenth what the France Luxe ones do.</li>
            <li> there were  2 to a package which I did not know so it was a nice surprise&lt;br /&gt;teeth are a good length for my heavy hair, pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice comb. Very pretty and large. Although the teeth are plastic it is heavy and well made</li>
            <li> It looks pretty online but when I received the comb, it was just too much for me!  But I&#x27;m keeping it to give as a gift...just have to find the right person.</li>
            <li> Fun, festive. Took me a while to figure out How to use this in my hair, but I did! Seller would have accepted return, but price so low,&lt;br /&gt;shipping would have cost more. Meantime, I keep it visible on my dresser as it is so cheerful, can pretend I am an exotic Flamenco dancer! ( &amp;#60;:  !</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Beautiful comb.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and It&#x27;s a beautiful comb but meant for longer heavier hair. Maybe my fault for not paying attention to details.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick long and heavy.  This comb is pretty, as pictured, but the metal/stone portion is a bit too heavy for the plastic teeth, the balance feels off when using it. Can use this to decorate after I hold my hair up with other pins or clips, but the teeth are not substantial enough to hold my hair on its own.</li>
            <li> Stunning piece!  Picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice.</li>
