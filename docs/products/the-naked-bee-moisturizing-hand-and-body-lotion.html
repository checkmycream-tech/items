            <li>The lotion is silky and despite the strong scent I am able to use it on my face  (although not labeled as a face cream) and around my eyes without burning.  </li>
            <li>this is the best lotion for dry skin in the winter.  </li>
            <li>The smells are pleasant but very musky, think incense and patchouli.</li>
            <li>my new favorite!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a HUGE tea lover, but I have to say it smells better on you than from the bottle.</li>
            <li>Love the product and light aroma.</li>
            <li>is great; however, if you are sensitive to strong scents, this might not be for you.</li>
            <li>I think this has true aromatic value!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy but not greasy, absorbs easily, smells heavenly.</li>
            <li>I love that I can come onto Amazon and get it at such a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>greatâ€¦very strong scent</li>
            <li>Because of the natural product it&#x27;s nice to use for children also!</li>
            <li>light non-perfumey smell.  </li>
            <li>I used these products when they were made by Shadows &amp; Light.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very spicy and reminds me of a warm cup of Chai.</li>
            <li>It smells swell and feels fabulously smooth - not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have an issue with this kind of thing, I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the first bottle and will order more.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is nice and it keeps my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I have received many comments from many different individuals about the offensiveness of the scent (it is a bit strong and has a bite to it).</li>
            <li>Favorite lotion in the whole world.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a nice soft chai tea scent, but it was beyond spicy in smell.  </li>
            <li>Never knew bee&#x27;s smelt so good naked!</li>
            <li>I love the light scent and how it makes my hands so soft!</li>
            <li>We love all Naked Bee products, but the Chai tea has to be our favorite.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth lotion, makes my skin so dang soft</li>
            <li>Chai tea is an amazing scent from the Naked Bee line.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and lingers just enough to make you want to smell and smell again.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hands feeling soft and has lovely smell.</li>
            <li>So exciting.</li>
            <li>We really liked the Orangebloosom Honey having purchased a bottle locally, but they do not always carry the product.</li>
            <li>If my allergies are acting up, I can&#x27;t use this lotion as the scent is very strong.</li>
            <li>One happy little naked bee, heehee :)</li>
            <li>I have always loved the spicy smell of Chai, and to have a lotion that smells exactly like it and make my skin super soft is such a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying that the other smells that the Naked Bee makes aren&#x27;t good, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly at work, and my whole office has a soft scent to it, everyone loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell put me off first</li>
            <li>I would purchase more Naked Bee</li>
            <li>I buy this for my wife to use as most of the lotions out there make me sneeze but not the Chai Tea Lotion from Naked Bee.</li>
            <li>I love Naked Bee lotion and Chai Tea</li>
            <li>so well she went back and bought 2 more containers.  </li>
            <li>first tried this scent as a store sample...</li>
            <li>It is rich, alluringly scented and leaves your skin baby soft.</li>
            <li>The Naked Bee Chai Tea Moisturizing Hand and Body Lotion leaves your skin feeling soft and silky, and I love the fresh smell of the Chai Tea scent.  </li>
            <li>Amazon is the best place to find little known, unique and hard to find products.  </li>
            <li>it is a quiet, rich exotic aroma--think Arabian nights--a touch mysterious...</li>
            <li>Will certainly buy again.  </li>
            <li>Lovely, subtle lingering scent (a bit strong at first, but then softens)...</li>
            <li>Highly recomend!</li>
            <li>The scent is very relaxing and the lotion is rehydrating.</li>
            <li>I wish it was available in a larger size.</li>
            <li>I love the way it sinks into your skin</li>
            <li>Soaks in fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion and the smell</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion</li>
            <li>Not sure where to begin because I love this product!</li>
            <li>The only draw-back for me is that it would work better if it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li>but the lotion is high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on sensitive noses.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had no negative change since using this product on my face.</li>
            <li>I just love the small and it really works well on my hands.</li>
            <li>Although Naked Bee does not make all the scents that Shadows &amp; Light did (and they are named differently), I was completely overjoyed to see that they were making a few of my favorite scents:</li>
            <li>skin is very sensitive to lotions..</li>
            <li>First became familiar with it in a small store in another town while on vacation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any break outs with this lotion, a little goes a long way...and it feels so nice on, and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>The scent is misleading as far as it smelling like tea.</li>
            <li>It smelled like the old man scent of Old Spice cologne.  </li>
            <li>and I consider myself sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The old product stayed on my skin all day until I took a shower.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft</li>
            <li>Too much hassle to send it back.</li>
            <li>Interestingly, most of the negative comments I&#x27;ve received are from women.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to use it everyday.</li>
            <li>Well this seems a little pricey, it is worth it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I use it mostly at work, and my whole office has a soft scent to it, everyone loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smell put me off first</li>
            <li> I would purchase more Naked Bee</li>
            <li> I buy this for my wife to use as most of the lotions out there make me sneeze but not the Chai Tea Lotion from Naked Bee.</li>
            <li> I love Naked Bee lotion and Chai Tea</li>
            <li> so well she went back and bought 2 more containers.  </li>
            <li> first tried this scent as a store sample...</li>
            <li> It is rich, alluringly scented and leaves your skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> The Naked Bee Chai Tea Moisturizing Hand and Body Lotion leaves your skin feeling soft and silky, and I love the fresh smell of the Chai Tea scent.  </li>
            <li> Amazon is the best place to find little known, unique and hard to find products.  </li>
            <li> it is a quiet, rich exotic aroma--think Arabian nights--a touch mysterious...</li>
            <li> Will certainly buy again.  </li>
            <li> Lovely, subtle lingering scent (a bit strong at first, but then softens)...</li>
            <li> Highly recomend!</li>
            <li> The scent is very relaxing and the lotion is rehydrating.</li>
            <li> I wish it was available in a larger size.</li>
            <li> I love the way it sinks into your skin</li>
            <li> Soaks in fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion and the smell</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion</li>
            <li> Not sure where to begin because I love this product!</li>
            <li> The only draw-back for me is that it would work better if it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> but the lotion is high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on sensitive noses.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had no negative change since using this product on my face.</li>
            <li> I just love the small and it really works well on my hands.</li>
            <li> Although Naked Bee does not make all the scents that Shadows &amp; Light did (and they are named differently), I was completely overjoyed to see that they were making a few of my favorite scents:</li>
            <li> skin is very sensitive to lotions..</li>
            <li> First became familiar with it in a small store in another town while on vacation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any break outs with this lotion, a little goes a long way...and it feels so nice on, and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> The scent is misleading as far as it smelling like tea.</li>
            <li> It smelled like the old man scent of Old Spice cologne.  </li>
            <li> and I consider myself sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The old product stayed on my skin all day until I took a shower.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft</li>
            <li> Too much hassle to send it back.</li>
            <li> Interestingly, most of the negative comments I&#x27;ve received are from women.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Well this seems a little pricey, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I wet my hands with warm water and mix the lotion with it to thin it a little.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s rather diluted and doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> Could not live without my Naked Bee Chi!</li>
            <li> Will continue to order as long as I can afford to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> M Naked Bee ORANGE BLOSSOM HONEY Hand body lotion 8 oz]]) don&#x27;t last a long time, but for a little bit, yes.</li>
            <li> My hands get so dry and the lotion leaves them moisturized without feeling sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> Although I kept the green tea due to liking it I would have rather not spent the extra money.</li>
            <li> The only missing component for me is that I&#x27;d like it richer.  </li>
            <li> Everyone who tries this loves it.</li>
            <li> One thing to note: I have both the chai and sandalwood scents and neither smells like I expected.</li>
            <li> , I like the smell (but it&#x27;s not really chai), and I thought it worked well.  </li>
            <li> usually get dry skin after my showers and have used a lot of different lotions</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have only tried the orange blossom in the past.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s not worth the price anymore.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I was given half a bottle of lotion that turned out to be this and spent a year looking for it.</li>
            <li> Not available in my hometown</li>
            <li> Moisturizers and hand sanitizers with alcohol can really destroy your manicure.  </li>
            <li> Chai Tea but inside was Green Tea.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for someone who used the product in the past.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product in Colorado in a small store where they were using it as a sample.  </li>
            <li> That is a very disgusting smell, don&#x27;t want to, but I am trying to toss the whole bottle away.</li>
            <li> None of the bad stuff.</li>
            <li> I keep thinking maybe it was just a bad batch, but it isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> some will break me out bad if I touch my face etc...</li>
            <li> While I myself think the scent isn&#x27;t so bad, some of my colleagues and clients really hate it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wonderful, heady but not too powerful. .  Reminds me of the sixties and all the wonderful new fragrances.  Hints of sandlewood.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this lotion for years. I just love the scent and great lotion. So glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> not greasy! light non-perfumey smell.  Will certainly buy again.  Because of the natural product it&#x27;s nice to use for children also!</li>
            <li> I will have to buy a bunch for the holidays. The scent is misleading as far as it smelling like tea. It has a beautiful and comforting herbal scent. I get lots of compliments- esp. from my hubby.</li>
            <li> This is one of the BEST hand lotions i&#x27;ve ever used!  It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs fast and smells great!  Chai Tea is my favorite scent! Naked Bee products are great!  Good value!    Highly recomend!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for someone who used the product in the past. She loves it! The scent is very relaxing and the lotion is rehydrating. This product was shipped well, in a sealed bag that was then taped with packing tape, secured to a piece of cardboard to prevent rattling around in the box. I would recommend this product as well as the vendor.</li>
            <li> Well this seems a little pricey, it is worth it. I love the smell the ingredients and how it works</li>
            <li> I understand that treatment lines and cosmetics are totally subjective.  That being said, I am grateful that I found Naked Bee Chai Tea H &amp; B Lotion.  I&#x27;ve used the first bottle and will order more.  Having tried MANY lotions, this comes the closest to perfection.  Lovely, subtle lingering scent (a bit strong at first, but then softens)...and though it doesn&#x27;t smell like chai tea...it is a quiet, rich exotic aroma--think Arabian nights--a touch mysterious...ahhhh.  The only missing component for me is that I&#x27;d like it richer.  After applying, minutes later I often reapply because I&#x27;m seeking that silky comfort.  I do recommend this, though, for your experimentation and enjoyment.  It&#x27;s lovely scent is captivating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/26/13:  Well, I&#x27;ve just purchased my fifth bottle and I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.  My husband loves the scent.  I apply a heavier amount for richness...and the stuff smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Chai tea is an amazing scent from the Naked Bee line. Honestly the best scent out of all of them. The lotion absorbs perfectly and does notttt leave a greasy after tone</li>
            <li> I used these products when they were made by Shadows &amp; Light.  Although Naked Bee does not make all the scents that Shadows &amp; Light did (and they are named differently), I was completely overjoyed to see that they were making a few of my favorite scents: Chai Tea, Orange Blossom Honey &amp; Sandalwood.  It&#x27;s the only lotion I use.  The scents are BEYOND!  You can wear this lotion like a perfume.  When your skin warms it will give off a beautiful scent.  Like they say....  All of the good stuff...None of the bad stuff.</li>
            <li> My daughter gave me this as a Christmas gift. I love the light scent and how it makes my hands so soft!</li>
            <li> Favorite lotion in the whole world. Smells amazing, I use this on my wrists before I do yoga or before I go to bed to help with breathing exercises. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this smell of this lotion.  Great for hands, knees and shoulders after evening shower.  My experience has been that it helps me rest better and sleep easier at night.  First became familiar with it in a small store in another town while on vacation.  Could not locate it at home.  Amazon is the best place to find little known, unique and hard to find products.  Also, sales or package deals made this purchase even more attractive.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product in Colorado in a small store where they were using it as a sample.  Immediately loved it.  Not available in my hometown so I love that Amazon carries it.  I am no scientist but the ingredients WORK</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this scent - it is earthy, spicy, woody.  The lotion is silky and despite the strong scent I am able to use it on my face  (although not labeled as a face cream) and around my eyes without burning.  Had issues with pump on bottle not working but the lotion is high quality.</li>
            <li> Wonderful spicy smell, leaves hands soft, not greasy, made in USA, not animal tested, and alcohol free.  Moisturizers and hand sanitizers with alcohol can really destroy your manicure.  I only wish it came in bigger bottles so I wouldn&#x27;t have to re-order so often.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased this lotion. It is rich, alluringly scented and leaves your skin baby soft. The fragrance is exotic and lasts. I adore it and I&#x27;m excited to use it everyday. I receive many compliments on the scent. I wish it was available in a larger size.</li>
            <li> We love all Naked Bee products, but the Chai tea has to be our favorite.  Both my husband and I love the way it sinks into your skin, it&#x27;s not greasy &amp; just the perfect amount of lotion comes out of the pump for after handwashing by the sink.  The smell is amazing and lingers just enough to make you want to smell and smell again.  The Naked Bee Chai Tea, it&#x27;s the best, although the Pomegranate, and the Orange Blossom are also nice.  But this one....my new favorite!! One happy little naked bee, heehee :)</li>
            <li> Everyone who tries this loves it. Scent lasts a ling time</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a nice soft chai tea scent, but it was beyond spicy in smell.  It smelled like the old man scent of Old Spice cologne.  I couldn&#x27;t even give it away.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Chai tea. When I received it te plastic was Chai Tea but inside was Green Tea. Amazon didn&#x27;t have a quantity of two in stock and they couldn&#x27;t garuntee it in time for Xmas. I had to go to another store and buy it from them. Although I kept the green tea due to liking it I would have rather not spent the extra money.</li>
            <li> The item arrived in perfect condition and I love the scent. I have only tried the orange blossom in the past. All naked bee products are terrific.</li>
            <li> Could not live without my Naked Bee Chi!</li>
            <li> this is the best lotion for dry skin in the winter.  I love the orange one better but figured I would try this.  It&#x27;s nice, but a bit spicey for me.....</li>
            <li> I love this product! It has a wonderful fragrance and does not leave your skin feeling greasy.  I purchase it regularly</li>
            <li> Very smooth lotion, makes my skin so dang soft I end up feeling myself up like a weirdo. Softness stayed even after some hand-washing. Soaks in fast. Smell put me off first and I&#x27;m a HUGE tea lover, but I have to say it smells better on you than from the bottle. Scents ( I have both this and the orange honey [[ASIN:B00117CH5M Naked Bee ORANGE BLOSSOM HONEY Hand body lotion 8 oz]]) don&#x27;t last a long time, but for a little bit, yes. Never knew bee&#x27;s smelt so good naked! Will continue to order as long as I can afford to.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m prone to acne and I consider myself sensitive skin but I&#x27;ve had no negative change since using this product on my face.</li>
            <li> I have had this product before and this smells GREAT and feels great on the skin. I would purchase more Naked Bee items.[[ASIN:B0014LQ9JA The Naked Bee Chai Tea Hand &amp; Body Lotion 8 oz lotion]]</li>
            <li> Love love love the chai tea lotion</li>
            <li> I use to use this product years ago and the smell was amazing but now it&#x27;s rather diluted and doesn&#x27;t last long.  The old product stayed on my skin all day until I took a shower.  I feel it&#x27;s not worth the price anymore.</li>
            <li> The Naked Bee Chai Tea Moisturizing Hand and Body Lotion leaves your skin feeling soft and silky, and I love the fresh smell of the Chai Tea scent.  This product is a light non-greasy lotion that absorbs nicely in the skin with no greasy residue.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love it!  smells so good.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my wife to use as most of the lotions out there make me sneeze but not the Chai Tea Lotion from Naked Bee. It&#x27;s gentle on sensitive noses.</li>
            <li> I love Naked Bee lotion and Chai Tea is my very favorite. We were selling it at the hospital gift shop where I volunteer and then they stopped carrying it. I receive lots of comments about how good I smell when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cookie Oates</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this line of lotions. My skin is so soft it&#x27;s ridiculous(ly good!). One thing to note: I have both the chai and sandalwood scents and neither smells like I expected. The smells are pleasant but very musky, think incense and patchouli.</li>
            <li> My wife found this at Brookgrenn Gardens in Myrtle Beach, SC.  She liked it so well she went back and bought 2 more containers.  She says &amp;#34; I love it and it stays with me all day&amp;#34;. You ladies out there know what she means.  She gave 2 containers too our friends and I bought 2 more here on Amazon at a cheaper price to replace them.  It comes in a couple different fragrances and I believe you will be very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Leaves hands feeling soft and has lovely smell. My hands get so dry and the lotion leaves them moisturized without feeling sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy anything from Naked Bee but I especially like this Chai Tea lotion.  It&#x27;s creamy but not greasy, absorbs easily, smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion and the smell is great; however, if you are sensitive to strong scents, this might not be for you. If my allergies are acting up, I can&#x27;t use this lotion as the scent is very strong. If you don&#x27;t have an issue with this kind of thing, I highly recommend this lotion. The smell is very spicy and reminds me of a warm cup of Chai. The coverage is nice and it keeps my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I was given half a bottle of lotion that turned out to be this and spent a year looking for it. Turns out it wasn&#x27;t locally distributed except at one flea market in a completely different smell. I&#x27;m not saying that the other smells that the Naked Bee makes aren&#x27;t good, but this one is my favorite. I absolutely love it. Finally, I wised up and just looked it up on here and got it the very next day. So exciting.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time - great product.</li>
            <li> I love Naked Bee Chai Tea lotion is the best I have ever used. Not greasy and the scent is mellow and not over bearing. I get a lot of comments from ladies around&lt;br /&gt;me wanting to know what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> Not sure where to begin because I love this product! For so many reasons. Arrived in perfect condition! Thanks</li>
            <li> Smells and feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> I had ordered Orangebloosom Honey lotion, but recieved Chai Tea aroma lotion. I was dissapointed so was my spouse. Too much hassle to send it back. So I will try to find our prefered aroma at a later time. We really liked the Orangebloosom Honey having purchased a bottle locally, but they do not always carry the product.</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion offset anything I have ever liked about Chai Tea! That is a very disgusting smell, don&#x27;t want to, but I am trying to toss the whole bottle away. I keep thinking maybe it was just a bad batch, but it isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, I like the smell (but it&#x27;s not really chai), and I thought it worked well.  The only draw-back for me is that it would work better if it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> We had a party and I put this in the bathroom for the guests; got rave reviews on it.  I love it as well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and company - I love this lotion for its creamy smoothness and light clean smell. I wish we carried it locally - I would have it stocked all the time!</li>
            <li> I use it as an after shave lotion and body lotion. I wet my hands with warm water and mix the lotion with it to thin it a little. Not greasy. The chai is a nice scent.</li>
            <li> It smells so good! I have always loved the spicy smell of Chai, and to have a lotion that smells exactly like it and make my skin super soft is such a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;I usually get dry skin after my showers and have used a lot of different lotions but this one makes my skin so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> greatâ€¦very strong scent</li>
            <li> I think this has true aromatic value!  I just love the small and it really works well on my hands.</li>
            <li> It smells swell and feels fabulously smooth - not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Good price, too.  Recommend this product to all&lt;br /&gt;scented-lotion shoppers.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! It smells absolutely awesome... always lots of compliments! I buy it every 2 or 3 months.</li>
            <li> Love the product and light aroma.</li>
            <li> While I myself think the scent isn&#x27;t so bad, some of my colleagues and clients really hate it. My supervisor cannot stand being in the elevator with me if I am wearing this chai tea lotion stuff! I have received many comments from many different individuals about the offensiveness of the scent (it is a bit strong and has a bite to it). Interestingly, most of the negative comments I&#x27;ve received are from women. I am not making any implications, just an observation.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on the Chai Tea lotion scent!  I use it mostly at work, and my whole office has a soft scent to it, everyone loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried this scent as a store sample...I walked out of the store...but all day (even after several hand washings) kept getting whiffs of it...I HAD to go back and buy it!  I&#x27;ve been hooked since!  I love that I can come onto Amazon and get it at such a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried the Orange Blossom Honey scent...which is also very nice, but CHAI TEA is the way to go!!!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive to lotions..some will break me out bad if I touch my face etc...I&#x27;ve never had any break outs with this lotion, a little goes a long way...and it feels so nice on, and is not greasy.  VERY good for your skin!</li>
