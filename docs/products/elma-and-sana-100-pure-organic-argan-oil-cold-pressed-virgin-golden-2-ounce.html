            <li>/&gt;Although it causes me break outs, I could feel how good this product is.</li>
            <li>Please do not ever raise the price and be as good as you are now.  </li>
            <li>I loved the sample I had received from the online vendor (NOT QVC).  </li>

            <li>It is a good Argan oil.</li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>It is still a good value</li>
            <li>I like dropper as it can dispense a good amount of product.</li>
            <li>i ordered the .5 oz of josie maran argan oil and absolutely loved the effect it had on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying coconut oil instead and loved it.</li>
            <li>this is just as good</li>
            <li>just as good as Josie Maran.</li>
            <li>I have fairly oily hair, so I have to wash it every day or else</li>
            <li>Good for nails/cuticles and adds softness and shine to hair.</li>
            <li>Good oil for hair care.</li>
            <li>Have been using it on my face/hair with good results.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love it~!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t realize is that this oil is good for so much more!</li>
            <li>I ordered a bottle of this oil and was very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Happy Shopping &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>But then I found this and couldn&#x27;t be more happy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking I can get rid of a lot of lotions, creams, conditioners and have a lot more room in my bathroom now!</li>
            <li>It looks so much better now!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>

            <li>I received a sample of 100% argan oil with a hair straightener I purchased and fell in love with the oil!</li>

            <li>Furthermore, my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing oil for the skin.</li>
            <li>Also makes a great eye area moisturizer when lightly dabbed around the eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made an amazing difference in the suppleness and level of moisturization in my skin, and it does not irritatte my rosacea at all  </li>
            <li>I ordered and it is just amazing</li>
            <li>a really amazing product for all skin types, even oily skin as i have.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff...consistently good oil.</li>

            <li>This one is in a nice sized bottle also.</li>
            <li>I use this on my bi-racial daughter&#x27;s hair and on my own 4c hair.</li>
            <li>I use it at night after using Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal and Aloe Witch Hazel.  </li>
            <li>Very good product, with very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>VERY Pleased  with my  Purchase &#x3D;)&lt;</li>
            <li>, it is a wonderful skin moisturizer as well as a good carrier oil for essential oil massages.</li>
            <li>And I would pay a lot more for this magic oil!</li>
            <li>and this took it right away!!!</li>
            <li>After using it the first time my hair became shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also worked wonders on my son&#x27;s sunburn - all around a great product, definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Works good, compared to Jose Maran it seems to be pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have, well had very fine lines around my eyes (crows feet) and they were GONE with in a week.</li>
            <li>I  love, love, love this oil!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and non-greasy, and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakout.</li>
            <li>its very light</li>
            <li>I love argan oil.</li>
            <li>use this bottle mostly as a supplement to body lotion.</li>
            <li>For my face &amp; hair, I prefer another brand for it&#x27;s thicker, more elastic texture.</li>
            <li>Not  oily shiny, just healthy shiny.</li>
            <li>More than that</li>
            <li>With proper use, it is a great product!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d say it works better for skin than hair.</li>
            <li>i love this oil.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found it.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>and most people think I&#x27;m 38-39.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>size is such a great value!!!!</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful as a facial moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>My favorite product.</li>
            <li>I love to use this on my hands and feet or any part of my body that needs moisture.  </li>
            <li>Looking in the mirror, I cannot give it a perfect 5 as I have only used it one day</li>
            <li>My skin and hair love this oil.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this more than once and the more I use it</li>
            <li>the better my skin has been.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels like velvet with this lovely oil.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better than ever.  </li>
            <li>I have been using for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many moisturizers over the years.  </li>
            <li>They are much better but continue to drink this stuff in....</li>
            <li>or I think better than Josie Marian</li>
            <li>I love this argan oil from Elma &amp; Sana.</li>
            <li>and I am still in love with this brand&#x27;s argan oil.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love the price and quality.</li>
            <li>I Love it and would recommend it</li>
            <li>Aloe vera, milk soap and argan oil :)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff..</li>
            <li>many uses including face and hair..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they will take care of you.</li>
            <li>no need to spend much more for this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better for your body to absorb this than something that is synthetic.</li>
            <li>and my skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel confident with this product.</li>
            <li>I have oily, acne-prone skin btw :)</li>
            <li>Have never used Argan Oil before, but this sure has me hooked.  </li>
            <li>I guess that means most argan oils have fragrance added, but for the price and the size this has lasted quite a while.</li>
            <li>Works magic.</li>
            <li>It really softens &amp; moisturizes very nicely.  </li>
            <li>After using it, my hair and nails are strong and shiny, and it&#x27;s the perfect facial oil as well -</li>
            <li>Smells great and moisturizes and softens skin and leaves hair soft.  </li>
            <li>It did make it look more shiny and smooth</li>
            <li>my mom and sister also loved it so much they took mine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands of Argan oil and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>i had a sample of josie maran argan oil and it worked great, but the price tag for the full sized product was way too high for me.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth, absorbs quickly and never leaves an oily feel on my face or hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have first tried argan oil from Sephora (the JM brand) and thought the oil was absolutely amazing but thought the price was way out of my range.</li>
            <li>I have pretty healthy hair, but now it has even more sheen to it.</li>
            <li>Works fine for that.</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair, and it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Fine lines around my eyes are deminishing.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t smell and the dropper works fine..</li>
            <li>I can say for sure that this oil has made my hair super shiny.</li>
            <li>packaged appropriately and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t experienced any of these special or unique benefits.</li>
            <li>I mix a couple of drops with my Lubriderm lotion for my hands, knees, and elbows, and it makes a huge difference in the texture of my skin.    </li>
            <li>I love this argan oil, it does not have a scent which is nice for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so I guess I should stop looking for the next great thing</li>
            <li>For the price I paid here (2oz $17), this was one of the better deals I&#x27;ve found... worth while.</li>
            <li>It goes into the skin smoothly and does not leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>My complexion is even and my skin is smooth.  </li>
            <li>It does have a rather unusual fragrance but not one that is offensive but actually kind of nutty.</li>
            <li>I apply it to my feet (heels especially) and my feet look great when wearing sandals and slippers.  </li>
            <li>Occassionally, I get compliments on my skin because it is so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Nice to see the 2 oz size at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The oil melted into my skin and it felt moisturizing yet light.  </li>
            <li>It helps my makeup lay smooth on my skin to where you can&#x27;t even tell I am wearing makeup at all.  </li>
            <li>Great price too when compared to my local health food store.</li>
            <li>My hands stay smooth for hours.  </li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s how you spell her name and its fabulous</li>
            <li>All it takes is three drops to smooth over my face and neck</li>
            <li>It took me couple of days to decide and I have finally decided to give this a try because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li>I bought this argan oil primarily for my face.  </li>
            <li>Argon il is a great facial moisturizer for skin.</li>
            <li>It does subside acne and leaves the skin smooth to touch.</li>
            <li>i enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Argan oil is great - only oil on the planet that doesn&#x27;t make you greasy!</li>
            <li>It soaks into your skin and makes it feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product!</li>
            <li>I would still recommend this , makes your skin nice and soft and a Dewy Healthy Look.</li>
            <li>I chose this brand primarily due to the fact that it&#x27;s fair trade, but it is also very high quality and a great bargain.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried it on the ends of my hair; again, it&#x27;s fine but nothing special.</li>
            <li>but this smell was very strong and it lingered so much that I had a headache</li>
            <li>Suppossed to be higher in vitamin E than most oils and nutritionally feeds the skin.</li>
            <li>I loved that it felt soft and light on my hands and face as well, as it&#x27;s distinct neutral odor.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, smells fantastic, and will make your hair smooth and soft and shine like gold.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily just nice and soft and I apply my makeup after and it just fine</li>
            <li>I have been watching to see if my marks fade faster using this, but I honestly can&#x27;t tell because I use many different products; it could be a combination of products including the argan oil.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not 100% natural, I prefer one &#x27;n only Argan Oil hair treatment which smells awesome.</li>
            <li>it is by far the best facial moisturizer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>light weight non  Greasy Oil that  Absorbs Quickly which makes me</li>
            <li>I have ordered other brands too, and they are nice, but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li>Also great for any dry body areas including around eyes and face.</li>
            <li>So far, I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>And the scent dissipates pretty quickly if you find you don&#x27;t love it like I do.</li>
            <li>Having been using this dail and leaves skin smooth and silky and great for hair especially when very frizzy, it seems to make the smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update : 9-9-13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had Recently Bought another Brand of Argan Oil and I am More Happy with New Item.</li>
            <li>Great oil for dry skin!</li>
            <li>I tried this because I got a special argan treatment for my her before</li>
            <li>Seen results right away!</li>
            <li>I love mine makes my skin softer than a baby best product for dry skin hands down I will buy over and over even getting my sister to get it instead of Jose&#x27;s love</li>
            <li>but I apply it to a clean face and it has not caused my face to be super oily, nor has it caused any breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Good enough for me!</li>
            <li>and it helps define my curls nicely while keeping my hair naturally hydrated.</li>
            <li>Better than spending twice as much retail.</li>
            <li>It smells so nice and natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s NOT bad, it just reminds me of olive oil (without the smell).  </li>
            <li>Other than that great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product, at a great price, I will be purchasing the 4oz bottle next time, and I will probably buy a few of these as gifts for my family members!</li>
            <li>Although Argan oil is supposed to absorb quickly, I don&#x27;t think it does.  </li>
            <li>You do have rub it in, like any face or hand cream, but it is not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Argan oil will be a tremendous blessing in fighting the aging process.  </li>
            <li>Virgin oil has a fairly distinctive scent reminiscent of olives, which dissipates once it is absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to wash your hands after, just rub it into your skin for smooth, soft, healthy hands.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Elma&amp;Sana absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy on my face.</li>
            <li>There are extraordinary claims made about Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes after the reviews because I love the reviews for helpful info.</li>
            <li>I can tell my hair is much more nourished, and the color is much more vibrant than normal.</li>
            <li>experience with this oil is great and nothing like the above, it absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It gives me less fly always a and helps protect from heat.</li>
            <li>It has a mild nutty smell that I like, and it is golden.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting compliments from much younger people on how beautiful my 71 year old skin looks.</li>
            <li>I use this on my dry hair, its a really good price compared to the argon oil they sell at sephora thats $50 dollars.</li>
            <li>i really loved this for my hands, which get dry and cracked during winter.  </li>
            <li>love this particular brand because it is very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>It really does seem to make the skin smoother and works nicely on fine lines.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair</li>
            <li>but this is really a cheap way to REALLY improve your skin.  </li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s so light and absorbs so fast, you can put on your makeup over it, so it can be used day and night.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to enjoy the benefits of it but no luck for me.</li>
            <li>I USE THIS FOLLOWING HYALURONIC ACID, AND IT LEAVES A NICE FINISH.  </li>
            <li>It smooths on as an oil, but is quickly absorbed into the skin without leaving an oily shine on the skin.</li>
            <li>I rarely put any product in my hair anymore for styling....</li>
            <li>once the oil is absorbed (2 or 3 minutes?)</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d apply this in the morning and refill my coffee while i waited for the oil to be absorbed before i put on foundation.  </li>
            <li>however, the smell dissipates quickly and i got used to it very fast.  </li>
            <li>I mix it with other oils though since I don&#x27;t think one ingredient is good for everything, but this moisturizes without breaking me out.</li>
            <li>I try to apply some to my ends every night before I wrap my hair and right away when I brush my hair</li>
            <li>I seeps right through the skin without any greasy feeling.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and soaks right in.</li>
            <li>Penetrates right into the skin and hair.</li>
            <li>This particular oil from Elma and Sana is rich and decadent.</li>
            <li>Instead of paying 100 dollars for a bottle of 100% pure pressed from Sephoras,  I can just get it off Amazon for almost 9 times cheaper!</li>
            <li>I found that it was absorbing SO quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very healing, glides onto skin smoothly, and is quickly absorbing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful, doesn&#x27;t leave your skin or hair (if you only use a few drops) greasy.</li>
            <li>The price per oz. was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>light and non-greasy, pleasant &amp; light smell, works very well with my flat iron and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I can rate this fairly, as the top of it was crooked and didn&#x27;t twist shut completely causing it to spill out most of the contents before I had the chance to use it.</li>
            <li>its a 100% Pure Argan Oil and worth every cent, they guarantee it.</li>
            <li>I had a huge breakout, but as soon as I got my argan oil back, it cleared the breakout right up!  </li>
            <li>Sadly, it is not for me.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and I apply it around my eyes mostly, or as part of my home facial regimen.</li>
            <li>The scent is very similar to toasted sesame oil, which I love.</li>
            <li>i had no redness and my acne looked so much clearer than the day before!</li>
            <li>and my husband asked what the funny smell was.  </li>
            <li>Much thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks Elma &amp; Sana, and Amazon!</li>
            <li>Just make sure argan oil is only ingredient, 100%!</li>
            <li>The product shipped on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I consider myself an Argan Oil expert ever since it came out several years ago in the states.  </li>
            <li>my first  use on  skin , it was smooth and soft, felt youthful..  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>This was the first argan oil I have tried.</li>
            <li>It was unusual to place oil on my face at first, but it is quickly absorbed and does leave your face, neck, or hands feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it daily.  </li>
            <li>I like this product, but I haven&#x27;t used it enough to tell if I love it yet.  </li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described...got one for myself and one for friend.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This is my third bottle and since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair has been growing a lot better.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Within a week, I got a replacement in the mail, along with extra bottles and one free argan oil soap as gifts!</li>
            <li>My face is absolutely glowing!</li>
            <li>This Elma &amp; Sana bottle is not the same at all -- smells slightly more \\&quot;woody\\&quot; and is way thinner -- which wouldn&#x27;t be an issue if it worked as well.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t go wrong, this is the best!  </li>
            <li>but I still have enough for like 5 months or more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it has some purpose, but face/hair is definitely not it.</li>
            <li>I loved this oil, it really softened the skin of my hands and face, helped sooth my cracked cuticles and nails, and made my face significantly less oily.</li>
            <li>generally use Coconut oil in my hair, about a pea size amount on damp hair is good for a little frizz free shine.  </li>
            <li>(I never got acne of any kind with other brands of argan oil).</li>
            <li>I think it is just as good as the much more expensive argan oil I used to use.  </li>
            <li>This is just as good as the more expensive oil.  </li>
            <li>My hair was super soft!</li>
            <li>I have used Watts in the past with no problems and good results</li>
            <li>Makes my skin super soft but not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I used this under my Boscia Intensive Night Cream, and my face was feeling super moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>IT HAS NO ADDITIVES, JUST PURE ARGAN OIL.</li>
            <li>Any brand that is 100% pure argan oil should work, I like this brand</li>
            <li>in all, you gotta think that this product is 100% pure and organic.</li>
            <li>100% pure argan oil is supposed to.</li>
            <li>I have no reason to believe that this isn&#x27;t pure.</li>
            <li>This product is good, but it wasn&#x27;t enough for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a good product, especially for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Used it on my hair and face; both absorbed quickly and left the smoothest skin/hair ever.</li>
            <li>I use this on my face only, I feel that it would be too oily for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I use argan oil along with my regular moisturizers for fine lines and wrinkles on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if I really got 100% pure Argon oil.</li>
            <li>I had seen the product on QVC dozens of times but felt the price was pretty high.  </li>
            <li>I use emu and jojoba oils and really like them and have no issues</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to get this for my skin because I read that argan oil is acnegenic, but I needed something moisturizing and gentle for after I exfoliate, so I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use much though</li>
            <li>This could be because I&#x27;m using too much at one time...</li>
            <li>Argan Oil can be added to hair products, body lotions or straight to the skin.</li>
            <li>this really is miracle oil.</li>
            <li>Argan oil is really miraculous for healing skin and shrinking pores.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>NO wonder it was cheaper than the real versions.</li>
            <li>and I have relief for the whole day.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very well, just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Here, ive read the  reviews in which made it Very Helpful to Purchase from seller.&lt;br /&gt;its  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>and I can really tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my hair felt very sticky.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
            <li>All you need is one drop of argon oil and it makes your hair really silky.</li>
            <li>but the acne cycle lasted 2 weeks in which I hid in my house the whole time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-30s, people always say that I look like a 20ish girl thanks to my argan oil.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes and eyebrows Grew Really Fast.</li>
            <li>It helps the application of my make-up go on so much easier.  </li>
            <li>This product, no lie, makes your face feel baby smooth the next morning.</li>
            <li>Note: I have medium thick/normal hair (that I&#x27;m trying to grow out) and very dry/sensitive</li>
            <li>, they contact you and they get the product out fast.  </li>
            <li>The only added benefit I can see is that it is more natural than putting all those chemicals on your skin.</li>
            <li>It also left my hair and bangs incredibly greasy where they brushed my face, which again is something that the other brands of oil had not done.</li>
            <li>This oil did work to disguise my split ends, but it kind of leaves them a bit sticky, and not easy to run my fingers through.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product... Can be used by itself or  mixed with any other hair product.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>The pros: it&#x27;s more spreadable, glides well, and there&#x27;s virtually no smell compared to other bottles.</li>
            <li>Smells better than other brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better of a price than other \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; argan oils, too.  </li>
            <li>So I just returned the other product to the ebay seller, and ordered one more of these for my cousin in Europe.</li>
            <li>maybe 2 more around where its dry and when my hair dries its very moisturized and looks alive.</li>
            <li>This left my face smooth and soft, and didn&#x27;t make me break out at all,which is surprising since it is a thick oil.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised at how much I like this argan oil!  </li>
            <li>I still use the oil on the ends, since I did not cut all of the damage off with the new cut (as that would&#x27;ve been way too drastic!)</li>
            <li>However, the bulb for the dropper does easily separate from the bottle, so I have to be careful.  </li>
            <li>I mainly bought it for my hair though.  </li>
            <li>I was sent a sample of Argan Oil from a particular online vendor as a sample.  </li>
            <li>It essentially the same thing as JM&#x27;s or better.</li>
            <li>If the second bottle is consistent with the quality of the first one, I&#x27;ll add that to my review.</li>
            <li>the only downside that i can think of to using this as a moisturizer is that many facial moisturizing creams come with sunblock built in.  </li>
            <li>but I prefer not to pay for the high price of Josie Maran&#x27;s oil</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen other organic argan oils for easily twice the price.</li>
            <li>a light Olive like Smell that goes away after it sinks into skin.. which doesent bother me or trigger allergies</li>
            <li>My hair just never dried and looked very greasy.</li>
            <li>Had to use other oils with it, but other than that this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Rubbing a few drops of argan oil in your hair will make your hair shine and keep it healthy.</li>
            <li>Its says to use it then apply normal moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a fresh glow the next day after every application.</li>
            <li>Many hand lotions give the illusion of softness and moisture for an hour or so, then the dry, cracking skin is back.  </li>
            <li>I love this for my skin and use it daily to keep the dry skin at bay.  </li>
            <li>New scars can be massaged with this and it helps to keep the scar tissue supple.</li>
            <li>I use it under my foundation and at night on a newly washed face.  </li>
            <li>I live in a desert climate and couldn&#x27;t wait to get this in the mail today.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin but no problems with  this oil.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very very soft.</li>
            <li>Ok not sure if it works</li>
            <li>helped my super dry skin!</li>
            <li>Wow, I have curly hair, makes it look like ringlets!</li>
            <li>The first bottle I used had almost no odor, and the second bottle has some odor.  </li>
            <li>This oil absorbs slightly better on my skin, but my face does not feel as moisturized the next day; meaning I usually have to still use a thicker cream on top of the argan oil -- which I didn&#x27;t have to with the other.</li>
            <li>I had purchased oil from Mogador Argan oil in the past (and was pleased with it) and thought I&#x27;d get another bottle of argan oil for my mom for mother&#x27;s day, so I thought I&#x27;d try the Elma &amp; Sana brand.</li>
            <li>its not completely fragrance free, there is a VERY slight odor (not bad)</li>
            <li>After shower, I rub a couple of drops of the argan oil into the ends of my hair and it makes them smooth, shiny and less</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not heavy, makes my skin very soft (on my face and face).</li>
            <li>i went through it so quickly that i searched for an equal product at a lesser price.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a massive difference in my skin like how some people say, but it moisturizes well enough without the super greasy feel.</li>
            <li>Other argan oils I have used have no odor; and quickly absorb.  </li>
            <li>You have to watch how much you use, because it can give your hair this &#x27;wet&#x27; look on the ends, extend blow dryer time if you use too much, and leave your hair feeling sticky, not silky.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I forgot this at my boyfriends house for two days straight and had to use my old synthetic face moisturizer, and obviously my skin could tell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised</li>
            <li>So far my experience has been alright.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and moisturized - but not oily - all day.</li>
            <li>I also mix in a couple of drops with my Redken hair wax, and it keeps my hair soft instead of sticky.    </li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>use it to my hair too, and it makes the hair soft and</li>
            <li>my face has never been this soft and dewy before using it.</li>
            <li>Nothing else works like this to keep both my hands and my lips well hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li>it keeps my skin soft and not dried out.  </li>
            <li>It soaks in instantly and really moisturizes.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does make your skin look younger.  </li>
            <li>Another reason to think about  purchasing Argan Oil : its a natural solution to defend the skin against premature aging and UV exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Currently I&#x27;ve been doing some research and also I&#x27;ve learned that some places mix real Argan with sunflower/other oils ...</li>
            <li>It does sink into the skin well and makes it feel soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>However, because of the price, I will continue to search for a moisturizer that is both natural and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Anything the oil touches turns soft.</li>
            <li>I have young kids</li>
            <li>ladies, if you have any issues with your oil, just contact them directly.</li>
            <li>i do the same thing when i use moisturizing cream, so i wasn&#x27;t really adding time to my morning routine with this.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s really the only reason i gave this 4 stars instead of</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and shiny and skin stays soft.</li>
            <li>I have hand eczema and it really soothes the itching and cracking open.</li>
            <li>My skin is fairly sensitive and I have had no problems with the oil.</li>
            <li>This is a very reasonably priced \\&quot;all purpose\\&quot; oil to use for everything from a face moisturizer to revitalizing brittle dry hair.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy at all and very light with a subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li>i bought this originally to tame frizzy hair, but ended up using it primarily as a moisturizer for my face, neck and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to help calm my somewhat frizzy hair due to winter-time dryness.</li>
            <li>It has a very slight nutty scent that is nearly  undetectable, but I add a little Neroli essential oil to it for the benefit of the scent and because it&#x27;s good for mature skin; however, you can use it as-is, too.  </li>
            <li>I use the most after I wash my hair when its wet I put like 7 drops on my ends from the midshaft down and</li>
            <li>It makes my face look younger and have less wrinkles, also makes it feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>When I opened my bottle to apply it to my face it smelled strongly rancid, not lightly nutty like my initial Modagor argan oil.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with a sample of the expensive JM oil and didn&#x27;t want to pay that much.</li>
            <li>Since I couldn&#x27;t use it on my hair, I did end up using most of it on my skin- rough elbows, arms, neck and sometimes a small but under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s this big skin miracle, but I will say I was surprised that I have not suffered a breakout using this on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for over three months, and have barely made a dent in this, and I use it every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>It even makes my adult acne go away when I use it regularly.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin glow and soft, especially during winter.</li>
            <li>This is just as effective as the expensive Argan oil.</li>
            <li>The ALMA&amp;SANA argan oil had a slight smell when I first opened it, but after two days the smell is gone and this argan oil seems to be odorless now.  </li>
            <li>A little of the oil can be rubbed anywhere you need a little more moisture.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect your wrinkles to go away,but your skin will look dewy not dry.</li>
            <li>the oil/dirt would weigh my course (and straight) hair down.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin, but a few dry patches and a few fine wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>A must have if you have mature dry skin.</li>
            <li>it will leave for hair and skin feeling silky soft all while doing wonders for acne and dry skin.</li>
            <li>There were a few droppers full and I tried to use the oil that had spilled and collected in the plastic wrap, but it&#x27;s not really how I prefer to experience a product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and my skin type is mixed -- oily at the \\&quot;T\\&quot; while dry on the cheeks.</li>
            <li>Not too oily, absorbs quickly leave behind a soft glow.</li>
            <li>its 100 % pure and doesnt contain anything artificial which is important to me.</li>
            <li>I was tempted to try the more expensive brand of argan oil, but I just couldn&#x27;t spend that much money on so little product..</li>
            <li>Made my dry skin extremely greasy, so much so that even my fiance noticed.</li>

            <li> I researched online to find the best alternative to JM&#x27;s argan oil and read all the reviews.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a all around great product!</li>

            <li> Awesome oil!!  </li>
            <li> However, I do not find that this is a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product, but it is very good.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face as a moisturizer and it works very good</li>
            <li> being said, I recently experienced the best customer service from Elma&amp; Sana.</li>
            <li> It really is good stuff!  </li>
            <li> and I loved it!</li>
            <li> you will be very pleased!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great on hands and nails.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s great either.  </li>
            <li> Works great on neck area.</li>
            <li> this product is great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> but this Argan oil has helped and makes my hands and cuticles feel and look great.  </li>

            <li> This is a very effective product</li>

            <li> This is an amazing product!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing for hair, too!  </li>

            <li> great organic oil...use it on skin and hair for incredible results...:) ive used it for almost a year and my hair is amazing..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it causes me break outs, I could feel how good this product is.</li>
            <li> Please do not ever raise the price and be as good as you are now.  </li>
            <li> I loved the sample I had received from the online vendor (NOT QVC).  </li>
            <li> I take really good care of my skin</li>
            <li> It is a good Argan oil.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.</li>
            <li> It is still a good value</li>
            <li> I like dropper as it can dispense a good amount of product.</li>
            <li> i ordered the .5 oz of josie maran argan oil and absolutely loved the effect it had on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying coconut oil instead and loved it.</li>
            <li> this is just as good</li>
            <li> just as good as Josie Maran.</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily hair, so I have to wash it every day or else</li>
            <li> Good for nails/cuticles and adds softness and shine to hair.</li>
            <li> Good oil for hair care.</li>
            <li> Have been using it on my face/hair with good results.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love it~!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t realize is that this oil is good for so much more!</li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle of this oil and was very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Happy Shopping &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> But then I found this and couldn&#x27;t be more happy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking I can get rid of a lot of lotions, creams, conditioners and have a lot more room in my bathroom now!</li>
            <li> It looks so much better now!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love argan oil!  </li>
            <li> Love the dropper!  </li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of 100% argan oil with a hair straightener I purchased and fell in love with the oil!</li>
            <li> after writing this review and realizing how much i liked it, i think i need to order some more!</li>
            <li> This argan oil is pure and wonderful for any skin type.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing oil for the skin.</li>
            <li> Also makes a great eye area moisturizer when lightly dabbed around the eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made an amazing difference in the suppleness and level of moisturization in my skin, and it does not irritatte my rosacea at all  </li>
            <li> I ordered and it is just amazing</li>
            <li> a really amazing product for all skin types, even oily skin as i have.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...consistently good oil.</li>
            <li> I do like that this oil does not have any smell, and the eye dropper is nice for controlled amounts.  </li>
            <li> My skin is loving it</li>
            <li> bought this for my mom and she liked a lot.</li>
            <li> This stuff is all-around good for you!!!</li>
            <li> This one is in a nice sized bottle also.</li>
            <li> I use this on my bi-racial daughter&#x27;s hair and on my own 4c hair.</li>
            <li> I use it at night after using Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal and Aloe Witch Hazel.  </li>
            <li> Very good product, with very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> VERY Pleased  with my  Purchase &#x3D;)&lt;</li>
            <li> , it is a wonderful skin moisturizer as well as a good carrier oil for essential oil massages.</li>
            <li> And I would pay a lot more for this magic oil!</li>
            <li> and this took it right away!!!</li>
            <li> After using it the first time my hair became shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also worked wonders on my son&#x27;s sunburn - all around a great product, definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Works good, compared to Jose Maran it seems to be pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have, well had very fine lines around my eyes (crows feet) and they were GONE with in a week.</li>
            <li> I  love, love, love this oil!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and non-greasy, and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakout.</li>
            <li> its very light</li>
            <li> I love argan oil.</li>
            <li> use this bottle mostly as a supplement to body lotion.</li>
            <li> For my face &amp; hair, I prefer another brand for it&#x27;s thicker, more elastic texture.</li>
            <li> Not  oily shiny, just healthy shiny.</li>
            <li> More than that</li>
            <li> With proper use, it is a great product!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d say it works better for skin than hair.</li>
            <li> i love this oil.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found it.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> and most people think I&#x27;m 38-39.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> size is such a great value!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful as a facial moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> My favorite product.</li>
            <li> I love to use this on my hands and feet or any part of my body that needs moisture.  </li>
            <li> Looking in the mirror, I cannot give it a perfect 5 as I have only used it one day</li>
            <li> My skin and hair love this oil.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this more than once and the more I use it</li>
            <li> the better my skin has been.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels like velvet with this lovely oil.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than ever.  </li>
            <li> I have been using for many years.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizers over the years.  </li>
            <li> They are much better but continue to drink this stuff in....</li>
            <li> or I think better than Josie Marian</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil from Elma &amp; Sana.</li>
            <li> and I am still in love with this brand&#x27;s argan oil.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love the price and quality.</li>
            <li> I Love it and would recommend it</li>
            <li> Aloe vera, milk soap and argan oil :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff..</li>
            <li> many uses including face and hair..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they will take care of you.</li>
            <li> no need to spend much more for this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better for your body to absorb this than something that is synthetic.</li>
            <li> and my skin has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel confident with this product.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone skin btw :)</li>
            <li> Have never used Argan Oil before, but this sure has me hooked.  </li>
            <li> I guess that means most argan oils have fragrance added, but for the price and the size this has lasted quite a while.</li>
            <li> Works magic.</li>
            <li> It really softens &amp; moisturizes very nicely.  </li>
            <li> After using it, my hair and nails are strong and shiny, and it&#x27;s the perfect facial oil as well -</li>
            <li> Smells great and moisturizes and softens skin and leaves hair soft.  </li>
            <li> It did make it look more shiny and smooth</li>
            <li> my mom and sister also loved it so much they took mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of Argan oil and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> i had a sample of josie maran argan oil and it worked great, but the price tag for the full sized product was way too high for me.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth, absorbs quickly and never leaves an oily feel on my face or hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have first tried argan oil from Sephora (the JM brand) and thought the oil was absolutely amazing but thought the price was way out of my range.</li>
            <li> I have pretty healthy hair, but now it has even more sheen to it.</li>
            <li> Works fine for that.</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair, and it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Fine lines around my eyes are deminishing.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell and the dropper works fine..</li>
            <li> I can say for sure that this oil has made my hair super shiny.</li>
            <li> packaged appropriately and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t experienced any of these special or unique benefits.</li>
            <li> I mix a couple of drops with my Lubriderm lotion for my hands, knees, and elbows, and it makes a huge difference in the texture of my skin.    </li>
            <li> I love this argan oil, it does not have a scent which is nice for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so I guess I should stop looking for the next great thing</li>
            <li> For the price I paid here (2oz $17), this was one of the better deals I&#x27;ve found... worth while.</li>
            <li> It goes into the skin smoothly and does not leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> My complexion is even and my skin is smooth.  </li>
            <li> It does have a rather unusual fragrance but not one that is offensive but actually kind of nutty.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my feet (heels especially) and my feet look great when wearing sandals and slippers.  </li>
            <li> Occassionally, I get compliments on my skin because it is so smooth.  </li>
            <li> Nice to see the 2 oz size at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The oil melted into my skin and it felt moisturizing yet light.  </li>
            <li> It helps my makeup lay smooth on my skin to where you can&#x27;t even tell I am wearing makeup at all.  </li>
            <li> Great price too when compared to my local health food store.</li>
            <li> My hands stay smooth for hours.  </li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s how you spell her name and its fabulous</li>
            <li> All it takes is three drops to smooth over my face and neck</li>
            <li> It took me couple of days to decide and I have finally decided to give this a try because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this argan oil primarily for my face.  </li>
            <li> Argon il is a great facial moisturizer for skin.</li>
            <li> It does subside acne and leaves the skin smooth to touch.</li>
            <li> i enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is great - only oil on the planet that doesn&#x27;t make you greasy!</li>
            <li> It soaks into your skin and makes it feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product!</li>
            <li> I would still recommend this , makes your skin nice and soft and a Dewy Healthy Look.</li>
            <li> I chose this brand primarily due to the fact that it&#x27;s fair trade, but it is also very high quality and a great bargain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried it on the ends of my hair; again, it&#x27;s fine but nothing special.</li>
            <li> but this smell was very strong and it lingered so much that I had a headache</li>
            <li> Suppossed to be higher in vitamin E than most oils and nutritionally feeds the skin.</li>
            <li> I loved that it felt soft and light on my hands and face as well, as it&#x27;s distinct neutral odor.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, smells fantastic, and will make your hair smooth and soft and shine like gold.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily just nice and soft and I apply my makeup after and it just fine</li>
            <li> I have been watching to see if my marks fade faster using this, but I honestly can&#x27;t tell because I use many different products; it could be a combination of products including the argan oil.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not 100% natural, I prefer one &#x27;n only Argan Oil hair treatment which smells awesome.</li>
            <li> it is by far the best facial moisturizer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> light weight non  Greasy Oil that  Absorbs Quickly which makes me</li>
            <li> I have ordered other brands too, and they are nice, but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Also great for any dry body areas including around eyes and face.</li>
            <li> So far, I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> And the scent dissipates pretty quickly if you find you don&#x27;t love it like I do.</li>
            <li> Having been using this dail and leaves skin smooth and silky and great for hair especially when very frizzy, it seems to make the smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update : 9-9-13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had Recently Bought another Brand of Argan Oil and I am More Happy with New Item.</li>
            <li> Great oil for dry skin!</li>
            <li> I tried this because I got a special argan treatment for my her before</li>
            <li> Seen results right away!</li>
            <li> I love mine makes my skin softer than a baby best product for dry skin hands down I will buy over and over even getting my sister to get it instead of Jose&#x27;s love</li>
            <li> but I apply it to a clean face and it has not caused my face to be super oily, nor has it caused any breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Good enough for me!</li>
            <li> and it helps define my curls nicely while keeping my hair naturally hydrated.</li>
            <li> Better than spending twice as much retail.</li>
            <li> It smells so nice and natural.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NOT bad, it just reminds me of olive oil (without the smell).  </li>
            <li> Other than that great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great product, at a great price, I will be purchasing the 4oz bottle next time, and I will probably buy a few of these as gifts for my family members!</li>
            <li> Although Argan oil is supposed to absorb quickly, I don&#x27;t think it does.  </li>
            <li> You do have rub it in, like any face or hand cream, but it is not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Argan oil will be a tremendous blessing in fighting the aging process.  </li>
            <li> Virgin oil has a fairly distinctive scent reminiscent of olives, which dissipates once it is absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to wash your hands after, just rub it into your skin for smooth, soft, healthy hands.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Elma&amp;Sana absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy on my face.</li>
            <li> There are extraordinary claims made about Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes after the reviews because I love the reviews for helpful info.</li>
            <li> I can tell my hair is much more nourished, and the color is much more vibrant than normal.</li>
            <li> experience with this oil is great and nothing like the above, it absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It gives me less fly always a and helps protect from heat.</li>
            <li> It has a mild nutty smell that I like, and it is golden.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting compliments from much younger people on how beautiful my 71 year old skin looks.</li>
            <li> I use this on my dry hair, its a really good price compared to the argon oil they sell at sephora thats $50 dollars.</li>
            <li> i really loved this for my hands, which get dry and cracked during winter.  </li>
            <li> love this particular brand because it is very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> It really does seem to make the skin smoother and works nicely on fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair</li>
            <li> but this is really a cheap way to REALLY improve your skin.  </li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s so light and absorbs so fast, you can put on your makeup over it, so it can be used day and night.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to enjoy the benefits of it but no luck for me.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS FOLLOWING HYALURONIC ACID, AND IT LEAVES A NICE FINISH.  </li>
            <li> It smooths on as an oil, but is quickly absorbed into the skin without leaving an oily shine on the skin.</li>
            <li> I rarely put any product in my hair anymore for styling....</li>
            <li> once the oil is absorbed (2 or 3 minutes?)</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d apply this in the morning and refill my coffee while i waited for the oil to be absorbed before i put on foundation.  </li>
            <li> however, the smell dissipates quickly and i got used to it very fast.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with other oils though since I don&#x27;t think one ingredient is good for everything, but this moisturizes without breaking me out.</li>
            <li> I try to apply some to my ends every night before I wrap my hair and right away when I brush my hair</li>
            <li> I seeps right through the skin without any greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Soaks right in without feeling oily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and soaks right in.</li>
            <li> Penetrates right into the skin and hair.</li>
            <li> This particular oil from Elma and Sana is rich and decadent.</li>
            <li> Instead of paying 100 dollars for a bottle of 100% pure pressed from Sephoras,  I can just get it off Amazon for almost 9 times cheaper!</li>
            <li> I found that it was absorbing SO quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very healing, glides onto skin smoothly, and is quickly absorbing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful, doesn&#x27;t leave your skin or hair (if you only use a few drops) greasy.</li>
            <li> The price per oz. was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> light and non-greasy, pleasant &amp; light smell, works very well with my flat iron and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I can rate this fairly, as the top of it was crooked and didn&#x27;t twist shut completely causing it to spill out most of the contents before I had the chance to use it.</li>
            <li> its a 100% Pure Argan Oil and worth every cent, they guarantee it.</li>
            <li> I had a huge breakout, but as soon as I got my argan oil back, it cleared the breakout right up!  </li>
            <li> Sadly, it is not for me.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> and I apply it around my eyes mostly, or as part of my home facial regimen.</li>
            <li> The scent is very similar to toasted sesame oil, which I love.</li>
            <li> i had no redness and my acne looked so much clearer than the day before!</li>
            <li> and my husband asked what the funny smell was.  </li>
            <li> Much thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks Elma &amp; Sana, and Amazon!</li>
            <li> Just make sure argan oil is only ingredient, 100%!</li>
            <li> The product shipped on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I consider myself an Argan Oil expert ever since it came out several years ago in the states.  </li>
            <li> my first  use on  skin , it was smooth and soft, felt youthful..  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> This was the first argan oil I have tried.</li>
            <li> It was unusual to place oil on my face at first, but it is quickly absorbed and does leave your face, neck, or hands feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it daily.  </li>
            <li> I like this product, but I haven&#x27;t used it enough to tell if I love it yet.  </li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described...got one for myself and one for friend.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle and since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair has been growing a lot better.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Within a week, I got a replacement in the mail, along with extra bottles and one free argan oil soap as gifts!</li>
            <li> My face is absolutely glowing!</li>
            <li> This Elma &amp; Sana bottle is not the same at all -- smells slightly more \\&quot;woody\\&quot; and is way thinner -- which wouldn&#x27;t be an issue if it worked as well.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong, this is the best!  </li>
            <li> but I still have enough for like 5 months or more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it has some purpose, but face/hair is definitely not it.</li>
            <li> I loved this oil, it really softened the skin of my hands and face, helped sooth my cracked cuticles and nails, and made my face significantly less oily.</li>
            <li> generally use Coconut oil in my hair, about a pea size amount on damp hair is good for a little frizz free shine.  </li>
            <li> (I never got acne of any kind with other brands of argan oil).</li>
            <li> I think it is just as good as the much more expensive argan oil I used to use.  </li>
            <li> This is just as good as the more expensive oil.  </li>
            <li> My hair was super soft!</li>
            <li> I have used Watts in the past with no problems and good results</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super soft but not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I used this under my Boscia Intensive Night Cream, and my face was feeling super moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li> IT HAS NO ADDITIVES, JUST PURE ARGAN OIL.</li>
            <li> Any brand that is 100% pure argan oil should work, I like this brand</li>
            <li> in all, you gotta think that this product is 100% pure and organic.</li>
            <li> 100% pure argan oil is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I have no reason to believe that this isn&#x27;t pure.</li>
            <li> This product is good, but it wasn&#x27;t enough for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, a good product, especially for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Used it on my hair and face; both absorbed quickly and left the smoothest skin/hair ever.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face only, I feel that it would be too oily for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I use argan oil along with my regular moisturizers for fine lines and wrinkles on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if I really got 100% pure Argon oil.</li>
            <li> I had seen the product on QVC dozens of times but felt the price was pretty high.  </li>
            <li> I use emu and jojoba oils and really like them and have no issues</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to get this for my skin because I read that argan oil is acnegenic, but I needed something moisturizing and gentle for after I exfoliate, so I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use much though</li>
            <li> This could be because I&#x27;m using too much at one time...</li>
            <li> Argan Oil can be added to hair products, body lotions or straight to the skin.</li>
            <li> this really is miracle oil.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is really miraculous for healing skin and shrinking pores.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> NO wonder it was cheaper than the real versions.</li>
            <li> and I have relief for the whole day.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very well, just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Here, ive read the  reviews in which made it Very Helpful to Purchase from seller.&lt;br /&gt;its  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> and I can really tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> I like this product very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my hair felt very sticky.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
            <li> All you need is one drop of argon oil and it makes your hair really silky.</li>
            <li> but the acne cycle lasted 2 weeks in which I hid in my house the whole time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-30s, people always say that I look like a 20ish girl thanks to my argan oil.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes and eyebrows Grew Really Fast.</li>
            <li> It helps the application of my make-up go on so much easier.  </li>
            <li> This product, no lie, makes your face feel baby smooth the next morning.</li>
            <li> Note: I have medium thick/normal hair (that I&#x27;m trying to grow out) and very dry/sensitive</li>
            <li> , they contact you and they get the product out fast.  </li>
            <li> The only added benefit I can see is that it is more natural than putting all those chemicals on your skin.</li>
            <li> It also left my hair and bangs incredibly greasy where they brushed my face, which again is something that the other brands of oil had not done.</li>
            <li> This oil did work to disguise my split ends, but it kind of leaves them a bit sticky, and not easy to run my fingers through.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product... Can be used by itself or  mixed with any other hair product.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> The pros: it&#x27;s more spreadable, glides well, and there&#x27;s virtually no smell compared to other bottles.</li>
            <li> Smells better than other brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better of a price than other \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; argan oils, too.  </li>
            <li> So I just returned the other product to the ebay seller, and ordered one more of these for my cousin in Europe.</li>
            <li> maybe 2 more around where its dry and when my hair dries its very moisturized and looks alive.</li>
            <li> This left my face smooth and soft, and didn&#x27;t make me break out at all,which is surprising since it is a thick oil.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised at how much I like this argan oil!  </li>
            <li> I still use the oil on the ends, since I did not cut all of the damage off with the new cut (as that would&#x27;ve been way too drastic!)</li>
            <li> However, the bulb for the dropper does easily separate from the bottle, so I have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> I mainly bought it for my hair though.  </li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of Argan Oil from a particular online vendor as a sample.  </li>
            <li> It essentially the same thing as JM&#x27;s or better.</li>
            <li> If the second bottle is consistent with the quality of the first one, I&#x27;ll add that to my review.</li>
            <li> the only downside that i can think of to using this as a moisturizer is that many facial moisturizing creams come with sunblock built in.  </li>
            <li> but I prefer not to pay for the high price of Josie Maran&#x27;s oil</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other organic argan oils for easily twice the price.</li>
            <li> a light Olive like Smell that goes away after it sinks into skin.. which doesent bother me or trigger allergies</li>
            <li> My hair just never dried and looked very greasy.</li>
            <li> Had to use other oils with it, but other than that this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Rubbing a few drops of argan oil in your hair will make your hair shine and keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> Its says to use it then apply normal moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a fresh glow the next day after every application.</li>
            <li> Many hand lotions give the illusion of softness and moisture for an hour or so, then the dry, cracking skin is back.  </li>
            <li> I love this for my skin and use it daily to keep the dry skin at bay.  </li>
            <li> New scars can be massaged with this and it helps to keep the scar tissue supple.</li>
            <li> I use it under my foundation and at night on a newly washed face.  </li>
            <li> I live in a desert climate and couldn&#x27;t wait to get this in the mail today.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin but no problems with  this oil.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very very soft.</li>
            <li> Ok not sure if it works</li>
            <li> helped my super dry skin!</li>
            <li> Wow, I have curly hair, makes it look like ringlets!</li>
            <li> The first bottle I used had almost no odor, and the second bottle has some odor.  </li>
            <li> This oil absorbs slightly better on my skin, but my face does not feel as moisturized the next day; meaning I usually have to still use a thicker cream on top of the argan oil -- which I didn&#x27;t have to with the other.</li>
            <li> I had purchased oil from Mogador Argan oil in the past (and was pleased with it) and thought I&#x27;d get another bottle of argan oil for my mom for mother&#x27;s day, so I thought I&#x27;d try the Elma &amp; Sana brand.</li>
            <li> its not completely fragrance free, there is a VERY slight odor (not bad)</li>
            <li> After shower, I rub a couple of drops of the argan oil into the ends of my hair and it makes them smooth, shiny and less</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not heavy, makes my skin very soft (on my face and face).</li>
            <li> i went through it so quickly that i searched for an equal product at a lesser price.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a massive difference in my skin like how some people say, but it moisturizes well enough without the super greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Other argan oils I have used have no odor; and quickly absorb.  </li>
            <li> You have to watch how much you use, because it can give your hair this &#x27;wet&#x27; look on the ends, extend blow dryer time if you use too much, and leave your hair feeling sticky, not silky.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I forgot this at my boyfriends house for two days straight and had to use my old synthetic face moisturizer, and obviously my skin could tell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised</li>
            <li> So far my experience has been alright.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and moisturized - but not oily - all day.</li>
            <li> I also mix in a couple of drops with my Redken hair wax, and it keeps my hair soft instead of sticky.    </li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> use it to my hair too, and it makes the hair soft and</li>
            <li> my face has never been this soft and dewy before using it.</li>
            <li> Nothing else works like this to keep both my hands and my lips well hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li> it keeps my skin soft and not dried out.  </li>
            <li> It soaks in instantly and really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does make your skin look younger.  </li>
            <li> Another reason to think about  purchasing Argan Oil : its a natural solution to defend the skin against premature aging and UV exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Currently I&#x27;ve been doing some research and also I&#x27;ve learned that some places mix real Argan with sunflower/other oils ...</li>
            <li> It does sink into the skin well and makes it feel soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> However, because of the price, I will continue to search for a moisturizer that is both natural and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Anything the oil touches turns soft.</li>
            <li> I have young kids</li>
            <li> ladies, if you have any issues with your oil, just contact them directly.</li>
            <li> i do the same thing when i use moisturizing cream, so i wasn&#x27;t really adding time to my morning routine with this.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really the only reason i gave this 4 stars instead of</li>
            <li> Hair is soft and shiny and skin stays soft.</li>
            <li> I have hand eczema and it really soothes the itching and cracking open.</li>
            <li> My skin is fairly sensitive and I have had no problems with the oil.</li>
            <li> This is a very reasonably priced \\&quot;all purpose\\&quot; oil to use for everything from a face moisturizer to revitalizing brittle dry hair.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy at all and very light with a subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> i bought this originally to tame frizzy hair, but ended up using it primarily as a moisturizer for my face, neck and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help calm my somewhat frizzy hair due to winter-time dryness.</li>
            <li> It has a very slight nutty scent that is nearly  undetectable, but I add a little Neroli essential oil to it for the benefit of the scent and because it&#x27;s good for mature skin; however, you can use it as-is, too.  </li>
            <li> I use the most after I wash my hair when its wet I put like 7 drops on my ends from the midshaft down and</li>
            <li> It makes my face look younger and have less wrinkles, also makes it feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> When I opened my bottle to apply it to my face it smelled strongly rancid, not lightly nutty like my initial Modagor argan oil.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with a sample of the expensive JM oil and didn&#x27;t want to pay that much.</li>
            <li> Since I couldn&#x27;t use it on my hair, I did end up using most of it on my skin- rough elbows, arms, neck and sometimes a small but under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s this big skin miracle, but I will say I was surprised that I have not suffered a breakout using this on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for over three months, and have barely made a dent in this, and I use it every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> It even makes my adult acne go away when I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin glow and soft, especially during winter.</li>
            <li> This is just as effective as the expensive Argan oil.</li>
            <li> The ALMA&amp;SANA argan oil had a slight smell when I first opened it, but after two days the smell is gone and this argan oil seems to be odorless now.  </li>
            <li> A little of the oil can be rubbed anywhere you need a little more moisture.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect your wrinkles to go away,but your skin will look dewy not dry.</li>
            <li> the oil/dirt would weigh my course (and straight) hair down.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin, but a few dry patches and a few fine wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> A must have if you have mature dry skin.</li>
            <li> it will leave for hair and skin feeling silky soft all while doing wonders for acne and dry skin.</li>
            <li> There were a few droppers full and I tried to use the oil that had spilled and collected in the plastic wrap, but it&#x27;s not really how I prefer to experience a product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and my skin type is mixed -- oily at the \\&quot;T\\&quot; while dry on the cheeks.</li>
            <li> Not too oily, absorbs quickly leave behind a soft glow.</li>
            <li> its 100 % pure and doesnt contain anything artificial which is important to me.</li>
            <li> I was tempted to try the more expensive brand of argan oil, but I just couldn&#x27;t spend that much money on so little product..</li>
            <li> Made my dry skin extremely greasy, so much so that even my fiance noticed.</li>
            <li> Since I started using pure argan on my face in the past six months my skin is never dry.</li>
            <li> I read somewhere that it&#x27;s normal to have a slight vinegary smell</li>
            <li> This is the time of year, where I live, that hands get dry and rough, as do my lips.  </li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s the exact same if not better product and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and gives you a very soft feel with a hint of shine.</li>
            <li> as other reviewers have mentioned, this has a slight &amp;#34;toasted&amp;#34; smell when you first put it on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 4 brands of argan oil in the past year or so, and this was absolutely my least favorite.</li>
            <li> (I just opened the bottle lately and it smelled funny.)</li>
            <li> Not sure this is real.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that there is no expire date on the bottle as the company claims, therefore, I have no idea how long or when it will expire.</li>
            <li> It seems like a strange way to describe an oil, but it seemed to have almost a gritty feel to it when I applied it to my face.</li>
            <li> I recommend ordering only one bottle at a time because it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I am 30, and have no lines or wrinkles, yet, and would like to keep it that way for as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> While I think there has been a lightening of some dark spots on my skin, and there has been improvement in the discoloration of my knees due to a series of abrasions,  I have not seen much improvement of the lines on my face, gained over a period of 60 + years.  </li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I work outside and my skin is dry even with using body butters to seal and protect.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend this oil if you are looking for a high quality, raw argan oil.</li>
            <li> this has given me the same results as the more expensive oil, so i will order this again!  </li>
            <li> And while I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic improvement in the appearance of my wrinkles, I will say that I have seen some, especially around my laugh lines.    </li>
            <li> I use it in my hair before I dry and flat iron it.</li>
            <li> a drop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will be using this product for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about Argan Oil a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product a 3 because it is so beneficial to most people for skin and hair but for my super sensitive skin it sadly broke me out in horrible acne all over my clear adult face.</li>
            <li> I would compare it to more expensive brands, like Josie Maran, but much less price.</li>
            <li> Later, I ordered another bottle and the oil itself was different; it had a darker color and a slightly fishy odor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i was never able to find the right amount to use in order to tame my frizzy hair after shampoos.  </li>
            <li> goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> You can also mix it with other oils like almond or jojoba to make it go further as a body oil in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I even put a couple of drops in my mascara when it started to dry out a bit, and that worked like a charm.    </li>
            <li> It helps with all the dry skin-on my face and hands.</li>
            <li> FOR SOMEONE WITH EXTREMELY DRY SKIN LIKE MINE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a miracle cure for dry skin and to help prevent scarring when I get a cut.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on dry heels and hands.</li>
            <li> My dry skin has gone away.  </li>
            <li> You can also use it on your face if you have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a naturally dry person I guess.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to get dry as well as my face.</li>
            <li> (But please note that I&#x27;m talking about having dry skin here.</li>
            <li> i would use 4-5 drops on each hand since they get so dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very long (down to my butt almost), and I only need 3 drops on the ends.  </li>
            <li> My hair was frizzy, and dry, I always just it up in a bun!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan oil and been used to the slightly nutty smell of her argan oil</li>
            <li> There is no particular scent to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several other Argan oils from different sellers and this is one is by far the worse smelling one.</li>
            <li> I also use on my sons very dry eczema spots and helps him a lot as well.  </li>
            <li> and my hands tend to get very dry from the yarn</li>
            <li> and I had a patch of skin that was starting to get a little crepey</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so a little bottle with actually last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> There is no odor which I love ,because I heard that some Argan oils smell bad.</li>
            <li> I expected this item to be greasy, I&#x27;ve used cold pressed olive and coconut oil and experienced that uncomfortable heavy/greasy feeling until it absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried putting it in my wet hair and it was a disaster.</li>
            <li> for my hair, I like to apply a few drops into my conditioner and let it soak into my hair (especially the ends) while I shower.</li>
            <li> the oil glides on evenly if the skin is slightly wet.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s thick &amp; the only thing I use it for is massaging my husband&#x27;s back.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this oil, it wasn&#x27;t slick enough to spread evenly through the ends of my hair, it seemed to dry as soon as I dropped it into my palm.  </li>
            <li> i usually used only 3 drops for my face; 4 drops if i was feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If you use it on your hair use only a very little bit.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have any other Argan oil products to compare this to, so</li>
            <li> I also add a drop or two to the other products I use.  </li>
            <li> It smells like vegetable oil and it remained greasy on my skin - not like other argan oils I have purchased.</li>
            <li> In comparison to this I refer the other one.</li>
            <li> A little drip goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I use it alone as moisturizer or mix a drop to my makeup or other lotion.</li>
            <li> When I first started researching argan oil and seen the expensive prices I thought, \\&quot;Forget about it.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I find that I don&#x27;t need anything else, other than my vitiman C (Transport capsules).</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t usually do the extra step of applying sunblock when i used the argan oil.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried just using a little bit on my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil about 6 months now, to moisturize after washing, a few drops smoothed over both face and hair; it soothes my dry skin and frizzy hair, but is a bit oily looking to go out without some other foundation on</li>
            <li> WHEN MY FACE SEEMS ESPECIALLY DRY, I APPLY ARGAN OIL</li>
            <li> ONLY complaint would be : theres No experation date on Bottle  &#x3D;</li>
            <li> Just a small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> i recommend this for anyone tired of all those chemicals in your beauty regiments and are looking for a natural solution.</li>
            <li> I use sometimes on my hair too, you only need a small amount on your hair, use sparingly!  </li>
            <li> I ended up chemically burning my hair and was putting this oil on the bottom half to try and repair it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this oil can only disguise the fried hair, not actually repair it.</li>
            <li> and I have less split ends.</li>
            <li> That means less breakage and split ends.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not super oily.</li>
            <li> It has a slight rancid smell and doesn&#x27;t absorb like argan oil - stays oily on your skin like vegetable oil...</li>
            <li> Now I wear it down, or half up and half down!</li>
            <li> I like to add it to my body lotion, but now I have to apply my body lotion standing in the bathtub so that I am not making an oily mess on the bathroom counter or floors.  </li>
            <li> Also made my dry hair greasy and dull.</li>
            <li> its a Little bit thicker and a Little Goes along way.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin look greasy for a while, it takes a little time to fully absorb.</li>
            <li> a little nutty smelling but goes away after a while.</li>
            <li> no matter how little I use in my damp hair)</li>
            <li> and I received my products in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> and I think it is a bit heavy texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added a few drops to my H20 body gloss and the fragrances don&#x27;t clash.  </li>
            <li> A few drops of this oil in the problem spot</li>
            <li> just use a keratin shampoo, condition and then comb a few drops of this through my hair.</li>
            <li> I even put a few drops in the water bottle for spraying my hair.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> apply a few drops between my palms and rub it together.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops on my face and blend it in, often after my shower.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few things I can use to moisturize my face without having reactions to it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used 4-5 different brands now, and this bottle is the least thick of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My hair has also been breaking A LOT less!  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t do anything plain (inexpensive) lotion can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> Other Argan oils sell for ridiculous prices.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has less of an odor than the other brand I used, actually not too bad.  </li>
            <li> But the small amount I used smoothed my hair.  </li>
            <li> After using it for about a week, small bumps (clogged pores) broke out all across my nose and cheeks</li>
            <li> I usually purchase.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t have time to do reviews.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with one of the bottles I purchased a while ago</li>
            <li> small eye dropper bottle lasts me at least a few months.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the results would be for oily</li>
            <li> I have been using the Elma and Sana argon oil for the past 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my had.</li>
            <li> My skin felt dry and unhydrated and it caused the skin around my eyes to age and pull in a scarey way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say, but I wouldn&#x27;t count it out because of the vitamin E.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time spreading it around evenly when used alone.</li>
            <li> I figured at least I can use it for my hair if it didn&#x27;t work out.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m forced to put product every time after brushing it, but this time I didn&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past couple of months and when I go for my facials each month my skin has improved!</li>
            <li> I used to spend $40 for  Argan oil, but no more!</li>
            <li> I put a very small amount of this in my hair after washing.  </li>
            <li> This is much less expensive than the argan oil</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a pleasant smell but at least it doesn&#x27;t linger.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product for a while now, I&#x27;d like to say that I seriously underestimated the state of the skin on my feet.  </li>
            <li> I bought this oil thinking that since it&#x27;s organic and less expensive than Moroccan Oil brand, I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> When the weather gets crazy, my scalp gets very dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> With the excessive grease, uncomfortable texture and clogged pores caused by the Elma &amp; Sana oil, I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This seems to hydrate my hair well enough, though I was a bit disappointed with the smell.</li>
            <li> It works well as a moisturizer, I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s made any improvements to my skin, but it hasn&#x27;t made it any worse.</li>
            <li> I also hate using chemical laden products on my skin, with exception of SPF (even then, I try to only use organic/natural blends like Badger).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My face is radiant and there&#x27;s always people asking me for my secret jaja, I always say:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a silicone, so it doesn&#x27;t give that fake shiny look.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using expensive night creams and now use this exclusively for face and eye treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with Argan oil.</li>
            <li> Then I wash it out with cold water because I know it \\&quot;seals your ends\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out, it doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the container/dropper.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s bad..</li>
            <li> I received a bad batch</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy it again, not because it&#x27;s a bad product, but because it&#x27;s not for me...</li>
            <li> It was horrid once I realized I was having a bad reaction to it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to give this Argan Oil a bad score because it hasn&#x27;t done anything bad.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I dropped it and lost 2/3 of it :(</li>
            <li> I have two very, very bad scars</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had high hopes after the reviews because I love the reviews for helpful info. Sadly, it is not for me. It did break me out. I use emu and jojoba oils and really like them and have no issues so I guess I should stop looking for the next great thing ;) In the hair or on my legs to make them shiny on a skirt day it goes.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product at a very good price!</li>
            <li> I love argan oil. Use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used 4-5 different brands now, and this bottle is the least thick of the ones I&#x27;ve tried. The pros: it&#x27;s more spreadable, glides well, and there&#x27;s virtually no smell compared to other bottles. The cons: it doesn&#x27;t feel as nutrient dense, can leave hair looking a bit greasy. This oil is &#x27;shinier.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this bottle mostly as a supplement to body lotion. For my face &amp; hair, I prefer another brand for it&#x27;s thicker, more elastic texture. For the price I paid here (2oz $17), this was one of the better deals I&#x27;ve found... worth while.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to get this for my skin because I read that argan oil is acnegenic, but I needed something moisturizing and gentle for after I exfoliate, so I decided to try it. I figured at least I can use it for my hair if it didn&#x27;t work out.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s this big skin miracle, but I will say I was surprised that I have not suffered a breakout using this on my face. I use it to remove makeup and I apply it around my eyes mostly, or as part of my home facial regimen. I do not keep it on overnight.  I have been watching to see if my marks fade faster using this, but I honestly can&#x27;t tell because I use many different products; it could be a combination of products including the argan oil. It&#x27;s hard to say, but I wouldn&#x27;t count it out because of the vitamin E.  I can say for sure that this oil has made my hair super shiny. Not  oily shiny, just healthy shiny. I have pretty healthy hair, but now it has even more sheen to it. I try to apply some to my ends every night before I wrap my hair and right away when I brush my hair I can see the difference.  All in all, I would say try it for your skin, but keep it for your hair.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair and skin.  My hair is very long (down to my butt almost), and I only need 3 drops on the ends.  More than that and it doesn&#x27;t absorb all the way and it looks greasy.  I also use this on my eyes to remove my eye makeup.  With proper use, it is a great product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...consistently good oil. I&#x27;ve bought more expensive brands that have arrived rancid, but have never had that issue with this brand. Use it on your face, hair, nails, wherever!</li>
            <li> I was tempted to try the more expensive brand of argan oil, but I just couldn&#x27;t spend that much money on so little product..so I tried this based on the Amazon reviews.  It really is good stuff!  I have normal skin, but a few dry patches and a few fine wrinkles.  This left my face smooth and soft, and didn&#x27;t make me break out at all,which is surprising since it is a thick oil.     It&#x27;s also great on hands and nails.  I mainly bought it for my hair though.  My hair has been frizzy in the recent humidity.  I put a very small amount of this in my hair after washing.  I&#x27;m really surprised how well this works!  Don&#x27;t use much though, it is an oil.  But the small amount I used smoothed my hair.  It&#x27;s not a silicone, so it doesn&#x27;t give that fake shiny look.      I&#x27;m really surprised at how much I like this argan oil!  I&#x27;m thinking I can get rid of a lot of lotions, creams, conditioners and have a lot more room in my bathroom now!</li>
            <li> This Argan oil is excellent. It goes into the skin smoothly and does not leave a greasy feel. Furthermore, my skin feels amazing. The only drawback is that there is no expire date on the bottle as the company claims, therefore, I have no idea how long or when it will expire. Hence, they get 4 stars. Other than that great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my face, and to add to my henna/indigo mix when I color my hair.  Although Argan oil is supposed to absorb quickly, I don&#x27;t think it does.  This could be because I&#x27;m using too much at one time...I don&#x27;t know.  I do like that this oil does not have any smell, and the eye dropper is nice for controlled amounts.  However, the bulb for the dropper does easily separate from the bottle, so I have to be careful.  If the bottle tips over, the oil will leak out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any other Argan oil products to compare this to, so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s bad..but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s great either.  So far my experience has been alright.  I&#x27;ll probably try a different brand next time before purchasing this one again.</li>
            <li> What can I say, this oil is AMAZING! I have, well had very fine lines around my eyes (crows feet) and they were GONE with in a week. After using the oil for about 3-4 days my husband asked what I did to my face and that I looked younger. My complexion is even and my skin is smooth.  Love, Love, Love it~!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> ... but I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product.    I mix 1-2 drops in with my facial moisturizer morning and evening. I found that it was absorbing SO quickly I had a hard time spreading it around evenly when used alone. My skin is soft and moisturized - but not oily - all day. And while I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic improvement in the appearance of my wrinkles, I will say that I have seen some, especially around my laugh lines.    I also mix in a couple of drops with my Redken hair wax, and it keeps my hair soft instead of sticky.    I mix a couple of drops with my Lubriderm lotion for my hands, knees, and elbows, and it makes a huge difference in the texture of my skin.    I even put a couple of drops in my mascara when it started to dry out a bit, and that worked like a charm.    The scent is very similar to toasted sesame oil, which I love. And the scent dissipates pretty quickly if you find you don&#x27;t love it like I do.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil can be added to hair products, body lotions or straight to the skin. A little of the oil can be rubbed anywhere you need a little more moisture. Works great on neck area. New scars can be massaged with this and it helps to keep the scar tissue supple.</li>
            <li> i had a sample of josie maran argan oil and it worked great, but the price tag for the full sized product was way too high for me. this one works just as well at a fraction of the price! i have acne-prone combination skin and this literally worked overnight. i put it on before bed and when i woke up my skin was totally rejuvenated! i had no redness and my acne looked so much clearer than the day before! this really is miracle oil. i&#x27;d say it works better for skin than hair. this is a must for everyone.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Although it causes me break outs, I could feel how good this product is. Instead of apply it all over my face as a serum, I apply only on my wrinkles, and it reduces the wrinkles perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to my hair too, and it makes the hair soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan oil and been used to the slightly nutty smell of her argan oil so I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the vinegary smell when I received this product.  I read somewhere that it&#x27;s normal to have a slight vinegary smell but this smell was very strong and it lingered so much that I had a headache and my husband asked what the funny smell was.  It also left my skin a bit drier than I was used to so I discontinued using it.  May be I received a bad batch but I prefer not to pay for the high price of Josie Maran&#x27;s oil so I&#x27;ll continue to search for another argan oil on Amazon.</li>
            <li> i love this oil. my face has never been this soft and dewy before using it.I seeps right through the skin without any greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Ok not sure if it works</li>
            <li> This is an amazing oil for the skin. It really does seem to make the skin smoother and works nicely on fine lines. It does have a rather unusual fragrance but not one that is offensive but actually kind of nutty. Suppossed to be higher in vitamin E than most oils and nutritionally feeds the skin. I am sold and will keep  ordering it.  Glad to have found it.  Thx</li>
            <li> I use this as my daily moisturizer, for my hair, my lips and my hands.  This is just as effective as the expensive Argan oil. I have been using it for a month on face and I see a difference.  This is the time of year, where I live, that hands get dry and rough, as do my lips.  Nothing else works like this to keep both my hands and my lips well hydrated and soft.  This is a very reasonably priced \\&quot;all purpose\\&quot; oil to use for everything from a face moisturizer to revitalizing brittle dry hair. You do have rub it in, like any face or hand cream, but it is not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product.  Please do not ever raise the price and be as good as you are now.  Much thanks!</li>
            <li> Very good product, with very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> this product is great. It is not greasy at all and very light with a subtle fragrance. I use it on my hair and skin. a drop goes a long way. its 100 % pure and doesnt contain anything artificial which is important to me.</li>
            <li> This oil did work to disguise my split ends, but it kind of leaves them a bit sticky, and not easy to run my fingers through. I ended up chemically burning my hair and was putting this oil on the bottom half to try and repair it. Unfortunately, this oil can only disguise the fried hair, not actually repair it. It worked well, but I ended up getting fed up with my frizzy, damaged hair and cut it to my shoulders. It looks so much better now! I still use the oil on the ends, since I did not cut all of the damage off with the new cut (as that would&#x27;ve been way too drastic!) You have to watch how much you use, because it can give your hair this &#x27;wet&#x27; look on the ends, extend blow dryer time if you use too much, and leave your hair feeling sticky, not silky. Although it&#x27;s not 100% natural, I prefer one &#x27;n only Argan Oil hair treatment which smells awesome.</li>
            <li> I was told to try this product by several people including my hairdresser. After using it the first time my hair became shiny and beautiful. A must have in any woman&#x27;s pack of tricks.</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of Argan Oil from a particular online vendor as a sample.  I had seen the product on QVC dozens of times but felt the price was pretty high.  I loved the sample I had received from the online vendor (NOT QVC).  So I came to Amazon, of course, and found this vendor and read the reviews and decided to order.  Well, I have acne prone skin and red marks.  Argan oil is really miraculous for healing skin and shrinking pores.  I take really good care of my skin but this is really a cheap way to REALLY improve your skin.  I&#x27;m almost 48 and most people think I&#x27;m 38-39.  Argan oil will be a tremendous blessing in fighting the aging process.  This is a definite KEEPER!  Also, this vendor ships promptly and I received my products in just a few days.  Thanks for such a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 4 brands of argan oil in the past year or so, and this was absolutely my least favorite. This definitely had a different texture than the others I&#x27;ve used. It seems like a strange way to describe an oil, but it seemed to have almost a gritty feel to it when I applied it to my face. After using it for about a week, small bumps (clogged pores) broke out all across my nose and cheeks (I never got acne of any kind with other brands of argan oil). It also left my hair and bangs incredibly greasy where they brushed my face, which again is something that the other brands of oil had not done. This has a different smell to it than virgin argan oil should have as well; this has a nuttier smell, which to me says that it has been roasted at some point and is no longer raw/virgin. Virgin oil has a fairly distinctive scent reminiscent of olives, which dissipates once it is absorbed into your skin. I have since bought another brand of oil for my face, and will be finishing this oil up on my legs and arms. With the excessive grease, uncomfortable texture and clogged pores caused by the Elma &amp; Sana oil, I won&#x27;t be buying this again. I do not recommend this oil if you are looking for a high quality, raw argan oil.</li>
            <li> this has an oily smelI and I think it is a bit heavy texture.I like another brand one so I use it for only haircare.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t done JACK! My skin felt dry and unhydrated and it caused the skin around my eyes to age and pull in a scarey way. I wonder if I really got 100% pure Argon oil.</li>
            <li> Ah....great oil! I use this on my face before applying makeup. A tiny bit goes a very long way. Very moisturizing. I will continue to buy this brand</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I notice my hair is stronger and I have less split ends. Prior to using this product, I would have to use different styling products because I have curly hair and it gets frizzy.  Now I don&#x27;t need to add anything else to my hair.  I highly recommend it.  The shipper was great!</li>
            <li> This is much less expensive than the argan oil I usually purchase.  The ALMA&amp;SANA argan oil had a slight smell when I first opened it, but after two days the smell is gone and this argan oil seems to be odorless now.  I think it is just as good as the much more expensive argan oil I used to use.  I recommend it highly.  I use it on my face (I am in my sixties)and it keeps my skin soft and not dried out.  I use it under my foundation and at night on a newly washed face.  I use it in my hair.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of Argan oil and this one is the best.  It&#x27;s a staple product for me and I will continue to purchase.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> For well over a month I&#x27;ve been using this product on my face, hands, legs, parts of my body and hair.  My skin drinks it in and I&#x27;m not left feeling oily and goopy.  I&#x27;m a knitter and my hands tend to get very dry from the yarn but this Argan oil has helped and makes my hands and cuticles feel and look great.  I have very oily skin but I apply it to a clean face and it has not caused my face to be super oily, nor has it caused any breakouts.  I apply it to my feet (heels especially) and my feet look great when wearing sandals and slippers.  I&#x27;ve added a few drops to my H20 body gloss and the fragrances don&#x27;t clash.  If you use it on your hair use only a very little bit.  This is a very effective product and I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.  I&#x27;m even thinking of getting Argan oil (different type) to use as a finishing oil on salads, roasted veggies, etc.  Thanks Elma &amp; Sana, and Amazon! The price and 2 oz. size is such a great value!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful!!! And it is priced perfectly!!! And it&#x27;s not to greasy! Also excellent shipping I got it in days! If u are buying Josie Maran u should try this because it is better!! It&#x27;s not as greasy and I had a patch of skin that was starting to get a little crepey and this took it right away!!!</li>
            <li> Works good, compared to Jose Maran it seems to be pretty good. Works well for moisturizing my face after using my retinol cream!</li>
            <li> I love this. It helps with all the dry skin-on my face and hands. Have been using it for about 2 months and it is great.</li>
            <li> FOR SOMEONE WITH EXTREMELY DRY SKIN LIKE MINE THIS IS FOR YOU!  I USE THIS FOLLOWING HYALURONIC ACID, AND IT LEAVES A NICE FINISH.  WHEN MY FACE SEEMS ESPECIALLY DRY, I APPLY ARGAN OIL AND IT SEEMS TO MINIMIZE THE LOOK OF MY WRINKLES.  I  CHOSE THIS PRODUCT B/C IT HAS NO ADDITIVES, JUST PURE ARGAN OIL.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a different Argan oil so I have nothing to compare it to. I use this on my face only, I feel that it would be too oily for my fine hair. It works well as a moisturizer, I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s made any improvements to my skin, but it hasn&#x27;t made it any worse. I might try a different oil when this bottle runs out to compare.</li>
            <li> This product is good, but it wasn&#x27;t enough for my dry skin. Had to use other oils with it, but other than that this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I love argan oil!  It is wonderful as a facial moisturizer!  Soaks right in without feeling oily.  I use sometimes on my hair too, you only need a small amount on your hair, use sparingly!  Any brand that is 100% pure argan oil should work, I like this brand but I also like a couple others too.  Just make sure argan oil is only ingredient, 100%!</li>
            <li> I have bought this several times. It is a good Argan oil. It has a mild nutty smell that I like, and it is golden. I would compare it to more expensive brands, like Josie Maran, but much less price. It is a good product.</li>
            <li> This did not improve the overall color of my skin nor did it reduce the appearance of my wrinkles, but it did leave my skin looking and feeling much healthier and a few people commented on how I had a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several other Argan oils from different sellers and this is one is by far the worse smelling one. It&#x27;s smells rancid, as if it were WAY passed it&#x27;s expiration date (if there is one, I don&#x27;t see anything on the bottle or box). Will try and return the item. I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> My favorite product. I use on my skin and hair, it&#x27;s the best. Save your money on all those moisturizing products and just get this.</li>
            <li> I love to use this on my hands and feet or any part of my body that needs moisture.  It&#x27;s very nice and not too oily.</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil, it does not have a scent which is nice for my sensitive skin. The price per oz. was very reasonable. The product shipped on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I like it and it&#x27;s affordable.  Looking in the mirror, I cannot give it a perfect 5 as I have only used it one day so my results will be forthcoming.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is pure and wonderful for any skin type. It&#x27;s very healing, glides onto skin smoothly, and is quickly absorbing. It can be mixed with your favourite hair product, or facial/body moisturizer. Since I started using pure argan on my face in the past six months my skin is never dry. Also makes a great eye area moisturizer when lightly dabbed around the eyes. This particular oil from Elma and Sana is rich and decadent. It&#x27;s the best argan oil I have used, and will continue to use with awesome results! I use about 3 to 4 drops on my face every morning. I definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> My skin and hair love this oil.  Smells great and moisturizes and softens skin and leaves hair soft.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> great organic oil...use it on skin and hair for incredible results...:) ive used it for almost a year and my hair is amazing..</li>
            <li> I purchased this AFTER I purchased a more expensive, organic bottle of argan oil &amp; having the two to compare to, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again.  It&#x27;s NOT bad, it just reminds me of olive oil (without the smell).  There&#x27;s no smell, it&#x27;s thick &amp; the only thing I use it for is massaging my husband&#x27;s back.  I won&#x27;t buy it again, not because it&#x27;s a bad product, but because it&#x27;s not for me...it&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m used to or what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product... Can be used by itself or  mixed with any other hair product.&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> I have purchased this more than once and the more I use it the better my skin has been.  It really softens &amp; moisturizes very nicely.  I also add a drop or two to the other products I use.  Occassionally, I get compliments on my skin because it is so smooth.  Nice to see the 2 oz size at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> light and non-greasy, pleasant &amp; light smell, works very well with my flat iron and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down. packaged appropriately and shipped quickly. no complaints</li>
            <li> This is wonderful oil. My skin is loving it and I&#x27;m getting compliments from much younger people on how beautiful my 71 year old skin looks. I use it on my face, neck hands, arms, and even splurge with it on my legs sometimes.My skin feels like velvet with this lovely oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using expensive night creams and now use this exclusively for face and eye treatments. I even use it on my hands and arms. It soaks in instantly and really moisturizes. It&#x27;s a bargain. I saw a French skin specialist on TV who said this is what French women use for everything, day and night. Good enough for me!</li>
            <li> This was my second time ordering the argan oil. It is the best one I&#x27;ve found. My skin looks better than ever.  I have my daughter and my sister using it now.  We all love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered a bottle of this oil and was very pleased with it.  The oil melted into my skin and it felt moisturizing yet light.  Later, I ordered another bottle and the oil itself was different; it had a darker color and a slightly fishy odor.  So the quality in inconsistent from my experience.  It is still a good value and I would order it again</li>
            <li> bought this for my mom and she liked a lot. was for some skin problem and this oil help her to heal.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have been using for many years.</li>
            <li> It smells like vegetable oil and it remained greasy on my skin - not like other argan oils I have purchased. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that ever since I have used this product, my hair has become shinier and softer. However, I do not find that this is a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product, but it is very good. I like dropper as it can dispense a good amount of product. I&#x27;ve had this product for over three months, and have barely made a dent in this, and I use it every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I consider myself an Argan Oil expert ever since it came out several years ago in the states.  I loved that it felt soft and light on my hands and face as well, as it&#x27;s distinct neutral odor.  So I knew instantly when I opened this, that it is NOT Argan oil.  Neither the texture, color, or smell is Aragan Oil.  Total Scam of oil.  NO wonder it was cheaper than the real versions.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;m amazed I can put this oil on my face and not break out. It&#x27;s a miracle cure for dry skin and to help prevent scarring when I get a cut. When the weather gets crazy, my scalp gets very dry and itchy. A few drops of this oil in the problem spot and I have relief for the whole day. Works wonders on dry heels and hands. It absorbs very well, just don&#x27;t use too much. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I use it on the ends of my hair and under my eyes before I put on my powder makeup.  It helps my makeup lay smooth on my skin to where you can&#x27;t even tell I am wearing makeup at all.  I  love, love, love this oil!</li>
            <li> I bought this once before and it had no odor but the product in this bottle smells a bit.  It&#x27;s not a pleasant smell but at least it doesn&#x27;t linger.  Otherwise, a good product, especially for dry hair.  (put a couple drops in the palm of your hand and run it over your hair)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Argon Oil before with fantatic results and since I tend to be a creature of habit, I just got the bigger bottle this time!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, smells fantastic, and will make your hair smooth and soft and shine like gold.  You don&#x27;t need to wash your hands after, just rub it into your skin for smooth, soft, healthy hands.  This stuff is all-around good for you!!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  I have very sensitive skin but no problems with  this oil.  it is by far the best facial moisturizer I have ever used.  When I told my sisters about it, they immediately ordered it because they could see how well it worked for me,.  This stuff really does make your skin look younger.  I recommend ordering only one bottle at a time because it lasts a long time.  I use about 6 drops twice a day, every day and it lasts maybe 6 months.  Smells better than other brands.</li>
            <li> I chose this brand primarily due to the fact that it&#x27;s fair trade, but it is also very high quality and a great bargain.  Love the dropper!  I use argan oil for my hair, skin, and cuticles, and a dropper of it goes a long way!  It has a very slight nutty scent that is nearly  undetectable, but I add a little Neroli essential oil to it for the benefit of the scent and because it&#x27;s good for mature skin; however, you can use it as-is, too.  You can also mix it with other oils like almond or jojoba to make it go further as a body oil in the shower.  After using it, my hair and nails are strong and shiny, and it&#x27;s the perfect facial oil as well - because it&#x27;s so light and absorbs so fast, you can put on your makeup over it, so it can be used day and night.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> i ordered the .5 oz of josie maran argan oil and absolutely loved the effect it had on my skin.  i went through it so quickly that i searched for an equal product at a lesser price.  this stuff is great!  its not completely fragrance free, there is a VERY slight odor (not bad) but when you apply it, you cant smell it.  this has given me the same results as the more expensive oil, so i will order this again!  its awesome!</li>
            <li> Recieved item 8/10/11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me  Say  by  im VERY Pleased  with my  Purchase &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;i did some  research and  found My Oil  Here, ive read the  reviews in which made it Very Helpful to Purchase from seller.&lt;br /&gt;its  light weight non  Greasy Oil that  Absorbs Quickly which makes me happy.&lt;br /&gt;has a light Olive like Smell that goes away after it sinks into skin.. which doesent bother me or trigger allergies&lt;br /&gt;after my first  use on  skin , it was smooth and soft, felt youthful..  wish i would had found out about this  oil years  ago  could ONLY imagine what my skin would look and  feel like today.&lt;br /&gt;Also Another reason to think about  purchasing Argan Oil : its a natural solution to defend the skin against premature aging and UV exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would Recomend this Product/Seller to Everyone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY complaint would be : theres No experation date on Bottle  &#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:::::::::::::::::::&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update : 9-9-13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had Recently Bought another Brand of Argan Oil and I am More Happy with New Item. its a Little bit thicker and a Little Goes along way. its a 100% Pure Argan Oil and worth every cent, they guarantee it. In comparison to this I refer the other one. I still use this one because some days I want a lighter oil on my face, and Body, and I&#x27;m not wasting my money. I would still recommend this , makes your skin nice and soft and a Dewy Healthy Look. My Review above still stands. Currently I&#x27;ve been doing some research and also I&#x27;ve learned that some places mix real Argan with sunflower/other oils ...im not saying this company does but I would do your Homework.  Happy Shopping &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Wonderful makes skin feel like silk</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this oil, it wasn&#x27;t slick enough to spread evenly through the ends of my hair, it seemed to dry as soon as I dropped it into my palm.  I ended up buying coconut oil instead and loved it.</li>
            <li> Get softer skin with Argan oil.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it on my skin and hair. I have very curly hair and it helps define my curls nicely while keeping my hair naturally hydrated. Makes my skin super soft but not greasy feeling. Great price too when compared to my local health food store.</li>
            <li> I use argan oil along with my regular moisturizers for fine lines and wrinkles on my face and neck.  Rubbing a few drops of argan oil in your hair will make your hair shine and keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and soft.  I use this under my makeup each day.</li>
            <li> I have tried many moisturizers over the years.  Many hand lotions give the illusion of softness and moisture for an hour or so, then the dry, cracking skin is back.  I&#x27;ve only used this product twice and I can really tell a difference.  My hands stay smooth for hours.  Hand washing doesn&#x27;t even take it all off.  I can feel it on my skin but I&#x27;m not leaving greasy fingerprints all over everything I touch.  2 applications have helped my feet and elbows too.  I like this product very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for a while now, I&#x27;d like to say that I seriously underestimated the state of the skin on my feet.  They are much better but continue to drink this stuff in....to the point I was wondering if it comes in 55 gal drums!</li>
            <li> It took me ten months to use 2 ounces of this oil, applying it to my cheeks and neck every morning and night.  It&#x27;s made an amazing difference in the suppleness and level of moisturization in my skin, and it does not irritatte my rosacea at all  It&#x27;s so much better of a price than other \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; argan oils, too.  I will continue to buy Elma &amp; Sana argan oil!</li>
            <li> This was the first argan oil I have tried. I purchased it as an alternative to chemical-laden lotions. It does sink into the skin well and makes it feel soft and moisturized but it doesn&#x27;t do anything plain (inexpensive) lotion can&#x27;t do. The only added benefit I can see is that it is more natural than putting all those chemicals on your skin. However, because of the price, I will continue to search for a moisturizer that is both natural and inexpensive. Also, it says you can use this in your hair. I tried putting it in my wet hair and it was a disaster. My hair just never dried and looked very greasy. Then I tried just using a little bit on my dry hair. It did make it look more shiny and smooth but my hair felt very sticky. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I had read about the benefits of Argan oil and was so pleased with this product! It was unusual to place oil on my face at first, but it is quickly absorbed and does leave your face, neck, or hands feeling greasy. It leaves your skin feeling soft and supple. I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I use this oil for my hair skin and nails and it is beyond awesome. I use it in my hair before I dry and flat iron it. It gives me less fly always a and helps protect from heat. For my skin I use it on my face and body. It leaves my skin very very soft. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past couple of months and when I go for my facials each month my skin has improved! They always ask me what I&#x27;m using and they always tell me argan oil is the BEST thing. I also use it for my nails, it softens my cuticles and help my nails grow. Anything the oil touches turns soft. A little drip goes a long way! It does make my skin look greasy for a while, it takes a little time to fully absorb. I love argan oil!!</li>
            <li> I bought this oil thinking that since it&#x27;s organic and less expensive than Moroccan Oil brand, I would give it a try.  I&#x27;m a big fan of Moroccan Oil.  Works wonders for hair.  This however made my hair greasy every time I tried it.  Since I couldn&#x27;t use it on my hair, I did end up using most of it on my skin- rough elbows, arms, neck and sometimes a small but under the eyes.  Works fine for that.</li>
            <li> this is just as good or I think better than Josie Marian I think that&#x27;s how you spell her name and its fabulous I love mine makes my skin softer than a baby best product for dry skin hands down I will buy over and over even getting my sister to get it instead of Jose&#x27;s love love love best price for best best price</li>
            <li> Have been buying this product before.I like the way it feels on my face.A must have if you have mature dry skin.There is no odor which I love ,because I heard that some Argan oils smell bad.Don&#x27;t expect your wrinkles to go away,but your skin will look dewy not dry.This is my bottle # 4 ,can&#x27;t beat the price.If you are in the market for organic argan oil give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I use this oil for hair, face, body. It is not greasy, absorbs quickly. takes just a drop or two.</li>
            <li> You have to try this. It makes such a difference in your skin!! I am allergic to everything but not this!!!</li>
            <li> just as good as Josie Maran. a little nutty smelling but goes away after a while. great for hair and skin! helped my super dry skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with Argan oil. I use it for any type of skin issues. Breaking out, bug bites, rashes, dryness, etc. It works for all. This one is in a nice sized bottle also. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it daily.  All it takes is three drops to smooth over my face and neck and I&#x27;m ready to go.  It smooths on as an oil, but is quickly absorbed into the skin without leaving an oily shine on the skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered Argan oil on the recommendation of a friend.  She raves about it, so I thought why not?  I am 30, and have no lines or wrinkles, yet, and would like to keep it that way for as long as possible.  I also hate using chemical laden products on my skin, with exception of SPF (even then, I try to only use organic/natural blends like Badger).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally use Coconut oil in my hair, about a pea size amount on damp hair is good for a little frizz free shine.  I use the Argan oil in my hair last night, and this morning upon waking I can tell my hair is much more nourished, and the color is much more vibrant than normal. I also used this on my face/neck and chest area.  Its says to use it then apply normal moisturizer.  I used this under my Boscia Intensive Night Cream, and my face was feeling super moisturized and soft.  This morning I can still feel the softness from the oil I put on my chest and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, at a great price, I will be purchasing the 4oz bottle next time, and I will probably buy a few of these as gifts for my family members!</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil from Elma &amp; Sana. I have first tried argan oil from Sephora (the JM brand) and thought the oil was absolutely amazing but thought the price was way out of my range. I researched online to find the best alternative to JM&#x27;s argan oil and read all the reviews. It took me couple of days to decide and I have finally decided to give this a try because of the great reviews. Now I only use this! I have purchased this 3 times already and I am still in love with this brand&#x27;s argan oil. It essentially the same thing as JM&#x27;s or better. :) I love the price and quality.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but I haven&#x27;t used it enough to tell if I love it yet.  But it seems to show a lot of the description for what it is about and what it does...... .A</li>
            <li> My dry skin has gone away.  I love this for my skin and use it daily to keep the dry skin at bay.  I work outside and my skin is dry even with using body butters to seal and protect.  This before lotion is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now and I like it.  I&#x27;ve never used Argan oil before.. but I purchased it after watching Dr. OZ.  I rarely put any product in my hair anymore for styling.... just use a keratin shampoo, condition and then comb a few drops of this through my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it at only night as it is too oily to wear under make-up during the daytime.  I haven&#x27;t tried the clay mask yet.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described...got one for myself and one for friend.  Will continue to order in the future.  Great oil for dry skin!</li>
            <li> It makes my face look younger and have less wrinkles, also makes it feel so smooth. I Love it and would recommend it</li>
            <li> I tried this because I got a special argan treatment for my her before and I loved it! I started to search online about the benefits of the argan oil and I found that it was great also for the face. I ordered and it is just amazing ;) My face is radiant and there&#x27;s always people asking me for my secret jaja, I always say: Aloe vera, milk soap and argan oil :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Seen results right away! No fragrance to this argon oil. I had hands that gave awy my age, but not anymore!</li>
            <li> Every time I use this product it aggravates me.  The dropper does not hold the oil, so from the time I pull the dropper out of the bottle, until I get it to where I intend to drop the drops, it drips.  I like to add it to my body lotion, but now I have to apply my body lotion standing in the bathtub so that I am not making an oily mess on the bathroom counter or floors.  I have used Watts in the past with no problems and good results - I wish I did not order this product.</li>
            <li> I expected this item to be greasy, I&#x27;ve used cold pressed olive and coconut oil and experienced that uncomfortable heavy/greasy feeling until it absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with this oil is great and nothing like the above, it absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth. It even makes my adult acne go away when I use it regularly. It has a glass dropper which allows you to drop the oil onto your hand and keeps the contents sanitary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also worked wonders on my son&#x27;s sunburn - all around a great product, definitely worth the cost. I&#x27;ll be purchasing the 4oz size next time as I find myself using it a lot.</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily hair, so I have to wash it every day or else the oil/dirt would weigh my course (and straight) hair down. I rub a dime size amount of it into the ends of my hair every night after I wash my hair. This is my third bottle and since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair has been growing a lot better. That means less breakage and split ends. Instead of paying 100 dollars for a bottle of 100% pure pressed from Sephoras,  I can just get it off Amazon for almost 9 times cheaper! And I would pay a lot more for this magic oil!</li>
            <li> I bought this and another argan oil from Ebay, which wasn&#x27;t bottled with a label and a barcode, but rather the lady supposedly buys it by the gallon and then pours in smaller bottles. After using both products, I kept this one (which does have a barcode and certification info). It not greasy, it&#x27;s not heavy, makes my skin very soft (on my face and face). I add 2 drops to my facial mosturizer each time, and I&#x27;ve even used it by itself. On my hair, I tested it after I washed it, and didn&#x27;t put anything else in it but about 4 drops that I rubbed on my palmes before spreading on my hair and then brushing it in. I have a curly hair and I&#x27;m forced to put product every time after brushing it, but this time I didn&#x27;t have to. I just sprayed my hair the next morning with some water to help the curls form and off I went. I even put a few drops in the water bottle for spraying my hair. My hair was super soft! So I just returned the other product to the ebay seller, and ordered one more of these for my cousin in Europe. If the second bottle is consistent with the quality of the first one, I&#x27;ll add that to my review. I read some people were complaining the same thing is actually totally different.</li>
            <li> I use this on my dry hair, its a really good price compared to the argon oil they sell at sephora thats $50 dollars. All you need is one drop of argon oil and it makes your hair really silky. I have really fine hair, and it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy at all. You can also use it on your face if you have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I ever had. It&#x27;s very light and non-greasy, and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakout. I took this with me when I visited my family for Christmas and my mom and sister also loved it so much they took mine. I had to order it again! I use it alone as moisturizer or mix a drop to my makeup or other lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought this argan oil primarily for my face.  I am in love!! I will never go without using this product again.  When I first started researching argan oil and seen the expensive prices I thought, \\&quot;Forget about it.\\&quot;  But then I found this and couldn&#x27;t be more happy.  It has done wonders for my face.  Fine lines around my eyes are deminishing.  Also, helping with breakouts.  As a matter of fact, I forgot this at my boyfriends house for two days straight and had to use my old synthetic face moisturizer, and obviously my skin could tell.  I had a huge breakout, but as soon as I got my argan oil back, it cleared the breakout right up!  My hair has also been breaking A LOT less!  I have two very, very bad scars so I have even been applying it to those, and even those scars are disappearing.  I swear by this prouduct, I will never put anything else on my face!</li>
            <li> Wow, I have curly hair, makes it look like ringlets! My hair was frizzy, and dry, I always just it up in a bun! Now I wear it down, or half up and half down! My hair has never been softer!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.. many uses including face and hair..a little goes a long way. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help calm my somewhat frizzy hair due to winter-time dryness. What I didn&#x27;t realize is that this oil is good for so much more! Not only does it help keep my hair sleek and shiny, it is a wonderful skin moisturizer as well as a good carrier oil for essential oil massages. I use it on my face, lips, feet and hands. I&#x27;ve seen other organic argan oils for easily twice the price. I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 3 because it is so beneficial to most people for skin and hair but for my super sensitive skin it sadly broke me out in horrible acne all over my clear adult face. It was horrid once I realized I was having a bad reaction to it I immediately quit using it but the acne cycle lasted 2 weeks in which I hid in my house the whole time. I really wanted to enjoy the benefits of it but no luck for me.</li>
            <li> This is my night moisturizing cream.  I find that I don&#x27;t need anything else, other than my vitiman C (Transport capsules). It&#x27;s also priced favoriably.</li>
            <li> I have young kids and I usually don&#x27;t have time to do reviews. But I have to do this one. I discovered Elma&amp;Sana argan oil a year ago and have been using it since. I have sensitive skin and my skin type is mixed -- oily at the \\&quot;T\\&quot; while dry on the cheeks. I used to have pimples. Elma&amp;Sana absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy on my face. It makes my skin glow and soft, especially during winter. I&#x27;m in my mid-30s, people always say that I look like a 20ish girl thanks to my argan oil. ;-) I buy Elma&amp;Sana as gifts too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I recently experienced the best customer service from Elma&amp; Sana. I was not satisfied with one of the bottles I purchased a while ago (I just opened the bottle lately and it smelled funny.) So I called Elma&amp;Sana and tried to get an explanation. Within a week, I got a replacement in the mail, along with extra bottles and one free argan oil soap as gifts! I offered to mail back the bottle I didn&#x27;t like. They told me just tossed it. I was impressed and overwhelmed!&lt;br /&gt;So, ladies, if you have any issues with your oil, just contact them directly. I&#x27;m sure they will take care of you. (It doesn&#x27;t matter which seller you purchased from, mine was from a 3rd party seller. Just provide your order number to them.)</li>
            <li> My eyelashes and eyebrows Grew Really Fast.</li>
            <li> Having been using this dail and leaves skin smooth and silky and great for hair especially when very frizzy, it seems to make the smooth.</li>
            <li> Argon il is a great facial moisturizer for skin.Good for nails/cuticles and adds softness and shine to hair.Only need tiny amounts&lt;br /&gt;the small eye dropper bottle lasts me at least a few months.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this few weeks ago. And i did notice a pleasant change on my skin. It does subside acne and leaves the skin smooth to touch. I&#x27;ve noticed a fresh glow the next day after every application. Would encourage anyone to buy this and give it a try.</li>
            <li> I used to spend $40 for  Argan oil, but no more! This is great for the skin and hair.</li>
            <li> i enjoy it. it&#x27;s not super oily. it balances everything out on my face. i don&#x27;t use it every night, but when i need it. i&#x27;ve heard it can lighten age spots and i&#x27;m hoping someday it will. i&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months and would recommend it. no need to spend much more for this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of oil.  It truly is wonderful. I used to pay three times this amount  for my oil from another company .  Now why would I ever do that again?  This is just as good as the more expensive oil.  I will only buy this from now on.</li>
            <li> Order it again and again. Better than spending twice as much retail. I feel it&#x27;s the exact same if not better product and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I have used argan oil for almost two years and Elma &amp; Sana argan oil for a year.  It has less of an odor than the other brand I used, actually not too bad.  The first bottle I used had almost no odor, and the second bottle has some odor.  I find it to be smoothing to my facial skin and it is excellent when used under my makeup.  It helps the application of my make-up go on so much easier.  I sometimes use it under my moisturizer at nighttime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a naturally dry person I guess. My hair tends to get dry as well as my face. Not only do I have to drink a lot of water, but I&#x27;m constantly conditioning my hair and using moisturizer for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply a few drops between my palms and rub it together. Then I pat it on my face before I go to bed. This product, no lie, makes your face feel baby smooth the next morning. It&#x27;s not greasy and soaks right in. The smell also evaporates within minutes. (But please note that I&#x27;m talking about having dry skin here. Not sure what the results would be for oily skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my hair, I like to apply a few drops into my conditioner and let it soak into my hair (especially the ends) while I shower. Then I wash it out with cold water because I know it \\&quot;seals your ends\\&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and gives you a very soft feel with a hint of shine. My ends the next day are definitely hydrated. LOVE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, you gotta think that this product is 100% pure and organic. It&#x27;s better for your body to absorb this than something that is synthetic. You can definitely tell the difference between using an organic product versus a synthetic product. My face is absolutely glowing!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of 100% argan oil with a hair straightener I purchased and fell in love with the oil! Used it on my hair and face; both absorbed quickly and left the smoothest skin/hair ever. This Elma &amp; Sana bottle is not the same at all -- smells slightly more \\&quot;woody\\&quot; and is way thinner -- which wouldn&#x27;t be an issue if it worked as well. Unfortunately, not only does it not absorb into my hair or skin, but it leaves my hair so oily (no matter how little I use in my damp hair) I&#x27;m embarrassed to leave the house. This oil absorbs slightly better on my skin, but my face does not feel as moisturized the next day; meaning I usually have to still use a thicker cream on top of the argan oil -- which I didn&#x27;t have to with the other. Note: I have medium thick/normal hair (that I&#x27;m trying to grow out) and very dry/sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this brand and will be purchasing a different brand that I&#x27;ve heard actually works like 100% pure argan oil is supposed to.</li>
            <li> It has a slight rancid smell and doesn&#x27;t absorb like argan oil - stays oily on your skin like vegetable oil...(maybe that&#x27;s what it is).  Other argan oils I have used have no odor; and quickly absorb.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I use this as a night time moisturizer for my face! It smells so nice and natural.  It does a great job! I also use on my sons very dry eczema spots and helps him a lot as well.  I have also used on my hair...you can&#x27;t go wrong, this is the best!  I have ordered other brands too, and they are nice, but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with a sample of the expensive JM oil and didn&#x27;t want to pay that much. This product is every bit as wonderful!  I&#x27;ve used it twice a day for two weeks now and my skin has never looked or felt better. I will be using this product for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Elma and Sana argon oil for the past 3 weeks.  While I think there has been a lightening of some dark spots on my skin, and there has been improvement in the discoloration of my knees due to a series of abrasions,  I have not seen much improvement of the lines on my face, gained over a period of 60 + years.  The product absorbes well into the skin but does not have any effect on the lines.</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair and I use Kerastase shampoo.  My hair tends to go frizzly in the heat.  After shower, I rub a couple of drops of the argan oil into the ends of my hair and it makes them smooth, shiny and less frizzly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beside using it on my hair, I also use it on my face at night sometime.  It&#x27;s a all around great product!</li>
            <li> I live in a desert climate and couldn&#x27;t wait to get this in the mail today. So far, I LOVE it! Totally makes my hair and skin feel moisturized. Gonna add it to my lotions too.</li>
            <li> The product smells like Olive oil. I tried to contact seller but no reply. I bought Argan oil before and it doesn&#x27;t smell like this. I don&#x27;t feel confident with this product. I will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Good oil for hair care.</li>
            <li> i just finished my 2-ounce bottle of elma &amp; sana argan oil.  i bought this originally to tame frizzy hair, but ended up using it primarily as a moisturizer for my face, neck and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i found that this kept my face feeling moisturized all day.  as other reviewers have mentioned, this has a slight &amp;#34;toasted&amp;#34; smell when you first put it on.  however, the smell dissipates quickly and i got used to it very fast.  i also found that the best way to use this as a moisturizer is on damp skin.  the oil glides on evenly if the skin is slightly wet.  i usually used only 3 drops for my face; 4 drops if i was feeling dry.  i really loved this for my hands, which get dry and cracked during winter.  i would use 4-5 drops on each hand since they get so dry.  once the oil is absorbed (2 or 3 minutes?), there&#x27;s no oily residue left on the skin.  i&#x27;d apply this in the morning and refill my coffee while i waited for the oil to be absorbed before i put on foundation.  i do the same thing when i use moisturizing cream, so i wasn&#x27;t really adding time to my morning routine with this.  the only downside that i can think of to using this as a moisturizer is that many facial moisturizing creams come with sunblock built in.  i didn&#x27;t usually do the extra step of applying sunblock when i used the argan oil.  that&#x27;s really the only reason i gave this 4 stars instead of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was never able to find the right amount to use in order to tame my frizzy hair after shampoos.  but i did like it as a moisturizer.  i was on the fence about whether or not to order another bottle.  after writing this review and realizing how much i liked it, i think i need to order some more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil about 6 months now, to moisturize after washing, a few drops smoothed over both face and hair; it soothes my dry skin and frizzy hair, but is a bit oily looking to go out without some other foundation on</li>
            <li> I think it does the job. I mix it with other oils though since I don&#x27;t think one ingredient is good for everything, but this moisturizes without breaking me out. I don&#x27;t see a massive difference in my skin like how some people say, but it moisturizes well enough without the super greasy feel. I have oily, acne-prone skin btw :)</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for almost a year.. I dropped it and lost 2/3 of it :( but I still have enough for like 5 months or more. I use about 5 drops a day on my hair. I have hip length hair. This is definitely a basic oil that everyone must have. its very light and Ive used it on my hands and my face. I have thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my had. I use the most after I wash my hair when its wet I put like 7 drops on my ends from the midshaft down and maybe 2 more around where its dry and when my hair dries its very moisturized and looks alive. I have wavy/curly hair and its excellent.</li>
            <li> a really amazing product for all skin types, even oily skin as i have. its also great for hair and nails. it will leave for hair and skin feeling silky soft all while doing wonders for acne and dry skin. i recommend this for anyone tired of all those chemicals in your beauty regiments and are looking for a natural solution.</li>
            <li> Have never used Argan Oil before, but this sure has me hooked.  It&#x27;s wonderful, doesn&#x27;t leave your skin or hair (if you only use a few drops) greasy. Penetrates right into the skin and hair. Hair is soft and shiny and skin stays soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to give this Argan Oil a bad score because it hasn&#x27;t done anything bad. It hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out, it doesn&#x27;t smell unpleasant, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the container/dropper. But frankly, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference to my skin or my hair either. I use a few drops on my face and blend it in, often after my shower. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s any different from using olive, grape seed, or almond oils. I&#x27;ve also tried it on the ends of my hair; again, it&#x27;s fine but nothing special. There are extraordinary claims made about Argan Oil. So far I haven&#x27;t experienced any of these special or unique benefits. So I don&#x27;t plan to purchase this oil again.</li>
            <li> I have no reason to believe that this isn&#x27;t pure. Have been using it on my face/hair with good results. The glass drip does leak a bit.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading about Argan Oil. I use it twice daily and you only have to use a tiny bit.  Goes on very smooth, absorbs quickly and never leaves an oily feel on my face or hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this particular brand because it is very reasonably priced.  Other Argan oils sell for ridiculous prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it... you will be very pleased!</li>
            <li> This is one of the few things I can use to moisturize my face without having reactions to it (ie: hives, acne, rashes).  It&#x27;s amazing for hair, too!  A little goes a long way, so a little bottle with actually last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people say it smells my bottle doesn&#x27;t smell and the dropper works fine.. I put it on my face as a moisturizer and it works very good it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily just nice and soft and I apply my makeup after and it just fine.. I use it every day..</li>
            <li> Not sure this is real. There are typos on the label - big red flag. Made my dry skin extremely greasy, so much so that even my fiance noticed. Also made my dry hair greasy and dull. I&#x27;m sure it has some purpose, but face/hair is definitely not it.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is great - only oil on the planet that doesn&#x27;t make you greasy!</li>
            <li> This winter, I use this product prior to putting on my moisturizer and it has made a world of difference in my hydration level on my face.  I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I had purchased oil from Mogador Argan oil in the past (and was pleased with it) and thought I&#x27;d get another bottle of argan oil for my mom for mother&#x27;s day, so I thought I&#x27;d try the Elma &amp; Sana brand. Then I started to run out of my Mogador argan oil and bought a 2 oz bottle for myself several weeks later. When I opened my bottle to apply it to my face it smelled strongly rancid, not lightly nutty like my initial Modagor argan oil. I sent it back for a refund and checked my mom&#x27;s Elma &amp; Sana argan oil which I had bought in a 4 oz size and several weeks earlier. It, too, was rancid. I won&#x27;t be buying argan oil from this seller again!!</li>
            <li> I will always purchase this product because I like they way my face feels after I apply it to my skin.  It soaks into your skin and makes it feels so smooth.  I wish I had known about Argan Oil a long time ago.  Just a small amount goes a long way.  I even purchase some for my daughter and for my grandson.  Awesome oil!!  Also, purchase from Elma&amp;Sana when you purchase, they contact you and they get the product out fast.  I will only purchase Argan Oil from them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I can rate this fairly, as the top of it was crooked and didn&#x27;t twist shut completely causing it to spill out most of the contents before I had the chance to use it. There were a few droppers full and I tried to use the oil that had spilled and collected in the plastic wrap, but it&#x27;s not really how I prefer to experience a product. I probably will not order this again.</li>
            <li> This seems to hydrate my hair well enough, though I was a bit disappointed with the smell. I guess that means most argan oils have fragrance added, but for the price and the size this has lasted quite a while.</li>
            <li> I have hand eczema and it really soothes the itching and cracking open. Also great for any dry body areas including around eyes and face.</li>
            <li> I use this on my bi-racial daughter&#x27;s hair and on my own 4c hair. Works magic. Not too oily, absorbs quickly leave behind a soft glow. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I loved this oil, it really softened the skin of my hands and face, helped sooth my cracked cuticles and nails, and made my face significantly less oily.</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair as well as a moisturizer!  There are some brands out there that are much more expensive, this works just as well.</li>
            <li> It is great for hydrating my skin.  I use it at night after using Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal and Aloe Witch Hazel.  It is a great combination.  It feels quite healing.  There is no particular scent to it.  My skin is fairly sensitive and I have had no problems with the oil.</li>
