            <li> Love the versatility of this palatte, but I&#x27;m afraid to use it a lot because it&#x27;s limited edition and I don&#x27;t want to use it all! I have brown hair/eyes with fairer skin and I always get compliments on my eyeshadow when I use this.</li>

            <li> Love, Love Love!!! This was recommended to me by a professional makeup artist who uses it on her clients. It comes with cards that match the shadows to help you create looks. I think that&#x27;s such an amazing bonus! I have already created several looks with it using the cards and I even tweaked them a little to my likening. I would highly recommend this!!! Great color and pigmentation. a must for any beauty enthusiast.</li>
