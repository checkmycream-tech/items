            <li>Nice sudsy feeling in the mouth.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a toothpaste that provides a great whitening and clean feeling as well as this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I loved all the bubbles and the way they made my mouth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste</li>
            <li>Still my favorite toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>For the price and amount,  its even better value than 99cent store because they don&#x27;t sell 8oz...</li>
            <li>Love the baking soda in it.</li>
            <li>Colgate is always my favorite and the prize with amazon prime</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay in the sense the peroxide and baking soda is &amp;#34;noticeable&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Good toothpaste with fresh breath to boot</li>

            <li>love to stock up</li>
            <li>I tried the Colgate baking soda and peroxide toothpaste and enjoyed the way it felt on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>These are the longer tubes, so that makes it worthwhile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient as part of my subscribe and save, but sometimes the prices are better at CVS</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure about the whitening, since I have braces one</li>
            <li>But it gets better as you brush.</li>
            <li>great value, good basic product - does the job</li>
            <li>i cannot find a better price anyplace or in any supermarket for this size tube</li>
            <li>brush often, so the three pack is better than a one pack.</li>
            <li>THIS PACKAGE OF 3 IS A WINNING COMBINATION,  HOWEVER, WALMART</li>
            <li>Colgate toothpast is ok for the kids</li>
            <li>I feel it cleans better than those fancy pro health toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to ordering more.</li>
            <li>Great price, great toothpaste that won&#x27;t let you down.  </li>

            <li>This is such an excellent price for a name brand good and high quality toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M REALLY PLEASED THAT I COULD GET THIS SIZE AT $5.96 FOR 3 HUGE TUBES (ADD ON ITEM)</li>
            <li>Good product fast well received.</li>
            <li>Such a good deal, can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>Great whitening toothpaste, keeps my breath fresh for a long time and its a really good value buy</li>
            <li>The baking soda leaves a clean and refreshing mouth and my teeth are noticably whiter.  </li>
            <li>Noticed the difference very quickly.</li>
            <li>Not too strong of a taste for a whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The mint is fine</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted it was fabulous</li>
            <li>Brush your teeth, its important</li>
            <li>Just ordered these and a badass pair of all terrain heavy duty camo crocs for my boyfriend and I. Perfect for wearing in the garden or water, just rinse them off!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more of a fresh mouth that I get from Arm and Hammer brand</li>
            <li>Oh i love thee fresh breath.</li>
            <li>Thank you Colgate for a product I really enjoy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see on the package if there were ingredients for keeping a person&#x27;s mouth free of cavities.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason the 3-pack is so cheap.  </li>
            <li>Good price and just like the store, obviously :)</li>
            <li>The toothpaste makes my teeth feel so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>makes this well worth it!</li>
            <li>A lot more Toothpaste than I expected, a good deal delivered.</li>
            <li>Good toothpaste, the white paste that cleans the plaque off my teeth (unlike those smooth gels).</li>
            <li>Tasted funny and just and average toothpaste at best.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel clean, it completes me.</li>
            <li>Perfect for kids who don&#x27;t have access to much, and who actually get excited over general and oral hygiene products :)</li>
            <li>I like the affordable price and the fact that it leaves my teeth and mouth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable brand and so far so good</li>
            <li>Look for the word &amp;#34;GEL&amp;#34; :) I will def continue to purchase Colagate products, just not this particular style.</li>
            <li>I like the mild tingling sensation.  </li>
            <li>Simple is much better - GREAT value - whitening toothpaste easy on the mouth - fresh and refreshing taste - not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>works great and having it shipped to home makes ones less shopping trip I need to do</li>
            <li>The mint flavor is strong but not overpoweringly strong, and the clean feeling it gives is almost addictive.</li>
            <li>well worth it</li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling fresh, it&#x27;s toothpaste, what else can I say.</li>
            <li>not sure if i&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>Tastes really funny.  </li>
            <li>thanks amazon !</li>
            <li>it came on time I love it like likely head</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt; Thanks !</li>
            <li>cleans your teeth pretty well, you shouldn&#x27;t swallow peroxide though.</li>
            <li>its just so much easier to have spares right on hand.</li>
            <li>Other than that it does its job leaving everyone&#x27;s breath smelling fresh!!!</li>
            <li>Large value size</li>
            <li>Tubes are large size.</li>
            <li>Smart buy.</li>
            <li>It came on time, it&#x27;s large 8oz size.  </li>
            <li>The tubes are huge, larger than the biggest size I can buy in the store and for $5 or $6 for Amazon&#x27;s 3 pack (on sale)</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommended.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery .Love</li>
            <li>I really like the baking soda taste</li>
            <li>This toothpaste has helped SO much.</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t like the taste of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The cost was reasonable.</li>
            <li>Like the simple clean taste of this paste.</li>
            <li>Clean, white teeth, without the triclosan.</li>
            <li>I used sensitivity toothpaste for the longest time, but found that using this toothpaste did not irritate my gums, so I stopped spending on the more expensive pastes and have been satisfied with Colgate Baking Soda.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s some weird more is better guy thing</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know what happened with this particular Colgate product</li>
            <li>but I like a little more umph</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing taste afterwards and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I WOULD NEVER PAY MORE THAN A $1.00 FOR ANY SINGLE TUBE OF TOOTHPASTE, THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME INGREDIENTS</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t mind.i like to try new tooth paste</li>
            <li>Live and learn:</li>
            <li>My teeth were turning black and rotten, and now they are gleaming white and solid, and all for a good price and prompt shipping.</li>
            <li>My teeth are very sensitive, and this toothpaste does not bother them like others.</li>
            <li>Rub a small amount on the top and underside of the fingernails, leave it on for a couple of minutes, then brush off under running water with a nail brush.  </li>
            <li>This is the only toothpaste my husband &amp; I use, it really whitens teeth, plus freshens breath!</li>
            <li>They tasted &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t seem to leave my teeth feeling quite as clean as other brands.</li>
            <li>so far this won&#x27;t be a keeper for me .</li>
            <li>Really like the way it feels in my entire mouth; like I can feel my mouth being refreshed.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>Just helping you about your job to get it clear &amp; clean up the mess</li>
            <li>No more clipping coupons or running out of toothpaste! :-)</li>
            <li>I was having major issues with my gums bleeding every time I brush.</li>
            <li>Long live the Colgtate BS&amp;P Whitening Paste.  </li>
            <li>I went through a whole tube, and every night or early morning, I had a terrible/extreme dry mouth and dry lips.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is pretty bland</li>
            <li>I have recently been trying all different kinds of teeth whitening products and only one or two products have had an effect on my teeth so far, this not being one of them.</li>

            <li> Fast Delivery .Love</li>
            <li> I really like the baking soda taste</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has helped SO much.</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t like the taste of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The cost was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Like the simple clean taste of this paste.</li>
            <li> Clean, white teeth, without the triclosan.</li>
            <li> I used sensitivity toothpaste for the longest time, but found that using this toothpaste did not irritate my gums, so I stopped spending on the more expensive pastes and have been satisfied with Colgate Baking Soda.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s some weird more is better guy thing</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what happened with this particular Colgate product</li>
            <li> but I like a little more umph</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing taste afterwards and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I WOULD NEVER PAY MORE THAN A $1.00 FOR ANY SINGLE TUBE OF TOOTHPASTE, THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME INGREDIENTS</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t mind.i like to try new tooth paste</li>
            <li> Live and learn:</li>
            <li> My teeth were turning black and rotten, and now they are gleaming white and solid, and all for a good price and prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very sensitive, and this toothpaste does not bother them like others.</li>
            <li> Rub a small amount on the top and underside of the fingernails, leave it on for a couple of minutes, then brush off under running water with a nail brush.  </li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste my husband &amp; I use, it really whitens teeth, plus freshens breath!</li>
            <li> They tasted &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t seem to leave my teeth feeling quite as clean as other brands.</li>
            <li> so far this won&#x27;t be a keeper for me .</li>
            <li> Really like the way it feels in my entire mouth; like I can feel my mouth being refreshed.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> Just helping you about your job to get it clear &amp; clean up the mess</li>
            <li> No more clipping coupons or running out of toothpaste! :-)</li>
            <li> I was having major issues with my gums bleeding every time I brush.</li>
            <li> Long live the Colgtate BS&amp;P Whitening Paste.  </li>
            <li> I went through a whole tube, and every night or early morning, I had a terrible/extreme dry mouth and dry lips.  </li>
            <li> The flavor is pretty bland</li>
            <li> I have recently been trying all different kinds of teeth whitening products and only one or two products have had an effect on my teeth so far, this not being one of them.</li>
            <li> However, The cap of the paste in a hinge type one and if not properly closed , it can dry up the paste leading to wastage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much whitening power it actually has.</li>
            <li> (Our dentist told us using too much paste or using whitening toothpastes too frequently can be a little harsh on teeth enamel.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little too sweet.  </li>
            <li> After speaking with my dentist and a few friends that used this particular brand of Colgate noticed that the baking soda &amp;#34;burning sensation&amp;#34; varies widely between individuals.</li>
            <li> and they will go a long way when used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I am a single case on this, but I had no results.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m a single dad trying to stick to a budget I don&#x27;t want to spend a ton on toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> simple product with less chemicals that works well</li>
            <li> I wanted the screw- type cap on the paste especially when kids use it and forget to close it tight.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but over all it&#x27;s a tooth paste.</li>
            <li> We are not going to buy them again, but please keep in mind user experience varies widely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste, not much to say, just set your subscription and save yourself some money.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected</li>
            <li> Its just toothpaste not really much to say..</li>
            <li> expected a burning sensation as stated in some reviews</li>
            <li> will never find a deal like this anywhere else other than amazon .</li>
            <li> leaves your teeth feeling cleaner than other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> is other forms (ie: gel, mint, cinnamon, etc).</li>
            <li> The plastic isn&#x27;t to hard and make it way simple</li>
            <li> I actually sold this to a friend because we thought it was so icky...  </li>
            <li> BACK IN THE DAY 8.2 oz OF TOOTHPASTE WAS COMMON</li>
            <li> , usually it&#x27;s a good quality product, but this one is terrible.  </li>
            <li> You wont be let down.</li>
            <li> NOW IT&#x27;S 6.oz OR LESS</li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S A $1.00 OR LESS.</li>
            <li> teeth seem a little brighter, but not like what the ad says..</li>
            <li> AND A LITTLE PRICEY</li>
            <li> Def get it here when there are no free after rebate toothpastes offered.</li>
            <li> will order again when this runs out (should be a few months.&lt;br /&gt;-Trevor</li>
            <li> Tried it a few times.</li>
            <li> I usually buy toothpaste in bulk like this.</li>
            <li> ALSO, FINDING BAKING SODA AND PEROXIDE IS ALSO HARD TO FIND, SO</li>
            <li> Husband was NOT impressed at all with this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Sorry I don&#x27;t meant any harm or what ever you want to call it.</li>
            <li> tastes a bit weird.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Too bad, I couldn&#x27;t find it at this price</li>
            <li> How it could be that you&#x27;re telling me that it&#x27;s not been paid for even though I got it when it was deliver to me along with the mouth wash, dental floss, and was shocked that you didn&#x27;t know.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this toothpaste</li>
            <li> A lot more Toothpaste than I expected, a good deal delivered.</li>
            <li> Tastes really funny.  Used to Colgate total.  I actually sold this to a friend because we thought it was so icky...  Good value?...</li>
            <li> Buyer Beware!  Deceptive advertising! A package of THREE count is advertised but you receive only ONE toothpaste tube.</li>
            <li> Very affordable brand and so far so good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used baking soda and peroxide for years.</li>
            <li> Great price. Not too strong of a taste for a whitening toothpaste. Will keep using!</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste, the white paste that cleans the plaque off my teeth (unlike those smooth gels).</li>
            <li> good product and good price</li>
            <li> It takes plaque and cruft off my chompers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind blown.</li>
            <li> Great price, great toothpaste that won&#x27;t let you down.  Definitely have seen whitening effects after 1 months of regular use.</li>
            <li> great buy for the price</li>
            <li> The tubes I got were not ADA accepted. They tasted &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; and didn&#x27;t seem to leave my teeth feeling quite as clean as other brands. Threw them away and purchased a different toothpaste.</li>
            <li> so inexpensive. great value ! will never find a deal like this anywhere else other than amazon . thanks amazon !</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a toothpaste that provides a great whitening and clean feeling as well as this toothpaste.  It taste great and rinses off of the toothbrush easily. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Like it, would buy again!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same product that&#x27;s sold in stores. Tasted funny and just and average toothpaste at best.</li>
            <li> What a great deal!  And to not have to worry about toothpaste until three tubes are finished!  Absolutely recommended.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected but over all it&#x27;s a tooth paste. I do use it 2-3 times when I brush my teeth in the morning it doesn&#x27;t work just once. But I don&#x27;t mind.i like to try new tooth paste so far this won&#x27;t be a keeper for me .</li>
            <li> Still my favorite toothpaste.  The baking soda leaves a clean and refreshing mouth and my teeth are noticably whiter.  Long live the Colgtate BS&amp;P Whitening Paste.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little too sweet.  If Colgate took out the sugar additives they put in this (this actually has Saccharin in it!) - it&#x27;d be a welcomed change</li>
            <li> For the price and amount,  its even better value than 99cent store because they don&#x27;t sell 8oz... max is 4-5oz.  Def get it here when there are no free after rebate toothpastes offered.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and the toothpaste works great and has a very nice taste to it.</li>
            <li> Good price and just like the store, obviously :)</li>
            <li> Great Product. Great Price. Fast Delivery .Love Colgate toothpaste</li>
            <li> We have always used Colgate and like the results.  I&#x27;m not sure how much whitening power it actually has.</li>
            <li> leaves taste of baking soda in mouth and dryness.gross</li>
            <li> Love Subscribe &amp; Save delivery of toothpast...so easy.</li>
            <li> THREE PACK!!. Ya I usually buy toothpaste in bulk like this. Inmy opinion its just so much easier to have spares right on hand. The plastic isn&#x27;t to hard and make it way simple to roll-up. But I would try and get it with scope or another flavor. The mint is fine but I like a little more umph</li>
            <li> simple product with less chemicals that works well</li>
            <li> Such a good deal, can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Awesome toothpaste.  Love the baking soda in it.</li>
            <li> Colgate is always my favorite and the prize with amazon prime makes this well worth it! Will buy again when we run out of the three tubes.</li>
            <li> Like the simple clean taste of this paste. However, The cap of the paste in a hinge type one and if not properly closed , it can dry up the paste leading to wastage. I wanted the screw- type cap on the paste especially when kids use it and forget to close it tight.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted it was fabulous it came on time I love it like likely head I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Brush your teeth, its important</li>
            <li> Good product for great price!</li>
            <li> What can I say, its Colgate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay in the sense the peroxide and baking soda is &amp;#34;noticeable&amp;#34;. After speaking with my dentist and a few friends that used this particular brand of Colgate noticed that the baking soda &amp;#34;burning sensation&amp;#34; varies widely between individuals. Hence you will see reviews at 5 star pointing to the value along side reviews of 1 or 2 stars pointing out to the burning sensation. We are not going to buy them again, but please keep in mind user experience varies widely.</li>
            <li> works great and having it shipped to home makes ones less shopping trip I need to do</li>
            <li> Simple is much better - GREAT value - whitening toothpaste easy on the mouth - fresh and refreshing taste - not overwhelming. Large value size x 3 at a bargain price. Great bargain for you value shoppers looking for a quality name brand.</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste with fresh breath to boot</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste I&#x27;ve used for over 10 years. I really like the baking soda taste</li>
            <li> HA! Husband was NOT impressed at all with this toothpaste. Live and learn: Look for the word &amp;#34;GEL&amp;#34; :) I will def continue to purchase Colagate products, just not this particular style.</li>
            <li> Received as is&lt;br /&gt; Thanks !</li>
            <li> Price and product good but 2 weeks to receive</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my crocs.  Just ordered these and a badass pair of all terrain heavy duty camo crocs for my boyfriend and I. Perfect for wearing in the garden or water, just rinse them off!</li>
            <li> great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li> I am actually reviewing this for nail whitening...  my finger nails tend to turn a bit yellow, so I use this toothpaste to keep them white.  Rub a small amount on the top and underside of the fingernails, leave it on for a couple of minutes, then brush off under running water with a nail brush.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a great deal this is! For what is basically around the cost of one tube at the local chain store, I can get three tubes. Same toothpaste, same quality, just saving a lot of money.</li>
            <li> This is very good to brush your teeth with this toothpaste. It has a refreshing taste afterwards and last a long time.</li>
            <li> cleans your teeth pretty well, you shouldn&#x27;t swallow peroxide though. leaves your teeth feeling cleaner than other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> MY SHINY TEETH AND ME!</li>
            <li> Great price and great tasting. Tubes are large size. Pleased that expiration date is not until 2017.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as described. The packaging was good. It was an add-on item so I had to delay buying it, till I wanted something else. Good deal nonetheless.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothpaste</li>
            <li> I used sensitivity toothpaste for the longest time, but found that using this toothpaste did not irritate my gums, so I stopped spending on the more expensive pastes and have been satisfied with Colgate Baking Soda. The price is great! The tubes are huge, larger than the biggest size I can buy in the store and for $5 or $6 for Amazon&#x27;s 3 pack (on sale) you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> My teeth were turning black and rotten, and now they are gleaming white and solid, and all for a good price and prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> Clean, white teeth, without the triclosan. The larger tubes at the price of the smaller. Yes, please.</li>
            <li> Great whitening toothpaste, keeps my breath fresh for a long time and its a really good value buy</li>
            <li> I loved all the bubbles and the way they made my mouth feel so clean. Great product and great value.</li>
            <li> Great price for the the 3 of them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste...I don&#x27;t know how to quite review above that.</li>
            <li> Great taste and performance. This is the best toothpaste</li>
            <li> Nice big tube of toothpaste for Operation Christmas Child boxes, at a great &amp;#34;add- on&amp;#34; price.  These are 8 oz tubes- so 1/2 pound, or 1/2 pint of toothpaste !! Perfect for kids who don&#x27;t have access to much, and who actually get excited over general and oral hygiene products :)</li>
            <li> It was a good flavor, good toothpaste, but did nothing to whiten my teeth no matter what it claims. I don&#x27;t know if I am a single case on this, but I had no results. I have recently been trying all different kinds of teeth whitening products and only one or two products have had an effect on my teeth so far, this not being one of them.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, item as described</li>
            <li> Used this toothpaste for years, will keep using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste, not much to say, just set your subscription and save yourself some money.</li>
            <li> I love the Colgate 3-pack. The toothpaste makes my teeth feel so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> well priced for the quantity received ....  great deal .... love it ...</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more of a fresh mouth that I get from Arm and Hammer brand</li>
            <li> great toothpaste and a great deal . love to stock up</li>
            <li> This is such an excellent price for a name brand good and high quality toothpaste. Too bad, I couldn&#x27;t find it at this price is other forms (ie: gel, mint, cinnamon, etc). Other than that it does its job leaving everyone&#x27;s breath smelling fresh!!!</li>
            <li> Works great, and I love that it comes in a three pack so I have a back up all the time.</li>
            <li> Good product fast well received.</li>
            <li> Great whitener for my teeth, without that yucky taste in most &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; pastes. Noticed the difference very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is great toothpaste at a great price. I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Good value for the quantity!</li>
            <li> How it could be that you&#x27;re telling me that it&#x27;s not been paid for even though I got it when it was deliver to me along with the mouth wash, dental floss, and was shocked that you didn&#x27;t know. I guess someone as the employee forgot to say it was already been pay for. You need to check with the employees about this matters like it&#x27;s been or isn&#x27;t been pay for. Need to go follow up with employees with paper &amp; computer work to check about the payment . Sorry I don&#x27;t meant any harm or what ever you want to call it. Just helping you about your job to get it clear &amp; clean up the mess also what made you think I didn&#x27;t pay for it ?.</li>
            <li> I bought this because, 1. I am creating a stockpile for my husband and myself to help take some of the financial burden off him, a three pack of big tubes of toothpaste just seemed like the thing to get. And 2. I tried the Colgate baking soda and peroxide toothpaste and enjoyed the way it felt on my teeth and gums. The mint flavor is strong but not overpoweringly strong, and the clean feeling it gives is almost addictive. I&#x27;m never going back to anything else.</li>
            <li> I was having major issues with my gums bleeding every time I brush. This toothpaste has helped SO much.</li>
            <li> Good whitening toothpaste</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t like the taste of toothpaste. By mistake recently bought the gel from a store, and had to give it away. Found the paste here and got it. It comes packaged as a set of three. These are the longer tubes, so that makes it worthwhile.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR PRICE</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste my husband &amp; I use, it really whitens teeth, plus freshens breath! My teeth are very sensitive, and this toothpaste does not bother them like others. We also like that it has baking soda &amp; peroxide in the ingredients, Love It!</li>
            <li> teeth seem a little brighter, but not like what the ad says..</li>
            <li> tastes a bit weird. not sure if i&#x27;m happy i have two tubes..</li>
            <li> Great buy well worth it</li>
            <li> Toothpaste... what can i say about toothpaste. It makes me feel clean, it completes me. Oh i love thee fresh breath.</li>
            <li> Item as described and shipped in a timely manner, thank you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient as part of my subscribe and save, but sometimes the prices are better at CVS</li>
            <li> Everything I expected</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling fresh, it&#x27;s toothpaste, what else can I say. I&#x27;m not so sure about the whitening, since I have braces one</li>
            <li> I purchased  these packages of toothpaste because I have a family, so it is cheaper and they will go a long way when used.</li>
            <li> Its just toothpaste not really much to say..</li>
            <li> A good value, tastes good, and has a nice texture.  will order again when this runs out (should be a few months.&lt;br /&gt;-Trevor</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. Really like the way it feels in my entire mouth; like I can feel my mouth being refreshed.</li>
            <li> Not an excellent tasting toothpaste. But it gets better as you brush.</li>
            <li> Very  good price for the 3 Colgate toothpaste</li>
            <li> Thank you Colgate for a product I really enjoy. Leaves a wonderful clean feeling in your mouth as well as whitening your teeth. As always is the best at fighting cavities from any Colgate product.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive. Smart buy.</li>
            <li> great value, good basic product - does the job</li>
            <li> good price for good old-fashioned toothpaste</li>
            <li> great buy for the price...i cannot find a better price anyplace or in any supermarket for this size tube</li>
            <li> Its tooth paste, what can I say</li>
            <li> What can I say, I like the colgate.&lt;br /&gt;I like white teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I like paste over gel.&lt;br /&gt;I brush often, so the three pack is better than a one pack.</li>
            <li> BACK IN THE DAY 8.2 oz OF TOOTHPASTE WAS COMMON, THIS IS THE SIZE EVERY TOOTHPASTE WAS, NOW IT&#x27;S 6.oz OR LESS AND A LITTLE PRICEY UNLESS YOU CATCH A GOOD SALE AND IT&#x27;S A $1.00 OR LESS. ALSO, FINDING BAKING SODA AND PEROXIDE IS ALSO HARD TO FIND, SO THIS PACKAGE OF 3 IS A WINNING COMBINATION,  HOWEVER, WALMART (IF YOU CAN FIND IT THERE) HAS IT FOR $4.96 IN THIS PACKAGE OF 3. I WOULD NEVER PAY MORE THAN A $1.00 FOR ANY SINGLE TUBE OF TOOTHPASTE, THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME INGREDIENTS AND THEY ALL DO THE SAME JOB.    I&#x27;M REALLY PLEASED THAT I COULD GET THIS SIZE AT $5.96 FOR 3 HUGE TUBES (ADD ON ITEM)</li>
            <li> It came on time, it&#x27;s large 8oz size.  Very happy with the discounted, bulk price of 3 tubes.  No more clipping coupons or running out of toothpaste! :-)</li>
            <li> The husband uses lots of toothpaste. Why? I have no idea. It&#x27;s some weird more is better guy thing I think.&lt;br /&gt;So now he gets these value packs.</li>
            <li> We use this toothpaste quite often in our house.  Since I&#x27;m a single dad trying to stick to a budget I don&#x27;t want to spend a ton on toothpaste.  I like the affordable price and the fact that it leaves my teeth and mouth feeling fresh and clean.  I like the mild tingling sensation.  The fact that this is a whitening paste is a plus but we don&#x27;t use it all the time for that reason. (Our dentist told us using too much paste or using whitening toothpastes too frequently can be a little harsh on teeth enamel.</li>
            <li> Good price and convenient, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Met standard as sold by box retail.</li>
            <li> The only one my husband will use.</li>
            <li> Get it. You wont be let down.</li>
            <li> I liked this toothpaste. Without being gritty, it did feel like my teeth had been polished by the dentist. Some toothpastes &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; or sting the inside of my mouth, but this product didn&#x27;t do that. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the Colgate Baking Soda Whitening Toothpaste 8.2 oz. I didn&#x27;t see on the package if there were ingredients for keeping a person&#x27;s mouth free of cavities. The taste is great and it whitens great, but I would rather have a preventative Crest toothpaste instead.</li>
            <li> Have been using for many years great product.</li>
            <li> Good price for toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Great deal and came via fed ex over night, wow.</li>
            <li> Colgate toothpast is ok for the kids</li>
            <li> Switched up my toothpaste and was delighted with this one.  it has that gritty texture that I like - makes my teeth feel polished.  the mint is nice.</li>
            <li> Not the freshest, mintiest, bite-my-lip-making-out flavor I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what happened with this particular Colgate product, usually it&#x27;s a good quality product, but this one is terrible.  There&#x27;s a reason the 3-pack is so cheap.  I went through a whole tube, and every night or early morning, I had a terrible/extreme dry mouth and dry lips.  I&#x27;ve never had this reaction to a toothpaste before and had been using Arm &amp; Hammer baking soda toothpaste with no issue.  I ended up tossing the two extra tubes and went back to A&amp;H.  Would never buy this again!!</li>
            <li> this is my fav toothpaste. I feel it cleans better than those fancy pro health toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I like the baking soda and foamy peroxide.</li>
            <li> This brand of toothpaste has whitened my teeth.  The flavor is acceptable.  The cost was reasonable.</li>
            <li> The flavor is pretty bland but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> As good as Arm &amp; Hammer and super cheap for a three pack. Looking forward to ordering more.</li>
            <li> Tried it a few times. Everything is fine.&lt;br /&gt;I expected a burning sensation as stated in some reviews but it did not happen. Real smooth and easy.&lt;br /&gt;Great value pack.</li>
            <li> A great product! Has peroxide and baking soda. Nice sudsy feeling in the mouth.</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste--been using Colgate for years and years.  Taste is refreshing!</li>
