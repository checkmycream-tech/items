            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it, but I&#x27;m sure it will be perfect.</li>
            <li>it is most definitely superior in every way.</li>
            <li>I ordered this hook and they gave me 2 of the top pieces.</li>
            <li>I just attached the top of the curlformer hook to the bottom of the vakind hook.</li>
            <li>I LOVE CURLFORMERS</li>
            <li>Not in love with the price, but if you brought the knock of curl formers, you better invest in this, as the wands that come with the curl formers will break overtime.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>This is a lot better</li>
            <li>BUT THIS ONE WORKS GREAT AND ITS A BETTER QUALITY AND WILL LAST LONGER</li>
            <li>My daughter sets them up as an assembly line making the installation quick!</li>
            <li>Purchased this to use with the knock-off Curlformers (I read that the hooks that come with the knock-offs are a little flimsy) and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it said genuine and</li>
            <li>Very well made product and easy to use!</li>
            <li>Luckily I ordered the Vakind curl formers and that came with a hook as well.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed, exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I used the one that came with the valkind curl formers first</li>
            <li>When it first arrived I went to snap it together</li>
            <li>Strong and definitely longer to handle the job.</li>
            <li>Its very sturdy and strong especially when compared to the one that came with the &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; curl formers.. no cmplaints</li>
            <li>This tool has really helped to pull the hair through the curlformers easier.</li>
            <li>However, it works very well.</li>
            <li>Changed to this one and the length really helps make it easier.</li>
            <li>Plus the end that help the curlformer from coming off the end makes the task so much easier.</li>
            <li>very sturdy and does come apart for storage.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and long, and easy to thread my long, fine hair through.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>

            <li>much better for the  extra long curl formers keeps hair from getting tangled.</li>
            <li>I purchased the knock off version of curlformers and other reviewers had recommended purchasing this hook instead of the cheap one that came with the knock off curlers.  </li>

            <li> Received it in 2 days. Absolutely awesome! Apparently the curlformer set I bought is generic and, as such, the hook they sent with it was so shoddy it broke in the middle of the third use. It also was not long enough either. I bought this because it said genuine and it is most definitely superior in every way. Before the other hook broke it kept coming apart because it didn&#x27;t properly snap together and it ripped my hair at several points because of improper/poor construction.</li>
            <li> This tool has really helped to pull the hair through the curlformers easier.</li>
            <li> Its very sturdy and strong especially when compared to the one that came with the &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; curl formers.. no cmplaints</li>
            <li> Strong and definitely longer to handle the job. The standard size can be troublesome to get the roller to stay on. This is a must buy... a must by times THREE. My daughter sets them up as an assembly line making the installation quick!</li>
            <li> Very well made product and easy to use! Sturdy and long, and easy to thread my long, fine hair through.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to use with the knock-off Curlformers (I read that the hooks that come with the knock-offs are a little flimsy) and it worked perfectly. Sturdy and had stood up to repeated use.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, exactly as described. Be careful that you&#x27;re not trying to pull too much hair through, or this hook will come apart in the middle.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hook and they gave me 2 of the top pieces. Luckily I ordered the Vakind curl formers and that came with a hook as well. I just attached the top of the curlformer hook to the bottom of the vakind hook. However, it works very well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE CURLFORMERS AND SOMEHOW I BROKE THE HOOK THAT CAME WITH MY SET BUT THIS ONE WORKS GREAT AND ITS A BETTER QUALITY AND WILL LAST LONGER</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly.  Had no problems at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on other recommendations for my daughters long hair. I highly recommend. This has a sort of stopper on the end that makes it a lot easier to use. I used the one that came with the valkind curl formers first and it was so much harder. Changed to this one and the length really helps make it easier. Plus the end that help the curlformer from coming off the end makes the task so much easier. It was frustrating with the one that came in the pack of generic curlformers.</li>
            <li> This hook is stronger and works well with my curlformers. However, I wish it did not come apart in the middle. When it first arrived I went to snap it together and it broke at the connection point where the plastic is thinner. I have had to tape it together in order to use it. If anyone finds a hook that is long and sturdy like this and comes in one solid, not-made-to-come-apart piece, let me know.</li>
            <li> much better for the  extra long curl formers keeps hair from getting tangled. very sturdy and does come apart for storage.</li>
            <li> Not in love with the price, but if you brought the knock of curl formers, you better invest in this, as the wands that come with the curl formers will break overtime. Glad I bought it.</li>

            <li> This is the length that should be packaged with the curlformers.  It also works with the extra long generic curlformers</li>
            <li> needed for the curlers, and make great curls! but be careful not to put too much hair at once or it will get stuck and can be painful</li>
