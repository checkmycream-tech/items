            <li>Plus, I think it would make an excellent gift item, so I do plan to buy more of them.</li>
            <li>I began researching shea butter and learned so many wonderful things.</li>
            <li>But I have to tell you the thing I was most impressed with</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!!!</li>
            <li>My skin was glowing and the smell that may offend some people lessens in intensity and smells pleasant on the skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with; bars are excellent.</li>
            <li>It is a very good moisturizer at an even better price with no chemicals or added fragrance for your skin to absorb.</li>
            <li>GOOD LUCK</li>
            <li>Good afternoon.    </li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>This butter is really, really good.</li>
            <li>It is good for the price offered though.</li>
            <li>and it should be good to go.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li>you need a really good moisturizer for your skin, this is a good product to soften it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It felt so good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>i planned on mixing it with jojoba oil almond oil &amp; nubian heritage shea butter lotion for it to smell good.</li>
            <li>time it came in a plastic bag with no label or anything, which was quite surprising</li>
            <li>It is simply good business to do so</li>
            <li>I used castor oil, olive oil, coconut oil, and the Africa&#x27;s Pride Herbal Oil which smells so good.  </li>
            <li>so the Africa&#x27;s Pride oil made it smell so good.  </li>
            <li>I looked around for a while for good shea butter</li>
            <li>I also enjoy using it as a hair conditioner (have to experiment to figure out what&#x27;s best for hair</li>
            <li>Upon research I found that using it alone as a hair treatment wasn&#x27;t a good idea</li>
            <li>I have fair skin that has had its share of sun damage over the years.  </li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizer, expecially for people with eczema, like myself.  </li>
            <li>Great for body butter..whipped up nice</li>
            <li>This did work good on my face</li>
            <li>It is so good.</li>
            <li>I must say I bought a good stuff.</li>
            <li>It felt good on my hands as I was working with it.</li>
            <li>But the butter was a good quality and consistency, and a good ingredient for the lotion bars I made.</li>
            <li>Good price for what I got.</li>
            <li>It is good for making sunscreens and body butter.</li>
            <li>Loved this product.</li>
            <li>Good price, too.</li>
            <li>Still feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li>but good..</li>
            <li>This is an extremely good moisturiser but it&#x27;s smell is waxy.  </li>
            <li>Good value for all the product I received.</li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>If you want good pricing and good service and good product, this is the place to go.</li>
            <li>Once you have some in your hands, rub together and it warms quickly and wonderfully to moisturize.   </li>
            <li>The quality of the shea butter is excellent and this is the fresh shipment.  </li>
            <li>In conclusion, this product was at an amazing price for the quality, and it feels so good</li>
            <li>I bought this because I heard so many great things about shea butter....</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the price, have made diaper rash cream and hand lotion from it.</li>
            <li>Awesome price and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Great for lying in the sun - great for right after a bath.  </li>
            <li>it is HUGE!!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>If you have cracked or severely chapped lips, you might need to do this more than one night but the results are amazing!  </li>
            <li>If you have cracked or severely chapped lips, you might need to do this more than one night but the results are amazing!  </li>

            <li>Love this stuff, for EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li>Perfect texture and exactly what I needed for my homemade deodorant project.  </li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>This is great stuff, but will retain a strong aroma.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on my whole body, perfect after shaving, and even clears up my mild eczema!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing use it in all my homemade organic skin care.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite an amazing concoction.  </li>
            <li>And this seller is amazing.</li>
            <li>Honestly, we should be apply it two times a day for preventative care.</li>
            <li>I did my own test on Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I think it smells like a petroleum chemical of some kind.</li>
            <li>honestly will never buy this again</li>
            <li>I did some more research and found Fair Trade...</li>
            <li>but they have a nice site that explains EVERYTHING about shea butter and as another review said this seller sends you Kpangana butter</li>
            <li>Have a nice day.      </li>
            <li>i purchased this for my wife so she can make her own hair products</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that the smell went away before the morning, and my hair is still thriving.</li>
            <li>a homemade sugar scrub does nicely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll let you take your own conclusions about the purity of this shea butter, or even if it&#x27;s shea butter at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit grainy but still works nicely for my purposes.</li>
            <li>I kind of found this suspicious and went online to read about how shea butter can smell/feel and look like.</li>
            <li>I really liked it, so I got on the internet to see if I could find some.</li>
            <li>i honestly dont think it smells smokey.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to use their label and make my own cream.</li>
            <li>I researched this before buying and really liked the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good butter, but Shea butter is better and I&#x27;m giving it a 1 because the seller either doesn&#x27;t know or either does know and isn&#x27;t being honest.    </li>
            <li>In addition to being thrilled with the product, I was thrilled with the price as well.  </li>
            <li>some of it starts to warm and then melt onto my hands..</li>
            <li>I liked the smell</li>
            <li>As it is &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34;, it does have a kind of&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy like real butter, but did not leave an oily residue on my sheets, and I felt wonderful upon waking up this morning.  </li>
            <li>Upon heating though a good ammount of debris floated to the top and sunk to the bottom of the container.</li>
            <li>My skin is loving it.</li>
            <li>They gave me the \\&quot;recipe\\&quot; to make my own body butter</li>
            <li>I kind of like it is sort of smoky smelling.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want to warm it up before using it, or cut/scoop pieces with a warm spoon/</li>
            <li>My family liked them.</li>
            <li>I really liked the purity and quality of this product.</li>
            <li>it does not at all stink, yes it has a very rich shea butter smell which is not along the lines of a \\&quot;sweet fragrance\\&quot; but still a very pleasant smell,</li>
            <li>The first two pounds I ordered came to me in bar form, and were very good quality ivory shea butter.</li>
            <li>Nice lemony color, good smell, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Overall this seems to be a good value and a great buy!    </li>
            <li>It did not smell rancid or burnt - just a very strong nutty odor.</li>
            <li>The product came faster than I thought it would be, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>From here on out I plan on mixing my own ingredients while avoiding the purchase of pricy lotions/hair products that are seemingly a much more temporary solution.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for nearly a year, though, and have noticed wonderful benefits to my skin.  </li>
            <li>when this amazing product has been available!</li>
            <li>this is by far the best shea butter i&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>After having a great experience with this sellers 8 oz&#x27;s of Golden Shea Butter Cream</li>
            <li>A wonderful, moisturizing, all natural product.  </li>
            <li>Also, you want the shea butter to be able to moisturize through the night, while you are warm in bed (optimal effects).    </li>
            <li>Knowing that baby gets no chemicals, just vitamin-rich natural shea butter, makes us very happy.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s even ok because when you rub it together it smooths on its own.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use many lotions but this is perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you are a natural and are looking for a good shea butter this is great.</li>
            <li>it certainly is not the best quality that I have found (or the best price), so I certainly have my doubts.</li>
            <li>Good product, decent packaging too for good shelf life.</li>
            <li>It made skin very smooth after application.</li>
            <li>It does not absorb into skin quickly, but seems to be a good emollient.  </li>
            <li>This is a great price for pure shea butter.  </li>
            <li>and they also love it too, and have purchased from this seller.</li>
            <li>and I was pleased with my bulk shipment at THAT time.</li>
            <li>This shea butter was not as greasing as many products I have attempted to put on my face</li>
            <li>I love this product &amp;&amp; I know most people use it for skin</li>
            <li>I know where to shop when I need more.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I think most of people could tolerate this smell after times.    </li>
            <li>We are both using this shea butter cream when skin gets inflamed and it works better than any creams we have bought otc and prescription.</li>
            <li>He tried it for the 1st time fell in love...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite fond of the chocolately smell, and love it.    </li>
            <li>I said it was okay, but I wanted the labels included.</li>
            <li>This is most difinitely one of Africa&#x27;s gifts.</li>
            <li>Great, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>When you wake up, your lips will feel and look much better.  </li>
            <li>When you wake up, your lips will feel and look much better.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;I love this product.</li>
            <li>As for Customer service? :-)\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I have since become more educated on how this product is supposed to look, smell, and \\&quot;work,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>In my experience, this product does not absorb well and instead sort of just sits on top of my hair or skin.</li>
            <li>, I am more than satisfied</li>
            <li>It is not a miracle cure, but it works better and longer than the store bought products I have used for years.     </li>
            <li>It feels a lot better on skin and has a much better consistency.</li>
            <li>The product is okay not the better quality or grade of shea butters.</li>
            <li>Probably will not purchase this again, and will look more into refined shea butter.</li>
            <li>Hey, if life throws you shea, make some butter with it. :)</li>
            <li>decided to do my hair &#x27;mascara&#x27; again, but this time using a lot more shea butter than oils.</li>
            <li>Not too many things give me a rash, plus both my daughter and I are used to unrefined</li>
            <li>Oh yea, one more thing.  </li>
            <li>I am sure I will keep getting it here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>your favorite oil that you may already use on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I use shea butter for recipe for hair and skin moisturizer and have been pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>and I love how it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li>I have been applying this Shea butter from the top of my head to the soles of my feet..    </li>
            <li>I bought this product after noticing how many unnatural ingredients were in the body butter I was using.</li>
            <li>i love it.  </li>
            <li>Between the shea and the coconut it also has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the product and even happier to know that I am using a product that I actually made.  </li>
            <li>i think it may help prevent more but not get rid of them</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s actually better than the stuff from WF.</li>
            <li>I also love putting it on them, because then I get to have it on my hands.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better than anything else.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>My shea butter looked much better than the pictures provided.</li>
            <li>and I absolutly love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I do not like creams or moisturizers that are synthetic or chemical based, and besides the fact that they aren&#x27;t healthy -</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt better.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutly love it.  </li>
            <li>Oils are okay, but I love using richer things in cooler weather.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been slathering it on, too:)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I guess they did that for ease of use and to make sure that I didn&#x27;t get over 16 oz.</li>
            <li>The scent could be better but its not horrible.  </li>
            <li>I can then rub the chunk itself over my skin or just keep rolling the chunk in my hands to gets more of the shea butter on them...</li>
            <li>This is the real thing and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>This product smells a lot more like cocoa butter than shea.</li>
            <li>but the more I put it on the more</li>
            <li>PLEASED HAVE USED IT TO MAKE FACE AND BODY CREAM AND BUTTER.</li>
            <li>Okay, now to the product.</li>
            <li>OMG I love it.</li>
            <li>Alone as a hair treatment, I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on oily or sticky and it penetrates the skin without sitting on the top of your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update after more usage if my skin has improved or the stains is washable, or if my hair will benefit from this at another date.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about two weeks now and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels and others have complemented me on the look and feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Shea Butter in already included in many skin products.  </li>
            <li>some smell and feel better than others.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?  </li>
            <li>It is great for the skin, I use it every night as an anti-wrinkle cream on my face and after each shower for my whole body.</li>
            <li>I am thinking of throwing away the rest of my lotions, too many chemicals in them.  </li>
            <li>I will be back to buy some more!!!!</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I love shea butter</li>
            <li>I hope this is an isolated incident but for almost $10 to ship &amp; handle, it should&#x27;ve been handled better than this.</li>
            <li>i had to put it on top of my heater to soften it up a bit.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent and relatively inexpensive moisturizer.</li>
            <li>When I run out I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Yup, it&#x27;s more time consuming than a pump bottle with lots of chemicals (read the label on almost any lotion)</li>
            <li>also great for toning skin on stomach, thighs, etc straight out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff for my cuticles.  </li>
            <li>This Shea butter has a nice consistency and stays smooth.</li>
            <li>To get thereal value of this product I recommend order MORE than 1 @ a time to off set the shipping.  </li>
            <li>So I will look around when I need more supply.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin more youthful looking too.</li>
            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>Used this for a home-made pomade recipe, which turned out fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>the smell could be over powering for people that don&#x27;t like the smell I love it</li>
            <li>2nd purchase, good quality and great for my skin.</li>
            <li>100% pure shea butter taped on the top!!</li>
            <li>But after attending a Sickle Cell Convention and purchasing this Shea butter from an African Vendor,I FELL IN LOVE!!!</li>
            <li>so I am very excited to see how it works.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s superior to sophisticated chemical mixtures (cosmetic creams) at much higher price.  </li>
            <li>It is very good quality and the shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>and it had a nice smell, but it was nothing special, so</li>
            <li>First it is said that it is organic, a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I slathered this product on my hands for awhile (you don&#x27;t need much!) and rubbed it in for a good moisturizing, but when I washed my hands afterward</li>
            <li>Excellent product and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>I was told it would be available to ship after 4/20, but thanks to  GREAT customer service, I received it on 4/18.  </li>
            <li>The product comes in a tub and appears bright yellow and a bit grainy (which was surprising to me).</li>
            <li>It works great by itself however, to make it easier to apply, I place it in a jar and heat it somewhat in hot water  to soften it, and then mix in aloe vera gel, coconut oil, jojoba oil and sweet almond oil.  </li>
            <li>but again shea butter is absolutely the best, and this price is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This the best product for dry skin!  </li>
            <li>So it doesn&#x27;t go on very smooth unless you let it warm up in your hands first, then rub it on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I don&#x27;t think this a very good product and would caution against using it.</li>
            <li>When I run out of shea butter for my homemade hand, face &amp; body products, I will be ordering more from this fantastic seller.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>Since I have gradually made the switch to NATURAL body products my skin, nail and hair has been great.  </li>
            <li>So far the product feels great just being rubbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li>others have been claiming it is, but it moisturizes really well and feels good on.  </li>
            <li>it is a good product with one drawback, no matter how much you blend it,it still has a texture like sand and will not&lt;br /&gt;go</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right taped!!</li>
            <li>I love the results so much!!!  </li>
            <li>The seller shipped this super fast too, so that was great.</li>
            <li>very rich in texture and smooth</li>
            <li>During the day I put it on after a nice warm shower which helps melt on my skin easier, I actually found myself enjoying it like a mini message :).</li>
            <li>I was very happy to have this product and whip it with other oil.  </li>
            <li>Jergens original cherry &amp; almond along with some Coconut oil works better for me.</li>
            <li>My daughter has easily irritable skin and excema.</li>
            <li>It helps to heal skin abrasions very quickly as well.  </li>
            <li>Do you get rashes fairly easily?</li>
            <li>But the scent wears off VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>Great care was taken in the packaging, and I was surprised to see that the container was actually filled with 1 lb. 6</li>
            <li>It is the consistency of refrigerated butter and melts easily.</li>
            <li>The Shea arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Its smell is strong but it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>And it does have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>Halaleveryday&#x27;s response to me was that the product has a strong nutty smell.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong nutty smell which I don&#x27;t care for</li>
            <li>I liked the results very much.  </li>
            <li>SO ITS A COOL EXOTIC BUTTER TO HAVE .</li>
            <li>advice would be to first look at your own body.</li>
            <li>Yes, shea butter stains clothes, however, I recommend using it at night after a shower and wearing cotton night clothes that you can launder in warm or hot water.  </li>
            <li>very pleased with the natural smell of it, i used it alot to fill my chapsticks and beach tanning :)</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews on here, I ordered this item, used my mixer to soften it (hot soapy water will remove the residue from any tools used) and I absolutely LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Fine, lets talk about the $9.74 I paid for</li>
            <li>im 8 months pregnant and still no stretch marks, but i am mostly pleased with my scar</li>
            <li>while it does liquify quickly once it comes into contact with body heat, I like it better smooth.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very \\&quot;dough-like\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t blend into the skin easily on its own.</li>
            <li>Works great on super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This shea butter came in a huge package.</li>
            <li>the jar is HUGE.</li>
            <li>But with the latest 2 orders I placed in Nov-Dec 2013, the shea butter was in bright Yellow color.</li>
            <li>plastic   containers filled with lumps of Shea.</li>
            <li>I since have found better success at [...]</li>
            <li>I really want to try it on my face and body, but I&#x27;m kind of scared that the smell of the Shea won&#x27;t leave my skin.</li>
            <li>conclusion is that the reviewer had only experienced refined and bleached shea butter.</li>
            <li>My skin is still adjusting to it in some areas, but overall I&#x27;m extremely happy.  </li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer for my hands, especially for the eczema.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday and very happy.</li>
            <li>Im not a expert when it comes to butters ; HOWEVER, It is a Big portion and happy with the butter.</li>
            <li>You have to break off a chunk and rub it between your hands to get it smooth for application.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, this stuff looks really funky.</li>
            <li>The butter will gradually heat up from the agitation and will become smooth.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy - hope this tip helps.</li>
            <li>Great deep conditioning and helps end breakage and split ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Skin is silky smooth and you don&#x27;t have to spend all that time rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>smooth moisturized but not oily.</li>
            <li>It was very creamy and nice for the baby &amp;#34;butt&amp;#34; balm I made with it.  </li>
            <li>My legs feel so smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>YOU WILL APPRECIATE AND ENJOY THESE COLLECTIONS</li>
            <li>on smoothly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have always believed this was unadulterated shea butter,however,I have noticed  that it has some grainy substance in it and wondering if really it is as unadulterated as I had believed.</li>
            <li>Fantastic to put on hands and feet (with socks and gloves) before bed.  </li>
            <li>Not firm at all, which was a good thing for me.</li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive to food and products that contain not so good stuff in it</li>
            <li>Nice warm yellow color too.</li>
            <li>Good, fresh product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I think that it is a good idea to use 100% Organic West African Shea Butter in combination with a favorite oil of yours.</li>
            <li>It is very rich, yet readily absorbed by the skin and does not leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>A great buttery soft moisturizer, it&#x27;s oily at first.</li>
            <li>Shea butter and flax oil were major ingredients, so I ordered them here on amazon, then decided to add cocunut oil because I had heard it was good for skin.</li>
            <li>They also delivered super fast and it was packaged nicely</li>
            <li>SHEA BUTTER HAS RICH PROPERTIES AND CAN BE USE IN A NUMBER OF WAYS .</li>
            <li>I filled one 16 ounce container full and filled another one about 3/4 of the way full after whipping it.  </li>
            <li>when I opened the package i was really excited</li>
            <li>Make sure to melt it well (don&#x27;t boil) and mix with coconut oil for your hair, excellent hair product for african american hair or a mix.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product while on vacation in Charleston,South Carolina.</li>
            <li>Well, when I recieved this order of Shea Butter, it didn&#x27;t look anything like the rich creamy picture.  </li>
            <li>Ok so first off let me start out by saying that this is NOT shea butter.  </li>
            <li>I was willing to pay more for an organic product, but I don&#x27;t think this butter from Nature and Herbs is organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product is rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>This product is great for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>but it worked great for my dry legs.  </li>
            <li>Works great for dry skin...</li>
            <li>The mixture turned out gritty (probably because it froze during delivery), but it becomes smooth when I rub it in and feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It was ok, kind of gritty</li>
            <li>IT HAS RESTORED THE DRY DAMMAGED HAIR.THIS IS ALSO GREAT IN MY SKIN CARE PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>I had actually bought a container of this exact shea butter from amazon before and was extremely happy with it&#x27;s ability to straighten out my curly fine hair.</li>
            <li>good quality, smells well.&lt;br /&gt;Color is light yellow.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great to use on your feet, then put some cozy socks, don&#x27;t  forget your hands :) I have even used it as a primer for some of my drier eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>Item arrived mostly safe, however, the plastic tub it arrived in made it clear that the package had been dropped, bumped around, and had heavier things on top of it.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t bleached white like the kind you buy in a jar or tube which is even better knowing it&#x27;s not chemically altered.</li>
            <li>the product is not AS gritty as i was expecting by the reviews i read myself on here before purchasing - that was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and as natural as you can get!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, absorbs quickly into the skin, and the mild odor fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the PURE SHEA BUTTER...</li>
            <li>Great product for hair, but it has a strong odor, you will have to mix this with another butter, or just get the ivory shea, which has less of a smell.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and easy to mix into my natural hair products.</li>
            <li>of them are the color of bright yellow butter.</li>
            <li>Bright yellow</li>
            <li>also the color varies from bright yellow to ivory, which also looks unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is a BRIGHT YELLOW.  </li>
            <li>Since March, we&#x27;ve discovered that when she comes in contact with something that she shouldn&#x27;t have (food or in the environment) and starts to get a rash, we have her take a cool shower and then put a generous layer of Shea Butter over the rashy areas.  </li>
            <li>I should have listened to one of the reviewers when she mentioned that she thought she got a not so good batch because it was mustard yellow</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I thought I was going to have to put my own natural scents in there (lavendar or vanilla)</li>
            <li>True story.</li>
            <li>we decided to try it and it was a dream come true.</li>
            <li>The price at the art fair was $30 for 4oz and was the same identical thing as this!!</li>
            <li>Does not it say if should melt, &amp;iquest;how to apply it?, &amp;iquest;as Much as?, &amp;iquest;as Many as days?, &amp;iquest;applies during the day or at night?  </li>
            <li>At this point you may add a couple of drops of essential oils to make it smell good</li>
            <li>Still a good butter with some similar properties.</li>
            <li>It has more moisture than real Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I was very well pleased with the pureness of the product and the quickness of its delivery.  </li>
            <li>is good for daily moisturizing of the body, face and hair.  </li>
            <li>but it is not a bad price.  </li>
            <li>and it is still fresh, rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>When the package arrived I noticed it had a strong smell, but I think I was too excited about its arrival to really notice it.</li>
            <li>Pure unrefined shea butter is cream in color!!</li>
            <li>When I first bought this product, I thought it was fine, but unremarkable.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be ordering more in a day or two.</li>
            <li>More often than not, her rash looks much better by the following morning and with continued use of the Shea Butter</li>
            <li>More often than not, her rash looks much better by the following morning and with continued use of the Shea Butter</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li>I did appreciate the quick shipment but the product was a bust.  </li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and was wrapped well.</li>
            <li>It has a mild smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month, and it has been super.  </li>
            <li>i bought this because i am pregnant</li>
            <li>(what pregnant woman wouldnt try anything?)</li>
            <li>I just love how it makes my face feel so soft and smooth looking.</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick and prompt, and the quantity you receive for the price you pay is a bargain.  </li>
            <li>9 mts pregnant</li>
            <li>oh and mails quickly</li>
            <li>Received product quickly.</li>
            <li>I know many people us this product primarily on the skin; however, I use it on my young daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>A quick google search came up w/</li>
            <li>I was using this for lotion bars, and the shea aroma quickly overpowered the scents I tried to add.</li>
            <li>Product was delivered quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for whole body - and is definitely a 24 hour moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Look how much really good skin cream that truely works on dry thirsty skin costs and the size of the product.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was packaged in large chunks which made it easy to transfer it to plastic bags.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dyed bright yellow which stains your skin and clothes, it&#x27;s greasy, has a strong odor and is more gritty than shea.</li>
            <li>I love the smell; very natural, sweet and</li>
            <li>With a little research, I found that the best shea butter is older shea butter, and shea butter gets yellower as it ages.</li>
            <li>I ordered the shea butter it was shipped promptly and arrived quick (could be because they are located about a good 15 mins from where I live) but none the less I am satisfied thoroughly with my order and will be purchasing products from them again!</li>
            <li>So when I received yellow shea butter, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>It also takes a while to absorb and has a light but funny smell.</li>
            <li>The difference is that with getting Shea Butter directly you are getting the best of the other products.  </li>
            <li>verses buying the real pure thing...</li>
            <li>This product works really good on the really dry areas of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Shea butter is very moistening an easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that strong of an odor, really.</li>
            <li>We were a little concerned about the person who had objected to the bright color and strong smell, and who had a skin reaction to the product.</li>
            <li>the plus side, my hands are very soft and smooth now from cleaning the shea butter off of everything else!</li>
            <li>but didn&#x27;t really work for me!!</li>
            <li>(But I&#x27;m not an expert, this is my first time using it), however it is worth noting the state that it arrived in!</li>
            <li>They have a strong odor that we identified as very similar to cocoa butter, except cocoa butter smells more chocolately (we have some and compared).</li>
            <li>I am glad i found a place to get the pure shea butter at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>I once paid $18 bucks for a 2ounce container of what I THOUGHT was real shea butter and was perplexed.</li>
            <li>I put my hair in two strand twist, and the next day I unraveled the twist and the outcome was AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Overall an amazing product.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li>It really has made a huge difference, and no chemicals to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have looked for years to find something that would be absorbed by my skin, not be greasy, yet would moisturize.</li>
            <li>I made a facial conditioning mix of about 70% shea butter (this product), 20% rose hipp oil, and 10% tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>(very) slowly absorbed.</li>
            <li>Please be kind enough to allow me to explain as follows:  </li>
            <li>which is nice enough</li>
            <li>Please be kind enough to help me.    </li>
            <li>Please be kind enough to help them out??</li>
            <li>I mixed the clumps of Shea butter with a blender, and it made a nice creamy texture.</li>
            <li>It does magic and made my skin smooth, especially my face.</li>
            <li>I keep meaning to move it to another container, like an old Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter jar or something, which I think would work better.</li>
            <li>I used it to create my own body butter using Jojoba Oil, Coconut Oil and Grapefruit Essential Oil.</li>
            <li>I love it so far.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I thought this information would be useful to those wondering about this.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I thought this information would be useful to those wondering about this.</li>
            <li>This was a purchase that was worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>its like the butter absorbed the oils.</li>
            <li>The product was fresh and came in a well-sealed container.</li>
            <li>even the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>then when it&#x27;s warm and melted I rub it on my face, especially around the eyes, my neck, stretchmarks on my belly</li>
            <li>It is good, though not what I expected.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that amazon offers a pagakage deal to.</li>
            <li>As it;s supposedly all natural, I will continue to give this some more time to \\&quot;work.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>It is very well absorbed by the skin and leaves it smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>As much as I love virgin coconut oil and use it for everything, shea butter far surpasses it in the moisture department.</li>
            <li>,IT&#x27;S THE BALM.SERIOUSLY ,IT&#x27;S FRESH SMELLS</li>
            <li>I bought it to use \\&quot;as is\\&quot; in its natural state like most of the customer reviews state.  </li>
            <li>But it was altogether worth the purchase .</li>
            <li>It has kind of a strange odor but its not a bad smell</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>It took a while to come in -- but it was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>tHIS PRODUCT USEFUL IN RELIEVING SKIN DRYNESS AROUND CUTICLES</li>
            <li>Love the soft skin in the morning.</li>
            <li>I used it for two days under my eyes and saw fine lines diminish more significantly than with months of use with other products.  </li>
            <li>CREOLE LOVE PRODUCTS ARE MADE WITH HIGH QUALITY INGREDIENTS TO INCLUDE, PURE UNREFINED SHEA BUTTER, PURE OILS - SWEET ALMOND, JOJOBA, OLIVE, ARGAN, AND COCONUT</li>
            <li>it does take a little while to soak in but it is pretty great after that.  </li>
            <li>This product is a bright yellowish color and is extremely creamy.</li>
            <li>It is good for scarring, soothing stretch marks and a host of other things.  </li>
            <li>But I just edited mine right now to add this....</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t feel right to her.  </li>
            <li>right from the nut.  </li>
            <li>After doing a lot of review about shea butter, I have come to conclusion that this is the right butter for me.</li>
            <li>O yes the price was right at the time I brough it.  </li>
            <li>When I got the Organic Shea butter, I wondered if the butter was all right.</li>
            <li>i use it for almost everything that i need moisturized, mix it with raw sugar and you make a great shower scrub that leaves your legs</li>
            <li>This product has really impressed me so much, not only has it helped with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>They live in Arizona and find the shea butter to be great in their very dry climate.   </li>
            <li>It is solid at room temperature, but melts on your skin very easily.  </li>
            <li>I love that moisturizes like no other lotion that I have tried except Ecco Bella, but without the liquid consistency.</li>
            <li>So far, the best stuff I&#x27;ve come across for anything skin related was the natural Shea butter they sell raw at the Del Mar Fair in San Diego County.</li>
            <li>Great and natural for dry skin.</li>
            <li>In addition to this I would recommend African Black Soap the best one is by DUDU Oson</li>
            <li>I occasionally suffer eczema and this mild moisturizer does not worsen the condition as most moisturizers do in my experience.</li>
            <li>But I just wasn&#x27;t ready to give up, plus I had to find out why I had such a reaction to a natural product that is said to be great for everyone...</li>
            <li>But even if this stuff isn&#x27;t pure, its super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It seems whenever I use any kind of lotion my skin just soaks it right up and still is dry.</li>
            <li>They are great for my sensitive and dry skin!</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for pure unrefined shea butter go to coastal scents or somewhere else, because this is not it!</li>
            <li>The butter was actually soft and easy to use out of the container.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you have a real all natural loofah for your shower to exfoliate...</li>
            <li>Are you sensitive to strong smells?</li>
            <li>Made a batch of lipstick with this, very very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>On my quest to find organic, raw shea butter on Amazon, I have not been too successful.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of other online retailers who will provide a superior quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I was also very surprised to find that I could use it on my face as a cream and that it was so potent that I only had to apply it three times a week to keep my hair smooth and controlled.</li>
            <li>Rub it in really well and your skin will absolutely glow!!  </li>
            <li>I store it in a dry cool dark place and it still is smelling good!  </li>
            <li>It has a bit of an fragrance, not much - but the moisture is amazing.</li>
            <li>Most recently I ordered 10Lbs of Shea on 2 day delivery on Dec.1, 2010.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s also great for hair as well, well at least my hair.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that i wish I could get more for the $$</li>
            <li>He did give me the courtesy of calling first.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re smooth and soft now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re smooth and soft now.    </li>
            <li>First, this does not come on the nut as pictured.  </li>
            <li>The seller shipped this so fast my head was spinning!  </li>
            <li>First purchase came in a bag and was creamy.  </li>
            <li>Instead, I have turned it into a paste and used it, along with jojoba and castor oil, as hot oil hair treatment.</li>
            <li>The smell on the first day was a bit offensive to me</li>
            <li>I tried mixing it with my Kitchen Aid, and it came out pretty well.  </li>
            <li>This product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I will surely be buying more when my current supply runs low.</li>
            <li>Really pleased I took another chance purchasing online from Dade and will buy from this seller again, hopefully with similar results.</li>
            <li>REALLY!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall though, up until this most recent order, it has been amazing stuff and worked very well, despite the strange packaging.</li>
            <li>I have used several brands of shea butter in the past, but this is one of the best.</li>
            <li>The white seems lighter and not as potent.  </li>
            <li>In sunny, hot conditions, I use an SPF over it, as I think it would may cause sunburning.</li>
            <li>This was my first time ordering.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty greasy.)</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>(*blush*), feet, arms, elbows, etc.  </li>
            <li>At first I didnt like the smell</li>
            <li>It is a bit grainy and not as pictured, but more like melted yellow Shea in a plastic jar.</li>
            <li>Seller, fast shipping, but does not respond to my emails!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the scent of the gold to be objectionalble at all, in fact I like it, and I&#x27;m the first one in any group to complain about the smell of something.</li>
            <li>Love it third time ordering</li>
            <li>When i first opened the container, the stench practically hit me in the face.</li>
            <li>greasy at first,</li>
            <li>and I love using it for everything, even as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>(but so much cheaper!)</li>
            <li>After using it for a while I was sure there was oil mixed with it, but now I can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I have purchased 100% Shea butter</li>
            <li>I love African Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>it is a bit higher in price here at Amazon...</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an actor in a very physically demanding play, performing barefoot, and my feet love being nourished before and after each show.</li>
            <li>its authentic.. generic...</li>
            <li>AND THE PRICE IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE SAME PRODUCT YOU CAN PURCHASE FROM BOTIQUES IN THE FANCY BOTTLES.</li>
            <li>This was my first order of Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>It does have an odor, but I was aware it would.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also heard essential oils helped with the odor - but there are so many to choose from at the health food store</li>
            <li>If you live where the product might freeze during the delivery process, be sure to ask for special packing such as newspaper to insulate it.  </li>
            <li>After removing one small clump and letting it warm in my hand it is easily spreadable and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Shea butter is clean and quite soft!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait for winter because now I know that I have real, proven, effective solution for my dry</li>
            <li>If used properly, this is a mild, highly effective moisturizer for dry, sensitive or healthy skin.</li>
            <li>It melts easily in your hands and rubs on smooth and if you have dry skin it really penetrates and moisturizes the skin.</li>
            <li>but I guess you have to know how to MIX this in with other ingredients, because, on its own, you can&#x27;t just \\&quot;rub it into your skin\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>It is a raw shea butter and has the nutty smell, and it does feel good on the skin aside the grainyness.  </li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer, and it&#x27;s really helped my skin go from dry and dull to comfortable and glowing along with a more natural skin-care regimen.  </li>
            <li>bright yellow and obviously scraped</li>
            <li>It may also be mixed with some oil, because it is oilier than the ASBI-certified product, and its color is bright yellow, not ivory.</li>
            <li>I have recently purchased unrefined shea butter, which is ivory (not white) in color, from another retailer that claims to be a fair trade organization.</li>
            <li>I also recently got some real shea butter straight from west Africa and noted that it was so smooth when being applied and did not have this grainy sandy stuff that this product has.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways,if you have no other option of getting real straight from the source shea butter, this would be a good 2nd!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very, very soft, and melts and absorbs VERY easily, however, it&#x27;s as yellow as a daisy.</li>
            <li>I am really happy and satisfied with this shea butter, it really works well in face and hair and even in my  lips, my husband love that for his feet, when you put a little in your face  or hair it looks  as oily, but don&#x27;t worry, few minutes later it is like your skin and hair drink that, so you can touch your hair and face without problem!!!</li>
            <li>Hands are super soft!</li>
            <li>and i saw alot of positive comments on organic shea butter .</li>
            <li>Keeping in mind that this is my first concoction, I think it turned out very well.</li>
            <li>First, it is real shea butter.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not my favorite scent in the world, I rather have it present as an indicator of the Shea butter being authentic and unprocessed.</li>
            <li>not use as I have too sensitive skin to try something that I do not know the full ingredients of.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I listened to the reviewers who gave this product high marks, and they were right.    </li>
            <li>I was pretty bummed because they had very few ingredients, were all natural, and made my skin look great.</li>
            <li>I heated it however, and melted it down to a nice consistancy.  </li>
            <li>Shea Institute has a great fact sheet all about what real shea butter is and the importance of testing, I learned that the government nor any other agency requires shea butter to be tested for quality and safety prior to selling.</li>
            <li>It glides and absorbs in my skin and hair easily, and moisturizes at the same time.</li>
            <li>I got the oil too, which turned out to be effective and less fussy.</li>
            <li>It was also relatively easy to mask the smoky scent with some lemon essential oil.</li>
            <li>My doctor, who recommended I use shea butter on the bottom of my dry cracked feet, said it had an odor that many people don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>This has a very yellow coloring and a overly strong scent.</li>
            <li>Unrefined coconut oil has a strong smell and a slightly different consistency.</li>
            <li>some say off white, some say strong smell</li>
            <li>However, it was accidentally thrown out, and I was buying from another company, so I bought pure unrefined shea butter from them as well.    </li>
            <li>We have been using shea butter but not in its pure form</li>
            <li>I just wanted Pure shea butter and BTW</li>
            <li>I do not plan on reordering from this seller, as I don&#x27;t believe this shea butter is pure.</li>
            <li>could I be allergic to 100% pure shea</li>
            <li>One can tell it is not 100% pure.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be ordering it again.</li>
            <li>You get a large amount of shea butter (16 oz.)</li>
            <li>the shea butter came in one large container like others have said it smelled nutty looks greasy upon application</li>
            <li>Pure Africa Shea Butter.\\</li>
            <li>I have never had/used pure Shea Butter before, but like this in a lotion recipe I made.  </li>
            <li>This product is pure and organic.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to people not only with a skin condition, but to people who have dry, flaky skin and need a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>so I guess I looked fine enough.  </li>
            <li>S&amp;H. The package from USPS was fine until I opened said pkg to find chunks of shea butter all over the inner containers.</li>
            <li>Product is fine but my personal preference is cacao butter.  </li>
            <li>My third pound came in a plastic tub and had a grittiness to it but was otherwise fine.</li>
            <li>What I have noticed was that funny oily smell on some clothes (mainly my robe) after washing.  </li>
            <li>If you DO your research, you will see that colors can vary from beige to off white and a mild yellow to a bright yellow.</li>
            <li>on Dec. 3, 2010 when my delivery DID NOT show up I tracked my package online and called UPS, Amazon and ALIVE &amp; AWARE!</li>
            <li>I now just warm the shea butter and blend in http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028POGA/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o05_s00_i01 , http://www.amazon.com/Natures-Way-Organic-Virgin-Coconut/dp/B003B3OOPA/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1357336912&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;coconut+oil , and a little bit of olive oil for shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I was a little turned off when I saw it was yellow, but it turned out to be great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer, you only need a little bit to cover any area.</li>
            <li>I will spend a little more money and get better quality next time.</li>
            <li>The product arrived very quickly, securely packaged, and I was amazed at the amount I received for such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Real Shea Butter does not smell like cocoa, it&#x27;s actually almost smell free.</li>
            <li>Instead I whipped this into a fluffy body butter incorporating in coconut and argan oils with amazing moisturizing results.</li>
            <li>I never thought to review this item seeing as it had such a huge amount of reviews covering just about everything from it&#x27;s strength to it&#x27;s restorative abilities on hair, but I decided after about a week to go ahead and review it.</li>
            <li>My hubby(who is very skeptical)and who also used to swear by vaseline.</li>
            <li>The label says to use as a lip balm - thanks for the tip</li>
            <li>However, within about 30 minutes after applying it, the itchiness is reduced to being bearable and the Shea Butter is absorbing into the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, within about 30 minutes after applying it, the itchiness is reduced to being bearable and the Shea Butter is absorbing into the skin.    </li>
            <li>The seller was very responsive.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the message.  </li>
            <li>and I have yet to see how much it weighs</li>
            <li>plus who cares how much it weighs....</li>
            <li>All be it an ounce is not so much but</li>
            <li>Did it smell smokey like real shea butter?</li>
            <li>I am very please with the product.  </li>
            <li>this is the real thing, if it was not for the ambiance and energy of Harlem I would continue getting my Shea butter here.</li>
            <li>This is the yellow shea butter thats sold in those oriental shops for a cheap pricing.</li>
            <li>Thanks...</li>
            <li>My daughter and I carefully read many reviews on this product as well as the three pound product.</li>
            <li>Also real shea butter does not feel greasy on the skin.</li>
            <li>though it was the real stuff.  </li>
            <li>What a surprise when I realized that I had yet to feel the real thing on my skin.   </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care to much for the smell</li>
            <li>The seller shiped fast.  </li>
            <li>Again it&#x27;s the real deal and this time I weighed it prior to using it and found it is exactly as stated, a full pound.</li>
            <li>when i did i put too much oil in it &amp; it became watery</li>
            <li>my whole life(i have keloid skin</li>
            <li>I guess I expected something more on the lines of a cocoa butter smell.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to try it yourself (refrigerate bewteen uses)!</li>
            <li>I hope it&#x27;s really unrefined shea butter as seller claims.</li>
            <li>I am not a connoisseur and so cannot comment on the purity of this product, but it seems like the real deal to me.</li>
            <li>I actually put it on my face and throat every night &amp; wake feeling fantastic.</li>
            <li>we have tried all cremes including organic ones and they didnt do much.</li>
            <li>his skin was moistured for 3 days straight.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of this Shea butter</li>
            <li>and it works wonderfully, even in the harshest cold.</li>
            <li>I thought it was highly unusual for me, as I am not allergic to anything.</li>
            <li>I have also learned that real unrefined and \\&quot;un-messed around</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have now ordered this twice for making homemade body moisturizers and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I am a diabetic and suffer from severe, intense, itching skin, and immediately felt relief in using this product.  </li>
            <li>Went to use it to make body cream and found whole flies in it.</li>
            <li>It really helps a lot.  </li>
            <li>I apply it on my face and on the whole body after bath.</li>
            <li>its the real deal.</li>
            <li>Con must apply to very warmed skin.</li>
            <li>This was a highly anticipated purchase for me!</li>
            <li>Is everyone really using the product \\&quot;as is\\&quot; without \\&quot;filtering\\&quot;?[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It is organic and very healing on your skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I think I will stop using it since I have no proof of its originality and beside it really does not work.</li>
            <li>If you want the real thing dont buy it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is greasy, but doesn&#x27;t really feel like it.  </li>
            <li>however I don&#x27;t really worry about this as I apply in shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but with a few extra things its a perfect, all natural, and affordable beauty product for my sensitive</li>
            <li>AS MUCH AS I HAVE.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very minuscule.</li>
            <li>it looks very suspicious to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nature and Herbs shipped very promptly, shipment was wrapped in a padded mailer and then a cardboard mailer.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>and it is real...</li>
            <li>I do not have much experience with Shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Really like it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works very well as a stand alone product or incorporated in your bath and body products.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I do it that way to smooth it onto my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also cut open a couple big aloe leaves from my own plant and added them after smoothing in a food processor.</li>
            <li>I will look for something that is organic with shea butter but added natural ingredients to make it more fluid.</li>
            <li>Since it lasts so long (I am only about half-way through mine after nearly a year), the light plastic tends to get dented and the lid doesn&#x27;t always seem super secure.  </li>
            <li>but you will know what I mean if you read the FAQ&#x27;s on Fair Trade...     </li>
            <li>What I received was genuine Shea butter that appears to be both raw, pure and very fresh.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have found that whipping it makes it creamy and easier to use than in its natural form right out of the container.  </li>
            <li>There are so many other uses you can find on the web</li>
            <li>Other than that, I was totally satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Several people who are familiar with her pre-shea butter hair ask me what I&#x27;m putting on her hair.  </li>
            <li>Other shea butters I&#x27;ve had experience with are more of a cream color.  </li>
            <li>Because it is the West African Shea butter, it is a bit more solid and less emollient than that of East Africa, but I just warm it in my hands a bit before applying, and it is easier to use.  </li>
            <li>It turned out super SUPER rich and thick.</li>
            <li>i was trying to use it as a diaper cream, as a dry skin moistureizer and treating very mild eczema and scars</li>
            <li>I love this products it helps fade away dark areas and stretch marks its really works</li>
            <li>Past reviews have been correct as far as the smell and the feeling of play doh, hopefully the results will be as good as everyone elses.</li>
            <li>ALIVE &amp; AWARE</li>
            <li>I immediately called UPS, Amazon and ALIVE &amp; AWARE and</li>
            <li>I will definitely be mixing in some coconut or sweet almond oil to balance it out.</li>
            <li>natural products are gonna smell funny, if yu are lookin for results from a skin problem, deal with it.</li>
            <li>If I could do it again, I would spend the few extra bucks to get a real pound of unrefined shea butter from a verified fair trade company.</li>
            <li>Shea butter is pretty miraculous and all natural.  </li>
            <li>Take the soft consistency shea butter out of the hot water/pot on stove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok, I just got my raw Shea Butter today, and first off the container was dented and then duct taped like it had been thrown against the wall.</li>
            <li>I live in Sacramento, CA!</li>
            <li>Works great on dry winter skin and a pound will last a LONG time!</li>
            <li>Found this product to be the best moisturizer so far for cold winter days.</li>
            <li>I have found a better quality shea butter (the lighter colored shea butters are creamier, less grit) on another site for a comparable price</li>
            <li>During the winter months my skin become so dry and cracked you could light a match off of my hand.</li>
            <li>Shea butter is used in soo many skin products for stretch marks &amp; such, but I cant seem to understand why people buy the refined junk and products that simply only CONTAIN shea butter,</li>
            <li>My skin is getting older with all the sun, winter heat, and wear...</li>
            <li>I ordered from this particular vendor.</li>
            <li>I assumed this would of been the white shea butter and more solid.</li>
            <li>My hair is the texture that I believe most African American women have.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely try more shea butter in the future, but probably not from this seller.</li>
            <li>It is lovely, fluffy, and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shea butter back in March, and I still have enough for I&#x27;m sure well into December.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But the top was a deep yellow</li>
            <li>Just recently bought this after trying 100% pure organic shea butter at an art fair this past weekend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a miracle for my sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t even have to buy lotion anymore!</li>
            <li>With all of the products out there,   it is hard to tell what is really the \\&quot;Natural Shea Butter\\&quot; product but as far as I am concerned this  product is good.</li>
            <li>It became creamy and very useful healing my dry skin.</li>
            <li>The process is messy, but the shea butter cleans easily with HOT water.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>they also said that this product is the main raw ingredient to make my own body butter and that they do not advise using it directly on the skin.  </li>
            <li>This stuff, albeit it very different from other \\&quot;moisturizers\\&quot;, is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it became so widely adopted with this title, but having Kapangnan Butter, Golden Shea or even African Tallow as part of the title would be more appropriate.</li>
            <li>I had never tried pure Shea butter in it&#x27;s natural form before.</li>
            <li>I also like that this is a pure and natural product.</li>
            <li>Its a little more creamy than Real Shea butter and it works well for natural hair.</li>
            <li>So far my hands feel very good--after washing the mixing bowl</li>
            <li>Someone should really do their research before labeling an all natural product like this.</li>
            <li>I really like the ivory ones with my old orders.</li>
            <li>Kindly &amp; Urgently Request for the Removal of the Negative Feedback for Amazon Order ID#xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx    </li>
            <li>I thought it was okay, started to use it for a few weeks or so...</li>
            <li>True, it does have a long shelf of 18-24 months, but it eventually will turn rancid just like all oils and butters do.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, the Shea butter keeps my hair very moist and soft and I have natural African American hair.  </li>
            <li>this might last me a good 8 months if not more.</li>
            <li>This most recent order here in January of 2012 came in a 16 oz plastic clear \\&quot;tub\\&quot; with a real label on it of African Shea Butter 100% Natural.  </li>
            <li>with\\&quot; shea butter should be cream colored to golden yellow.</li>
            <li>I bought mine with the Shea Butter oil and use the two together, but I have also mixed it with my own essential oils for a personal scent.  </li>
            <li>First time I bought this, it was pretty good aside from the swirl of mixed colors which I know is not ideal but normal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and has a nice thick consistency.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After chipping some of this stuff off the block in the container it does seem to be shea butter, but it is very odd that there are so many variations received on this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little greasy at first on the body, but give it a few mins and your good.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona.  </li>
            <li>I tried many skin creams, but raw shea butter is a keeper.</li>
            <li>This has made such a difference in how my skin feels and ended up being better than I expected.</li>
            <li>The refined would not be as strong and would have less chance of causing a reaction.</li>
            <li>As I survive by the rate of the positive feedback, please be kind enough to remove the negative feedback for me now.</li>
            <li>I found out that REAL raw shea butter is much more expensive and it was my own ignorance of shea butter that lead me to believe I could buy it so cheap....</li>
            <li>It makes it very soft, shiny &amp;&amp; manageable when applied generously.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin Very soft throught the days i apply it.</li>
            <li>I weight each one on an ounce scale that I use to weight out soap ingredients and its very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>b/c after 2 kids, my sense of smell is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>And my sense of smell is VERY sensitive.  </li>
            <li>very soft and works well with my skin.</li>
            <li>but then it goes away and leaves very soft, hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>a natural product that works and does not cost an arm and a leg!</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of other moisturizers to keep my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty yellow in color and smells a bit rancid.</li>
            <li>Any natural diva would tell you that one of her staple products is shea butter!</li>
            <li>It also had a moderate scent unique to Shea, an almost smoky and nutty scent similar to rubbery oud.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for a short while, however not on a consistent basis.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if anyone is aware of the term \\&quot;chicken-skin\\&quot;, referring to the bumps on the back of arms and thighs</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering from someone else in the future and not on here as many 3rd party vendors are selling this African Butter as \\&quot;Shea Butter.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It stains and is pretty gritty.    </li>
            <li>BEFORE I WASH ,I LEAVE IT IN THE LAST 2/3RDS OF MY HAIR ,I GO OUT AND DO MY BUSINESS AND GET A HOT OIL CONDITIONER</li>
            <li>It also looks more yellow than other Shea butter</li>
            <li>and if you fake tan like myself it give it an extra yellow under tone that looks great!</li>
            <li>However, it is either not Grade A butter, or it is past the expiration date, or maybe it was reheated many times.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is really raw, works well but isn&#x27;t very clean.</li>
            <li>I even had some frost bite on my leg around my ankle and it turned black but thanks to the shea butter, the scars are healing up quickly</li>
            <li>It does have a bit of a strange scent to it, but I got used to it very quickly and while I was initially surprised by the skin reaction(pimples and such)</li>
            <li>I used to live in Ghana, West Africa years before moving to the U.S.A, and as such, i know how pure shea butter from Ghana feel, smell, and look like.</li>
            <li>im   hispanic honduran and black and natural and it works just fine.   </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and as a last resort was willing to go organic.</li>
            <li>I  was using Ultra Sheen, Pink Lotion, stuff called Super Grow, Doctor Miracle, Castor Oil and my hair</li>
            <li>, luckily my first order of the item came in a large (I&#x27;d say it could hold 32 oz) white \\&quot;tub\\&quot; with a basic \\&quot;self-print\\&quot; barcode label attached.  </li>
            <li>Either they are not organic (seeming to be inconsistent in color, packaging, and product), or they are processed/melted so that they are not raw</li>
            <li>This raw shea butter is as good as it gets when it comes to lotions, skin butters and other moisturizing products.</li>
            <li>Several whole and many small pieces of the insects.</li>
            <li>a few hours after I wrote it in light of new information I have come across.</li>
            <li>and as such am much less satisfied.</li>
            <li>After opening the sealed plastic package I noticed a strong smell, not a bad smell, but very different from the other 4x more expensive shea butters I have tried.</li>
            <li>The dudu-osun soap is fine, but I have doubts about the shea butter oil as it made me dried out and</li>
            <li>I have used shea butter for a longtime, and as such i know this definitely isn&#x27;t pure Ghanaian shea butter.</li>
            <li>Pure African Shea butter is one of the oldest forms of moisturizing around.  </li>
            <li>I seriously spent $12 on 2oz of pure shae butter at Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>It is solid so if you want to mix in your favorite lotion dig a little bit out from the tub , and melt in the microwave.</li>
            <li>I think that as suggested by some, that you could put it all into a mix master with the paddle attachment to change it from being a hard consistency to something more whipped...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so thick that I will have to mix it with oils to be able to smooth it on to my skin a little easier.</li>
            <li>color is a noticeable bright canary/mustard yellow and it has a hard solid form.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not new to Shea butter because I&#x27;ve used the refined version before; I just didn&#x27;t know that the raw kind existed.</li>
            <li>If it cannot be shipped to AZ in the summertime, that should be made clear in the description or it should not allow you to ship it to AZ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is in chunks in a clear plastic tub.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great for after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put a few table spoons in bath water for a natural and cheap bath oil.</li>
            <li>The shea butter completely melted and leaked all over the rest of my order.  </li>
            <li>IT MAKES YOUR SKIN SOFT</li>
            <li>AND IT ALSO MAKES YOUR HAVE SOFT .</li>
            <li>your skin is really soft after its rubbed in.</li>
            <li>but this very inexpensive product rehydrates to the point where my neck, hands, feet look so much younger.</li>
            <li>so natural smelling</li>
            <li>I am frequently in the hospital for my Sickle Cell sometimes up to 2 weeks at a time and when I get out itz</li>
            <li>, how do I know its all natural???</li>
            <li>Gets rid of blemishes, and it helps skin return to it&#x27;s natural skin tone.</li>
            <li>I added some lavender essential oil at the end, which didn&#x27;t affect the scent much but didn&#x27;t hurt it either.  </li>
            <li>The Shea Butter came out light and fluffy.  </li>
            <li>If the scent truly bothers you, maybe you should check out Candida Overgrowth as being over sensitive to scents can be a symptom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my skin is returning to it&#x27;s natural tone.</li>
            <li>, they instead sent two food grade plastic containers filled with yellow stuff with no protective plastic sealing or anything anyone could open it and use it then close it again, send it back</li>
            <li>The only con i have about this product is i don&#x27;t belive this is   real shea butter.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft, and moisturized (without my hair feeling too greasy).</li>
            <li>Not messy or anything like that and makes my skin and hair feel moisturized.</li>
            <li>and 2) Did it look old or smell rancid?</li>
            <li>and since I am a prime member knew if this was not the real thing I could send this back</li>
            <li>I hope in my next formulation it smooths out, otherwise I can&#x27;t really use it except maybe in making soap.  </li>
            <li>So, technically, I cannot say if this is the real deal or not.</li>
            <li>I thought \\&quot;Wow,</li>
            <li>I had to use a lot of detergent to wash out the mixing bowl haha, but it finally did come off.</li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t have a reaction to putting the butter directly on our hands and faces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do you have sensitive skin?</li>
            <li>And I obsesessed with products that make my hair soft b/c</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already used it on my natural hair and WOW...</li>
            <li>It makes my hands so soft.</li>
            <li>It was crumbly &amp; Soft.</li>
            <li>Natural Shea</li>
            <li>my skin feels soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>i was told this works and this is 100% natural.  </li>
            <li>its natural stuff.</li>
            <li>also makes hair feel soft</li>
            <li>REAL shea butter is an IVORY to BEIGE color, this is a MUSTARD YELLOW color.</li>
            <li>Secondly, Shea butter has a MUCH stronger sent, isn&#x27;t waxy feeling.    </li>
            <li>This much makes enough for us to use for about 3 months.</li>
            <li>saying that it smelled and that it wasn&#x27;t to be used directly on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not waste your money or your time.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a natural skin moisterizer that wasn&#x27;t a runny oil.</li>
            <li>Note: if you do not have a stand mixer, you can use a hand mixer, but it takes a while to get it soft and creamy, so consider having a buddy to do relays on holding the hand mixer.</li>
            <li>It does work at getting my roughest areas soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m newly natural and have been trying to get my hands on some shea butter to use in my DIY hair moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Used this product with coconut oil, beeswax and lemongrass oil (with a drop of Vit. E oil) to make natural lotion bars.  </li>
            <li>I use it for my 1 year old as well after bath and as a diaper rush cream.</li>
            <li>this is natural shea butter.</li>
            <li>Babby soft feet by morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It can be used for deep moisturizing or in smaller quantities as a light moisturizer such as under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Imagine my suprise when it arrived in some OLD plastic (probably used) container, with the words</li>
            <li>It heals chapped hands, lips and is a natural sun screen.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t bother my husbands sensitive nose</li>
            <li>Its the only thing Ive really found that can bring any moisture to my cuticles and keep them smoothed.</li>
            <li>Natural shea is supposed to be ivory in color.  </li>
            <li>It comes sealed in a heavy bag and was nine dollars and ninety five cents with free shipping for 16 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I have been using it as skin cream so far, no greasy feeling, the skin absorbs it well</li>
            <li>In the morning, my hair is still a lil damp but its shiny and so soft.</li>
            <li>After a week, my hair is still soft.</li>
            <li>The price was worth what I spent for the amount of product.</li>
            <li>this product will do a whole lot more for your skin than those lotions from victoria&#x27;s secret, bath and body works, nivea etc.</li>
            <li>This is just as good as expensive shea butter</li>
            <li>If anything it&#x27;s yellow color helped to tone down my red irritated skin to a more normal looking complexion!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only thing that works better is a move to Florida in the winter, much more expensive!</li>
            <li>It is very grainy [which may be due to reheatings], takes much longer to melt when rubbed between the palms, and longer to absorb into skin than the ASBI-certified product.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other lotions the shea is absorbed into the skin almost immediately and this is why I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this raw shea butter primarily for my hands and for under my eyes, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>This makes the second time I purchased this and this purchase is different from my first purchase.  </li>
            <li>I also applied this to my hair which is very chemically abused, and pretty dried.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be pretty common abroad epically in the US market where you will also find it labeled as Golden Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>OK big deal sure you have to pop a small portion of it (about half the size of a starburst for the whole body) into the microwave for 15 second and apply it to skin, but do you have any idea what is done to and added to the other lotions on the market.  </li>
            <li>Plus, one tub when opened seemed very shiny and moist on top, the other was dried out with large cracks in center.</li>
            <li>then i looked down and saw two containers filled with yellow stuff...</li>
            <li>I was highly dissapointed with my purschase, and i will definely be throwing it away, as i can&#x27;t imagine using African palm oil on my skin.</li>
            <li>A good skin conditioner and moisturizer but heavy consistency , use lightly dependent upon dryness of skin or those difficult areas such as elbows and feet.</li>
            <li>It is a little more yellow than some that I have purchased, but spreads and feels the same.  </li>
            <li>The backs of my hands are smoother with much less roughness due to keratosis spots, and I truly believe that already I am seeing fine lines under my eyes disappearing!  </li>
            <li>My order is deep yellow/gold, almost mustard in color and while I&#x27;m aware the color of unrefined shea butter ranges from ivory/beige to yellow, this one is either mixed with palm oil or something else or the stock is very old.</li>
            <li>This was a very mustard yellow (which shows in your homemade lotions and salves) and very moist, rough texture.</li>
            <li>she is almost back normal in 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li>she is almost back normal in 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my hands and within days my hands was back to normal.  </li>
            <li>Originally purchased Raw Shae Butter for use in homemade deodorant, but now use it as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>What the seller did was mixed the pure shea butter with African palm oil, hence the smell and yellowish color.</li>
            <li>I live in a very rural area and could not find shea butter around.  </li>
            <li>This product has rather faint tobacco smell and it is bright yellow, which, as I understand, suggests that something was added to it.</li>
            <li>I do use a lot after my shower but my legs get so dry in the winter under my jeans and this has really helped.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend it for people with dry skin it works wonders.</li>
            <li>It has worked very well on finger cuts and dry spots.  </li>
            <li>This is worth it even though the shipping is crazy (more than the product).</li>
            <li>I was concerned about some features that others complained of in their reviews (mostly the smell and the yellow color rubbing off on clothing, etc.).  </li>
            <li>My only problem occurred when my dog devoured the whole 8-oz tub of the gold shortly after I got it.</li>
            <li>I have ordered real shea butter and it is supposed to be white, not yellow.</li>
            <li>After a minute in the microwave and a couple of stirs with a fork, it went right down to liquid form.</li>
            <li>No other cream or lotion has worked so well on my skin like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like 100% pure and raw shea butter.  </li>
            <li>guess some might consider this a tedious process, but it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li>True it does have a slight smell, but only for a minute or so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost positive that this shea butter is not pure, it&#x27;s grade</li>
            <li>Shea butter is never a bright yellow, the bright yellow butter is actually African butter which comes from an entirely different tree.</li>
            <li>Generally, shea butter has a smokey or roasted smell, this shea butter did not.</li>
            <li>and although it goes on smoother than cacao it doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate as well and also gives a cooling sensation to the skin, which I may love on a hot summer day but don&#x27;t appreciate on a cold winter night.</li>
            <li>Once it totally absorbs in the skin, it has a natural look that looks as though you haven&#x27;t applied anything to your skin.     </li>
            <li>Either way you just have to be careful not to apply too much.</li>
            <li>And, apparently, that adds a stronger smell and, I would suspect, the rash that some people say they get.</li>
            <li>And, apparently, that adds a stronger smell and, I would suspect, the rash that some people say they get.</li>
            <li>I am going back to the 4x more times expensive, certified and real Shea butter.</li>
            <li>My hair is extra soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Instead this was an ivory color flecked in places by a light yellowish green with the overall texture of playdough and that telltale sticky/tackiness when pinched between your fingers present.</li>
            <li>However, maybe because this is a natural product, I am unsure, but before opening container, I noticed one batch had greenish, blue tinge in some areas.</li>
            <li>ALL OF THIS INFORMATION COMES DIRECTLY FROM THE AMERICAN SHEA INSTITUTE...</li>
            <li>but after a short while looks like nothing is there and leaves skin feeling soft</li>
            <li>his skin was soft and his knees started to peel on the 3rd day.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to odors, I would reocmmend the white, but otherwise, save your money and get this one.  </li>
            <li>When you get your butter, empty the contents of the plastic container into your stand mixer (use paddle attachment) and mix at low speed at first to keep it from flying everywhere.</li>
            <li>First off please do not pay attention to the reviews stating that this is not real shea butter based on the fact that it is yellow.</li>
            <li>Since it isn&#x27;t purified at all, it does have a slight scent that is kind of oily, but it didn&#x27;t take long to get used to, and it goes away once it is on the skin for a little while.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry or rashy skin.</li>
            <li>When I am using it daily, I don&#x27;t even have problems with dry skin and eczema (though mine really isn&#x27;t severe).  </li>
            <li>It really works well on dry skin and the effects are lasting.  </li>
            <li>The chunky appearance of it in the raw was a bit of a shock, but it works really well out here in the high desert.</li>
            <li>I felt the difference right away, and once my hair had dried I could see the difference.</li>
            <li>Doing that kept them from getting dry, chapped and cracked when they normally would have been a mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it on our hair as a pre-conditioner, yet</li>
            <li>I use it with other lotions but the shea butter has really helped keep my hands smoother.</li>
            <li>Other places I found on line were charging 2x as much for 1/2 the amount.  </li>
            <li>The color is golden yellow with a little bit contamination (with something brown color).</li>
            <li>This product is bright yellow (not cream, YELLOW-much yellower than all other shea butters I have seen), somewhat hard and therefore difficult to work with at times because it does not melt easily in the hands.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used shea butter for my skin (mixed black and white) and my very frizzy, dry hair.</li>
            <li>I recommend putting a bit of water on your chapped lips so they are very slightly moist and then putting a generous layer of Shea Butter over that, right before bed.  </li>
            <li>I recommend putting a bit of water on your chapped lips so they are very slightly moist and then putting a generous layer of Shea Butter over that, right before bed.  </li>
            <li>I have bought it from african venders  in New York City,also in Seattle Washington,the color has always been  a gold color,or a very deep yellow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 21, African American, natural hair, 4a hair, 4b hair, 4c hair, and some 3 a-b-or-c hair.</li>
            <li>I use shea butter for hair care (4a/4b African American natural hair) and as a skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li>is that, nearly a year later and still using the butter daily, I still get those comments from women I might not have seen in awhile.</li>
            <li>, i put some on my hands and my face and it feels completely greasy, (i definitely wouldnt use it on my face during the day) and the smell is definitely lingering, so</li>
            <li>It will probably take several days to remove it completely from inner areas.</li>
            <li>The Butter WAS NOT Dry.  </li>
            <li>The container is huge, and it&#x27;s not one of those weird containers you get from some natural products dealers that looks big on the outside but really isn&#x27;t once you open it.</li>
            <li>Oh my word, there was black mold like stuff and grease all over the outside of the bag, and the bag itself was open...not exactly reassuring.</li>
            <li>I actually mix this in one big batch with extra virgin olive oil, castor oil, jojoba oil, natural honey, sugar, and organic aloe vera.</li>
            <li>At first your skin will be oily, but after about three minutes the skin becomes soft and there is no more oiliness than a regular moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought some shea butter at a craft fair and it was very expensive</li>
            <li>for people of color this raw shea butter is a must, it is straight from the earth as god intended it to be, all natural.</li>
            <li>With shipping this product ended up costing me $20 but a little goes a long way, and you get 2 pounds worth.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of shea butter, so I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to, but it smelled fresh - vaguely like cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li>Then I order it here and get 8x as much for 30% less.</li>
            <li>Usually, my skin has to be moist for me to feel that the product is absorbing, but this just melts into your skin making it baby soft.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE OF THE SUMMER HEAT.AT THE SAME TIME I STARTED TO USE A NATURAL SHAMPOO BAR FOR DRY HAIR ,</li>
            <li>This is the first time I am trying raw shea butter, and I am hooked.  </li>
            <li>i live in the dry winters of Montana and this is the only thing that has worked to keep my skin from itching all day long.  </li>
            <li>Also, any undesirable smell (I didn&#x27;t mind it in natural form at all) can be fixed with a little essential oil in the mixing process as another reviewer indicated OR just wait after applying because the smell disappears after a while.</li>

            <li> I began researching shea butter and learned so many wonderful things.</li>
            <li> But I have to tell you the thing I was most impressed with</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!!!</li>
            <li> My skin was glowing and the smell that may offend some people lessens in intensity and smells pleasant on the skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with; bars are excellent.</li>
            <li> It is a very good moisturizer at an even better price with no chemicals or added fragrance for your skin to absorb.</li>
            <li> GOOD LUCK</li>
            <li> Good afternoon.    </li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> This butter is really, really good.</li>
            <li> It is good for the price offered though.</li>
            <li> and it should be good to go.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li> you need a really good moisturizer for your skin, this is a good product to soften it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It felt so good on my skin.  </li>
            <li> i planned on mixing it with jojoba oil almond oil &amp; nubian heritage shea butter lotion for it to smell good.</li>
            <li> time it came in a plastic bag with no label or anything, which was quite surprising</li>
            <li> It is simply good business to do so</li>
            <li> I used castor oil, olive oil, coconut oil, and the Africa&#x27;s Pride Herbal Oil which smells so good.  </li>
            <li> so the Africa&#x27;s Pride oil made it smell so good.  </li>
            <li> I looked around for a while for good shea butter</li>
            <li> I also enjoy using it as a hair conditioner (have to experiment to figure out what&#x27;s best for hair</li>
            <li> Upon research I found that using it alone as a hair treatment wasn&#x27;t a good idea</li>
            <li> I have fair skin that has had its share of sun damage over the years.  </li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer, expecially for people with eczema, like myself.  </li>
            <li> Great for body butter..whipped up nice</li>
            <li> This did work good on my face</li>
            <li> It is so good.</li>
            <li> I must say I bought a good stuff.</li>
            <li> It felt good on my hands as I was working with it.</li>
            <li> But the butter was a good quality and consistency, and a good ingredient for the lotion bars I made.</li>
            <li> Good price for what I got.</li>
            <li> It is good for making sunscreens and body butter.</li>
            <li> Loved this product.</li>
            <li> Good price, too.</li>
            <li> Still feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> but good..</li>
            <li> This is an extremely good moisturiser but it&#x27;s smell is waxy.  </li>
            <li> Good value for all the product I received.</li>
            <li> I loved it.  </li>
            <li> If you want good pricing and good service and good product, this is the place to go.</li>
            <li> Once you have some in your hands, rub together and it warms quickly and wonderfully to moisturize.   </li>
            <li> The quality of the shea butter is excellent and this is the fresh shipment.  </li>
            <li> In conclusion, this product was at an amazing price for the quality, and it feels so good</li>
            <li> I bought this because I heard so many great things about shea butter....</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the price, have made diaper rash cream and hand lotion from it.</li>
            <li> Awesome price and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Great for lying in the sun - great for right after a bath.  </li>
            <li> it is HUGE!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> If you have cracked or severely chapped lips, you might need to do this more than one night but the results are amazing!  </li>
            <li> If you have cracked or severely chapped lips, you might need to do this more than one night but the results are amazing!  </li>
            <li> but my skin was so much better for it!  </li>
            <li> just love this stuff!</li>

            <li> plan on buying 2 more as i am giving one away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks for tip!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, for EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> Perfect texture and exactly what I needed for my homemade deodorant project.  </li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, but will retain a strong aroma.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great on my whole body, perfect after shaving, and even clears up my mild eczema!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing use it in all my homemade organic skin care.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite an amazing concoction.  </li>
            <li> And this seller is amazing.</li>
            <li> Honestly, we should be apply it two times a day for preventative care.</li>
            <li> I did my own test on Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I think it smells like a petroleum chemical of some kind.</li>
            <li> honestly will never buy this again</li>
            <li> I did some more research and found Fair Trade...</li>
            <li> but they have a nice site that explains EVERYTHING about shea butter and as another review said this seller sends you Kpangana butter</li>
            <li> Have a nice day.      </li>
            <li> i purchased this for my wife so she can make her own hair products</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that the smell went away before the morning, and my hair is still thriving.</li>
            <li> a homemade sugar scrub does nicely.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll let you take your own conclusions about the purity of this shea butter, or even if it&#x27;s shea butter at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit grainy but still works nicely for my purposes.</li>
            <li> I kind of found this suspicious and went online to read about how shea butter can smell/feel and look like.</li>
            <li> I really liked it, so I got on the internet to see if I could find some.</li>
            <li> i honestly dont think it smells smokey.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to use their label and make my own cream.</li>
            <li> I researched this before buying and really liked the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good butter, but Shea butter is better and I&#x27;m giving it a 1 because the seller either doesn&#x27;t know or either does know and isn&#x27;t being honest.    </li>
            <li> In addition to being thrilled with the product, I was thrilled with the price as well.  </li>
            <li> some of it starts to warm and then melt onto my hands..</li>
            <li> I liked the smell</li>
            <li> As it is &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34;, it does have a kind of&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy like real butter, but did not leave an oily residue on my sheets, and I felt wonderful upon waking up this morning.  </li>
            <li> Upon heating though a good ammount of debris floated to the top and sunk to the bottom of the container.</li>
            <li> My skin is loving it.</li>
            <li> They gave me the \\&quot;recipe\\&quot; to make my own body butter</li>
            <li> I kind of like it is sort of smoky smelling.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to warm it up before using it, or cut/scoop pieces with a warm spoon/</li>
            <li> My family liked them.</li>
            <li> I really liked the purity and quality of this product.</li>
            <li> it does not at all stink, yes it has a very rich shea butter smell which is not along the lines of a \\&quot;sweet fragrance\\&quot; but still a very pleasant smell,</li>
            <li> The first two pounds I ordered came to me in bar form, and were very good quality ivory shea butter.</li>
            <li> Nice lemony color, good smell, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Overall this seems to be a good value and a great buy!    </li>
            <li> It did not smell rancid or burnt - just a very strong nutty odor.</li>
            <li> The product came faster than I thought it would be, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> From here on out I plan on mixing my own ingredients while avoiding the purchase of pricy lotions/hair products that are seemingly a much more temporary solution.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for nearly a year, though, and have noticed wonderful benefits to my skin.  </li>
            <li> when this amazing product has been available!</li>
            <li> this is by far the best shea butter i&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> After having a great experience with this sellers 8 oz&#x27;s of Golden Shea Butter Cream</li>
            <li> A wonderful, moisturizing, all natural product.  </li>
            <li> Also, you want the shea butter to be able to moisturize through the night, while you are warm in bed (optimal effects).    </li>
            <li> Knowing that baby gets no chemicals, just vitamin-rich natural shea butter, makes us very happy.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s even ok because when you rub it together it smooths on its own.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use many lotions but this is perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you are a natural and are looking for a good shea butter this is great.</li>
            <li> it certainly is not the best quality that I have found (or the best price), so I certainly have my doubts.</li>
            <li> Good product, decent packaging too for good shelf life.</li>
            <li> It made skin very smooth after application.</li>
            <li> It does not absorb into skin quickly, but seems to be a good emollient.  </li>
            <li> This is a great price for pure shea butter.  </li>
            <li> and they also love it too, and have purchased from this seller.</li>
            <li> and I was pleased with my bulk shipment at THAT time.</li>
            <li> This shea butter was not as greasing as many products I have attempted to put on my face</li>
            <li> I love this product &amp;&amp; I know most people use it for skin</li>
            <li> I know where to shop when I need more.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I think most of people could tolerate this smell after times.    </li>
            <li> We are both using this shea butter cream when skin gets inflamed and it works better than any creams we have bought otc and prescription.</li>
            <li> He tried it for the 1st time fell in love...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite fond of the chocolately smell, and love it.    </li>
            <li> I said it was okay, but I wanted the labels included.</li>
            <li> This is most difinitely one of Africa&#x27;s gifts.</li>
            <li> Great, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> When you wake up, your lips will feel and look much better.  </li>
            <li> When you wake up, your lips will feel and look much better.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;I love this product.</li>
            <li> As for Customer service? :-)\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have since become more educated on how this product is supposed to look, smell, and \\&quot;work,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> In my experience, this product does not absorb well and instead sort of just sits on top of my hair or skin.</li>
            <li> , I am more than satisfied</li>
            <li> It is not a miracle cure, but it works better and longer than the store bought products I have used for years.     </li>
            <li> It feels a lot better on skin and has a much better consistency.</li>
            <li> The product is okay not the better quality or grade of shea butters.</li>
            <li> Probably will not purchase this again, and will look more into refined shea butter.</li>
            <li> Hey, if life throws you shea, make some butter with it. :)</li>
            <li> decided to do my hair &#x27;mascara&#x27; again, but this time using a lot more shea butter than oils.</li>
            <li> Not too many things give me a rash, plus both my daughter and I are used to unrefined</li>
            <li> Oh yea, one more thing.  </li>
            <li> I am sure I will keep getting it here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> your favorite oil that you may already use on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I use shea butter for recipe for hair and skin moisturizer and have been pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> and I love how it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been applying this Shea butter from the top of my head to the soles of my feet..    </li>
            <li> I bought this product after noticing how many unnatural ingredients were in the body butter I was using.</li>
            <li> i love it.  </li>
            <li> Between the shea and the coconut it also has a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product and even happier to know that I am using a product that I actually made.  </li>
            <li> i think it may help prevent more but not get rid of them</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s actually better than the stuff from WF.</li>
            <li> I also love putting it on them, because then I get to have it on my hands.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s better than anything else.</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> My shea butter looked much better than the pictures provided.</li>
            <li> and I absolutly love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I do not like creams or moisturizers that are synthetic or chemical based, and besides the fact that they aren&#x27;t healthy -</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt better.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutly love it.  </li>
            <li> Oils are okay, but I love using richer things in cooler weather.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been slathering it on, too:)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I guess they did that for ease of use and to make sure that I didn&#x27;t get over 16 oz.</li>
            <li> The scent could be better but its not horrible.  </li>
            <li> I can then rub the chunk itself over my skin or just keep rolling the chunk in my hands to gets more of the shea butter on them...</li>
            <li> This is the real thing and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> This product smells a lot more like cocoa butter than shea.</li>
            <li> but the more I put it on the more</li>
            <li> PLEASED HAVE USED IT TO MAKE FACE AND BODY CREAM AND BUTTER.</li>
            <li> Okay, now to the product.</li>
            <li> OMG I love it.</li>
            <li> Alone as a hair treatment, I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on oily or sticky and it penetrates the skin without sitting on the top of your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update after more usage if my skin has improved or the stains is washable, or if my hair will benefit from this at another date.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels and others have complemented me on the look and feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Shea Butter in already included in many skin products.  </li>
            <li> some smell and feel better than others.</li>
            <li> Need I say more?  </li>
            <li> It is great for the skin, I use it every night as an anti-wrinkle cream on my face and after each shower for my whole body.</li>
            <li> I am thinking of throwing away the rest of my lotions, too many chemicals in them.  </li>
            <li> I will be back to buy some more!!!!</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter</li>
            <li> I hope this is an isolated incident but for almost $10 to ship &amp; handle, it should&#x27;ve been handled better than this.</li>
            <li> i had to put it on top of my heater to soften it up a bit.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent and relatively inexpensive moisturizer.</li>
            <li> When I run out I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Yup, it&#x27;s more time consuming than a pump bottle with lots of chemicals (read the label on almost any lotion)</li>
            <li> also great for toning skin on stomach, thighs, etc straight out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for my cuticles.  </li>
            <li> This Shea butter has a nice consistency and stays smooth.</li>
            <li> To get thereal value of this product I recommend order MORE than 1 @ a time to off set the shipping.  </li>
            <li> So I will look around when I need more supply.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin more youthful looking too.</li>
            <li> I really love this.</li>
            <li> Used this for a home-made pomade recipe, which turned out fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> the smell could be over powering for people that don&#x27;t like the smell I love it</li>
            <li> 2nd purchase, good quality and great for my skin.</li>
            <li> 100% pure shea butter taped on the top!!</li>
            <li> But after attending a Sickle Cell Convention and purchasing this Shea butter from an African Vendor,I FELL IN LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> so I am very excited to see how it works.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s superior to sophisticated chemical mixtures (cosmetic creams) at much higher price.  </li>
            <li> It is very good quality and the shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> and it had a nice smell, but it was nothing special, so</li>
            <li> First it is said that it is organic, a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I slathered this product on my hands for awhile (you don&#x27;t need much!) and rubbed it in for a good moisturizing, but when I washed my hands afterward</li>
            <li> Excellent product and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I was told it would be available to ship after 4/20, but thanks to  GREAT customer service, I received it on 4/18.  </li>
            <li> The product comes in a tub and appears bright yellow and a bit grainy (which was surprising to me).</li>
            <li> It works great by itself however, to make it easier to apply, I place it in a jar and heat it somewhat in hot water  to soften it, and then mix in aloe vera gel, coconut oil, jojoba oil and sweet almond oil.  </li>
            <li> but again shea butter is absolutely the best, and this price is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This the best product for dry skin!  </li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t go on very smooth unless you let it warm up in your hands first, then rub it on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I don&#x27;t think this a very good product and would caution against using it.</li>
            <li> When I run out of shea butter for my homemade hand, face &amp; body products, I will be ordering more from this fantastic seller.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> Since I have gradually made the switch to NATURAL body products my skin, nail and hair has been great.  </li>
            <li> So far the product feels great just being rubbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li> others have been claiming it is, but it moisturizes really well and feels good on.  </li>
            <li> it is a good product with one drawback, no matter how much you blend it,it still has a texture like sand and will not&lt;br /&gt;go</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right taped!!</li>
            <li> I love the results so much!!!  </li>
            <li> The seller shipped this super fast too, so that was great.</li>
            <li> very rich in texture and smooth</li>
            <li> During the day I put it on after a nice warm shower which helps melt on my skin easier, I actually found myself enjoying it like a mini message :).</li>
            <li> I was very happy to have this product and whip it with other oil.  </li>
            <li> Jergens original cherry &amp; almond along with some Coconut oil works better for me.</li>
            <li> My daughter has easily irritable skin and excema.</li>
            <li> It helps to heal skin abrasions very quickly as well.  </li>
            <li> Do you get rashes fairly easily?</li>
            <li> But the scent wears off VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> Great care was taken in the packaging, and I was surprised to see that the container was actually filled with 1 lb. 6</li>
            <li> It is the consistency of refrigerated butter and melts easily.</li>
            <li> The Shea arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Its smell is strong but it works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> And it does have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> Halaleveryday&#x27;s response to me was that the product has a strong nutty smell.  </li>
            <li> It does have a strong nutty smell which I don&#x27;t care for</li>
            <li> I liked the results very much.  </li>
            <li> SO ITS A COOL EXOTIC BUTTER TO HAVE .</li>
            <li> advice would be to first look at your own body.</li>
            <li> Yes, shea butter stains clothes, however, I recommend using it at night after a shower and wearing cotton night clothes that you can launder in warm or hot water.  </li>
            <li> very pleased with the natural smell of it, i used it alot to fill my chapsticks and beach tanning :)</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews on here, I ordered this item, used my mixer to soften it (hot soapy water will remove the residue from any tools used) and I absolutely LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> Fine, lets talk about the $9.74 I paid for</li>
            <li> im 8 months pregnant and still no stretch marks, but i am mostly pleased with my scar</li>
            <li> while it does liquify quickly once it comes into contact with body heat, I like it better smooth.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very \\&quot;dough-like\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t blend into the skin easily on its own.</li>
            <li> Works great on super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This shea butter came in a huge package.</li>
            <li> the jar is HUGE.</li>
            <li> But with the latest 2 orders I placed in Nov-Dec 2013, the shea butter was in bright Yellow color.</li>
            <li> plastic   containers filled with lumps of Shea.</li>
            <li> I since have found better success at [...]</li>
            <li> I really want to try it on my face and body, but I&#x27;m kind of scared that the smell of the Shea won&#x27;t leave my skin.</li>
            <li> conclusion is that the reviewer had only experienced refined and bleached shea butter.</li>
            <li> My skin is still adjusting to it in some areas, but overall I&#x27;m extremely happy.  </li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for my hands, especially for the eczema.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and very happy.</li>
            <li> Im not a expert when it comes to butters ; HOWEVER, It is a Big portion and happy with the butter.</li>
            <li> You have to break off a chunk and rub it between your hands to get it smooth for application.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, this stuff looks really funky.</li>
            <li> The butter will gradually heat up from the agitation and will become smooth.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy - hope this tip helps.</li>
            <li> Great deep conditioning and helps end breakage and split ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skin is silky smooth and you don&#x27;t have to spend all that time rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> smooth moisturized but not oily.</li>
            <li> It was very creamy and nice for the baby &amp;#34;butt&amp;#34; balm I made with it.  </li>
            <li> My legs feel so smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> YOU WILL APPRECIATE AND ENJOY THESE COLLECTIONS</li>
            <li> on smoothly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have always believed this was unadulterated shea butter,however,I have noticed  that it has some grainy substance in it and wondering if really it is as unadulterated as I had believed.</li>
            <li> Fantastic to put on hands and feet (with socks and gloves) before bed.  </li>
            <li> Not firm at all, which was a good thing for me.</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to food and products that contain not so good stuff in it</li>
            <li> Nice warm yellow color too.</li>
            <li> Good, fresh product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I think that it is a good idea to use 100% Organic West African Shea Butter in combination with a favorite oil of yours.</li>
            <li> It is very rich, yet readily absorbed by the skin and does not leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> A great buttery soft moisturizer, it&#x27;s oily at first.</li>
            <li> Shea butter and flax oil were major ingredients, so I ordered them here on amazon, then decided to add cocunut oil because I had heard it was good for skin.</li>
            <li> They also delivered super fast and it was packaged nicely</li>
            <li> SHEA BUTTER HAS RICH PROPERTIES AND CAN BE USE IN A NUMBER OF WAYS .</li>
            <li> I filled one 16 ounce container full and filled another one about 3/4 of the way full after whipping it.  </li>
            <li> when I opened the package i was really excited</li>
            <li> Make sure to melt it well (don&#x27;t boil) and mix with coconut oil for your hair, excellent hair product for african american hair or a mix.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product while on vacation in Charleston,South Carolina.</li>
            <li> Well, when I recieved this order of Shea Butter, it didn&#x27;t look anything like the rich creamy picture.  </li>
            <li> Ok so first off let me start out by saying that this is NOT shea butter.  </li>
            <li> I was willing to pay more for an organic product, but I don&#x27;t think this butter from Nature and Herbs is organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product is rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> This product is great for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> but it worked great for my dry legs.  </li>
            <li> Works great for dry skin...</li>
            <li> The mixture turned out gritty (probably because it froze during delivery), but it becomes smooth when I rub it in and feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It was ok, kind of gritty</li>
            <li> IT HAS RESTORED THE DRY DAMMAGED HAIR.THIS IS ALSO GREAT IN MY SKIN CARE PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> I had actually bought a container of this exact shea butter from amazon before and was extremely happy with it&#x27;s ability to straighten out my curly fine hair.</li>
            <li> good quality, smells well.&lt;br /&gt;Color is light yellow.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s great to use on your feet, then put some cozy socks, don&#x27;t  forget your hands :) I have even used it as a primer for some of my drier eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Item arrived mostly safe, however, the plastic tub it arrived in made it clear that the package had been dropped, bumped around, and had heavier things on top of it.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bleached white like the kind you buy in a jar or tube which is even better knowing it&#x27;s not chemically altered.</li>
            <li> the product is not AS gritty as i was expecting by the reviews i read myself on here before purchasing - that was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and as natural as you can get!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, absorbs quickly into the skin, and the mild odor fades quickly.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the PURE SHEA BUTTER...</li>
            <li> Great product for hair, but it has a strong odor, you will have to mix this with another butter, or just get the ivory shea, which has less of a smell.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and easy to mix into my natural hair products.</li>
            <li> of them are the color of bright yellow butter.</li>
            <li> Bright yellow</li>
            <li> also the color varies from bright yellow to ivory, which also looks unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is a BRIGHT YELLOW.  </li>
            <li> Since March, we&#x27;ve discovered that when she comes in contact with something that she shouldn&#x27;t have (food or in the environment) and starts to get a rash, we have her take a cool shower and then put a generous layer of Shea Butter over the rashy areas.  </li>
            <li> I should have listened to one of the reviewers when she mentioned that she thought she got a not so good batch because it was mustard yellow</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I thought I was going to have to put my own natural scents in there (lavendar or vanilla)</li>
            <li> True story.</li>
            <li> we decided to try it and it was a dream come true.</li>
            <li> The price at the art fair was $30 for 4oz and was the same identical thing as this!!</li>
            <li> Does not it say if should melt, &amp;iquest;how to apply it?, &amp;iquest;as Much as?, &amp;iquest;as Many as days?, &amp;iquest;applies during the day or at night?  </li>
            <li> At this point you may add a couple of drops of essential oils to make it smell good</li>
            <li> Still a good butter with some similar properties.</li>
            <li> It has more moisture than real Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I was very well pleased with the pureness of the product and the quickness of its delivery.  </li>
            <li> is good for daily moisturizing of the body, face and hair.  </li>
            <li> but it is not a bad price.  </li>
            <li> and it is still fresh, rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> When the package arrived I noticed it had a strong smell, but I think I was too excited about its arrival to really notice it.</li>
            <li> Pure unrefined shea butter is cream in color!!</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product, I thought it was fine, but unremarkable.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely be ordering more in a day or two.</li>
            <li> More often than not, her rash looks much better by the following morning and with continued use of the Shea Butter</li>
            <li> More often than not, her rash looks much better by the following morning and with continued use of the Shea Butter</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I did appreciate the quick shipment but the product was a bust.  </li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and was wrapped well.</li>
            <li> It has a mild smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month, and it has been super.  </li>
            <li> i bought this because i am pregnant</li>
            <li> (what pregnant woman wouldnt try anything?)</li>
            <li> I just love how it makes my face feel so soft and smooth looking.</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick and prompt, and the quantity you receive for the price you pay is a bargain.  </li>
            <li> 9 mts pregnant</li>
            <li> oh and mails quickly</li>
            <li> Received product quickly.</li>
            <li> I know many people us this product primarily on the skin; however, I use it on my young daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> A quick google search came up w/</li>
            <li> I was using this for lotion bars, and the shea aroma quickly overpowered the scents I tried to add.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for whole body - and is definitely a 24 hour moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Look how much really good skin cream that truely works on dry thirsty skin costs and the size of the product.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was packaged in large chunks which made it easy to transfer it to plastic bags.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dyed bright yellow which stains your skin and clothes, it&#x27;s greasy, has a strong odor and is more gritty than shea.</li>
            <li> I love the smell; very natural, sweet and</li>
            <li> With a little research, I found that the best shea butter is older shea butter, and shea butter gets yellower as it ages.</li>
            <li> I ordered the shea butter it was shipped promptly and arrived quick (could be because they are located about a good 15 mins from where I live) but none the less I am satisfied thoroughly with my order and will be purchasing products from them again!</li>
            <li> So when I received yellow shea butter, I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> It also takes a while to absorb and has a light but funny smell.</li>
            <li> The difference is that with getting Shea Butter directly you are getting the best of the other products.  </li>
            <li> verses buying the real pure thing...</li>
            <li> This product works really good on the really dry areas of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter is very moistening an easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that strong of an odor, really.</li>
            <li> We were a little concerned about the person who had objected to the bright color and strong smell, and who had a skin reaction to the product.</li>
            <li> the plus side, my hands are very soft and smooth now from cleaning the shea butter off of everything else!</li>
            <li> but didn&#x27;t really work for me!!</li>
            <li> (But I&#x27;m not an expert, this is my first time using it), however it is worth noting the state that it arrived in!</li>
            <li> They have a strong odor that we identified as very similar to cocoa butter, except cocoa butter smells more chocolately (we have some and compared).</li>
            <li> I am glad i found a place to get the pure shea butter at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I once paid $18 bucks for a 2ounce container of what I THOUGHT was real shea butter and was perplexed.</li>
            <li> I put my hair in two strand twist, and the next day I unraveled the twist and the outcome was AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Overall an amazing product.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li> It really has made a huge difference, and no chemicals to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have looked for years to find something that would be absorbed by my skin, not be greasy, yet would moisturize.</li>
            <li> I made a facial conditioning mix of about 70% shea butter (this product), 20% rose hipp oil, and 10% tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> (very) slowly absorbed.</li>
            <li> Please be kind enough to allow me to explain as follows:  </li>
            <li> which is nice enough</li>
            <li> Please be kind enough to help me.    </li>
            <li> Please be kind enough to help them out??</li>
            <li> I mixed the clumps of Shea butter with a blender, and it made a nice creamy texture.</li>
            <li> It does magic and made my skin smooth, especially my face.</li>
            <li> I keep meaning to move it to another container, like an old Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter jar or something, which I think would work better.</li>
            <li> I used it to create my own body butter using Jojoba Oil, Coconut Oil and Grapefruit Essential Oil.</li>
            <li> I love it so far.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I thought this information would be useful to those wondering about this.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I thought this information would be useful to those wondering about this.</li>
            <li> This was a purchase that was worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> its like the butter absorbed the oils.</li>
            <li> The product was fresh and came in a well-sealed container.</li>
            <li> even the most sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> then when it&#x27;s warm and melted I rub it on my face, especially around the eyes, my neck, stretchmarks on my belly</li>
            <li> It is good, though not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that amazon offers a pagakage deal to.</li>
            <li> As it;s supposedly all natural, I will continue to give this some more time to \\&quot;work.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> It is very well absorbed by the skin and leaves it smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> As much as I love virgin coconut oil and use it for everything, shea butter far surpasses it in the moisture department.</li>
            <li> ,IT&#x27;S THE BALM.SERIOUSLY ,IT&#x27;S FRESH SMELLS</li>
            <li> I bought it to use \\&quot;as is\\&quot; in its natural state like most of the customer reviews state.  </li>
            <li> But it was altogether worth the purchase .</li>
            <li> It has kind of a strange odor but its not a bad smell</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> It took a while to come in -- but it was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> tHIS PRODUCT USEFUL IN RELIEVING SKIN DRYNESS AROUND CUTICLES</li>
            <li> Love the soft skin in the morning.</li>
            <li> I used it for two days under my eyes and saw fine lines diminish more significantly than with months of use with other products.  </li>
            <li> CREOLE LOVE PRODUCTS ARE MADE WITH HIGH QUALITY INGREDIENTS TO INCLUDE, PURE UNREFINED SHEA BUTTER, PURE OILS - SWEET ALMOND, JOJOBA, OLIVE, ARGAN, AND COCONUT</li>
            <li> it does take a little while to soak in but it is pretty great after that.  </li>
            <li> This product is a bright yellowish color and is extremely creamy.</li>
            <li> It is good for scarring, soothing stretch marks and a host of other things.  </li>
            <li> But I just edited mine right now to add this....</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t feel right to her.  </li>
            <li> right from the nut.  </li>
            <li> After doing a lot of review about shea butter, I have come to conclusion that this is the right butter for me.</li>
            <li> O yes the price was right at the time I brough it.  </li>
            <li> When I got the Organic Shea butter, I wondered if the butter was all right.</li>
            <li> i use it for almost everything that i need moisturized, mix it with raw sugar and you make a great shower scrub that leaves your legs</li>
            <li> This product has really impressed me so much, not only has it helped with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> They live in Arizona and find the shea butter to be great in their very dry climate.   </li>
            <li> It is solid at room temperature, but melts on your skin very easily.  </li>
            <li> I love that moisturizes like no other lotion that I have tried except Ecco Bella, but without the liquid consistency.</li>
            <li> So far, the best stuff I&#x27;ve come across for anything skin related was the natural Shea butter they sell raw at the Del Mar Fair in San Diego County.</li>
            <li> Great and natural for dry skin.</li>
            <li> In addition to this I would recommend African Black Soap the best one is by DUDU Oson</li>
            <li> I occasionally suffer eczema and this mild moisturizer does not worsen the condition as most moisturizers do in my experience.</li>
            <li> But I just wasn&#x27;t ready to give up, plus I had to find out why I had such a reaction to a natural product that is said to be great for everyone...</li>
            <li> But even if this stuff isn&#x27;t pure, its super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It seems whenever I use any kind of lotion my skin just soaks it right up and still is dry.</li>
            <li> They are great for my sensitive and dry skin!</li>
            <li> But if you are looking for pure unrefined shea butter go to coastal scents or somewhere else, because this is not it!</li>
            <li> The butter was actually soft and easy to use out of the container.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you have a real all natural loofah for your shower to exfoliate...</li>
            <li> Are you sensitive to strong smells?</li>
            <li> Made a batch of lipstick with this, very very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> On my quest to find organic, raw shea butter on Amazon, I have not been too successful.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of other online retailers who will provide a superior quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I was also very surprised to find that I could use it on my face as a cream and that it was so potent that I only had to apply it three times a week to keep my hair smooth and controlled.</li>
            <li> Rub it in really well and your skin will absolutely glow!!  </li>
            <li> I store it in a dry cool dark place and it still is smelling good!  </li>
            <li> It has a bit of an fragrance, not much - but the moisture is amazing.</li>
            <li> Most recently I ordered 10Lbs of Shea on 2 day delivery on Dec.1, 2010.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also great for hair as well, well at least my hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that i wish I could get more for the $$</li>
            <li> He did give me the courtesy of calling first.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re smooth and soft now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re smooth and soft now.    </li>
            <li> First, this does not come on the nut as pictured.  </li>
            <li> The seller shipped this so fast my head was spinning!  </li>
            <li> First purchase came in a bag and was creamy.  </li>
            <li> Instead, I have turned it into a paste and used it, along with jojoba and castor oil, as hot oil hair treatment.</li>
            <li> The smell on the first day was a bit offensive to me</li>
            <li> I tried mixing it with my Kitchen Aid, and it came out pretty well.  </li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I will surely be buying more when my current supply runs low.</li>
            <li> Really pleased I took another chance purchasing online from Dade and will buy from this seller again, hopefully with similar results.</li>
            <li> REALLY!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall though, up until this most recent order, it has been amazing stuff and worked very well, despite the strange packaging.</li>
            <li> I have used several brands of shea butter in the past, but this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> The white seems lighter and not as potent.  </li>
            <li> In sunny, hot conditions, I use an SPF over it, as I think it would may cause sunburning.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty greasy.)</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> (*blush*), feet, arms, elbows, etc.  </li>
            <li> At first I didnt like the smell</li>
            <li> It is a bit grainy and not as pictured, but more like melted yellow Shea in a plastic jar.</li>
            <li> Seller, fast shipping, but does not respond to my emails!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the scent of the gold to be objectionalble at all, in fact I like it, and I&#x27;m the first one in any group to complain about the smell of something.</li>
            <li> Love it third time ordering</li>
            <li> When i first opened the container, the stench practically hit me in the face.</li>
            <li> greasy at first,</li>
            <li> and I love using it for everything, even as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> (but so much cheaper!)</li>
            <li> After using it for a while I was sure there was oil mixed with it, but now I can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have purchased 100% Shea butter</li>
            <li> I love African Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> it is a bit higher in price here at Amazon...</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an actor in a very physically demanding play, performing barefoot, and my feet love being nourished before and after each show.</li>
            <li> its authentic.. generic...</li>
            <li> AND THE PRICE IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE SAME PRODUCT YOU CAN PURCHASE FROM BOTIQUES IN THE FANCY BOTTLES.</li>
            <li> This was my first order of Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> It does have an odor, but I was aware it would.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also heard essential oils helped with the odor - but there are so many to choose from at the health food store</li>
            <li> If you live where the product might freeze during the delivery process, be sure to ask for special packing such as newspaper to insulate it.  </li>
            <li> After removing one small clump and letting it warm in my hand it is easily spreadable and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is clean and quite soft!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for winter because now I know that I have real, proven, effective solution for my dry</li>
            <li> If used properly, this is a mild, highly effective moisturizer for dry, sensitive or healthy skin.</li>
            <li> It melts easily in your hands and rubs on smooth and if you have dry skin it really penetrates and moisturizes the skin.</li>
            <li> but I guess you have to know how to MIX this in with other ingredients, because, on its own, you can&#x27;t just \\&quot;rub it into your skin\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It is a raw shea butter and has the nutty smell, and it does feel good on the skin aside the grainyness.  </li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer, and it&#x27;s really helped my skin go from dry and dull to comfortable and glowing along with a more natural skin-care regimen.  </li>
            <li> bright yellow and obviously scraped</li>
            <li> It may also be mixed with some oil, because it is oilier than the ASBI-certified product, and its color is bright yellow, not ivory.</li>
            <li> I have recently purchased unrefined shea butter, which is ivory (not white) in color, from another retailer that claims to be a fair trade organization.</li>
            <li> I also recently got some real shea butter straight from west Africa and noted that it was so smooth when being applied and did not have this grainy sandy stuff that this product has.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways,if you have no other option of getting real straight from the source shea butter, this would be a good 2nd!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very, very soft, and melts and absorbs VERY easily, however, it&#x27;s as yellow as a daisy.</li>
            <li> I am really happy and satisfied with this shea butter, it really works well in face and hair and even in my  lips, my husband love that for his feet, when you put a little in your face  or hair it looks  as oily, but don&#x27;t worry, few minutes later it is like your skin and hair drink that, so you can touch your hair and face without problem!!!</li>
            <li> Hands are super soft!</li>
            <li> and i saw alot of positive comments on organic shea butter .</li>
            <li> Keeping in mind that this is my first concoction, I think it turned out very well.</li>
            <li> First, it is real shea butter.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not my favorite scent in the world, I rather have it present as an indicator of the Shea butter being authentic and unprocessed.</li>
            <li> not use as I have too sensitive skin to try something that I do not know the full ingredients of.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I listened to the reviewers who gave this product high marks, and they were right.    </li>
            <li> I was pretty bummed because they had very few ingredients, were all natural, and made my skin look great.</li>
            <li> I heated it however, and melted it down to a nice consistancy.  </li>
            <li> Shea Institute has a great fact sheet all about what real shea butter is and the importance of testing, I learned that the government nor any other agency requires shea butter to be tested for quality and safety prior to selling.</li>
            <li> It glides and absorbs in my skin and hair easily, and moisturizes at the same time.</li>
            <li> I got the oil too, which turned out to be effective and less fussy.</li>
            <li> It was also relatively easy to mask the smoky scent with some lemon essential oil.</li>
            <li> My doctor, who recommended I use shea butter on the bottom of my dry cracked feet, said it had an odor that many people don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> This has a very yellow coloring and a overly strong scent.</li>
            <li> Unrefined coconut oil has a strong smell and a slightly different consistency.</li>
            <li> some say off white, some say strong smell</li>
            <li> However, it was accidentally thrown out, and I was buying from another company, so I bought pure unrefined shea butter from them as well.    </li>
            <li> We have been using shea butter but not in its pure form</li>
            <li> I just wanted Pure shea butter and BTW</li>
            <li> I do not plan on reordering from this seller, as I don&#x27;t believe this shea butter is pure.</li>
            <li> could I be allergic to 100% pure shea</li>
            <li> One can tell it is not 100% pure.</li>
            <li> I will certainly be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> You get a large amount of shea butter (16 oz.)</li>
            <li> the shea butter came in one large container like others have said it smelled nutty looks greasy upon application</li>
            <li> Pure Africa Shea Butter.\\</li>
            <li> I have never had/used pure Shea Butter before, but like this in a lotion recipe I made.  </li>
            <li> This product is pure and organic.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to people not only with a skin condition, but to people who have dry, flaky skin and need a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> so I guess I looked fine enough.  </li>
            <li> S&amp;H. The package from USPS was fine until I opened said pkg to find chunks of shea butter all over the inner containers.</li>
            <li> Product is fine but my personal preference is cacao butter.  </li>
            <li> My third pound came in a plastic tub and had a grittiness to it but was otherwise fine.</li>
            <li> What I have noticed was that funny oily smell on some clothes (mainly my robe) after washing.  </li>
            <li> If you DO your research, you will see that colors can vary from beige to off white and a mild yellow to a bright yellow.</li>
            <li> on Dec. 3, 2010 when my delivery DID NOT show up I tracked my package online and called UPS, Amazon and ALIVE &amp; AWARE!</li>
            <li> I now just warm the shea butter and blend in http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028POGA/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o05_s00_i01 , http://www.amazon.com/Natures-Way-Organic-Virgin-Coconut/dp/B003B3OOPA/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1357336912&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;coconut+oil , and a little bit of olive oil for shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I was a little turned off when I saw it was yellow, but it turned out to be great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer, you only need a little bit to cover any area.</li>
            <li> I will spend a little more money and get better quality next time.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very quickly, securely packaged, and I was amazed at the amount I received for such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Real Shea Butter does not smell like cocoa, it&#x27;s actually almost smell free.</li>
            <li> Instead I whipped this into a fluffy body butter incorporating in coconut and argan oils with amazing moisturizing results.</li>
            <li> I never thought to review this item seeing as it had such a huge amount of reviews covering just about everything from it&#x27;s strength to it&#x27;s restorative abilities on hair, but I decided after about a week to go ahead and review it.</li>
            <li> My hubby(who is very skeptical)and who also used to swear by vaseline.</li>
            <li> The label says to use as a lip balm - thanks for the tip</li>
            <li> However, within about 30 minutes after applying it, the itchiness is reduced to being bearable and the Shea Butter is absorbing into the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, within about 30 minutes after applying it, the itchiness is reduced to being bearable and the Shea Butter is absorbing into the skin.    </li>
            <li> The seller was very responsive.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the message.  </li>
            <li> and I have yet to see how much it weighs</li>
            <li> plus who cares how much it weighs....</li>
            <li> All be it an ounce is not so much but</li>
            <li> Did it smell smokey like real shea butter?</li>
            <li> I am very please with the product.  </li>
            <li> this is the real thing, if it was not for the ambiance and energy of Harlem I would continue getting my Shea butter here.</li>
            <li> This is the yellow shea butter thats sold in those oriental shops for a cheap pricing.</li>
            <li> Thanks...</li>
            <li> My daughter and I carefully read many reviews on this product as well as the three pound product.</li>
            <li> Also real shea butter does not feel greasy on the skin.</li>
            <li> though it was the real stuff.  </li>
            <li> What a surprise when I realized that I had yet to feel the real thing on my skin.   </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care to much for the smell</li>
            <li> The seller shiped fast.  </li>
            <li> Again it&#x27;s the real deal and this time I weighed it prior to using it and found it is exactly as stated, a full pound.</li>
            <li> when i did i put too much oil in it &amp; it became watery</li>
            <li> my whole life(i have keloid skin</li>
            <li> I guess I expected something more on the lines of a cocoa butter smell.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to try it yourself (refrigerate bewteen uses)!</li>
            <li> I hope it&#x27;s really unrefined shea butter as seller claims.</li>
            <li> I am not a connoisseur and so cannot comment on the purity of this product, but it seems like the real deal to me.</li>
            <li> I actually put it on my face and throat every night &amp; wake feeling fantastic.</li>
            <li> we have tried all cremes including organic ones and they didnt do much.</li>
            <li> his skin was moistured for 3 days straight.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of this Shea butter</li>
            <li> and it works wonderfully, even in the harshest cold.</li>
            <li> I thought it was highly unusual for me, as I am not allergic to anything.</li>
            <li> I have also learned that real unrefined and \\&quot;un-messed around</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have now ordered this twice for making homemade body moisturizers and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I am a diabetic and suffer from severe, intense, itching skin, and immediately felt relief in using this product.  </li>
            <li> Went to use it to make body cream and found whole flies in it.</li>
            <li> It really helps a lot.  </li>
            <li> I apply it on my face and on the whole body after bath.</li>
            <li> its the real deal.</li>
            <li> Con must apply to very warmed skin.</li>
            <li> This was a highly anticipated purchase for me!</li>
            <li> Is everyone really using the product \\&quot;as is\\&quot; without \\&quot;filtering\\&quot;?[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It is organic and very healing on your skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I think I will stop using it since I have no proof of its originality and beside it really does not work.</li>
            <li> If you want the real thing dont buy it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is greasy, but doesn&#x27;t really feel like it.  </li>
            <li> however I don&#x27;t really worry about this as I apply in shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but with a few extra things its a perfect, all natural, and affordable beauty product for my sensitive</li>
            <li> AS MUCH AS I HAVE.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very minuscule.</li>
            <li> it looks very suspicious to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nature and Herbs shipped very promptly, shipment was wrapped in a padded mailer and then a cardboard mailer.  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> and it is real...</li>
            <li> I do not have much experience with Shea butter.  </li>
            <li> Really like it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works very well as a stand alone product or incorporated in your bath and body products.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I do it that way to smooth it onto my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also cut open a couple big aloe leaves from my own plant and added them after smoothing in a food processor.</li>
            <li> I will look for something that is organic with shea butter but added natural ingredients to make it more fluid.</li>
            <li> Since it lasts so long (I am only about half-way through mine after nearly a year), the light plastic tends to get dented and the lid doesn&#x27;t always seem super secure.  </li>
            <li> but you will know what I mean if you read the FAQ&#x27;s on Fair Trade...     </li>
            <li> What I received was genuine Shea butter that appears to be both raw, pure and very fresh.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have found that whipping it makes it creamy and easier to use than in its natural form right out of the container.  </li>
            <li> There are so many other uses you can find on the web</li>
            <li> Other than that, I was totally satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Several people who are familiar with her pre-shea butter hair ask me what I&#x27;m putting on her hair.  </li>
            <li> Other shea butters I&#x27;ve had experience with are more of a cream color.  </li>
            <li> Because it is the West African Shea butter, it is a bit more solid and less emollient than that of East Africa, but I just warm it in my hands a bit before applying, and it is easier to use.  </li>
            <li> It turned out super SUPER rich and thick.</li>
            <li> i was trying to use it as a diaper cream, as a dry skin moistureizer and treating very mild eczema and scars</li>
            <li> I love this products it helps fade away dark areas and stretch marks its really works</li>
            <li> Past reviews have been correct as far as the smell and the feeling of play doh, hopefully the results will be as good as everyone elses.</li>
            <li> ALIVE &amp; AWARE</li>
            <li> I immediately called UPS, Amazon and ALIVE &amp; AWARE and</li>
            <li> I will definitely be mixing in some coconut or sweet almond oil to balance it out.</li>
            <li> natural products are gonna smell funny, if yu are lookin for results from a skin problem, deal with it.</li>
            <li> If I could do it again, I would spend the few extra bucks to get a real pound of unrefined shea butter from a verified fair trade company.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is pretty miraculous and all natural.  </li>
            <li> Take the soft consistency shea butter out of the hot water/pot on stove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok, I just got my raw Shea Butter today, and first off the container was dented and then duct taped like it had been thrown against the wall.</li>
            <li> I live in Sacramento, CA!</li>
            <li> Works great on dry winter skin and a pound will last a LONG time!</li>
            <li> Found this product to be the best moisturizer so far for cold winter days.</li>
            <li> I have found a better quality shea butter (the lighter colored shea butters are creamier, less grit) on another site for a comparable price</li>
            <li> During the winter months my skin become so dry and cracked you could light a match off of my hand.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is used in soo many skin products for stretch marks &amp; such, but I cant seem to understand why people buy the refined junk and products that simply only CONTAIN shea butter,</li>
            <li> My skin is getting older with all the sun, winter heat, and wear...</li>
            <li> I ordered from this particular vendor.</li>
            <li> I assumed this would of been the white shea butter and more solid.</li>
            <li> My hair is the texture that I believe most African American women have.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely try more shea butter in the future, but probably not from this seller.</li>
            <li> It is lovely, fluffy, and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shea butter back in March, and I still have enough for I&#x27;m sure well into December.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But the top was a deep yellow</li>
            <li> Just recently bought this after trying 100% pure organic shea butter at an art fair this past weekend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a miracle for my sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t even have to buy lotion anymore!</li>
            <li> With all of the products out there,   it is hard to tell what is really the \\&quot;Natural Shea Butter\\&quot; product but as far as I am concerned this  product is good.</li>
            <li> It became creamy and very useful healing my dry skin.</li>
            <li> The process is messy, but the shea butter cleans easily with HOT water.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> they also said that this product is the main raw ingredient to make my own body butter and that they do not advise using it directly on the skin.  </li>
            <li> This stuff, albeit it very different from other \\&quot;moisturizers\\&quot;, is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it became so widely adopted with this title, but having Kapangnan Butter, Golden Shea or even African Tallow as part of the title would be more appropriate.</li>
            <li> I had never tried pure Shea butter in it&#x27;s natural form before.</li>
            <li> I also like that this is a pure and natural product.</li>
            <li> Its a little more creamy than Real Shea butter and it works well for natural hair.</li>
            <li> So far my hands feel very good--after washing the mixing bowl</li>
            <li> Someone should really do their research before labeling an all natural product like this.</li>
            <li> I really like the ivory ones with my old orders.</li>
            <li> Kindly &amp; Urgently Request for the Removal of the Negative Feedback for Amazon Order ID#xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx    </li>
            <li> I thought it was okay, started to use it for a few weeks or so...</li>
            <li> True, it does have a long shelf of 18-24 months, but it eventually will turn rancid just like all oils and butters do.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, the Shea butter keeps my hair very moist and soft and I have natural African American hair.  </li>
            <li> this might last me a good 8 months if not more.</li>
            <li> This most recent order here in January of 2012 came in a 16 oz plastic clear \\&quot;tub\\&quot; with a real label on it of African Shea Butter 100% Natural.  </li>
            <li> with\\&quot; shea butter should be cream colored to golden yellow.</li>
            <li> I bought mine with the Shea Butter oil and use the two together, but I have also mixed it with my own essential oils for a personal scent.  </li>
            <li> First time I bought this, it was pretty good aside from the swirl of mixed colors which I know is not ideal but normal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and has a nice thick consistency.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After chipping some of this stuff off the block in the container it does seem to be shea butter, but it is very odd that there are so many variations received on this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little greasy at first on the body, but give it a few mins and your good.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona.  </li>
            <li> I tried many skin creams, but raw shea butter is a keeper.</li>
            <li> This has made such a difference in how my skin feels and ended up being better than I expected.</li>
            <li> The refined would not be as strong and would have less chance of causing a reaction.</li>
            <li> As I survive by the rate of the positive feedback, please be kind enough to remove the negative feedback for me now.</li>
            <li> I found out that REAL raw shea butter is much more expensive and it was my own ignorance of shea butter that lead me to believe I could buy it so cheap....</li>
            <li> It makes it very soft, shiny &amp;&amp; manageable when applied generously.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin Very soft throught the days i apply it.</li>
            <li> I weight each one on an ounce scale that I use to weight out soap ingredients and its very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> b/c after 2 kids, my sense of smell is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> And my sense of smell is VERY sensitive.  </li>
            <li> very soft and works well with my skin.</li>
            <li> but then it goes away and leaves very soft, hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> a natural product that works and does not cost an arm and a leg!</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of other moisturizers to keep my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty yellow in color and smells a bit rancid.</li>
            <li> Any natural diva would tell you that one of her staple products is shea butter!</li>
            <li> It also had a moderate scent unique to Shea, an almost smoky and nutty scent similar to rubbery oud.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a short while, however not on a consistent basis.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if anyone is aware of the term \\&quot;chicken-skin\\&quot;, referring to the bumps on the back of arms and thighs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering from someone else in the future and not on here as many 3rd party vendors are selling this African Butter as \\&quot;Shea Butter.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It stains and is pretty gritty.    </li>
            <li> BEFORE I WASH ,I LEAVE IT IN THE LAST 2/3RDS OF MY HAIR ,I GO OUT AND DO MY BUSINESS AND GET A HOT OIL CONDITIONER</li>
            <li> It also looks more yellow than other Shea butter</li>
            <li> and if you fake tan like myself it give it an extra yellow under tone that looks great!</li>
            <li> However, it is either not Grade A butter, or it is past the expiration date, or maybe it was reheated many times.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is really raw, works well but isn&#x27;t very clean.</li>
            <li> I even had some frost bite on my leg around my ankle and it turned black but thanks to the shea butter, the scars are healing up quickly</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of a strange scent to it, but I got used to it very quickly and while I was initially surprised by the skin reaction(pimples and such)</li>
            <li> I used to live in Ghana, West Africa years before moving to the U.S.A, and as such, i know how pure shea butter from Ghana feel, smell, and look like.</li>
            <li> im   hispanic honduran and black and natural and it works just fine.   </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and as a last resort was willing to go organic.</li>
            <li> I  was using Ultra Sheen, Pink Lotion, stuff called Super Grow, Doctor Miracle, Castor Oil and my hair</li>
            <li> , luckily my first order of the item came in a large (I&#x27;d say it could hold 32 oz) white \\&quot;tub\\&quot; with a basic \\&quot;self-print\\&quot; barcode label attached.  </li>
            <li> Either they are not organic (seeming to be inconsistent in color, packaging, and product), or they are processed/melted so that they are not raw</li>
            <li> This raw shea butter is as good as it gets when it comes to lotions, skin butters and other moisturizing products.</li>
            <li> Several whole and many small pieces of the insects.</li>
            <li> a few hours after I wrote it in light of new information I have come across.</li>
            <li> and as such am much less satisfied.</li>
            <li> After opening the sealed plastic package I noticed a strong smell, not a bad smell, but very different from the other 4x more expensive shea butters I have tried.</li>
            <li> The dudu-osun soap is fine, but I have doubts about the shea butter oil as it made me dried out and</li>
            <li> I have used shea butter for a longtime, and as such i know this definitely isn&#x27;t pure Ghanaian shea butter.</li>
            <li> Pure African Shea butter is one of the oldest forms of moisturizing around.  </li>
            <li> I seriously spent $12 on 2oz of pure shae butter at Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li> It is solid so if you want to mix in your favorite lotion dig a little bit out from the tub , and melt in the microwave.</li>
            <li> I think that as suggested by some, that you could put it all into a mix master with the paddle attachment to change it from being a hard consistency to something more whipped...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick that I will have to mix it with oils to be able to smooth it on to my skin a little easier.</li>
            <li> color is a noticeable bright canary/mustard yellow and it has a hard solid form.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to Shea butter because I&#x27;ve used the refined version before; I just didn&#x27;t know that the raw kind existed.</li>
            <li> If it cannot be shipped to AZ in the summertime, that should be made clear in the description or it should not allow you to ship it to AZ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is in chunks in a clear plastic tub.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great for after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put a few table spoons in bath water for a natural and cheap bath oil.</li>
            <li> The shea butter completely melted and leaked all over the rest of my order.  </li>
            <li> IT MAKES YOUR SKIN SOFT</li>
            <li> AND IT ALSO MAKES YOUR HAVE SOFT .</li>
            <li> your skin is really soft after its rubbed in.</li>
            <li> but this very inexpensive product rehydrates to the point where my neck, hands, feet look so much younger.</li>
            <li> so natural smelling</li>
            <li> I am frequently in the hospital for my Sickle Cell sometimes up to 2 weeks at a time and when I get out itz</li>
            <li> , how do I know its all natural???</li>
            <li> Gets rid of blemishes, and it helps skin return to it&#x27;s natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> I added some lavender essential oil at the end, which didn&#x27;t affect the scent much but didn&#x27;t hurt it either.  </li>
            <li> The Shea Butter came out light and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> If the scent truly bothers you, maybe you should check out Candida Overgrowth as being over sensitive to scents can be a symptom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my skin is returning to it&#x27;s natural tone.</li>
            <li> , they instead sent two food grade plastic containers filled with yellow stuff with no protective plastic sealing or anything anyone could open it and use it then close it again, send it back</li>
            <li> The only con i have about this product is i don&#x27;t belive this is   real shea butter.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft, and moisturized (without my hair feeling too greasy).</li>
            <li> Not messy or anything like that and makes my skin and hair feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> and 2) Did it look old or smell rancid?</li>
            <li> and since I am a prime member knew if this was not the real thing I could send this back</li>
            <li> I hope in my next formulation it smooths out, otherwise I can&#x27;t really use it except maybe in making soap.  </li>
            <li> So, technically, I cannot say if this is the real deal or not.</li>
            <li> I thought \\&quot;Wow,</li>
            <li> I had to use a lot of detergent to wash out the mixing bowl haha, but it finally did come off.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t have a reaction to putting the butter directly on our hands and faces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do you have sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> And I obsesessed with products that make my hair soft b/c</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already used it on my natural hair and WOW...</li>
            <li> It makes my hands so soft.</li>
            <li> It was crumbly &amp; Soft.</li>
            <li> Natural Shea</li>
            <li> my skin feels soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> i was told this works and this is 100% natural.  </li>
            <li> its natural stuff.</li>
            <li> also makes hair feel soft</li>
            <li> REAL shea butter is an IVORY to BEIGE color, this is a MUSTARD YELLOW color.</li>
            <li> Secondly, Shea butter has a MUCH stronger sent, isn&#x27;t waxy feeling.    </li>
            <li> This much makes enough for us to use for about 3 months.</li>
            <li> saying that it smelled and that it wasn&#x27;t to be used directly on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not waste your money or your time.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a natural skin moisterizer that wasn&#x27;t a runny oil.</li>
            <li> Note: if you do not have a stand mixer, you can use a hand mixer, but it takes a while to get it soft and creamy, so consider having a buddy to do relays on holding the hand mixer.</li>
            <li> It does work at getting my roughest areas soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m newly natural and have been trying to get my hands on some shea butter to use in my DIY hair moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Used this product with coconut oil, beeswax and lemongrass oil (with a drop of Vit. E oil) to make natural lotion bars.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my 1 year old as well after bath and as a diaper rush cream.</li>
            <li> this is natural shea butter.</li>
            <li> Babby soft feet by morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can be used for deep moisturizing or in smaller quantities as a light moisturizer such as under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Imagine my suprise when it arrived in some OLD plastic (probably used) container, with the words</li>
            <li> It heals chapped hands, lips and is a natural sun screen.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t bother my husbands sensitive nose</li>
            <li> Its the only thing Ive really found that can bring any moisture to my cuticles and keep them smoothed.</li>
            <li> Natural shea is supposed to be ivory in color.  </li>
            <li> It comes sealed in a heavy bag and was nine dollars and ninety five cents with free shipping for 16 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I have been using it as skin cream so far, no greasy feeling, the skin absorbs it well</li>
            <li> In the morning, my hair is still a lil damp but its shiny and so soft.</li>
            <li> After a week, my hair is still soft.</li>
            <li> The price was worth what I spent for the amount of product.</li>
            <li> this product will do a whole lot more for your skin than those lotions from victoria&#x27;s secret, bath and body works, nivea etc.</li>
            <li> This is just as good as expensive shea butter</li>
            <li> If anything it&#x27;s yellow color helped to tone down my red irritated skin to a more normal looking complexion!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only thing that works better is a move to Florida in the winter, much more expensive!</li>
            <li> It is very grainy [which may be due to reheatings], takes much longer to melt when rubbed between the palms, and longer to absorb into skin than the ASBI-certified product.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other lotions the shea is absorbed into the skin almost immediately and this is why I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this raw shea butter primarily for my hands and for under my eyes, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> This makes the second time I purchased this and this purchase is different from my first purchase.  </li>
            <li> I also applied this to my hair which is very chemically abused, and pretty dried.  </li>
            <li> This seems to be pretty common abroad epically in the US market where you will also find it labeled as Golden Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> OK big deal sure you have to pop a small portion of it (about half the size of a starburst for the whole body) into the microwave for 15 second and apply it to skin, but do you have any idea what is done to and added to the other lotions on the market.  </li>
            <li> Plus, one tub when opened seemed very shiny and moist on top, the other was dried out with large cracks in center.</li>
            <li> then i looked down and saw two containers filled with yellow stuff...</li>
            <li> I was highly dissapointed with my purschase, and i will definely be throwing it away, as i can&#x27;t imagine using African palm oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> A good skin conditioner and moisturizer but heavy consistency , use lightly dependent upon dryness of skin or those difficult areas such as elbows and feet.</li>
            <li> It is a little more yellow than some that I have purchased, but spreads and feels the same.  </li>
            <li> The backs of my hands are smoother with much less roughness due to keratosis spots, and I truly believe that already I am seeing fine lines under my eyes disappearing!  </li>
            <li> My order is deep yellow/gold, almost mustard in color and while I&#x27;m aware the color of unrefined shea butter ranges from ivory/beige to yellow, this one is either mixed with palm oil or something else or the stock is very old.</li>
            <li> This was a very mustard yellow (which shows in your homemade lotions and salves) and very moist, rough texture.</li>
            <li> she is almost back normal in 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li> she is almost back normal in 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my hands and within days my hands was back to normal.  </li>
            <li> Originally purchased Raw Shae Butter for use in homemade deodorant, but now use it as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> What the seller did was mixed the pure shea butter with African palm oil, hence the smell and yellowish color.</li>
            <li> I live in a very rural area and could not find shea butter around.  </li>
            <li> This product has rather faint tobacco smell and it is bright yellow, which, as I understand, suggests that something was added to it.</li>
            <li> I do use a lot after my shower but my legs get so dry in the winter under my jeans and this has really helped.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend it for people with dry skin it works wonders.</li>
            <li> It has worked very well on finger cuts and dry spots.  </li>
            <li> This is worth it even though the shipping is crazy (more than the product).</li>
            <li> I was concerned about some features that others complained of in their reviews (mostly the smell and the yellow color rubbing off on clothing, etc.).  </li>
            <li> My only problem occurred when my dog devoured the whole 8-oz tub of the gold shortly after I got it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered real shea butter and it is supposed to be white, not yellow.</li>
            <li> After a minute in the microwave and a couple of stirs with a fork, it went right down to liquid form.</li>
            <li> No other cream or lotion has worked so well on my skin like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like 100% pure and raw shea butter.  </li>
            <li> guess some might consider this a tedious process, but it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li> True it does have a slight smell, but only for a minute or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost positive that this shea butter is not pure, it&#x27;s grade</li>
            <li> Shea butter is never a bright yellow, the bright yellow butter is actually African butter which comes from an entirely different tree.</li>
            <li> Generally, shea butter has a smokey or roasted smell, this shea butter did not.</li>
            <li> and although it goes on smoother than cacao it doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate as well and also gives a cooling sensation to the skin, which I may love on a hot summer day but don&#x27;t appreciate on a cold winter night.</li>
            <li> Once it totally absorbs in the skin, it has a natural look that looks as though you haven&#x27;t applied anything to your skin.     </li>
            <li> Either way you just have to be careful not to apply too much.</li>
            <li> And, apparently, that adds a stronger smell and, I would suspect, the rash that some people say they get.</li>
            <li> And, apparently, that adds a stronger smell and, I would suspect, the rash that some people say they get.</li>
            <li> I am going back to the 4x more times expensive, certified and real Shea butter.</li>
            <li> My hair is extra soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Instead this was an ivory color flecked in places by a light yellowish green with the overall texture of playdough and that telltale sticky/tackiness when pinched between your fingers present.</li>
            <li> However, maybe because this is a natural product, I am unsure, but before opening container, I noticed one batch had greenish, blue tinge in some areas.</li>
            <li> ALL OF THIS INFORMATION COMES DIRECTLY FROM THE AMERICAN SHEA INSTITUTE...</li>
            <li> but after a short while looks like nothing is there and leaves skin feeling soft</li>
            <li> his skin was soft and his knees started to peel on the 3rd day.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to odors, I would reocmmend the white, but otherwise, save your money and get this one.  </li>
            <li> When you get your butter, empty the contents of the plastic container into your stand mixer (use paddle attachment) and mix at low speed at first to keep it from flying everywhere.</li>
            <li> First off please do not pay attention to the reviews stating that this is not real shea butter based on the fact that it is yellow.</li>
            <li> Since it isn&#x27;t purified at all, it does have a slight scent that is kind of oily, but it didn&#x27;t take long to get used to, and it goes away once it is on the skin for a little while.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry or rashy skin.</li>
            <li> When I am using it daily, I don&#x27;t even have problems with dry skin and eczema (though mine really isn&#x27;t severe).  </li>
            <li> It really works well on dry skin and the effects are lasting.  </li>
            <li> The chunky appearance of it in the raw was a bit of a shock, but it works really well out here in the high desert.</li>
            <li> I felt the difference right away, and once my hair had dried I could see the difference.</li>
            <li> Doing that kept them from getting dry, chapped and cracked when they normally would have been a mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it on our hair as a pre-conditioner, yet</li>
            <li> I use it with other lotions but the shea butter has really helped keep my hands smoother.</li>
            <li> Other places I found on line were charging 2x as much for 1/2 the amount.  </li>
            <li> The color is golden yellow with a little bit contamination (with something brown color).</li>
            <li> This product is bright yellow (not cream, YELLOW-much yellower than all other shea butters I have seen), somewhat hard and therefore difficult to work with at times because it does not melt easily in the hands.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used shea butter for my skin (mixed black and white) and my very frizzy, dry hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend putting a bit of water on your chapped lips so they are very slightly moist and then putting a generous layer of Shea Butter over that, right before bed.  </li>
            <li> I recommend putting a bit of water on your chapped lips so they are very slightly moist and then putting a generous layer of Shea Butter over that, right before bed.  </li>
            <li> I have bought it from african venders  in New York City,also in Seattle Washington,the color has always been  a gold color,or a very deep yellow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21, African American, natural hair, 4a hair, 4b hair, 4c hair, and some 3 a-b-or-c hair.</li>
            <li> I use shea butter for hair care (4a/4b African American natural hair) and as a skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> is that, nearly a year later and still using the butter daily, I still get those comments from women I might not have seen in awhile.</li>
            <li> , i put some on my hands and my face and it feels completely greasy, (i definitely wouldnt use it on my face during the day) and the smell is definitely lingering, so</li>
            <li> It will probably take several days to remove it completely from inner areas.</li>
            <li> The Butter WAS NOT Dry.  </li>
            <li> The container is huge, and it&#x27;s not one of those weird containers you get from some natural products dealers that looks big on the outside but really isn&#x27;t once you open it.</li>
            <li> Oh my word, there was black mold like stuff and grease all over the outside of the bag, and the bag itself was open...not exactly reassuring.</li>
            <li> I actually mix this in one big batch with extra virgin olive oil, castor oil, jojoba oil, natural honey, sugar, and organic aloe vera.</li>
            <li> At first your skin will be oily, but after about three minutes the skin becomes soft and there is no more oiliness than a regular moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought some shea butter at a craft fair and it was very expensive</li>
            <li> for people of color this raw shea butter is a must, it is straight from the earth as god intended it to be, all natural.</li>
            <li> With shipping this product ended up costing me $20 but a little goes a long way, and you get 2 pounds worth.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of shea butter, so I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to, but it smelled fresh - vaguely like cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li> Then I order it here and get 8x as much for 30% less.</li>
            <li> Usually, my skin has to be moist for me to feel that the product is absorbing, but this just melts into your skin making it baby soft.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE OF THE SUMMER HEAT.AT THE SAME TIME I STARTED TO USE A NATURAL SHAMPOO BAR FOR DRY HAIR ,</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am trying raw shea butter, and I am hooked.  </li>
            <li> i live in the dry winters of Montana and this is the only thing that has worked to keep my skin from itching all day long.  </li>
            <li> Also, any undesirable smell (I didn&#x27;t mind it in natural form at all) can be fixed with a little essential oil in the mixing process as another reviewer indicated OR just wait after applying because the smell disappears after a while.</li>
            <li> The shea butter is a natural, thick, super-moisturizing emoilent that really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> I wrote back saying that the information Halaleveryday gave me was certainly not listed in the product information on Amazon and that I would not have purchased it if I knew that I should not use it \\&quot;as is\\&quot; directly on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Go to your local health food store and check out the price of pure, raw shea butter</li>
            <li> Will it be 100% pure and raw?</li>
            <li> (100% Pure &amp; Raw)]]  </li>
            <li> B00B86PMC6 KAKOSI 100% Pure Organic Raw Virgin Shea Butter (16oz/1 Pound)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the only skin-care product I&#x27;ve ever purchased (other than natural goat&#x27;s milk soap)</li>
            <li> Only raw shea butter does the trick and fast.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usually brittle and dry without the right product.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long away, and it&#x27;s very lightweight</li>
            <li> other conclusion was that the reviewer has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The other ones I have received have been extremely \\&quot;moist\\&quot; and much darker yellow in color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have rec&#x27;d some from other sources that was soft and fully packed in container.  </li>
            <li> I am using this not only as a skin softner, but also as a hair conditioner because I use a flat iron and it works well.</li>
            <li> This product is real 100% shea butter.(Unlike other suppliers that blend butter w/ other moisturizers.)</li>
            <li> If you have never tried this product before buy small quantity and see if you like it before going large.</li>
            <li> I have no experience with Shea butter other than the highly purified version from L&#x27;Occitane, so I can&#x27;t compare this to other similar products.  </li>
            <li> do not listen to negative reviews first off</li>
            <li> I have purchased this Shea Butter at least 4 times from Amazon here, from this exact listing.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure I have the real deal.</li>
            <li> With this, I could only put it on at night because it would leave it greasy for so long.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t take long for your skin to get that glow back.</li>
            <li> It has a \\&quot;nutty\\&quot; smell, but there is some sort of chemically, not natural or agreeable smell mixed with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various moisturizers (high-end to low-end) over the years and never stuck with any of them for long.</li>
            <li> Overall, it goes a long way when using it.</li>
            <li> Just long enough for it to soften a bit.     </li>
            <li> It last long</li>
            <li> I sometimes slather it on pretty thick and then put socks on and go to bed like that.</li>
            <li> This stuff was clearly made for black skin</li>
            <li> i also use it as  a moisturizer for my hair which my hair is very coarse and dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my skin (to use along with the black soap I ordered), and for my naturally kinky, curly, coiled hair.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product to someone with really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I especially like it on my feet, cuz they get dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> I have been using Shea Butter for several years now and works wonders on my dry aging skin.</li>
            <li> I somewhat expected this, but the scent (and the lack of organic certification on the actual labeling, despite it saying it on the bar code sticker...) is what gave me final reason to try to return these two 16 ounce tubs.</li>
            <li> I have used it under my eyes and wow in just a few days there is a big difference.</li>
            <li> &amp; when i came back for it it was fluffy &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> Not only is this not \\&quot;100% Organic West African Shea Butter\\&quot;, it&#x27;s not really shea butter at all.</li>
            <li> PURE RAW shea butter (not shea mixed with olive, mineral, or other oils...</li>
            <li> and I bet you will toss out every other lotion you own at least I DID!!!     </li>
            <li> plastic tub was broken, but since i keep this in a cool dry place, the shea has stayed intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The yellow color remained in my bars so that colors did not remain the same (blue color turned into green because of the yellow soap).</li>
            <li> I have eczema, and other products I have used in the past have either left blemishes or were largely ineffective.  </li>
            <li> Harlem NY went into an African shop that sells 100% Shea Butter, and its NOT yellow but cream or half white, I used it on my face and</li>
            <li> I mixed it with other oils and essential oil.</li>
            <li> Al can be used same time with other products of beauty?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a transparent plastic glass of regular presentation, without labels.  </li>
            <li> I have used organic West African Shea Butter before from other vendors and it was never this yellow.</li>
            <li> a lot of retails (online and \\&quot;regular\\&quot; stores) sell low grades of shea butter OR shea mixed with other oils for unreal prices.  </li>
            <li> I will never ever use anything else on my skin, I&#x27;m beginning to experiment and add a lil vanilla essential oils to it and also add some sea salts or raw brown sugar to it for a 100% NATURAL BODY SCRUB</li>
            <li> I know that since this is a natural product, it takes a little time to \\&quot;work\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Doing that kept them from getting dry, chapped and cracked when they normally would have been a mess!    </li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t worked with real shea before, please note this stuff is as hard as a rock.  </li>
            <li> thus far, it is one solid almost milky white hard block.  </li>
            <li> Not good or consistent quality at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On top of that, the plastic package that I received it in was dirty.</li>
            <li> In both instances the shea butter lasted long without being too greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 and am living with Sickle Cell Anemia &amp; I used and was faithful to coconut butter for a long time...</li>
            <li> My shoulder length hair (stretched) shrinks up to my ears, but once I applied the Shea</li>
            <li> In part, they were told, \\&quot;The yellow color basically comes from added Crushed Shea nut shell that is being added to the Shea Butter.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> In part, they were told, \\&quot;The yellow color basically comes from added Crushed Shea nut shell that is being added to the Shea Butter.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> However the aroma doesn&#x27;t linger long.  </li>
            <li> As long as I can buy this from Amazon.con I plan on using this from now on.</li>
            <li> , I KNOW IT&#x27;S LONG</li>
            <li> We used this by itself for a bit, but it takes too long to liquify it for applying as a diaper cream, so I made it into a butt butter by adding lanolin, jojoba oil, vitamin E oil and beeswax.</li>
            <li> It took way too long to receive my order (over two weeks) with no communication from the merchant.</li>
            <li> Its a minor problem that I will resolve by adding sented oil extract.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The containers are not capable of containing 16oz of shea butter, they only contain 14.5.oz, so you guys owe me 4.4oz of shea butter.</li>
            <li> The white is harder and doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have it for a long time, and I use it for everything.</li>
            <li> At night I like to rub it on slowly as I get ready for bed</li>
            <li> My hair is natural \\&quot;black hair\\&quot; and ever since I&#x27;ve been using this mixture my hair has been growing like weeds!</li>
            <li> and I have decided to go natural and have been natural for the past year and a half.  </li>
            <li> I took a few small bits and rubbed it into my skin right out of the container.</li>
            <li> I ordered several things from this vendor--the dudu-osun african black soap, the shea butter oil 16 oz, and the shea butter.  </li>
            <li> The reason I dropped one star is the slight inconsistency in different batches of shea butter (purchased at different time) -</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Shea Butter comes from the Karite tree and can be a variety of colors ranging from a slight yellow to an off white.</li>
            <li> and you could actually see flecks of color variation as if it was pushed and mixed in a large bowl as opposed to being melted down to a uniform color or worse dyed yellow.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone with dry or rashy skin.shower and shea butter, it cuts the time down to less than a week.  </li>
            <li> I just think that on first application, Vaseline with SHea butter moisturizes the same, if not better than the raw shea butter....</li>
            <li> OR this butter is NOT true shea butter, but rather African butter from a different tree.  </li>
            <li> use those other brands that are composed of god knows what if you want to, I guarantee you will pay for it later.     </li>
            <li> but as the other reviews say, it does not last.</li>
            <li> Shea butter from other sources that I have used since do NOT have the same effect.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about ordering this West African Shea Butter fearing the quality/product would be different.</li>
            <li> I found what appears to be a strand of human hair and bits of other stuff in there (hull of the seed maybe?).  </li>
            <li> and you can tell it has been mixed with some other oil and poured into plastic tub.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what the long term effects of using this product beholds in store for me!</li>
            <li> I plan to be a long time user!</li>
            <li> Halaleveryday&#x27;s response was that I should not blame anyone other than myself because I should have researched the product prior to buying.  </li>
            <li> I have used it both by itself as well as with other oils such as organic argan oil and organic grapeseed oil.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m convinced that the bumps are due to dry skin which is exacerbated by friction or contact w/ daily clothing and/or bed linen.  </li>
            <li> The raw unrefined tan colour will take some getting use to, but so far I do like how it feels</li>
            <li> Every winter I get dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> The soles of my feet used to be dry and scratchy.  </li>
            <li> During the end of our dry Colorado winter, I snuck into my kid&#x27;s rooms, at night and smeared Shea Butter on their lips (without the water routine.)  </li>
            <li> The soles of my feet used to be dry and scratchy.  </li>
            <li> During the end of our dry Colorado winter, I snuck into my kid&#x27;s rooms, at night and smeared Shea Butter on their lips (without the water routine.)  </li>
            <li> I figured the Shea butter would moisturize my skin, and my dry dense hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face for dry skin and blemishes, after shaving, as a lip balm, and on my eczema that I have in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders on my really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I had a dry itch rash on my one hand and nothing was working.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that has dry skin and want to improve the quality of their sking.  </li>
            <li> The rubbing against the sheets causes friction and causes our skin to remain dry.  </li>
            <li> This helped with extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> It repaired a stubborn dry heel problem.</li>
            <li> My son is 16 months and he has severe dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin , but parts of my face are oily and using this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to aggravate it.</li>
            <li> I bought it because my skin gets so dry from this condition.  </li>
            <li> IF I BRUSH IT WHEN IT&#x27;S DRY</li>
            <li> but it keeps my skin from peeling in dry weather and keeps my hair manageable.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smell; doesn&#x27;t smell nutty or anywhere near cocoa butter</li>
            <li> This actually is the least natural looking batch of the bunch</li>
            <li> The gritty feeling was kind of annoying, but my skin did drink it up.  </li>
            <li> I have this happen with various other oils as well, so it&#x27;s not particular to this shea.  </li>
            <li> Apparently one of the containers was not closed tightly so it spilled everywhere making it messy</li>
            <li> Unrefined Shea Butter (which is not what I received) ranges from almost white to a pale yellow, and has a nutty, smoky scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading the other reviews, I decided to try beating the Shea Butter in my my Kitchen Aid Stand mixer, with the flat beater.  </li>
            <li> This product is shipped in a loosely sealed plastic baggie.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get a solid answer of what &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; raw shea butter is supposed to look and smell like, some say yellow</li>
            <li> I had to melt it down and strain it, whip it with essential oils and still smelt almost unbearable.</li>
            <li> It was full of air pockets due to the hard shea was not able to pack in.</li>
            <li> received a tub of part yellow, part white shea butter (approximately 90% yellow and 10% white).</li>
            <li> and it only takes a small amount as opposed to the white.</li>
            <li> It causes my hands to get really rough and dry.</li>
            <li> The product was totally different in texture than my previous purchases.</li>
            <li> This product is what I buy form various African vendors at conventions and small ethnic locations.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered shea butter from this seller before, and this batch is definitely NOT like my previous orders.</li>
            <li> But, my previous butter (from another seller) was creamy white, basically odor-less, and smooth-melting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have 4b hair, Your typical african coily hair.</li>
            <li> Oh, and for easier application, heat it up in the microwave just until melting point for about 30 seconds at a time and it becomes very clear and smoother to apply to delicate skin...</li>
            <li> True, raw Shea butter is ivory and very hard.</li>
            <li> My skin became very dry over the winter.</li>
            <li> Even after melting it completely and cooling quickly, its still grainy, but not as bad.  </li>
            <li> This shea butter relieved my dead dry skin instantly.  </li>
            <li> I will come back and tell you if I&#x27;ve noticed any other differences besides the fact that a little does go a long way, and it does stay on my skin longer, and</li>
            <li> On low heat I melted this shea butter and the coconut oil, and after it cooled a little added the flax and aloe.</li>
            <li> I even started getting little white heads on the tops of my arms and thighs.</li>
            <li> or you can add a little jojoba oil which will double your moisturizing power.  </li>
            <li> The photo above is a little misleading because it doesn&#x27;t show the butter, just what it comes from.</li>
            <li> will only both you if you&#x27;re worried about seeing little specks in it</li>
            <li> The smell was reminiscent of previous raw shea butters I have used, although its color was different.</li>
            <li> It smelled OK, but looked bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s because of this product contained natural vitamin A or due to other factors.     </li>
            <li> The fragrance is not pleasing, but, it&#x27;s rather minimal and the cream washes out in the laundry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent lots of time trying to get the smell off of my hands</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting impatient to whip up the next batch.  </li>
            <li> There really is no credibility, no certification,</li>
            <li> I will be coming back to make this a 5-star review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> After washing the AO conditioner and jojoba out, I applied Shea butter to wet hair</li>
            <li> The rough skin on feet is gone.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no grittiness</li>
            <li> The product arrived in big chunks, not smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li> It smooths knees, elbows, and rough heels, softens cuticles, and eases skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> The smell is minimal and I have had no problems with the color rubbing off on clothes.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that was interesting(in a creepy way)was that there was some white mixed with yellow in it.  </li>
            <li> just as I expected with the exception that I didn&#x27;t know it came in chunks rather than the smoother one.</li>
            <li> Have trouble finding this type of thing locally.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S HARDER TO WASH OUT</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 because it&#x27;s not real shea butter.</li>
            <li> I whipped it with my hand mixer, adding coconut oil and jojoba oil as well as a few drops of lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> As I expected.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected, no surprises.</li>
            <li> ordered it to make home made shaving cream, but have not accomplished that yet, I think it will work well though.</li>
            <li> Shipped and received as expected.</li>
            <li> While wet, i do a two strand twist and moisturize with the butter and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I stored it in an empty cetaphil container, spread the extras on my hands, and plan to try it out on my body over the next few days.</li>
            <li> and it makes my thick hair feel soft to the touch</li>
            <li> I had to go home and check amazon right away because i thought i clicked the wrong product to buy....</li>
            <li> Origionally I intended on using this for my daughter who has very dry skin but ended up using it on myself as well!</li>
            <li> Unrefined shea butter is softer than cocoa butter, ivory in color, the odor is very faint and it absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> This is very solid, not easy to put on skin.</li>
            <li> Second, being that this was my first experience with African butter, I would have to say that it wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not anything I&#x27;d use in my lotions due to the strong, unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to get whats shown in the picture which is a big raw piece of shea butter</li>
            <li> We reached that conclusion because of our extensive experience with products that are raw and organic, as well as refined.</li>
            <li> and I really like what it does for my skin especially on those dry cold winter days.</li>
            <li> I must say a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way, &amp; I&#x27;ve also used it for my husbands feet, as he has diabetes &amp; the butter</li>
            <li> A little shea butter goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way).</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> (I might not recommend this to someone with less dry skin, though--or someone who doesn&#x27;t sleep alone!</li>
            <li> Other reviews say it smells and stains</li>
            <li> The consistency, color, benefits of this product is the same, if not better, than what I am used to as a shea butter user.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for that reason I never sent it back because I was too lazy and didn&#x27;t feel like it.</li>
            <li> I did as other reviewers recommended and immediately emptied it into a stand mixer and whipped it.</li>
            <li> (Guys don&#x27;t go around complimenting each other on their skin.)</li>
            <li> It provides softness and sheen to your tresses with only a small amount.</li>
            <li> Untested shea butter undesirables include, products of rancidity, mold, yeast, bacteria, fungus, coliform bacteria, lead, mercury,and other undesirables.</li>
            <li> This has an extremely rancid odor.</li>
            <li> but you would need to add some other oil to it for that to happen.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only a small amount.</li>
            <li> I mix it with other products to use on my hair.</li>
            <li> I opened the plastic container, took a chunk out, placed it in the palm of one hand, and softened it by using the forefinger of my other hand.  </li>
            <li> This crystallization can cause lip balms, body butters and other formulations to turn gritty.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> But she never had any GI problems after that, like I would have expected, which I guess vouches for its purity!</li>
            <li> Its texture was sandy like other buyer described.</li>
            <li> Also, it is not certified by ASBI or any other organization, which leaves some doubts regarding authenticity.  </li>
            <li> so I had to find other containers for it.  </li>
            <li> This purchase came in a plastic container, which is fine, but is so terribly grainy and much softer.  </li>
            <li> Similar to an Aloe Vera Gel I bought on here, it appears to be a very humble company that claims to not use any chemical additives to the shea butter or any during processing to get it into a melted state to put in packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slight &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; scent, but that&#x27;s to be expected with unrefined shea.</li>
            <li> It comes in a large plastic container, and unlike the picture is in random clumps.</li>
            <li> She has very dry hair, and moisturizers for adults were too harsh and caused skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> I expected raw unprocessed.</li>
            <li> I do add a few drops of essential oil because I am not a fan of the raw shea smell.</li>
            <li> I discovered that the other company&#x27;s shea butter was creamier, less greasy, and didn&#x27;t contain any of the gritties that I get with this.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using the shea butter alone, the initial smell is a little \\&quot;smoky\\&quot; not sure what else to call it and</li>
            <li> When it finally started to melt (which it went from completely hard to oil)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t comfortable selling the products made with this, the smell was so bad.</li>
            <li> I heard that its smell is unpleasant, it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> This is the email i received after leaving the above negative feedback....      </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be asking for a refund as the shipping was not worth the return.     </li>
            <li> The former question was sort-of yes (inordinately smokey), and at least my batch was not rancid.     </li>
            <li> i bought this product a few times in the past from the same vendor.</li>
            <li> I use it on my feet and put on socks overnight - they are stained with dark spots in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I really cant tell the difference between \\&quot;real\\&quot; and fake butter</li>
            <li> This means you do not know what you have, it may be good, or it maybe your worst nightmare.</li>
            <li> not real Shea butter don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> this is not good shea butter, not pure, it has a extreme yellow color which  you can tell has been mixed with something, came in a plastic bag and very small.  </li>
            <li> very few people would waste the money if they saw what was actually sent .</li>
            <li> I will not mark the product down for that.     </li>
            <li> but it weighs my hair down</li>
            <li> So, if it is the other product that some of the reviews refer to, then I&#x27;m going to switch to this one!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, a little does go a loong way.</li>
            <li> have had dried cracked feet for year, and lotion never seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of using Raw Shae Butter, daily, the difference is AMAZING!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> By using the shower and shea butter, it cuts the time down to less than a week.  </li>
            <li> dudu osun black soap OMG your skin will glow, no</li>
            <li> This is the most disgusting, gross smelling product.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly nutty and fades after putting it on your skin.</li>
            <li> Never the less, my daughter doesn&#x27;t like putting Shea Butter on her rash.  </li>
            <li> Never the less, my daughter doesn&#x27;t like putting Shea Butter on her rash.  </li>
            <li> I had less shrinkage than ever.    </li>
            <li> I ordered this with the Black Soap.</li>
            <li> washing with the black soap w/aloe).</li>
            <li> got less than I paid for.  </li>
            <li> Everything I wrote about my previous order applies to this as well:  </li>
            <li> I am beginning to see slight improvement in the condition of my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was prompt, less than 1 week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i could care less.</li>
            <li> It is slightly nutty smelling, but it is from a nut</li>
            <li> am guessing that the product is going to weight less than 14oz when its out of the plastic tub.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I bought 2 pounds for less than $ 20.</li>
            <li> I also bought the Dudu Osun Black Soap that i can&#x27;t wait to try (it smells like pine trees)</li>
            <li> I always order mine from coastal scents and have never had an odd multi-color shea.</li>
            <li> Heat the butter and use about a teaspoon and a half of jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> It looks odd, but don&#x27;t let that detract</li>
            <li> I recieved 1 lb of raw shea butter in the mail---enough to last me at least two - three months.</li>
            <li> Another point of concern I have is that the price it is being sold for now is less than half of what I paid just a few months ago.    </li>
            <li> AND THE CURLS ARE SO TIGHT</li>
            <li> Even on extremely dry skin, put it on in the morning and it lasts throughout the day into late night.  </li>
            <li> Its smell were different and not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a less messy method for applying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed to find out that real Shea butter should be ivory color and not that butterish yellow color</li>
            <li> I also added some jojoba oil, borage oil, and a little bit of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, a little goes a</li>
            <li> I just hold a little bit in my hands until the body&#x27;s warmth softens it up.</li>
            <li> has a little scent to it</li>
            <li> you will need a tongue depressor or little plastic spatula to get it scooped out of the container if you don&#x27;t have nails.</li>
            <li> Then increase the speed a little at the time.  </li>
            <li> little about my process:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the lid TAPED down!</li>
            <li> very thick; this purchase will last a while!</li>
            <li> Wait a few minutes, if applying to feet in sandals, as it can cause feet to slide and slip a bit.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about a few of the reviews</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too heavy-</li>
            <li> Also, after a few applications (applying to my hair at night and washing it out in the morning) I havnt noticed my hair softer, shinier, or anything.    </li>
            <li> TO APPEAL TO YOUR EVERYDAY GUY.    </li>
            <li> Did I mention it protects from those harsh uv rays.</li>
            <li> I have ordered Shea butter a few times.</li>
            <li> I had the rash for a few months.  </li>
            <li> It comes in plain plastic containers, like take-out tubs--no fancy packaging.</li>
            <li> Shared the plain Shea butter and lotion bars with family, they were pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just the product in a plain plastic jar.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not strong whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Do not attempt to put it on inner areas such as inside the mouth, because in those areas it will congeal and become like glue and is very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought its smell like a burning pork skin, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my hands, feet, arms and even under my eyes for the past few days since receiving it.</li>
            <li> Would hate to think if there was a true problem</li>
            <li> Anytime when I receive the negative feedback, my business is down immediately.  </li>
            <li> Do not confuse raw shea butter with shea butter creams and mixes.</li>
            <li> jar of SB in itz raw form and was blown away.</li>
            <li> For now, I ordered organic raw cocoa chunks (1 pound packages) on here to use for my homemade moisturizers/lotions instead.</li>
            <li> &quot; then I would recommend you \\&quot;pass\\&quot; on any shea butter that is raw, organic, etc.</li>
            <li> When you buy the raw Shea butter, mix it with jojoba oil with a mixer.  </li>
            <li> In it&#x27;s raw state</li>
            <li> pieces of raw shea butter nuggets.  </li>
            <li> I have never used raw shea butter before, and would describe using this product like playing with play-doh.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s how raw sheabutter is supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> Raw Virgin Shea Butter (16oz/1 Pound)</li>
            <li> After receiving 2 consecutive &#x27;bad&#x27; orders, I now wonder if this vendor will keep shipping the same &#x27;yellow&#x27; bags.</li>
            <li> It is a thick butter like consistancy of course, with a someone odd odor.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that little droplets of water were beaded up on my skin, over the film of shea butter!</li>
            <li> Arrives raw so its a little hard but greatif you smush it a bit</li>
            <li> After using the 100% raw shea butter for only a week I am seeing improvements in my skin that dermotologists have not helped with their expensive prescriptions.</li>
            <li> I ended up rubbing a very little on the bottom of my feet and my feet were stained</li>
            <li> I have brought Shea butter for over 10 years, I usually get my she butter from 125th Street in Harlem.  </li>
            <li> Yet again, cheaper is NOT better.</li>
            <li> It literally takes seconds to take a small small amount into the palm of my hand, rub together, and its spreads like butter after that.</li>
            <li> but I personally find it difficult to use it this way except on the lips.</li>
            <li> I gave it a three because I am not sure about it&#x27;s purity.</li>
            <li> Alone it has a small one sticker with a direction of a website, in which neither instructions they are found neither any indication on the product.  </li>
            <li> I later discovered that the shea butter I had been using had been processed horribly wrong.</li>
            <li> although I had to get past the crumbled-cheese texture, I consoled myself that there weren&#x27;t any petroleum byproducts to emulsify it.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> the color is very yellow, the type what fake mustartd has.</li>
            <li> Plus the shipping was outrageous &amp; way more than my order.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great for skin, and if you use a small piece you can swipe it across your hair to tame fly-aways!</li>
            <li> also there is a small dirty sticker that is barely attached to the bag</li>
            <li> If you know where to purchase certified organic, raw shea butter, please share!</li>
            <li> It is also hard as a rock.    </li>
            <li> When i tried to scoop some out, it was so hard and brittle</li>
            <li> - the consistency is mushy and some of it is hard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;\\&quot;The Food Allergy Research and Resource Program reports the shea nuts do not belong in the list of commonly allergenic tree nuts.</li>
            <li> I placed it after reading ALL the reviews including the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are slowly improving I just mix it up with 100% virgin olive oil in a bottle and slather it on after massaging my skin with a scrubber in the bath or shower.</li>
            <li> but the eczema is slowly disappearing as well.    </li>
            <li> gave it four stars because the product is rather thick; like paste.  </li>
            <li> It was all broken up and crumbly and looked dried up.  </li>
            <li> This is very raw Shea butter with some particles in it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick creamy dreamy shea butter.</li>
            <li> so it helps if you have jar you can store it in as it is too thick for a squeeze bottle.</li>
            <li> I mean literally glow</li>
            <li> Unlike the white, this does have that odor, but I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> The shea butter I bought had a weird smell, and was discolored, the shea butter had dark blackish spots all over.</li>
            <li> The chunks have to be broken into small pieces, rolled and warmed in your hands before it can be applied to the skin.  </li>
            <li> you will get the urge to taste it seriously.</li>
            <li> I did some muscle testing to see what products I was having such a horrible reaction to and it was the African Shea Butter</li>
            <li> a side note, in the winter my face was so dry from the cold air and fireplace</li>
            <li> But even if it is, you definitely don&#x27;t want to rub this on your skin, for simple fact that it smells awful!</li>
            <li> I was buying a facecream from a botanical farm that was previously out of Maine, then the family moved to Utah, and unfortunately, soon afterward decided to no longer make their products.</li>
            <li> 4 ounces is 25% of a pound and at those prices its not fair</li>
            <li> It was grey, smelled very weird, had lots of particles and specks, and didn&#x27;t do mch for the moisture levels in my skin.</li>
            <li> doesnt mean they shoudve rated it poor.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in my order because it was hard chunks which did not completely fill the container.  </li>
            <li> The texture was very hard but it melted at body temperature.</li>
            <li> I had one before - very hard, ivory looking, but quicly melting -</li>
            <li> Compared to the weeks of itching, scratching, crying and in general being miserable, while getting this stuff out of her system, this is a miracle.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the weeks of itching, scratching, crying and in general being miserable, while getting this stuff out of her system, this is a miracle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick.  </li>
            <li> But no more, even my nail lady noticed!!</li>
            <li> Anyway, those pimples seemed to be decreased after</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with my purchase, I&#x27;ll never buy anything from this seller again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so annoyed that they would sell this product as 100% Shea Butter when they know that its not.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any itching or redness...</li>
            <li> It is thick and difficult to rub on skin</li>
            <li> 100% False advertisment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like artificial scents and if you want \\&quot;good\\&quot; lotion it costs a lot for a small amount.   </li>
            <li> this using of difficult form, since to apply it in the skin in complicated by being a quite hard substance.  </li>
            <li> Hard and a bit unpleasant nose.</li>
            <li> Not sure if any dye was added or it came from bad nuts.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box I sadly discovered 10-16oz.</li>
            <li> the amount you get for 5 bucks is insane, this 16 oz container you may only have to buy once</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, pimples appeared on my forehead and both cheeks, and the skin around my lips and nails scaled.</li>
            <li> but instead smells of some type of weird wood.</li>
            <li> , I know I spelled that wrong...</li>
            <li> for someone who doesn&#x27;t care what they rub on their skin then I would recommend this fake shea butter....</li>
            <li> I will never go back to that awful garbage again.</li>
            <li> Purity is questionable as it is with any \\&quot;All natural\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding shea butter in stores and decided to order this product.</li>
            <li> Also, you cannot go wrong with the amount you receive for the price.  </li>
            <li> Second order smelled HORRIBLE and had things floating in it.</li>
            <li> I am sad, I wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;packaging - dirty plastic bag that is poorly sealed.</li>
            <li> (I know I spelled it wrong)</li>
            <li> stuff is a mustard yellow, has a nasty smell to it and is gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this false advertising of shea butter.</li>
            <li> 8yo daughter suffers from both food (wheat, gluten, dairy, nightshades, grains, etc) and environmental sensitivities.  </li>
            <li> The chicken bumps noticeably reduced.  </li>
            <li> and I was itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> the smell is kinda nasty but small price to pay for the realy deal.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo afterwards takes care of the unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Stinks terribly like burnt rubber or something similar, the worst smell though</li>
            <li> But I arrive us in a glass in a cut, very hard block and packed of evil forms.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> Five months, of intensive use isn&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had a bad, itchy rash, you know that no amount of discipline can keep you from scratching something that itches that badly.  </li>
            <li> On really bad days, I even wore it to work.  </li>
            <li> I  had some ugly blemishes that faded away where the Shea Butter was applied.</li>
            <li> I had psoriasis on my ankles and feet- got to the point where it was painful to walk or stand-</li>
            <li> It made me feel sick.    </li>
            <li> but then I got horribly sick and nauseous.</li>
            <li> TRY THIS OUT, YU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> But I wanted to try it--and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just stick to my victoria secret lotions!!!</li>
            <li> It stinks it feels horrible on my skin.</li>
            <li> I hate to say this, but the picture doesn&#x27;t represent what was sent to me.</li>
            <li> But I seriously hate the smell</li>
            <li> Because of these sensitivities, she gets horrible, bumpy, itchy rashes that she scratches until she&#x27;s bloody.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is just disgusting to me!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why someone would sell a horrible batch.  </li>
            <li> I WILL NOT be buying from this vendor again after the horrible reaction I had.</li>
            <li> OMG this smells terrible, but I have never felt anything so moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I attempted to make lotion bars with this product and could not get passed the awful smell.</li>
            <li> It smells DISGUSTING!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is the worst product ever i got from amazon</li>
            <li> And the s/h were outrageous on the others.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I live in Arizona.  This product is shipped in a loosely sealed plastic baggie.  The shea butter completely melted and leaked all over the rest of my order.  If it cannot be shipped to AZ in the summertime, that should be made clear in the description or it should not allow you to ship it to AZ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, my hands are very soft and smooth now from cleaning the shea butter off of everything else!</li>
            <li> This product has really impressed me so much, not only has it helped with my dry skin.  I have used it on my hair to condition it, I have shaved with it, used it on my face on pimples, scars and brown spots and I have had great results for every use...My stretch marks are slowly improving I just mix it up with 100% virgin olive oil in a bottle and slather it on after massaging my skin with a scrubber in the bath or shower. There are so many other uses you can find on the web just look and see. I would recommend this seller and I already have to friends and family and they also love it too, and have purchased from this seller.</li>
            <li> Great and natural for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great Shea.  I was a little turned off when I saw it was yellow, but it turned out to be great.  I mix up a shea butter mix for my hair and skin.  This batch was so creamy.</li>
            <li> I have placed two (2) orders of this product and I was pleased with my bulk shipment at THAT time. Most recently I ordered 10Lbs of Shea on 2 day delivery on Dec.1, 2010. on Dec. 3, 2010 when my delivery DID NOT show up I tracked my package online and called UPS, Amazon and ALIVE &amp; AWARE! Online showed the package in San Fransisco,CA! I live in Sacramento, CA! Amazon told me that there was nothing they could do until my delivery came. ALIVE &amp; AWARE NEVER RETURNED my recorded message! I received   my 10Lbs. Shea of bulk Shea on MONDAY, Dec. 6, 2010 @ 7:00p.m. PST. When I opened the box I sadly discovered 10-16oz. plastic   containers filled with lumps of Shea. I immediately called UPS, Amazon and ALIVE &amp; AWARE and as of today Dec. 14, 2010 I have   not received any follow-up phone call or my refund. SO BUYERS BEWARE! I since have found better success at [...]</li>
            <li> I love this product! I mix it with coconut oil and olive oil and use it as a skin moisurizer and I put on my hair to seal in moisture. My hair is natural \\&quot;black hair\\&quot; and ever since I&#x27;ve been using this mixture my hair has been growing like weeds!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I use it in the summer for chapped hands. I use it with other lotions but the shea butter has really helped keep my hands smoother. The only thing that works better is a move to Florida in the winter, much more expensive!</li>
            <li> This is NOT shea butter. It is gritty like cornmeal , mustard yellow, and warming to the touch when rubbed together. This is Kpangnan (pronounced Panya)! You are advertising organic unrefined Shea! I want my Shea butter which is what I ordered!</li>
            <li> SHEA BUTTER HAS RICH PROPERTIES AND CAN BE USE IN A NUMBER OF WAYS . IT MAKES YOUR SKIN SOFT AND YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE TO APPLY NOTHING BUT ONE CODE OF IT TO MOISTURIZE YOUR SKIN . i ALSO MADE A HAIR BUTTER WITH IT AND IT ALSO MAKES YOUR HAVE SOFT . SO ITS A COOL EXOTIC BUTTER TO HAVE . IT ALSO PROMOTES HAIR GROWTH . I BROUGHT SOME FOR MY MOM , STEPFATHER AND MY SELF .</li>
            <li> Every winter I get dry itchy skin.  I have looked for years to find something that would be absorbed by my skin, not be greasy, yet would moisturize. This is that product. I will be ordering it again. Although not for a while, since you get quite a bit of shea butter with your order.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used shea butter for my skin (mixed black and white) and my very frizzy, dry hair. This shea butter was not as greasing as many products I have attempted to put on my face and it actually contained my frizzes well without clumping up in my hair. I made a facial conditioning mix of about 70% shea butter (this product), 20% rose hipp oil, and 10% tea tree oil. In both instances the shea butter lasted long without being too greasy. Keeping in mind that this is my first concoction, I think it turned out very well. From here on out I plan on mixing my own ingredients while avoiding the purchase of pricy lotions/hair products that are seemingly a much more temporary solution.</li>
            <li> I love this product &amp;&amp; I know most people use it for skin but it&#x27;s also great for hair as well, well at least my hair. It makes it very soft, shiny &amp;&amp; manageable when applied generously. The only thing is that i wish I could get more for the $$ but they do give you quite a lot. WILL be definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is used in soo many skin products for stretch marks &amp; such, but I cant seem to understand why people buy the refined junk and products that simply only CONTAIN shea butter, verses buying the real pure thing...</li>
            <li> No other cream or lotion has worked so well on my skin like this product. I noticed improved skin after only several uses.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not going to say it&#x27;s the miracle others have been claiming it is, but it moisturizes really well and feels good on.  it does take a little while to soak in but it is pretty great after that.  your skin is really soft after its rubbed in.</li>
            <li> This product is great for my dry skin.  I know where to shop when I need more.  Great sale, great product.</li>
            <li> If you want to soften and rejuvenate your skin, there&#x27;s nothing like this. My skin is getting older with all the sun, winter heat, and wear... but this very inexpensive product rehydrates to the point where my neck, hands, feet look so much younger. I&#x27;m fascinated. Do not confuse raw shea butter with shea butter creams and mixes. Only raw shea butter does the trick and fast. I love it.</li>
            <li> do not listen to negative reviews first off it does not at all stink, yes it has a very rich shea butter smell which is not along the lines of a \\&quot;sweet fragrance\\&quot; but still a very pleasant smell, so natural smelling you will get the urge to taste it seriously. people complain you have to heat it up, actually you don&#x27;t but to make it last longer yes it is best you heat it up so it is easier to spread. OK big deal sure you have to pop a small portion of it (about half the size of a starburst for the whole body) into the microwave for 15 second and apply it to skin, but do you have any idea what is done to and added to the other lotions on the market.  this product will do a whole lot more for your skin than those lotions from victoria&#x27;s secret, bath and body works, nivea etc. I have been using this product for six months and stand by its quality. for people of color this raw shea butter is a must, it is straight from the earth as god intended it to be, all natural. not only does it moisturize but it helps to preserve the overall health and beauty of your skin. my people this product is essential. use those other brands that are composed of god knows what if you want to, I guarantee you will pay for it later.     P.S. the amount you get for 5 bucks is insane, this 16 oz container you may only have to buy once every 6-9 months try it and I bet you will toss out every other lotion you own at least I DID!!!     SIDE NOTE- buy this with dudu osun black soap OMG your skin will glow, no I mean literally glow</li>
            <li> This shea butter came in a huge package. The color is golden yellow with a little bit contamination (with something brown color). I heard that its smell is unpleasant, it&#x27;s true. At first, I thought its smell like a burning pork skin, but it wasn&#x27;t too bad. I think most of people could tolerate this smell after times.    I applied this product on my hands and face (including under eye area), it was quite greasy and (very) slowly absorbed. After using this product for 2-3 days, my skin looked softer and the wrinkle looked shallower. Unfortunately, pimples appeared on my forehead and both cheeks, and the skin around my lips and nails scaled. I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s because of this product contained natural vitamin A or due to other factors.     Anyway, those pimples seemed to be decreased after continue using this product for 1-2 weeks. Now I used this product for 2-3 weeks. My skin looks smoother, softer, and the wrinkle under my eyes look almost disappeared</li>
            <li> My daughter has easily irritable skin and excema. I have some skin issues. We are both using this shea butter cream when skin gets inflamed and it works better than any creams we have bought otc and prescription. Honestly, we should be apply it two times a day for preventative care. Other reviews say it smells and stains and it&#x27;s not that bad. The fragrance is not pleasing, but, it&#x27;s rather minimal and the cream washes out in the laundry. (Vs. the alternative: Ive noticed petroleum based creams leave permanent yellow stains on articles and become brittle and unsightly).</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer, and it&#x27;s really helped my skin go from dry and dull to comfortable and glowing along with a more natural skin-care regimen.  However, it was accidentally thrown out, and I was buying from another company, so I bought pure unrefined shea butter from them as well.    I discovered that the other company&#x27;s shea butter was creamier, less greasy, and didn&#x27;t contain any of the gritties that I get with this.  It absorbs into my skin faster, leaving it softer quicker.  With this, I could only put it on at night because it would leave it greasy for so long.</li>
            <li> The title of this review says it all.  Everyone should use unrefined shea butter for everything!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the PURE SHEA BUTTER...I&#x27;m 33 and am living with Sickle Cell Anemia &amp; I used and was faithful to coconut butter for a long time...But after attending a Sickle Cell Convention and purchasing this Shea butter from an African Vendor,I FELL IN LOVE!!! My hubby(who is very skeptical)and who also used to swear by vaseline. He tried it for the 1st time fell in love...I once paid $18 bucks for a 2ounce container of what I THOUGHT was real shea butter and was perplexed. b/c I paid $5 bucks &amp; got a 20 oz. jar of SB in itz raw form and was blown away. I am frequently in the hospital for my Sickle Cell sometimes up to 2 weeks at a time and when I get out itz like I take a mud bath in the Shea butter, it rejuvenates my skin from head to toe and I just have to say \\&quot;Where have you been all of my life\\&quot;...I will never ever use anything else on my skin, I&#x27;m beginning to experiment and add a lil vanilla essential oils to it and also add some sea salts or raw brown sugar to it for a 100% NATURAL BODY SCRUB, how do I know its all natural??? Because , I made it myself!!! Oh, and for easier application, heat it up in the microwave just until melting point for about 30 seconds at a time and it becomes very clear and smoother to apply to delicate skin...I do it that way to smooth it onto my 4 year old daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin. GOOD LUCK</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and neck at night.  I have no zits.  It is a very good moisturizer at an even better price with no chemicals or added fragrance for your skin to absorb.</li>
            <li> I ordered the shea butter it was shipped promptly and arrived quick (could be because they are located about a good 15 mins from where I live) but none the less I am satisfied thoroughly with my order and will be purchasing products from them again!</li>
            <li> A great buttery soft moisturizer, it&#x27;s oily at first. It gives the skin a beautiful glow. Once it totally absorbs in the skin, it has a natural look that looks as though you haven&#x27;t applied anything to your skin.     The smell reminds me of white chocolate as soon as it is applied. I&#x27;m quite fond of the chocolately smell, and love it.    It also has a subtle mild smoky smell once the butter has been applied for a while. It does not stink. The smell is not the gross \\&quot;Burnt Toast\\&quot; smell, or burnt popcorn smell.     Gets rid of blemishes, and it helps skin return to it&#x27;s natural skin tone. I did my own test on Shea butter. I  had some ugly blemishes that faded away where the Shea Butter was applied. The skin area that didn&#x27;t get Shea Butter applied still has marks, now I&#x27;m using Shea Butter to get rid of those as well.    I even massage Shea Butter in my hair from time to time as a moisturizer, and along the hair line.     My product was in a creamy buttery form. Not firm at all, which was a good thing for me. The vendor called and asked me if they could send my African Shea Butter in plastic so that it wouldn&#x27;t spill out. I said it was okay, but I wanted the labels included. I think he misunderstood and didn&#x27;t include the labels. He did give me the courtesy of calling first. I wanted to see the company who sold the Shea Butter, and label information. Other than that, I was totally satisfied with the product. I will not mark the product down for that.     I listened to the reviewers who gave this product high marks, and they were right.    I wish I had known where to purchase 100% African Shea Butter from years ago. This is most difinitely one of Africa&#x27;s gifts. A product that works for me, I tell my relatives about it. I will most definitely be ordering more in a day or two. My sister is also placing an order.</li>
            <li> This is the most disgusting, gross smelling product.    I think it smells like a petroleum chemical of some kind. It made me feel sick.    I&#x27;ve spent lots of time trying to get the smell off of my hands and I can still notice it.    It is also hard as a rock.    The label says to use as a lip balm - thanks for the tip but I think I&#x27;ll pass.</li>
            <li> Just received my package today! Great, fast shipping. The product comes in a tub and appears bright yellow and a bit grainy (which was surprising to me). Anyway, I rubbed it into my arms and it appears to moisturize wonderfully. My only complaint is the smell; doesn&#x27;t smell nutty or anywhere near cocoa butter -as others have claimed- but instead smells of some type of weird wood. I will definitely be mixing in some coconut or sweet almond oil to balance it out.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0009JQFF6 100% Organic West African Shea Butter 16 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Shea Butter on March 11, 2010.  I ordered two 16 ounce containers, accidently.  I recieved them by the 17th.  Today, August 9th, we have several tablespoons of the frist container left.  Five months, of intensive use isn&#x27;t bad.  I&#x27;m thinking that we should be done with that in the next week or two and I&#x27;m getting impatient to whip up the next batch.  I gave away several heaping tablespoons to friends, also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the other reviews, I decided to try beating the Shea Butter in my my Kitchen Aid Stand mixer, with the flat beater.  I added some lavender essential oil at the end, which didn&#x27;t affect the scent much but didn&#x27;t hurt it either.  The Shea Butter came out light and fluffy.  I filled one 16 ounce container full and filled another one about 3/4 of the way full after whipping it.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with the scent.  It&#x27;s slightly nutty and fades after putting it on your skin. If the scent truly bothers you, maybe you should check out Candida Overgrowth as being over sensitive to scents can be a symptom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 8yo daughter suffers from both food (wheat, gluten, dairy, nightshades, grains, etc) and environmental sensitivities.  She seems to have the Scratch to Rash symptoms of Eczema when she comes in contact with items that bother her.  Because of these sensitivities, she gets horrible, bumpy, itchy rashes that she scratches until she&#x27;s bloody.  If you&#x27;ve ever had a bad, itchy rash, you know that no amount of discipline can keep you from scratching something that itches that badly.  Since March, we&#x27;ve discovered that when she comes in contact with something that she shouldn&#x27;t have (food or in the environment) and starts to get a rash, we have her take a cool shower and then put a generous layer of Shea Butter over the rashy areas.  This seems to reduce the itchiness and inflamation.  These rashes used to take about 3 weeks to recover from, start to finish.  By using the shower and shea butter, it cuts the time down to less than a week.  More often than not, her rash looks much better by the following morning and with continued use of the Shea Butter she is almost back normal in 2-3 days.  By the end of the week, she&#x27;s healed and you can&#x27;t tell she ever had a rash!  Compared to the weeks of itching, scratching, crying and in general being miserable, while getting this stuff out of her system, this is a miracle.  Never the less, my daughter doesn&#x27;t like putting Shea Butter on her rash.  Because it&#x27;s so itchy, and we have to touch the rash to put the Shea Butter on, it&#x27;s not comfortable to apply it, even though after beating it in the mixer, it&#x27;s light and fluffy.  She also says that it feels like she&#x27;s putting shortening on her skin and doesn&#x27;t like the way it feels.  However, within about 30 minutes after applying it, the itchiness is reduced to being bearable and the Shea Butter is absorbing into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use shea butter on my feet elbows and hands after I shower.  The soles of my feet used to be dry and scratchy.  They&#x27;re smooth and soft now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter also works great on chapped lips.  I recommend putting a bit of water on your chapped lips so they are very slightly moist and then putting a generous layer of Shea Butter over that, right before bed.  When you wake up, your lips will feel and look much better.  If you have cracked or severely chapped lips, you might need to do this more than one night but the results are amazing!  During the end of our dry Colorado winter, I snuck into my kid&#x27;s rooms, at night and smeared Shea Butter on their lips (without the water routine.)  Doing that kept them from getting dry, chapped and cracked when they normally would have been a mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it on our hair as a pre-conditioner, yet but I plan to do so with the next batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry or rashy skin.shower and shea butter, it cuts the time down to less than a week.

            <li> The seller was very responsive.  The butter was actually soft and easy to use out of the container.  Very good price.</li>
            <li> Item was well packaged and delivered promptly. I haven&#x27;t stopped talking about this to my friends and family, even strangers! I use it on my hair, skin and lips. I even had some frost bite on my leg around my ankle and it turned black but thanks to the shea butter, the scars are healing up quickly and my skin is returning to it&#x27;s natural tone. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I used this for soap making. It did not smell rancid or burnt - just a very strong nutty odor. I took a few small bits and rubbed it into my skin right out of the container. No worries. After a minute in the microwave and a couple of stirs with a fork, it went right down to liquid form. Heavenly stuff and oh so good in soap! Awesome price and very fast delivery. Ordered Thursday and received Monday.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing use it in all my homemade organic skin care. This is my 2nd order from this company</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on the evening of the 26th and received it in the mail today which is the 29th.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it on my skin and on my hair.  My best friend and I have decided to go natural and have been natural for the past year and a half.  We have been using shea butter but not in its pure form so I am very excited to see how it works.  I thought this product would come in the form of the picture but I am happy with the two 8 oz containers that I received which. Past reviews have been correct as far as the smell and the feeling of play doh, hopefully the results will be as good as everyone elses. That and the fact that the shipping was excellent is the reason why it gets five stars.  I will update later on the results of this product.</li>
            <li> when I opened the package i was really excited then i looked down and saw two containers filled with yellow stuff...I had to go home and check amazon right away because i thought i clicked the wrong product to buy....nope...seller just advertised different item.    I was expecting to get whats shown in the picture which is a big raw piece of shea butter, they instead sent two food grade plastic containers filled with yellow stuff with no protective plastic sealing or anything anyone could open it and use it then close it again, send it back then they send it to you...honestly will never buy this again Im affraid to use it on my body....I did some more research and found Fair Trade...I&#x27;ve never heard of them I found them on google but they have a nice site that explains EVERYTHING about shea butter and as another review said this seller sends you Kpangana butter, I know I spelled that wrong...but you will know what I mean if you read the FAQ&#x27;s on Fair Trade...     I found out that REAL raw shea butter is much more expensive and it was my own ignorance of shea butter that lead me to believe I could buy it so cheap....I doubt i will even use this butter that was sent on my feet even though i bought it for my face. I will probably just take the loss and throw it away....for someone who doesn&#x27;t care what they rub on their skin then I would recommend this fake shea butter.... I did contact the seller and they said this :  Dear Customer:    Thank you so much for the message.  Please be kind enough to allow me to explain as follows:  1.I purchased this item from an African importer. He delivered the big shells (like coconut) to me. Each shell (egg) contains about 50 pounds. I digged it out from the shell and put into the food-grade containers and then I weighed it by digital scale. This is the way I sell shea butter cream;  2. The quality of the shea butter is excellent and this is the fresh shipment.  I suggest that you try it. You&#x27;ll like it. If you don;t like it, pleaselet me know. I&#x27;ll make the refund to you.     I&#x27;m customer-oriented. My phone number is xxxxxxxxxx.    Have a nice day.      which is nice enough but of course they will recommend I try it.. Their selling it lol.....but why would i try something that I didn&#x27;t even buy?  anyway I replied back and asked why they don&#x27;t just put a picture of what they actually send you on ther website.....  We&#x27;ll see what they say....I already know the answer though...very few people would waste the money if they saw what was actually sent . hope this was helpful.    Heres an update    Another thing they keep telling me it&#x27;s weighed with digital scales.... and I have yet to see how much it weighs you can&#x27;t find that info anywhere! plus who cares how much it weighs....I just wanted Pure shea butter and BTW I ended up rubbing a very little on the bottom of my feet and my feet were stained yellow lol it&#x27;s gross I cant beleive i tried it.  -------------------------------------  This is the email i received after leaving the above negative feedback....

            <li> i purchased this for my wife so she can make her own hair products and she LOVED IT!!! it keeps her hair so moisturized. i have been sneaking and using her product on my hair too!!</li>
            <li> Good but didn&#x27;t really work for me!! I wanted it for my stretch marks but it didnt work but good quality!!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I love this product. I have been using shea butter for years. The consistency, color, benefits of this product is the same, if not better, than what I am used to as a shea butter user. So, if it is the other product that some of the reviews refer to, then I&#x27;m going to switch to this one! Plus, I think it would make an excellent gift item, so I do plan to buy more of them. As for Customer service? :-)\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I bought some shea butter at a craft fair and it was very expensive but it worked great for my dry legs.  I ran out so went shopping at Amazon.  This is a great price and it works great.  It is kinda lumpy but it breaks apart with some pressure from your thumb.  I do use a lot after my shower but my legs get so dry in the winter under my jeans and this has really helped.  I do recommend!</li>
            <li> I think this product is very nice. The product came in a rectangular   forrm in a plastic. Its smell is strong but it works like a charm.  I don&#x27;t belive this is 100% shea butter but i do know for shure  that this product works very nicely. I use this product on my skin and   it makes my skin Very soft throught the days i apply it. i also use it as  a moisturizer for my hair which my hair is very coarse and dry. im   hispanic honduran and black and natural and it works just fine.   The only con i have about this product is i don&#x27;t belive this is   real shea butter.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter was shipped in a timely manner     I bought this product for my skin (to use along with the black soap I ordered), and for my naturally kinky, curly, coiled hair. I figured the Shea butter would moisturize my skin, and my dry dense hair. When the package arrived I noticed it had a strong smell, but I think I was too excited about its arrival to really notice it. I mixed the clumps of Shea butter with a blender, and it made a nice creamy texture. I decided not to use it on my skin because of the smell, but I did use it on my hair. When I was applying it to my hair I felt the difference right away, and once my hair had dried I could see the difference. I put my hair in two strand twist, and the next day I unraveled the twist and the outcome was AMAZING. My hair was soft, and moisturized (without my hair feeling too greasy). I can honestly say that the smell went away before the morning, and my hair is still thriving. I really want to try it on my face and body, but I&#x27;m kind of scared that the smell of the Shea won&#x27;t leave my skin. I will try it on my face sooner or later, and if the results are the same as my hair......IT&#x27;S A KEEPER.    A little goes a long away, and it&#x27;s very lightweight but it weighs my hair down which is a plus. My shoulder length hair (stretched) shrinks up to my ears, but once I applied the Shea I had less shrinkage than ever.    Facts about myself  I&#x27;m 21, African American, natural hair, 4a hair, 4b hair, 4c hair, and some 3 a-b-or-c hair.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is just disgusting to me!! It stinks it feels horrible on my skin. I&#x27;ll just stick to my victoria secret lotions!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product! It arrived quickly and was packaged well. I ordered this with the Black Soap. Origionally I intended on using this for my daughter who has very dry skin but ended up using it on myself as well! After just 3/4 days of using both products together her skin is softer than it has ever been. There is a bit of a smell to it but as the other reviews say, it does not last. I have been using it as it came and rubbing it between my palms to soften it. But I am going to try blending it with oil. I have even been using it on my face at night instead of my moisturizer(after washing with the black soap w/aloe). My acne has improved dramatically! It is a bit too oily to use during the day. Either way you just have to be careful not to apply too much. What a life saver...a natural product that works and does not cost an arm and a leg!</li>
            <li> I should have listened to one of the reviewers when she mentioned that she thought she got a not so good batch because it was mustard yellow and it didn&#x27;t feel right to her.  I too got the yellowy mustard color. I thought it was okay, started to use it for a few weeks or so...but then I got horribly sick and nauseous. I did some muscle testing to see what products I was having such a horrible reaction to and it was the African Shea Butter I ordered from this particular vendor. I stopped using it and my nausea dissipated.  I threw the batch out. I won&#x27;t be asking for a refund as the shipping was not worth the return.     I am extremely sensitive to food and products that contain not so good stuff in it and I guess this didn&#x27;t--or somehow it was a rancid batch.  I did appreciate the quick shipment but the product was a bust.  I don&#x27;t understand why someone would sell a horrible batch.  I ordered several things from this vendor--the dudu-osun african black soap, the shea butter oil 16 oz, and the shea butter.  The dudu-osun soap is fine, but I have doubts about the shea butter oil as it made me dried out and the shea butter I bought from them is totally out for me.  I WILL NOT be buying from this vendor again after the horrible reaction I had.</li>
            <li> First, this does not come on the nut as pictured.  Mine arrived a plastic container in chunks and pieces.  This is great because I didn&#x27;t have to suffer through the chore of removal &amp; storage.  Yippie!  The seller shipped this so fast my head was spinning!  Excellent service and an excellent price for an excellent product!  Using truly organic products is a no brainer.  When I run out of shea butter for my homemade hand, face &amp; body products, I will be ordering more from this fantastic seller.&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, in the winter my face was so dry from the cold air and fireplace so at night I put 100% shea butter on my face before bed.  Yep I was shiny but my skin was so much better for it!  On really bad days, I even wore it to work.  No one said anything, so I guess I looked fine enough.  If anything it&#x27;s yellow color helped to tone down my red irritated skin to a more normal looking complexion!&lt;br /&gt;I just love this stuff!</li>
            <li> got less than I paid for.  I ordered 4 16 oz containers and non of them weighed 16 ounzes.  I weight each one on an ounce scale that I use to weight out soap ingredients and its very sensitive.  All be it an ounce is not so much but 4 ounces is 25% of a pound and at those prices its not fair</li>
            <li> The product came faster than I thought it would be, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.  Not messy or anything like that and makes my skin and hair feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> Works great for dry skin... I had the problem of skin dryness. I tried a lot of other moisturizers to keep my skin smooth and soft. Nothing works. Then i found this... It does magic and made my skin smooth, especially my face.</li>
            <li> I have no experience with Shea butter other than the highly purified version from L&#x27;Occitane, so I can&#x27;t compare this to other similar products.  I have been using it for nearly a year, though, and have noticed wonderful benefits to my skin.  I use it on my face for dry skin and blemishes, after shaving, as a lip balm, and on my eczema that I have in the winter months.  When I am using it daily, I don&#x27;t even have problems with dry skin and eczema (though mine really isn&#x27;t severe).  It helps to heal skin abrasions very quickly as well.  The product arrived very quickly, securely packaged, and I was amazed at the amount I received for such a reasonable price.  It looks just like the picture-- bright yellow and obviously scraped right from the nut.  Since it isn&#x27;t purified at all, it does have a slight scent that is kind of oily, but it didn&#x27;t take long to get used to, and it goes away once it is on the skin for a little while.  Because it is the West African Shea butter, it is a bit more solid and less emollient than that of East Africa, but I just warm it in my hands a bit before applying, and it is easier to use.  I do wish it came in a nicer container with a screw-top lid or something.  Since it lasts so long (I am only about half-way through mine after nearly a year), the light plastic tends to get dented and the lid doesn&#x27;t always seem super secure.  I keep meaning to move it to another container, like an old Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter jar or something, which I think would work better.</li>
            <li> this is not good shea butter, not pure, it has a extreme yellow color which  you can tell has been mixed with something, came in a plastic bag and very small.  i will continue to order my shea butter from [...] Unrefined shea butter will not be bright&lt;br /&gt;yellow unless a root dye extract has been added to it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have changed review because i have used on nephew this weekend he is a teenager and he has lost of big pimples on his back and face as well as something on his hand and i applied this shea butter and in 2 days the pimples reduced in size and looks to be drying out healing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost positive that this shea butter is not pure, it&#x27;s grade F. The shea butter I bought had a weird smell, and was discolored, the shea butter had dark blackish spots all over. Back to the smell, I can&#x27;t even begin to try and describe the smell, I just remember that it made me want to throw up. Generally, shea butter has a smokey or roasted smell, this shea butter did not. I stopped using it for that reason I never sent it back because I was too lazy and didn&#x27;t feel like it.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product, I thought it was fine, but unremarkable. At the time, my only concerns were: 1) Did it smell smokey like real shea butter? and 2) Did it look old or smell rancid? The former question was sort-of yes (inordinately smokey), and at least my batch was not rancid.     I have since become more educated on how this product is supposed to look, smell, and \\&quot;work,\\&quot; and as such am much less satisfied. The product is sold as 100% shea butter and I will not say that it isn&#x27;t, but it certainly is not the best quality that I have found (or the best price), so I certainly have my doubts. I use shea butter for hair care (4a/4b African American natural hair) and as a skin moisturizer. In my experience, this product does not absorb well and instead sort of just sits on top of my hair or skin. Shea butter from other sources that I have used since do NOT have the same effect. This product is bright yellow (not cream, YELLOW-much yellower than all other shea butters I have seen), somewhat hard and therefore difficult to work with at times because it does not melt easily in the hands. Overall, I don&#x27;t think this a very good product and would caution against using it. There are plenty of other online retailers who will provide a superior quality product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> What I received is not shea butter it&#x27;s actually Kpangnan Butter or African Butter, totally different than shea butter. It&#x27;s dyed bright yellow which stains your skin and clothes, it&#x27;s greasy, has a strong odor and is more gritty than shea. Unrefined shea butter is softer than cocoa butter, ivory in color, the odor is very faint and it absorbs easily. Not happy at all with my purchase, I&#x27;ll never buy anything from this seller again</li>
            <li> After doing a lot of review about shea butter, I have come to conclusion that this is the right butter for me. I am very please with the product.  It glides and absorbs in my skin and hair easily, and moisturizes at the same time. I will be ordering a larger tube since my family is helping themselves to mine. I shouted, \\&quot;Hey, I was given this for Mother&#x27;s Day!\\&quot; Oh well, that didn&#x27;t stop them. So, I decided to order a larger one. This butter is really, really good. I like it and my family does too.</li>
            <li> I have brought Shea butter for over 10 years, I usually get my she butter from 125th Street in Harlem.  I ran out and kept putting off my trip for essential oils and Shea butter and since I am a prime member knew if this was not the real thing I could send this back, I am more than satisfied this is the real thing, if it was not for the ambiance and energy of Harlem I would continue getting my Shea butter here.</li>
            <li> I used to live in Ghana, West Africa years before moving to the U.S.A, and as such, i know how pure shea butter from Ghana feel, smell, and look like.I have used shea butter for a longtime, and as such i know this definitely isn&#x27;t pure Ghanaian shea butter. What the seller did was mixed the pure shea butter with African palm oil, hence the smell and yellowish color. I was highly dissapointed with my purschase, and i will definely be throwing it away, as i can&#x27;t imagine using African palm oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews prior to purchasing this product. Should I buy white or gold shea butter? Will it be 100% pure and raw? Well, I finally ordered and I have to say, I like it.  I used it to create my own body butter using Jojoba Oil, Coconut Oil and Grapefruit Essential Oil. I also use it in my hair as a pre-poo. I absolutely love it! It is not a miracle cure, but it works better and longer than the store bought products I have used for years.     I don&#x27;t recommend using the shea butter alone, the initial smell is a little \\&quot;smoky\\&quot; not sure what else to call it and while it does liquify quickly once it comes into contact with body heat, I like it better smooth.    It shipped quickly and was wrapped well.</li>
            <li> This the best product for dry skin!  Make sure you have a real all natural loofah for your shower to exfoliate...a homemade sugar scrub does nicely.  You can use the shea butter by itself or if you think you need a boost use some cold-pressed olive oil or organic coconut oil mixed with the shea butter and go to town!!!  It won&#x27;t take long for your skin to get that glow back.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on customer reviews here. I do not plan on reordering from this seller, as I don&#x27;t believe this shea butter is pure. My order is deep yellow/gold, almost mustard in color and while I&#x27;m aware the color of unrefined shea butter ranges from ivory/beige to yellow, this one is either mixed with palm oil or something else or the stock is very old. At the bottom of the box, I found traces of white/beige colored butter.    Another point of concern I have is that the price it is being sold for now is less than half of what I paid just a few months ago.    I have recently purchased unrefined shea butter, which is ivory (not white) in color, from another retailer that claims to be a fair trade organization. I love it so far. It feels a lot better on skin and has a much better consistency.</li>
            <li> Can anyone tell me how this is supposed to smell? It&#x27;s pretty yellow in color and smells a bit rancid.</li>
            <li> Stinks terribly like burnt rubber or something similar, the worst smell though</li>
            <li> This is the yellow shea butter thats sold in those oriental shops for a cheap pricing. The product is okay not the better quality or grade of shea butters. I assumed this would of been the white shea butter and more solid. This has a very yellow coloring and a overly strong scent.</li>
            <li> This makes the second time I purchased this and this purchase is different from my first purchase.  First purchase came in a bag and was creamy.  This purchase came in a plastic container, which is fine, but is so terribly grainy and much softer.  Even after melting it completely and cooling quickly, its still grainy, but not as bad.  I hope in my next formulation it smooths out, otherwise I can&#x27;t really use it except maybe in making soap.  It is a raw shea butter and has the nutty smell, and it does feel good on the skin aside the grainyness.  It just needs to be tempered with to bring it to smoothness.  Also, the listing says organic, but no where on the packaging does it say it&#x27;s organic.  It also says there is no expiration date for shea butter.  True, it does have a long shelf of 18-24 months, but it eventually will turn rancid just like all oils and butters do.  Probably will not purchase this again, and will look more into refined shea butter.</li>
            <li> Alright, I admit I have never seen, felt or smelled 100 % shea butter in my life! So, technically, I cannot say if this is the real deal or not. But even if it is, you definitely don&#x27;t want to rub this on your skin, for simple fact that it smells awful! Instead, I have turned it into a paste and used it, along with jojoba and castor oil, as hot oil hair treatment. The shampoo afterwards takes care of the unpleasant scent. I have to say, it works wonders! Hey, if life throws you shea, make some butter with it. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to do my hair &#x27;mascara&#x27; again, but this time using a lot more shea butter than oils. Let me tell you, my head started itching a minute after applying it, and even after shampooing and rinsing my hair twice, my head still itched and my scalp was redish!! I thought \\&quot;Wow, could I be allergic to 100% pure shea butter?!\\&quot; So I did a google search and found this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;\\&quot;The Food Allergy Research and Resource Program reports the shea nuts do not belong in the list of commonly allergenic tree nuts. There are no reports of allergic reactions to shea nuts or its products.\\&quot;\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll let you take your own conclusions about the purity of this shea butter, or even if it&#x27;s shea butter at all. As for me, I threw it all out and definitely won&#x27;t be buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> On my quest to find organic, raw shea butter on Amazon, I have not been too successful. Either they are not organic (seeming to be inconsistent in color, packaging, and product), or they are processed/melted so that they are not raw anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one does not have an organic certification on the packaging. Similar to an Aloe Vera Gel I bought on here, it appears to be a very humble company that claims to not use any chemical additives to the shea butter or any during processing to get it into a melted state to put in packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a noticeable bright canary/mustard yellow and it has a hard solid form. I somewhat expected this, but the scent (and the lack of organic certification on the actual labeling, despite it saying it on the bar code sticker...) is what gave me final reason to try to return these two 16 ounce tubs. It has a \\&quot;nutty\\&quot; smell, but there is some sort of chemically, not natural or agreeable smell mixed with it. Like paint? T-shirt paint or something? I&#x27;m not convinced this is unaltered at all. Plus, one tub when opened seemed very shiny and moist on top, the other was dried out with large cracks in center. Not good or consistent quality at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ezruli.com is the company&#x27;s website. There really is no credibility, no certification, so it&#x27;s basically taking their word for it. Suffice it to say, I don&#x27;t want to chance it. For now, I ordered organic raw cocoa chunks (1 pound packages) on here to use for my homemade moisturizers/lotions instead. Plus, it can double as a dessert ingredient. If you know where to purchase certified organic, raw shea butter, please share! Thanks...</li>
            <li> I just received my shea butter today. It was double-wrapped in plastic and very yellow. The smell was reminiscent of previous raw shea butters I have used, although its color was different. The texture was very hard but it melted at body temperature. I did as other reviewers recommended and immediately emptied it into a stand mixer and whipped it. I also added some jojoba oil, borage oil, and a little bit of tea tree oil. It turned out super SUPER rich and thick. I had to use a lot of detergent to wash out the mixing bowl haha, but it finally did come off. As other reviewers have mentioned, a little does go a loong way. I stored it in an empty cetaphil container, spread the extras on my hands, and plan to try it out on my body over the next few days. So far my hands feel very good--after washing the mixing bowl I noticed that little droplets of water were beaded up on my skin, over the film of shea butter! (my hands were super-protected from the elements lol)    Only 4 stars because I don&#x27;t know how it will work for my skin, but I have a feeling I will be coming back to make this a 5-star review in a few weeks. Overall this seems to be a good value and a great buy!    update 3/20/2011: shea butter is still working great. very thick; this purchase will last a while!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for rubs and lip balms, and the price is great.</li>
            <li> I use it in all of my homemade lotions. It&#x27;s a bit grainy but still works nicely for my purposes.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I carefully read many reviews on this product as well as the three pound product. We were a little concerned about the person who had objected to the bright color and strong smell, and who had a skin reaction to the product. We decided to buy it anyway. We bought both the three pound and the one pound (from two different companies, it looked like to us) so we could compare them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of them are the color of bright yellow butter. They have a strong odor that we identified as very similar to cocoa butter, except cocoa butter smells more chocolately (we have some and compared). We didn&#x27;t have a reaction to putting the butter directly on our hands and faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our conclusion is that the reviewer had only experienced refined and bleached shea butter. We reached that conclusion because of our extensive experience with products that are raw and organic, as well as refined. For example, refined coconut oil has no odor. Unrefined coconut oil has a strong smell and a slightly different consistency. [Edit: I have since discovered that there is, indeed, a white shea butter. See my edit below.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our other conclusion was that the reviewer has sensitive skin. Not too many things give me a rash, plus both my daughter and I are used to unrefined products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice would be to first look at your own body. Do you have sensitive skin? Do you get rashes fairly easily? Are you sensitive to strong smells? If the answers to these are \\&quot;yes\\&quot; then I would recommend you \\&quot;pass\\&quot; on any shea butter that is raw, organic, etc. The refined would not be as strong and would have less chance of causing a reaction. Also, I am supposing that some people could be allergic to shea butter and that may have been the reviewers problem with it, so if you have allergies, you might want to think twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am editing this review a few hours after I wrote it in light of new information I have come across. I have been exploring Amazon and came across white shea butter for sale. I didn&#x27;t want to quote all of someone else&#x27;s review, so I&#x27;ll just say this. They wanted to know the difference between white shea butter and yellow shea butter, so they asked the company. In part, they were told, \\&quot;The yellow color basically comes from added Crushed Shea nut shell that is being added to the Shea Butter.\\&quot; And, apparently, that adds a stronger smell and, I would suspect, the rash that some people say they get. Anyway, I thought this information would be useful to those wondering about this. Those of you who have had problems with the yellow shea butter might want to try the white.oss white shea butter for sale.

            <li> After opening the sealed plastic package I noticed a strong smell, not a bad smell, but very different from the other 4x more expensive shea butters I have tried. It&#x27;s smells a lot like cocoa butter and it&#x27;s greasier too. I kind of found this suspicious and went online to read about how shea butter can smell/feel and look like. Then I learned about the Kpangan butter. The Kpangan butter smells like cocoa butter, is oily on the skin and is yellow. All of this matched the product I received at home as \\&quot;Shea Butter\\&quot;. Real Shea Butter does not smell like cocoa, it&#x27;s actually almost smell free. Also real shea butter does not feel greasy on the skin. Shea butter can have a yellowish tone but what I got is mustard yellow. Either the seller doesn&#x27;t know what he/she sells or...    Yet again, cheaper is NOT better. I am going back to the 4x more times expensive, certified and real Shea butter.</li>
            <li> It has a mild smell. One can tell it is not 100% pure. It is good for the price offered though.</li>
            <li> I just recently started using Shea butter after doing a lot of research.  And I LOVE IT!!!  The smell on the first day was a bit offensive to me b/c after 2 kids, my sense of smell is very sensitive.  But I wanted to stick with it b/c of all the benefits I read about and after day 2, I don&#x27;t even notice the smell anymore.  And my sense of smell is VERY sensitive.  On top of that, the Shea butter keeps my hair very moist and soft and I have natural African American hair.  My hair is the texture that I believe most African American women have.  And I obsesessed with products that make my hair soft b/c it&#x27;s usually brittle and dry without the right product.  I put Shea butter in my hair after I used Aubrey Organics Shampoo and deep conditioned with Aubrey Organics condition and jojoba oil.  After washing the AO conditioner and jojoba out, I applied Shea butter to wet hair then I blow-dried it.  I love the results so much!!!  You have to buy it now.  Oh yea, one more thing.  When you buy the raw Shea butter, mix it with jojoba oil with a mixer.  Then put it back in its container that it came in and it should be good to go.  I also use Shea butter as my body moisturizer b/c it&#x27;s that good.  Like others have said, a little goes a</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to Shea butter because I&#x27;ve used the refined version before; I just didn&#x27;t know that the raw kind existed. The raw unrefined tan colour will take some getting use to, but so far I do like how it feels and it only takes a small amount as opposed to the white. I just received mines August 26th, 2009. I placed it after reading ALL the reviews including the negative reviews. I will come back and tell you if I&#x27;ve noticed any other differences besides the fact that a little does go a long way, and it does stay on my skin longer, and I like using it in my hair on the ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my shea butter! It is very good quality and the shipping was super fast. I&#x27;ve already used it on my natural hair and WOW...it works sooo well. My hair is extra soft and moisturized. The smell is not strong whatsoever. After reading the reviews I thought I was going to have to put my own natural scents in there (lavendar or vanilla) but now that I have it and actually smelled it myself, I don&#x27;t need to add scent to it at all. It&#x27;s great. I will definitely make another purchase from this supplier again. Even though it is a lot, I should have ordered two!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month, and it has been super.  I have eczema, and other products I have used in the past have either left blemishes or were largely ineffective.  This has been great!  My skin is still adjusting to it in some areas, but overall I&#x27;m extremely happy.  I will certainly be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I had never tried pure Shea butter in it&#x27;s natural form before. I have used it under my eyes and wow in just a few days there is a big difference. The products sold on the market for under eye area do not compare. It makes my hands so soft. The rough skin on feet is gone. I must say a little goes a long way. I just hold a little bit in my hands until the body&#x27;s warmth softens it up.</li>
            <li> very pleased with the natural smell of it, i used it alot to fill my chapsticks and beach tanning :)</li>
            <li> i bought this because i am pregnant and i heard it will help prevent stretch marks (what pregnant woman wouldnt try anything?) but to my surprise it has faded and smoothed out a 6 inch scar i have on my stomach from a car accident.  i am amazed. im 8 months pregnant and still no stretch marks, but i am mostly pleased with my scar</li>
            <li> This was a purchase that was worth purchasing. I have eczema and I needed a lotion or cream that can last all day without drying and also I was sunburnt on the back of my neck so I spread this all over it and not only the burn disappeared but the eczema is slowly disappearing as well.    This is worth it even though the shipping is crazy (more than the product).</li>
            <li> I had been getting my product from the flee market.  I though it was the real stuff.  What a surprise when I realized that I had yet to feel the real thing on my skin.   First it is said that it is organic, a good thing.  I have a problem with my hands when I do a lot of cooking because I wash my hands a lot in water that have bleach in it.  It causes my hands to get really rough and dry. I use this on my hands and within days my hands was back to normal.  It took weeks before.  O yes the price was right at the time I brough it.  I am sure I will keep getting it here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> My first order of shea butter so not sure of long-term benefits.  If you live where the product might freeze during the delivery process, be sure to ask for special packing such as newspaper to insulate it.  I tried mixing it with my Kitchen Aid, and it came out pretty well.  The process is messy, but the shea butter cleans easily with HOT water.  The mixture turned out gritty (probably because it froze during delivery), but it becomes smooth when I rub it in and feels good on my skin.  I added some jojoba oil and lavender essence - I&#x27;ll try peppermint next time.  It leaves my skin slippery looking but wiping with a kleenex helps.  It seems greasy but is not, so it doesn&#x27;t leave spots on clothing or bed sheets, etc.  I got the oil too, which turned out to be effective and less fussy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various moisturizers (high-end to low-end) over the years and never stuck with any of them for long. Oily feeling. No discernible effect. The heck with them.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Then a nurse told me about this shea butter. I just use it on my face and neck, sort of a combination pre-shave / after-shave / moisturizer. And now I use it on my hair and scalp. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Within two weeks of starting to use it, here&#x27;s what happened. True story. I&#x27;m 62. Always looked a bit younger than my age. But I never had women I&#x27;ve known actually get wide-eyed and ask, \\&quot;What have you done! You look incredible!\\&quot; They actually thought I&#x27;d had \\&quot;work\\&quot; done. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s amazing is that, nearly a year later and still using the butter daily, I still get those comments from women I might not have seen in awhile. (Guys don&#x27;t go around complimenting each other on their skin.) So it&#x27;s not a fluke, or my imagination.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only skin-care product I&#x27;ve ever purchased (other than natural goat&#x27;s milk soap) that&#x27;s made any tangible difference whatsoever and that I will use for the rest of my life. Can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews on here, I ordered this item, used my mixer to soften it (hot soapy water will remove the residue from any tools used) and I absolutely LOVE this stuff. First, it is real shea butter. With a little research, I found that the best shea butter is older shea butter, and shea butter gets yellower as it ages. So when I received yellow shea butter, I was very pleased. The container was plastic, but I transferred it all to glass containers once softened and recycled the plastic. Also, any undesirable smell (I didn&#x27;t mind it in natural form at all) can be fixed with a little essential oil in the mixing process as another reviewer indicated OR just wait after applying because the smell disappears after a while. I can&#x27;t believe I ever used chemically-contaminated moisturizers/foot soaks/bath oils/acne medication/scar reducers/hair conditioners/chap sticks/wrinkle products, etc. etc. etc. when this amazing product has been available! I will never go back to that awful garbage again.</li>
            <li> Great price for the product. I don&#x27;t care to much for the smell so I add essential oils when I use it for my hair. Make sure to melt it well (don&#x27;t boil) and mix with coconut oil for your hair, excellent hair product for african american hair or a mix. A little greasy at first on the body, but give it a few mins and your good.</li>
            <li> Any natural diva would tell you that one of her staple products is shea butter! This yellow butter arrives in 8oz moisture sealed containers that are reusable. Shea butter can be used on hair as well as skin. It provides softness and sheen to your tresses with only a small amount. I would recommend this product to anyone at anytime.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.  The seller shiped fast.  Had it in 3 days!!!  It is a thick butter like consistancy of course, with a someone odd odor.  However the aroma doesn&#x27;t linger long.  It works wonders on my really dry skin.  I will surely be buying more when my current supply runs low.</li>
            <li> This product works really good on the really dry areas of my skin.  Especially my feet.  I put this on at night, just before I go to bed.  If I want to put a lot on my feet, then I&#x27;ll put on some socks too.  This helps to keep the product on your skin longer; and doesn&#x27;t get on your sheets and blankets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a really good moisturizer for your skin, this is a good product to soften it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because the product is rather thick; like paste.  So it doesn&#x27;t go on very smooth unless you let it warm up in your hands first, then rub it on your skin.  You might want to mix this with some vitamin e oil, or some almond oil...your favorite oil that you may already use on your skin.  This would give it a softer texture and would go on your skin smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to someone with really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Arrives raw so its a little hard but greatif you smush it a bit and/or to mix with essensial oils.</li>
            <li> I am really happy and satisfied with this shea butter, it really works well in face and hair and even in my  lips, my husband love that for his feet, when you put a little in your face  or hair it looks  as oily, but don&#x27;t worry, few minutes later it is like your skin and hair drink that, so you can touch your hair and face without problem!!! It is the best shea butter I ever had.  Sissa</li>
            <li> Can I just say how disapointed I am with product, I used it on my face and it itched like hell and made my face burn. This is not 100% Shea Butter at all. How i know you ask?...... well I went  Harlem NY went into an African shop that sells 100% Shea Butter, and its NOT yellow but cream or half white, I used it on my face and NO burning NO itching or break outs. It worked wonders for my skin....I&#x27;m so annoyed that they would sell this product as 100% Shea Butter when they know that its not.</li>
            <li> the product is not AS gritty as i was expecting by the reviews i read myself on here before purchasing - that was a pleasant surprise. It literally takes seconds to take a small small amount into the palm of my hand, rub together, and its spreads like butter after that. Its a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best shea butter i&#x27;ve ever used.  i live in the dry winters of Montana and this is the only thing that has worked to keep my skin from itching all day long.  the smell is kinda nasty but small price to pay for the realy deal.  good stuff!!</li>
            <li> After having a great experience with this sellers 8 oz&#x27;s of Golden Shea Butter Cream I was a little apprehensive about ordering this West African Shea Butter fearing the quality/product would be different. It&#x27;s not! Again it&#x27;s the real deal and this time I weighed it prior to using it and found it is exactly as stated, a full pound. Everything I wrote about my previous order applies to this as well:  What I received was genuine Shea butter that appears to be both raw, pure and very fresh. There was absolutely no grittiness and you could actually see flecks of color variation as if it was pushed and mixed in a large bowl as opposed to being melted down to a uniform color or worse dyed yellow. Instead this was an ivory color flecked in places by a light yellowish green with the overall texture of playdough and that telltale sticky/tackiness when pinched between your fingers present. It also had a moderate scent unique to Shea, an almost smoky and nutty scent similar to rubbery oud. While it&#x27;s not my favorite scent in the world, I rather have it present as an indicator of the Shea butter being authentic and unprocessed. Mine came in a simple plastic bag.  In it&#x27;s raw state Shea does turn into a oil when warmed between your hands but I personally find it difficult to use it this way except on the lips. Instead I whipped this into a fluffy body butter incorporating in coconut and argan oils with amazing moisturizing results. It was also relatively easy to mask the smoky scent with some lemon essential oil. This has made such a difference in how my skin feels and ended up being better than I expected. Really pleased I took another chance purchasing online from Dade and will buy from this seller again, hopefully with similar results.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this shea butter. I use shea butter for recipe for hair and skin moisturizer and have been pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product while on vacation in Charleston,South Carolina. I really liked it, so I got on the internet to see if I could find some. I have been using this for 2 months now and I love how it leaves my skin feeling. As long as I can buy this from Amazon.con I plan on using this from now on. Some reviews said not to use it on the face, but I have ever since I started using it and my face does not break out from it, but with all things we try everybodies skin is different. I just love how it makes my face feel so soft and smooth looking. Won&#x27;t use anyhing else. The price and the product is great!!! Amazon.con please don&#x27;t do anything different with this product.</li>
            <li> I found what appears to be a strand of human hair and bits of other stuff in there (hull of the seed maybe?).  You do get a lot.  And it smells god-awful.  Purchase this only if you like smelling like a greasy ashtray.</li>
            <li> This raw shea butter is as good as it gets when it comes to lotions, skin butters and other moisturizing products. It is very rich, yet readily absorbed by the skin and does not leave a greasy feeling. Also, It is the only thing that seems to actually heal and protect my two boy&#x27;s skin from eczema.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have purchased the Organic West Afican Shea Butter.  I read about this product in an article for women over 50 and I have to say, the article was correct.      My skin is starting to feel smoother.  I had a dry itch rash on my one hand and nothing was working.  The Shea has stop the itching and it appears to be going away.  I have been putting this stuff in my hair. My friends think I have been to the beauty shop.  I would recommend this product to anyone that has dry skin and want to improve the quality of their sking.  I have been applying this Shea butter from the top of my head to the soles of my feet..    Sincerely,  A Happy Customer</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick and prompt, and the quantity you receive for the price you pay is a bargain.  I currently use it on a daily basis and it does its job.  With all of the products out there,   it is hard to tell what is really the \\&quot;Natural Shea Butter\\&quot; product but as far as I am concerned this  product is good.</li>
            <li> The Butter WAS NOT Dry.  It was crumbly &amp; Soft. It felt so good on my skin.  i honestly dont think it smells smokey.  IT SMELLS LIKE GLOVES.  But the scent wears off VERY quickly. i made a BIG Mistake buying two jars of this stuff. the jar is HUGE. REALLY! when i saw it i was flabbergasted, i didnt expect it. my cousin said: WHOA. this might last me a good 8 months if not more. i planned on mixing it with jojoba oil almond oil &amp; nubian heritage shea butter lotion for it to smell good. when i did i put too much oil in it &amp; it became watery &amp; i got upset. but i went to go do some work &amp; when i came back for it it was fluffy &amp; soft. its like the butter absorbed the oils. i am SO happy with my purchase. i have a hernia scar ive been dealing with my whole life(i have keloid skin so it hasnt healed)im hopin it will with this. if it does i will update....TRY THIS OUT, YU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED. just because others didnt like the smell doesnt mean they shoudve rated it poor. natural products are gonna smell funny, if yu are lookin for results from a skin problem, deal with it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this Shea Butter at least 4 times from Amazon here, from this exact listing.  Each time I have received it, it has been a different \\&quot;version\\&quot; of the product, although I swear they have all been \\&quot;sold and shipped by halaleveryday\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One time it came in a plastic bag with no label or anything, which was quite surprising, luckily my first order of the item came in a large (I&#x27;d say it could hold 32 oz) white \\&quot;tub\\&quot; with a basic \\&quot;self-print\\&quot; barcode label attached.  This most recent order here in January of 2012 came in a 16 oz plastic clear \\&quot;tub\\&quot; with a real label on it of African Shea Butter 100% Natural.  This actually is the least natural looking batch of the bunch thus far, it is one solid almost milky white hard block.  The other ones I have received have been extremely \\&quot;moist\\&quot; and much darker yellow in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After chipping some of this stuff off the block in the container it does seem to be shea butter, but it is very odd that there are so many variations received on this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, up until this most recent order, it has been amazing stuff and worked very well, despite the strange packaging.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after noticing how many unnatural ingredients were in the body butter I was using. It comes in a large plastic container, and unlike the picture is in random clumps. After removing one small clump and letting it warm in my hand it is easily spreadable and very moisturizing. However I do not think I can handle the smell. It is quite smokey. I guess I expected something more on the lines of a cocoa butter smell. Next time I will try the refined white shea butter or maybe the oil instead.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a short while, however not on a consistent basis.  The product arrived in big chunks, not smooth and creamy.  The chunks have to be broken into small pieces, rolled and warmed in your hands before it can be applied to the skin.  I am beginning to see slight improvement in the condition of my skin.  I plan to purchase the oil to blend with it for easier application.</li>
            <li> I bought the 2 lb. container.  Didn&#x27;t believe in all the hype.  Used the shea and love it!  I use it on my natural/transitioning hair along with coconut oil and I also use the shea butter on my body as a moisturizer prior to using my Johnson &amp; Johnson 24 hour lotion.  Yes, the shea has a smoky smell...not gonna lie but it does disappear after application...no joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if anyone is aware of the term \\&quot;chicken-skin\\&quot;, referring to the bumps on the back of arms and thighs but I had a problem with those.  Went to the dermatologist over a year ago for a consult.  Over $300 later + unsatisfactory results, I decided to proactively research my problem.  This led me to \\&quot;Organic/Natural Shea butter\\&quot;.  Literally 1-2 days after application, I felt a difference in the texture of my skin.  The chicken bumps noticeably reduced.  I can&#x27;t wait for winter because now I know that I have real, proven, effective solution for my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was prompt, less than 1 week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note:  I&#x27;m not a doctor...yet but I&#x27;m convinced that the bumps are due to dry skin which is exacerbated by friction or contact w/ daily clothing and/or bed linen.  Whatever moisterizers we apply to the skin daily, prior to going to bed gets rubbed off.  The rubbing against the sheets causes friction and causes our skin to remain dry.  Unlike other lotions the shea is absorbed into the skin almost immediately and this is why I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
            <li> i was looking for shea butter for my skin and based upon the reviews this is why i purchased this product. i love it.  very soft and works well with my skin. my skin feels soft and shiny.  i want to keep my skin intact you know. i was told this works and this is 100% natural.  has a little scent to it but i could care less. so what. its natural stuff. plan on buying 2 more as i am giving one away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks for tip!</li>
            <li> I have used several brands of shea butter in the past, but this is one of the best. You get a large amount of shea butter (16 oz.) for the price. A great value. I&#x27;ll purchase from this seller again</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0009JQFF6 African Shea Butter Creams 16 Oz. (100% Pure &amp; Raw)]]  This helped with extremely dry skin. I&#x27;ve used it for about a year. Tried both the Gold and White.  The white seems lighter and not as potent.  The gold has a scent similar to cocoa butter. I recently ordered a second batch (3 containers to one batch lasted several months.  However, maybe because this is a natural product, I am unsure, but before opening container, I noticed one batch had greenish, blue tinge in some areas. I contacted the seller, who immediately sent replacement products.     *****Would upgrade to 5 Stars! July 13, 2009  So, I ordered this again and what a great experience!  It was wrapped differently for shipping and one container lasts me about 5 months.  On the second container now and it is still fresh, rich and creamy. The consistency is creamier. I love that moisturizes like no other lotion that I have tried except Ecco Bella, but without the liquid consistency. If in a hurry, scoop some in hand, rub together, rub onto body part and go. Wait a few minutes, if applying to feet in sandals, as it can cause feet to slide and slip a bit. Even on extremely dry skin, put it on in the morning and it lasts throughout the day into late night.  In sunny, hot conditions, I use an SPF over it, as I think it would may cause sunburning.</li>
            <li> I was buying a facecream from a botanical farm that was previously out of Maine, then the family moved to Utah, and unfortunately, soon afterward decided to no longer make their products. I was pretty bummed because they had very few ingredients, were all natural, and made my skin look great. So I decided to use their label and make my own cream. Shea butter and flax oil were major ingredients, so I ordered them here on amazon, then decided to add cocunut oil because I had heard it was good for skin. I also cut open a couple big aloe leaves from my own plant and added them after smoothing in a food processor. On low heat I melted this shea butter and the coconut oil, and after it cooled a little added the flax and aloe. It&#x27;s wonderful! My skin loves it and simply glows! It&#x27;s great on my whole body, perfect after shaving, and even clears up my mild eczema! Between the shea and the coconut it also has a lovely scent. In conclusion, this product was at an amazing price for the quality, and it feels so good knowing you&#x27;re not using toxins like parabens on your skin! Highly recommended to try it yourself (refrigerate bewteen uses)!</li>
            <li> If it is supplied by Halaleveryday, you may want to rethink ordering your shea butter here and find one that carries the American Shea Institute shield, so you know what you are getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE READ, I KNOW IT&#x27;S LONG BUT I LEARNED A LOT AFTER RECEIVING SHEA BUTTER THAT IS NOT TESTED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shea Institute has a great fact sheet all about what real shea butter is and the importance of testing, I learned that the government nor any other agency requires shea butter to be tested for quality and safety prior to selling. It is simply good business to do so and it is voluntary. This is the only way to certify a grade for the shea butter. So, if the shea butter is advertised as \\&quot;grade A\\&quot; it should display the seal of the American Shea Butter Institute. If it states it is grade A but does not carry the shield of the American Shea Butter Institute it is not actually graded and that butter is considered Lotto Grade Shea butter. This means you do not know what you have, it may be good, or it maybe your worst nightmare. Laboratory testing will include a safety screen, shelf life determination, and size of bioactive friction. Untested shea butter undesirables include, products of rancidity, mold, yeast, bacteria, fungus, coliform bacteria, lead, mercury,and other undesirables. ALL OF THIS INFORMATION COMES DIRECTLY FROM THE AMERICAN SHEA INSTITUTE...SHEAINSTITUTE.COM AND YOU CAN GOOGLE THEIR FAQ SHEET AND READ IT THERE FOR YOURSELF</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for my hands, especially for the eczema.  a little goes a long way, &amp; I&#x27;ve also used it for my husbands feet, as he has diabetes &amp; the butter helps his skin.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Not only is this not \\&quot;100% Organic West African Shea Butter\\&quot;, it&#x27;s not really shea butter at all. I&#x27;m at a loss as to what it was that I got in the package. Unrefined Shea Butter (which is not what I received) ranges from almost white to a pale yellow, and has a nutty, smoky scent. This \\&quot;shea butter\\&quot; was mustard yellow, melts at body temperature, but smells like cocoa butter! On top of that, the plastic package that I received it in was dirty. If I could do it again, I would spend the few extra bucks to get a real pound of unrefined shea butter from a verified fair trade company. DO NOT BUY THIS STUFF! IT IS NOT WHAT WAS ADVERTISED!</li>
            <li> When I got the Organic Shea butter, I wondered if the butter was all right. It smelled OK, but looked bad. I was disappointed with the plastic wrap. I mixed it with other oils and essential oil. I made skin oil, body scrub, and hair mask with Shea butter. They are great for my sensitive and dry skin! I use it everyday and very happy.</li>
            <li> Im not a expert when it comes to butters ; HOWEVER, It is a Big portion and happy with the butter. No complaints</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering.  I was very happy to have this product and whip it with other oil.  I used castor oil, olive oil, coconut oil, and the Africa&#x27;s Pride Herbal Oil which smells so good.  I don&#x27;t like the smell of shea butter so the Africa&#x27;s Pride oil made it smell so good.  I am very happy with the product and even happier to know that I am using a product that I actually made.  I researched this before buying and really liked the price.  I will reorder from them if I ever need shea butter again.</li>
            <li> Made a batch of lipstick with this, very very moisturizing. Has no noticeable smell or taste which is perfect for what I am using it for.</li>
            <li> the shea butter came in one large container like others have said it smelled nutty looks greasy upon application but after a short while looks like nothing is there and leaves skin feeling soft also makes hair feel soft i put it in my hair which is un-relaxed and my daughters hair which is the same and it makes my thick hair feel soft to the touch im 9 mts pregnant and i have some stretch marks on my belly i think it may help prevent more but not get rid of them i read a review that said she thought it got rid of the marks oh and mails quickly</li>
            <li> I hate to say this, but the picture doesn&#x27;t represent what was sent to me. REAL shea butter is an IVORY to BEIGE color, this is a MUSTARD YELLOW color. The butter being labeled as \\&quot;Shea Butter,\\&quot; is in fact Kpangnan butter, an African butter SIMILAR to the qualities inherent in SHEA BUTTER. It&#x27;s a good butter, but Shea butter is better and I&#x27;m giving it a 1 because the seller either doesn&#x27;t know or either does know and isn&#x27;t being honest.    Secondly, Shea butter has a MUCH stronger sent, isn&#x27;t waxy feeling.    I&#x27;m only keeping the butter because I don&#x27;t feel like sending this back.    I&#x27;ll be ordering from someone else in the future and not on here as many 3rd party vendors are selling this African Butter as \\&quot;Shea Butter.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Great smell,and is a wonderful moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I seriously spent $12 on 2oz of pure shae butter at Whole Foods.  Then I order it here and get 8x as much for 30% less. And it&#x27;s actually better than the stuff from WF. We used this by itself for a bit, but it takes too long to liquify it for applying as a diaper cream, so I made it into a butt butter by adding lanolin, jojoba oil, vitamin E oil and beeswax. It&#x27;s quite an amazing concoction.  This much makes enough for us to use for about 3 months. I&#x27;m just now ordering my second batch ingredients so I can give it out to our friends who are having children. I also love putting it on them, because then I get to have it on my hands.  I started using it as a soothing ointment after shaving too and it&#x27;s better than anything else.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer! Purity is questionable as it is with any \\&quot;All natural\\&quot; product. This is a great moisturizer, you only need a little bit to cover any area. I hope it&#x27;s really unrefined shea butter as seller claims. I gave it a three because I am not sure about it&#x27;s purity. I will try shea butter from different sellers and compare smells and colors.</li>
            <li> Received product quickly. This product is real 100% shea butter.(Unlike other suppliers that blend butter w/ other moisturizers.) Shea Butter is a great moisturizer &amp; can be used to reduce appearance of scars from acne.  I am very happy w/ product. I have ordered extra containers to shared it w/ several family members.</li>
            <li> It repaired a stubborn dry heel problem. I wish there was a less messy method for applying it. A little shea butter goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am not a connoisseur and so cannot comment on the purity of this product, but it seems like the real deal to me. You get a lot, and it feels &amp; smells great. It comes in plain plastic containers, like take-out tubs--no fancy packaging. I actually put it on my face and throat every night &amp; wake feeling fantastic. (I might not recommend this to someone with less dry skin, though--or someone who doesn&#x27;t sleep alone! It&#x27;s pretty greasy.)</li>
            <li> This has an extremely rancid odor. It&#x27;s not anything I&#x27;d use in my lotions due to the strong, unpleasant smell. Pass on this one</li>
            <li> I have used shea butter for 7 years.I have bought it from african venders  in New York City,also in Seattle Washington,the color has always been  a gold color,or a very deep yellow.Nannie in Edmond Ok.</li>
            <li> My son is 16 months and he has severe dry skin. we have tried all cremes including organic ones and they didnt do much. i was online researching and i saw alot of positive comments on organic shea butter . we decided to try it and it was a dream come true. my son skin is ashy no matter what and his knee were starting to peel so we used the duduo saop and then the shea butter. his skin was moistured for 3 days straight. his skin was soft and his knees started to peel on the 3rd day. now we all us it in the house. i love this product.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this purchase. The product was fresh and came in a well-sealed container. A great amount for the price. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Just recently bought this after trying 100% pure organic shea butter at an art fair this past weekend. The price at the art fair was $30 for 4oz and was the same identical thing as this!! The price of this is amazing and it is wonderful.   I bought some for my husband &amp; me, my brother and sister-in-law and also my mother-in-law. Everyone loves it. My mother-in-law is now ordering for a neighbor too. They live in Arizona and find the shea butter to be great in their very dry climate.   I have been using it on my hands, feet, arms and even under my eyes for the past few days since receiving it. It has made a visible difference in my skin for the better!!  I was concerned about a few of the reviews saying that it smelled and that it wasn&#x27;t to be used directly on the skin. True it does have a slight smell, but only for a minute or so. It is slightly nutty smelling, but it is from a nut so what else would you expect? I think that as suggested by some, that you could put it all into a mix master with the paddle attachment to change it from being a hard consistency to something more whipped...but you would need to add some other oil to it for that to happen. For the price, I am tempted to try adding some essential oils with fragrance to see how it would work.  If you leave it in the container that it comes in (mine came in a plastic tub with a lid) you will need a tongue depressor or little plastic spatula to get it scooped out of the container if you don&#x27;t have nails. Once you have some in your hands, rub together and it warms quickly and wonderfully to moisturize.   My shea butter looked much better than the pictures provided. Nice warm yellow color too. No specks of nut shell, etc</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of this Shea butter (But I&#x27;m not an expert, this is my first time using it), however it is worth noting the state that it arrived in! Oh my word, there was black mold like stuff and grease all over the outside of the bag, and the bag itself was open...not exactly reassuring. Will definitely try more shea butter in the future, but probably not from this seller.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Bright yellow and you can tell it has been mixed with some other oil and poured into plastic tub.&lt;br /&gt;I then wanted to check the weight as I HAVE paid for 16oz and it weighs 14 1/2oz (with the lid taken off!) (15 oz with the lid on).&lt;br /&gt;I am guessing that the product is going to weight less than 14oz when its out of the plastic tub.&lt;br /&gt;Will not use as I have too sensitive skin to try something that I do not know the full ingredients of.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money or your time.</li>
            <li> This is the Bomb!!!!! I do a lot of mixing with oils and I absolutly love this stuff. I want to try to get the biggest amount i can find which i think is 7 pounds.  This stuff was clearly made for black skin beacause it makes my skin and hair feel like butter. It is lighening up all my strecth marks and scars. God knew what he was doing when he made that tree. Will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I heard so many great things about shea butter....but I guess you have to know how to MIX this in with other ingredients, because, on its own, you can&#x27;t just \\&quot;rub it into your skin\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s very \\&quot;dough-like\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t blend into the skin easily on its own.</li>
            <li> very rich in texture and smooth</li>
            <li> I purchased this raw shea butter primarily for my hands and for under my eyes, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I do not like creams or moisturizers that are synthetic or chemical based, and besides the fact that they aren&#x27;t healthy - they never, ever work as well as they claim!  The shea butter is a natural, thick, super-moisturizing emoilent that really gets the job done.  My skin has never felt better.  I used it for two days under my eyes and saw fine lines diminish more significantly than with months of use with other products.  I now use this product on my entire body, including my ultra-sensitive face and I absolutly love it.  It smooths knees, elbows, and rough heels, softens cuticles, and eases skin irritation.  You have to break off a chunk and rub it between your hands to get it smooth for application.  Rub it in really well and your skin will absolutely glow!!  In addition to being thrilled with the product, I was thrilled with the price as well.  Go to your local health food store and check out the price of pure, raw shea butter and you will see that they can not beat this awesome price.</li>
            <li> My doctor, who recommended I use shea butter on the bottom of my dry cracked feet, said it had an odor that many people don&#x27;t like.  Unlike the white, this does have that odor, but I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant.  If you are sensitive to odors, I would reocmmend the white, but otherwise, save your money and get this one.  It really works well on dry skin and the effects are lasting.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The article does not bring any class of instructions, or manual.  Does not it say if should melt, &amp;iquest;how to apply it?, &amp;iquest;as Much as?, &amp;iquest;as Many as days?, &amp;iquest;applies during the day or at night?  Al can be used same time with other products of beauty?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a transparent plastic glass of regular presentation, without labels.  Presentation lacks him.  The presentation is not adjusted to the photo.  In the photo is seen well packed.  But I arrive us in a glass in a cut, very hard block and packed of evil forms.  Equal to the paraffin.  Alone it has a small one sticker with a direction of a website, in which neither instructions they are found neither any indication on the product.  Does not it include neither a photocopy with instructions.  Every product of beauty brings indications on its use.  But this not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom it this using of difficult form, since to apply it in the skin in complicated by being a quite hard substance.  For the hair is even more difficult to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not it say if should be diluted with some substance or one must melt it.  To my mom has touched her to be begin to guess the form to use it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am trying raw shea butter, and I am hooked.  It works great by itself however, to make it easier to apply, I place it in a jar and heat it somewhat in hot water  to soften it, and then mix in aloe vera gel, coconut oil, jojoba oil and sweet almond oil.  I use this cream all over my body - on my hair, face, hands and feet and it works wonderfully, even in the harshest cold.</li>
            <li> Works great in making lotions! Hands are super soft! Works best if you whip it for awhile before use. Will buy agian</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a natural skin moisterizer that wasn&#x27;t a runny oil. Oils are okay, but I love using richer things in cooler weather. I began researching shea butter and learned so many wonderful things. The first time I tried it. I broke out into welps and I was itching like crazy. I even started getting little white heads on the tops of my arms and thighs. I thought it was highly unusual for me, as I am not allergic to anything. I just assumed that I couldn&#x27;t reep the benefits of shea butter.    But I just wasn&#x27;t ready to give up, plus I had to find out why I had such a reaction to a natural product that is said to be great for everyone... even the most sensitive skin. I later discovered that the shea butter I had been using had been processed horribly wrong. It was grey, smelled very weird, had lots of particles and specks, and didn&#x27;t do mch for the moisture levels in my skin. I have also learned that real unrefined and \\&quot;un-messed around with\\&quot; shea butter should be cream colored to golden yellow. It should be dense, a cross between Pla-Doh and candle wax. And it should have a smokey or roasted nut smell... that fades away. THIS IS THAT BUTTER!! I have not experienced any itching or redness... and I&#x27;ve been slathering it on, too:) I love this stuff. The container is huge, and it&#x27;s not one of those weird containers you get from some natural products dealers that looks big on the outside but really isn&#x27;t once you open it. I do wish that my shea butter had come to me as one solid block instead of a bunch of scrumbled pieces. I guess they did that for ease of use and to make sure that I didn&#x27;t get over 16 oz. All and all, I will purchase again. But whose to say when that thing will run out... it is HUGE!!</li>
            <li> A wonderful, moisturizing, all natural product.  The scent could be better but its not horrible.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It seems whenever I use any kind of lotion my skin just soaks it right up and still is dry. I don&#x27;t like artificial scents and if you want \\&quot;good\\&quot; lotion it costs a lot for a small amount.   I&#x27;ll be honest, this stuff looks really funky. There&#x27;s no getting around that, but I got over it when I picked up a nasty-dried-up-play-doh-lookin&#x27; chunk and rubbed it between my hands and then started to rub it on my arms. My skin was glowing and the smell that may offend some people lessens in intensity and smells pleasant on the skin. I found it works best to start by picking up a chunk, rolling it around in my hand..some of it starts to warm and then melt onto my hands.. I can then rub the chunk itself over my skin or just keep rolling the chunk in my hands to gets more of the shea butter on them...then when it&#x27;s warm and melted I rub it on my face, especially around the eyes, my neck, stretchmarks on my belly (*blush*), feet, arms, elbows, etc.  I especially like it on my feet, cuz they get dry and cracked. I sometimes slather it on pretty thick and then put socks on and go to bed like that. With shipping this product ended up costing me $20 but a little goes a long way, and you get 2 pounds worth. Look how much really good skin cream that truely works on dry thirsty skin costs and the size of the product. I also like that this is a pure and natural product. Some lotions have shea butter in them but it&#x27;s only a small amount. This is the real thing and it does a great job.  I have dry skin , but parts of my face are oily and using this stuff doesn&#x27;t seem to aggravate it. Oily skin needs some moisturizing too I think.</li>
            <li> I have been using Shea Butter for several years now and works wonders on my dry aging skin. Over the years I have found that whipping it makes it creamy and easier to use than in its natural form right out of the container.  When you get your butter, empty the contents of the plastic container into your stand mixer (use paddle attachment) and mix at low speed at first to keep it from flying everywhere. Then increase the speed a little at the time.  The butter will gradually heat up from the agitation and will become smooth.  At this point you may add a couple of drops of essential oils to make it smell good or you can add a little jojoba oil which will double your moisturizing power.  Please note that if you choose to heat Shea butter, do it gradually and at very low heat (I use a double broiler when I need to heat it) because it has a very low heat tolerance, if overheated you will end up with a gritty consistency that is not correctable. Note: if you do not have a stand mixer, you can use a hand mixer, but it takes a while to get it soft and creamy, so consider having a buddy to do relays on holding the hand mixer. Enjoy - hope this tip helps.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the package I knew I had been duped. This product is a bright yellowish color and is extremely creamy. True, raw Shea butter is ivory and very hard. This product smells a lot more like cocoa butter than shea. When it arrived the package label said \\&quot;Yellow Shea Butter\\&quot;. I did not order \\&quot;yellow\\&quot; Shea butter. What was marketed online was \\&quot;100% Organic West African Shea Butter\\&quot;. What I received is not what I paid for and I want my money back! Do not be fooled!</li>
            <li> This is very solid, not easy to put on skin. It also takes a while to absorb and has a light but funny smell. I will not buy again I will look for something that is organic with shea butter but added natural ingredients to make it more fluid.</li>
            <li> The chunky appearance of it in the raw was a bit of a shock, but it works really well out here in the high desert.</li>
            <li> I know many people us this product primarily on the skin; however, I use it on my young daughter&#x27;s hair.  She has very dry hair, and moisturizers for adults were too harsh and caused skin irritation.  I use it daily on her hair at night as a moisturizer prior to braiding it.  It has truly transformed her hair.   Several people who are familiar with her pre-shea butter hair ask me what I&#x27;m putting on her hair.  They can&#x27;t believe the transformation.</li>
            <li> I looked around for a while for good shea butter and I stumbled on this product. The price was reasonal enough for me to try it. When I got it, it was double the size of the picture and it is in chunks in a clear plastic tub. At first I didnt like the smell but once I put it on it faded within a couple minutes but the more I put it on the more I liked the smell and now I dont even notice it. It melts easily in your hands and rubs on smooth and if you have dry skin it really penetrates and moisturizes the skin. I really recommend it for people with dry skin it works wonders. They also delivered super fast and it was packaged nicely I will definitely buy from here again. Great price and a great product.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS WONDERFULLY. AM VER PLEASED HAVE USED IT TO MAKE FACE AND BODY CREAM AND BUTTER. GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> I really like 100% pure and raw shea butter.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer if you have alligator skin.  I also enjoy using it as a hair conditioner (have to experiment to figure out what&#x27;s best for hair so it&#x27;s not too heavy- a little bit goes a long way). This is a great price for pure shea butter.  I have found a better quality shea butter (the lighter colored shea butters are creamier, less grit) on another site for a comparable price so I will not be ordering from this supplier again.  It took way too long to receive my order (over two weeks) with no communication from the merchant.</li>
            <li> It is good, though not what I expected. It is a bit grainy and not as pictured, but more like melted yellow Shea in a plastic jar. I expected raw unprocessed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use many lotions but this is perfect for my sensitive skin. I do add a few drops of essential oil because I am not a fan of the raw shea smell. It does work at getting my roughest areas soft.</li>
            <li> First off please do not pay attention to the reviews stating that this is not real shea butter based on the fact that it is yellow. Shea butter comes in 2 different colors. If you DO your research, you will see that colors can vary from beige to off white and a mild yellow to a bright yellow. In some cases, white shea butter means that it is refined and therefore losses the essential nutrients. So 100% shea butter can be white or yellow.   Okay, now to the product. I&#x27;m newly natural and have been trying to get my hands on some shea butter to use in my DIY hair moisturizer. I;m so happy I found this. Mixed with some essential oils into a cream, it does wonders for my hair. It is softer, has sheen, OMG I love it. Alone as a hair treatment, I&#x27;m not so sure. Upon research I found that using it alone as a hair treatment wasn&#x27;t a good idea so I didn&#x27;t try it. I love the fact that amazon offers a pagakage deal to. You get essential oils to mix with it in a bundle price and I took advantage of that ( I was going to purchase them anyways for my shea butter mix). If you are a natural and are looking for a good shea butter this is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a difficult time finding shea butter in stores and decided to order this product. I recieved 1 lb of raw shea butter in the mail---enough to last me at least two - three months. I mix it with other products to use on my hair. The quality is excellent!!</li>
            <li> I have now ordered this twice for making homemade body moisturizers and it works very well.  As it is &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34;, it does have a kind of&lt;br /&gt;nutty fragrance, but not noticeable after I mixed in some essential oils.</li>
            <li> My skin became very dry over the winter. This shea butter relieved my dead dry skin instantly.  It doesn&#x27;t go on oily or sticky and it penetrates the skin without sitting on the top of your skin. The price was worth what I spent for the amount of product. I would have given the shea butter 5 stars but it smells like shoe rubber. Its a minor problem that I will resolve by adding sented oil extract.</li>
            <li> Though the transaction and delivery were excellent,the shea butter itself was a no-win.I would have gotten the same results from regular skin lotion. Marketers know the value of exploitation and exagerration and this was one of those times.But I wanted to try it--and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wonderful service!  This product arrived 3 days after I placed my order.  Great care was taken in the packaging, and I was surprised to see that the container was actually filled with 1 lb. 6 oz. pieces of raw shea butter nuggets.  A bonus of six extra ounces.  I have never used raw shea butter before, and would describe using this product like playing with play-doh.  I opened the plastic container, took a chunk out, placed it in the palm of one hand, and softened it by using the forefinger of my other hand.  Once I got it to the consistancy I prefered, I then began to rub it all over my entire body.  I am a diabetic and suffer from severe, intense, itching skin, and immediately felt relief in using this product.  It is a bit greasy like real butter, but did not leave an oily residue on my sheets, and I felt wonderful upon waking up this morning.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what the long term effects of using this product beholds in store for me!</li>
            <li> It stains and is pretty gritty.    A quick google search came up w/ the cause:    \\&quot;Gritty Shea. Again, complications in processing.\\&quot;    \\&quot;Improper heating of shea butter can cause the butter to crystallize as it cools. This crystallization can cause lip balms, body butters and other formulations to turn gritty.\\&quot;    After a shower, I would sit in front of the heater to hurry the melting process of applying the butter.  The gritty feeling was kind of annoying, but my skin did drink it up.  I got dressed and then noticed the butter had stained my clothes a gross yellow.      I also applied this to my hair which is very chemically abused, and pretty dried.  This thing made me look like I havnt showered in a week.  Also, after a few applications (applying to my hair at night and washing it out in the morning) I havnt noticed my hair softer, shinier, or anything.    I&#x27;ll update after more usage if my skin has improved or the stains is washable, or if my hair will benefit from this at another date.  As it;s supposedly all natural, I will continue to give this some more time to \\&quot;work.\\&quot;    Also, if I run out of this stuff and it does work, I probably will try a different brand.    Seller, fast shipping, but does not respond to my emails!  Would hate to think if there was a true problem w/ my order.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now and love it.  I was concerned about some features that others complained of in their reviews (mostly the smell and the yellow color rubbing off on clothing, etc.).  The smell is minimal and I have had no problems with the color rubbing off on clothes.  I bought mine with the Shea Butter oil and use the two together, but I have also mixed it with my own essential oils for a personal scent.  I love the way my skin feels and others have complemented me on the look and feel of my skin.  Also, you cannot go wrong with the amount you receive for the price.  I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Well, when I recieved this order of Shea Butter, it didn&#x27;t look anything like the rich creamy picture.  It was all broken up and crumbly and looked dried up.  I heated it however, and melted it down to a nice consistancy.  Upon heating though a good ammount of debris floated to the top and sunk to the bottom of the container.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product. Went to use it to make body cream and found whole flies in it. Several whole and many small pieces of the insects. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again. I don&#x27;t want to have to strain the shea butter before using it.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin that has had its share of sun damage over the years.  After using the 100% raw shea butter for only a week I am seeing improvements in my skin that dermotologists have not helped with their expensive prescriptions. It is easy to use, absorbs quickly into the skin, and the mild odor fades quickly. The backs of my hands are smoother with much less roughness due to keratosis spots, and I truly believe that already I am seeing fine lines under my eyes disappearing!  I plan to be a long time user!</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer, expecially for people with eczema, like myself.  I bought it because my skin gets so dry from this condition.  I just take a clump, rub some in and it goes deeply into my skin to moisurize it.  I use that with my aloe and cortisone and I am set.  It really helps a lot.  I recommend this product to people not only with a skin condition, but to people who have dry, flaky skin and need a good moisturizer.  It works.</li>
            <li> Shea Butter in already included in many skin products.  The difference is that with getting Shea Butter directly you are getting the best of the other products.  For people who have psoriasis it seems to help in relieving itch pain and soreness.</li>
            <li> I bought both the  gold and the white shea butter. I don&#x27;t find the scent of the gold to be objectionalble at all, in fact I like it, and I&#x27;m the first one in any group to complain about the smell of something. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, although I had to get past the crumbled-cheese texture, I consoled myself that there weren&#x27;t any petroleum byproducts to emulsify it. My only problem occurred when my dog devoured the whole 8-oz tub of the gold shortly after I got it. But she never had any GI problems after that, like I would have expected, which I guess vouches for its purity!</li>
            <li> Being a soap maker means I&#x27;m used to weighing soaps and ingredients and as soon as I picked up one of the 3 x &#x27;1 pound&#x27; containers, I knew something was off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The containers are not capable of containing 16oz of shea butter, they only contain 14.5.oz, so you guys owe me 4.4oz of shea butter.</li>
            <li> A good skin conditioner and moisturizer but heavy consistency , use lightly dependent upon dryness of skin or those difficult areas such as elbows and feet. If you have never tried this product before buy small quantity and see if you like it before going large.</li>
            <li> Found this product to be the best moisturizer so far for cold winter days. I apply it on my face and on the whole body after bath. It is very well absorbed by the skin and leaves it smooth and silky. It&#x27;s superior to sophisticated chemical mixtures (cosmetic creams) at much higher price.  I mix it with argan oil for easier spreading and enhanced beneficial effects.  The reason I dropped one star is the slight inconsistency in different batches of shea butter (purchased at different time) - some smell and feel better than others.</li>
            <li> I am using this not only as a skin softner, but also as a hair conditioner because I use a flat iron and it works well.</li>
            <li> Need I say more?  Mom has no stretch marks, baby has no diaper rash or any skin issues, for that matter.    Yes, shea butter stains clothes, however, I recommend using it at night after a shower and wearing cotton night clothes that you can launder in warm or hot water.  Also, you want the shea butter to be able to moisturize through the night, while you are warm in bed (optimal effects).    Shea butter is pretty miraculous and all natural.  Knowing that baby gets no chemicals, just vitamin-rich natural shea butter, makes us very happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried some shea butter before that I&#x27;d gotten from the beauty supply store. It was ok, kind of gritty and it had a nice smell, but it was nothing special, so I couldn&#x27;t understand all the hoopla about this stuff.     I decided to give it another try, after doing some research and seeing that unrefined shea butter was probably much different than the stuff I had. So I ordered this.    OMG this smells terrible, but I have never felt anything so moisturizing. Usually, my skin has to be moist for me to feel that the product is absorbing, but this just melts into your skin making it baby soft. Unbelievable. But I seriously hate the smell so I had to take off one star.     The seller shipped this super fast too, so that was great. Overall an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I tried shea butter because of an article I read in a magazine.  It is absorbent, and does make the skin softer.  I do like this product and will probably buy again.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to get myself some Shea butter for a while.  I finally decided on this stuff.  It moisturizes well and was a great price!</li>
            <li> I got this for making DIY aluminum-free deodorant.  I may use this to make lotion as well. Good, fresh product at a reasonable price. Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I weighed it after reading several reviews of being short changed, and got a couple of extra ounces.  It is a little more yellow than some that I have purchased, but spreads and feels the same.  A good value!</li>
            <li> Love it third time ordering</li>
            <li> Great for body butter..whipped up nice</li>
            <li> I purchased this product twice, and the third time was NOT the charm..... The product was totally different in texture than my previous purchases. I am so disappointed with this false advertising of shea butter. The quality has changed and the product is visibly different. I will not order this again.</li>
            <li> First time I bought this, it was pretty good aside from the swirl of mixed colors which I know is not ideal but normal. Second order smelled HORRIBLE and had things floating in it. I had to melt it down and strain it, whip it with essential oils and still smelt almost unbearable. I wasn&#x27;t comfortable selling the products made with this, the smell was so bad. Although the price is great, in the end it cost me money.</li>
            <li> The only thing that was interesting(in a creepy way)was that there was some white mixed with yellow in it.  Overall, it goes a long way when using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff was wonderful and easy to work with! Perfect for making body care products. I will be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Used this product with coconut oil, beeswax and lemongrass oil (with a drop of Vit. E oil) to make natural lotion bars.  Easy to work with; bars are excellent.</li>
            <li> This was a very mustard yellow (which shows in your homemade lotions and salves) and very moist, rough texture. I have ordered organic shea butter before and it was totally different than this. I will spend a little more money and get better quality next time.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I discovered this shea butter!! I bought 2 pounds for less than $ 20. It is great for the skin, I use it every night as an anti-wrinkle cream on my face and after each shower for my whole body.I use it for my 1 year old as well after bath and as a diaper rush cream. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I am thinking of throwing away the rest of my lotions, too many chemicals in them.  I will be back to buy some more!!!!</li>
            <li> I order this my shea butter about 2 weeks ago. My skin is loving it. During the winter months my skin become so dry and cracked you could light a match off of my hand. But no more, even my nail lady noticed!! And this seller is amazing. I ordered it on a Wednesday got it Saturday.</li>
            <li> I attempted to make lotion bars with this product and could not get passed the awful smell. It&#x27;s very...plasticy or waxy. I personally was not a big fan. It&#x27;s not a smell I would want on my skin.</li>
            <li> ok. this is natural shea butter. its great for your skin. its the real deal. And it does have a strong smell. I was using this for lotion bars, and the shea aroma quickly overpowered the scents I tried to add. This is great stuff, but will retain a strong aroma.</li>
            <li> Used this alone and with beeswax to make lotion bars.  Shared the plain Shea butter and lotion bars with family, they were pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Mom is diabetic and I have eczema, so we have to watch what we put on our skin and this was a relief.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, for EVERYTHING! It is the ultimate moisturizer. As much as I love virgin coconut oil and use it for everything, shea butter far surpasses it in the moisture department.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! Been using it on my skin and my hair. Very smooth and easy to mix into my natural hair products.</li>
            <li> Do not remember purchasing this</li>
            <li> Before a shower, coat your hair with the Shea Butter, put on a shower cap and heat with a blow-dryer for 5-10 minutes. Then shampoo. Great deep conditioning and helps end breakage and split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shower, coat feet and put on socks. Babby soft feet by morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put a few table spoons in bath water for a natural and cheap bath oil. Skin is silky smooth and you don&#x27;t have to spend all that time rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> I use this on my feet and it works like a dream...softens my heels and toes. It is solid so if you want to mix in your favorite lotion dig a little bit out from the tub , and melt in the microwave. Just long enough for it to soften a bit.     I personally like to use in my my lotion mixes. It has definitely improved my skin texture and tone</li>
            <li> I love shea butter so the product itself is great and just as I expected with the exception that I didn&#x27;t know it came in chunks rather than the smoother one. That&#x27;s even ok because when you rub it together it smooths on its own. Fine, lets talk about the $9.74 I paid for S&amp;H. The package from USPS was fine until I opened said pkg to find chunks of shea butter all over the inner containers. Apparently one of the containers was not closed tightly so it spilled everywhere making it messy and I had to put it all back intot he container. I hope this is an isolated incident but for almost $10 to ship &amp; handle, it should&#x27;ve been handled better than this.</li>
            <li> Ok, I just got my raw Shea Butter today, and first off the container was dented and then duct taped like it had been thrown against the wall. When i first opened the container, the stench practically hit me in the face. It smells DISGUSTING!! When i tried to scoop some out, it was so hard and brittle i had to put it on top of my heater to soften it up a bit. When it finally started to melt (which it went from completely hard to oil), i put some on my hands and my face and it feels completely greasy, (i definitely wouldnt use it on my face during the day) and the smell is definitely lingering, so I&#x27;m going to have to wash it all off before work. I know that since this is a natural product, it takes a little time to \\&quot;work\\&quot; so I&#x27;m going to give it a shot. I&#x27;m just only going to use it at night so i can wash it off in the morning. I also bought the Dudu Osun Black Soap that i can&#x27;t wait to try (it smells like pine trees) so maybe that will pair well with the shea butter. I just think that on first application, Vaseline with SHea butter moisturizes the same, if not better than the raw shea butter....and it smells a wholeee lot better!!!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent and relatively inexpensive moisturizer. I occasionally suffer eczema and this mild moisturizer does not worsen the condition as most moisturizers do in my experience. It can be used for deep moisturizing or in smaller quantities as a light moisturizer such as under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shea butter is packed in a plastic tub with a screw lid. It is the consistency of refrigerated butter and melts easily. It&#x27;s necessary to rub the moisturizer with your hands for about 3 seconds before applying it. At first your skin will be oily, but after about three minutes the skin becomes soft and there is no more oiliness than a regular moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a tub of part yellow, part white shea butter (approximately 90% yellow and 10% white). The white is harder and doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well. The yellow shea butter does not tint the skin or clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned: only use this on your skin or lips (works well as a chapstick substitute). Do not attempt to put it on inner areas such as inside the mouth, because in those areas it will congeal and become like glue and is very difficult to remove. It will probably take several days to remove it completely from inner areas. If used properly, this is a mild, highly effective moisturizer for dry, sensitive or healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer. Con must apply to very warmed skin. Pro it lasts for 24 plus hours. greasy at first, but then it goes away and leaves very soft, hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> This was a highly anticipated purchase for me! Imagine my suprise when it arrived in some OLD plastic (probably used) container, with the words 100% pure shea butter taped on the top!! That&#x27;s right taped!! And the lid TAPED down! This butter is yellow! Pure unrefined shea butter is cream in color!! This did work good on my face, that is the only reason I gave it 1 star. But if you are looking for pure unrefined shea butter go to coastal scents or somewhere else, because this is not it!</li>
            <li> Came packaged in larger food type container and wrapped in plastic. Perfect texture and exactly what I needed for my homemade deodorant project.  Have trouble finding this type of thing locally.  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!!!</li>
            <li> Coming from Africa, the sheabutter is the same. It is so good.I use it on my hair and on my body. It is a very nice cream and moisturizer. It works well as a sunscreen too. It is not oily.    I must say I bought a good stuff.</li>
            <li> This is Kpangnan Butter, or African Butter. It&#x27;s not actually Shea butter (which is beige and not as dense as African butter). They are from different trees in different habitats. Still a good butter with some similar properties. This seems to be pretty common abroad epically in the US market where you will also find it labeled as Golden Shea Butter. I&#x27;m not sure how it became so widely adopted with this title, but having Kapangnan Butter, Golden Shea or even African Tallow as part of the title would be more appropriate.</li>
            <li> great smell, great product. love it! i use it for almost everything that i need moisturized, mix it with raw sugar and you make a great shower scrub that leaves your legs smooth moisturized but not oily.</li>
            <li> I HAD ORDERED SOME SHEA FOR MY CREAMS SOME MONTHS AGO ,AND IT WAS GOOD,BUT ALITTLE OLD.I ORDER 1 LB IN JUNE,IT&#x27;S THE BALM.SERIOUSLY ,IT&#x27;S FRESH SMELLS GREAT AND THEY HAD A LIST OF USES ON THE CONTAINER WITCH HAS BEEN A BLESSING.I DIDN&#x27;T KNOW IT WAS A SUNBLOCK. ALSO I HAVE A PERM IN MY HAIR AND THE CURLS ARE SO TIGHT IF I BRUSH IT WHEN IT&#x27;S DRY I GET A FRO. MY HAIR WAS ALSO SO DRY,I STARED USING THIS AS A CONDITIONER BEFORE I WASH ,I LEAVE IT IN THE LAST 2/3RDS OF MY HAIR ,I GO OUT AND DO MY BUSINESS AND GET A HOT OIL CONDITIONER BECAUSE OF THE SUMMER HEAT.AT THE SAME TIME I STARTED TO USE A NATURAL SHAMPOO BAR FOR DRY HAIR ,MY HAIR LOOKS AND FEELS SO GOOD,EACH CURL SEPERATED AND BOUNCY.THE BACK OF MY HAIR IS NOT AS CURLY OR DAMAGED AND I&#x27;VE FOUND IF I PUT THE SHEA IN THAT PART IT&#x27;S HARDER TO WASH OUT AND LOOKS GREASY.BUT IT HAS RESTORED THE DRY DAMMAGED HAIR.THIS IS ALSO GREAT IN MY SKIN CARE PRODUCTS I&#x27;VE MADE WITH IT AND SEE A NOTICABLE DIFFERENCE.</li>
            <li> When I received my shea butter I put it all in my Kitchen Aid mixer for 20 minutes. It became creamy and very useful healing my dry skin. I tried many skin creams, but raw shea butter is a keeper. When I run out I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> not real Shea butter don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Product is fine but my personal preference is cacao butter.  I made a body butter using this and although it goes on smoother than cacao it doesn&#x27;t seem to penetrate as well and also gives a cooling sensation to the skin, which I may love on a hot summer day but don&#x27;t appreciate on a cold winter night.</li>
            <li> I ordered Organic African Shea Butter from Amazon based on their description of the product as well as the numerous 5-star reviews from customers.   I had the product shipped to my office and received it yesterday.  Anxious to try it, I opened the package and did what so many of the reviews said,  I took a small piece, warmed it with my hands and used it on my hands.  My co-workers did not appreciate the smell and thought that it might be rancid.  I e-mailed Halaleveryday(who had shipped me the product) asking if the scent should be so overpowering or is it possible that it might be rancid.   Halaleveryday&#x27;s response to me was that the product has a strong nutty smell.  they also said that this product is the main raw ingredient to make my own body butter and that they do not advise using it directly on the skin.  They gave me the \\&quot;recipe\\&quot; to make my own body butter, however, I did not buy the product to use it to make body butter.   I bought it to use \\&quot;as is\\&quot; in its natural state like most of the customer reviews state.  I wrote back saying that the information Halaleveryday gave me was certainly not listed in the product information on Amazon and that I would not have purchased it if I knew that I should not use it \\&quot;as is\\&quot; directly on my skin.  Halaleveryday&#x27;s response was that I should not blame anyone other than myself because I should have researched the product prior to buying.  They continued by saying that Amazon&#x27;s listing \\&quot;could not serve as a shea butter schooling\\&quot; and that \\&quot;the people who praised it know well what to do with it\\&quot;.  I dont even know what to say or what to think.  Is everyone really using the product \\&quot;as is\\&quot; without \\&quot;filtering\\&quot;?[[ASIN:B0009JQFF6 100% Organic West African Shea Butter 16 oz]]</li>
            <li> Ok so first off let me start out by saying that this is NOT shea butter.  It is African butter from a totally different part of Africa. I have ordered real shea butter and it is supposed to be white, not yellow. Second, being that this was my first experience with African butter, I would have to say that it wasn&#x27;t too bad. Its a little more creamy than Real Shea butter and it works well for natural hair. I noticed that it also works well on skin. It has more moisture than real Shea butter. But it was altogether worth the purchase . I gave it a 3 because it&#x27;s not real shea butter. Someone should really do their research before labeling an all natural product like this.</li>
            <li> This is very raw Shea butter with some particles in it.  It is organic and very healing on your skin. Shea butter is very moistening an easy to apply.  It is solid at room temperature, but melts on your skin very easily.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs very well.  It heals chapped hands, lips and is a natural sun screen.  It has worked very well on finger cuts and dry spots.  Great price!</li>
            <li> It was very creamy and nice for the baby &amp;#34;butt&amp;#34; balm I made with it.  It felt good on my hands as I was working with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, its legitimate shea butter.  It is thick and difficult to rub on skin but that&#x27;s how raw sheabutter is supposed to be.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I whipped it with my hand mixer, adding coconut oil and jojoba oil as well as a few drops of lavender essential oil. It is lovely, fluffy, and very moisturizing. Heals my skin well and I love using it for everything, even as a facial moisturizer. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> i got this shea butter after hearing and reading how great it is for all type of skin condition. I had one before - very hard, ivory looking, but quicly melting - but this one is soo diferent. the color is very yellow, the type what fake mustartd has. i was trying to use it as a diaper cream, as a dry skin moistureizer and treating very mild eczema and scars but it did not do anything to any above mentioned problem. After several days I still did not see any result nor improvment. That is when I started to think of the authenticity of this product. I think I will stop using it since I have no proof of its originality and beside it really does not work. I am sad, I wish I could return it. I will try to contact the seller. If you want the real thing dont buy it.</li>
            <li> There is nothing as moisturizing as shea butter. It&#x27;s not greasy and has a nice thick consistency. I use it around my eyes, face, neck, hands. It has kind of a strange odor but its not a bad smell and you get used to it. I don&#x27;t even notice I kind of like it is sort of smoky smelling. but again shea butter is absolutely the best, and this price is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This is just as good as expensive shea butter (but so much cheaper!) No fancy packaging so it doesn&#x27;t cost a lot. It&#x27;s really a miracle for my sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t even have to buy lotion anymore!</li>
            <li> Hard and a bit unpleasant nose. Jergens original cherry &amp; almond along with some Coconut oil works better for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff, albeit it very different from other \\&quot;moisturizers\\&quot;, is amazing.  I put the tub of shea on the rim of the tub when I am in the shower.  It softens it up enough to get creamy in my hands almost immediately.  Grab a chunk, roll it in you hands (add essential oils if you want) and start applying.  Yup, it&#x27;s more time consuming than a pump bottle with lots of chemicals (read the label on almost any lotion) but it is worth it.  This stuff is greasy, but doesn&#x27;t really feel like it.  I put it on my face and my skin can BREATHE, it is still on my belly in the morning.  No gross feeling at all.  As with any oil/butter, watch your clothes~it may stain although I haven&#x27;t noticed it.  What I have noticed was that funny oily smell on some clothes (mainly my robe) after washing.  I have this happen with various other oils as well, so it&#x27;s not particular to this shea.  Great stuff, save your skin and try it and give it a chance.</li>
            <li> I was very well pleased with the pureness of the product and the quickness of its delivery.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I even like the smell of it.  It is heaven for my feet.</li>
            <li> I never thought to review this item seeing as it had such a huge amount of reviews covering just about everything from it&#x27;s strength to it&#x27;s restorative abilities on hair, but I decided after about a week to go ahead and review it. I had actually bought a container of this exact shea butter from amazon before and was extremely happy with it&#x27;s ability to straighten out my curly fine hair. I was also very surprised to find that I could use it on my face as a cream and that it was so potent that I only had to apply it three times a week to keep my hair smooth and controlled. It does have a bit of a strange scent to it, but I got used to it very quickly and while I was initially surprised by the skin reaction(pimples and such) it cleared up within a week, and it has the added benefit of keeping my skin just a bit warmer in colder temperatures.</li>
            <li> The photo above is a little misleading because it doesn&#x27;t show the butter, just what it comes from. But the butter was a good quality and consistency, and a good ingredient for the lotion bars I made. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Good product, decent packaging too for good shelf life.</li>
            <li> I actually mix this in one big batch with extra virgin olive oil, castor oil, jojoba oil, natural honey, sugar, and organic aloe vera. I store the extra and keep some in a tin in my bathroom to use as shaving \\&quot;cream\\&quot;. It works amazing! My legs feel so smooth and moisturized. I have extremely sensitive skin and as a last resort was willing to go organic. It really has made a huge difference, and no chemicals to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little about my process:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I heat the shea butter in a measuring cup placed in water I am heating on the stove. This way it gradually heats instead of microwaving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Take the soft consistency shea butter out of the hot water/pot on stove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Use an electric mixer and add extra virgin olive oil, castor oil, and aloe vera until a whipped, creamy consistency is reached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Then add, to a lesser degree: honey, sugar, and jojoba oil *I imagine you could add an essential oil like cinnamon, ginger, or lavender for smell- however I don&#x27;t really worry about this as I apply in shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Store the excess mixture away, and place some in a container to use in bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess some might consider this a tedious process, but it&#x27;s pretty easy. I purchased this shea butter back in March, and I still have enough for I&#x27;m sure well into December.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because personally, I don&#x27;t like using it \\&quot;as is\\&quot; but with a few extra things its a perfect, all natural, and affordable beauty product for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------UPDATE JANUARY 2013 ----------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I still use this shea butter. Only purchased it maybe two or three times since my initial review, this stuff lasts forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve simplified my process: I now just warm the shea butter and blend in http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028POGA/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o05_s00_i01 , http://www.amazon.com/Natures-Way-Organic-Virgin-Coconut/dp/B003B3OOPA/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1357336912&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;coconut+oil , and a little bit of olive oil for shaving cream.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s thick creamy dreamy shea butter. It arrived quickly and was packaged in large chunks which made it easy to transfer it to plastic bags. It&#x27;s so thick that I will have to mix it with oils to be able to smooth it on to my skin a little easier. I&#x27;m definitely not complaining about that though. I will be re ordering when I run out (which may be a while given the amount of shea butter I received,lol)</li>
            <li> As I expected. Works great on dry winter skin and a pound will last a LONG time! Used it in a body butter recipe.</li>
            <li> I had psoriasis on my ankles and feet- got to the point where it was painful to walk or stand- put this on under some sox in the morning and before bed- was gone within a couple of weeks. Only have to use it 2x a week now to maintain. also great for toning skin on stomach, thighs, etc straight out of the shower.This stuff is amazing and as natural as you can get!</li>
            <li> After using it for a while I was sure there was oil mixed with it, but now I can&#x27;t tell. I don&#x27;t like having it on my hands but it keeps my skin from peeling in dry weather and keeps my hair manageable. The reason I thought it contained oil was that it feels oily. But I haven&#x27;t gotten any zits from it so if it does have oil (which it probably doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s very minuscule. It also looks more yellow than other Shea butter I&#x27;ve seen/used. So far, the best stuff I&#x27;ve come across for anything skin related was the natural Shea butter they sell raw at the Del Mar Fair in San Diego County.</li>
            <li> i just got this product in the mail today. it looks very suspicious to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;butter - the consistency is mushy and some of it is hard. also the color varies from bright yellow to ivory, which also looks unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;packaging - dirty plastic bag that is poorly sealed. also there is a small dirty sticker that is barely attached to the bag and it says \\&quot;100% organic west african shea butter\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the worst product ever i got from amazon</li>
            <li> Used it for face and hand creams.&lt;br /&gt;Very good quality, smells well.&lt;br /&gt;Color is light yellow. Looks fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have purchased 100% Shea butter and I really like what it does for my skin especially on those dry cold winter days. It does have a strong nutty smell which I don&#x27;t care for but it didn&#x27;t bother my husbands sensitive nose so that made it easier to ignore. During the day I put it on after a nice warm shower which helps melt on my skin easier, I actually found myself enjoying it like a mini message :). At night I like to rub it on slowly as I get ready for bed, it&#x27;s great to use on your feet, then put some cozy socks, don&#x27;t  forget your hands :) I have even used it as a primer for some of my drier eyeshadows. I highly recommend this oh and if you fake tan like myself it give it an extra yellow under tone that looks great! Did I mention it protects from those harsh uv rays.</li>
            <li> Item arrived mostly safe, however, the plastic tub it arrived in made it clear that the package had been dropped, bumped around, and had heavier things on top of it.  plastic tub was broken, but since i keep this in a cool dry place, the shea has stayed intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a steal on amazon.  My local holistic store has started carrying this same brand, and they want triple the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t worked with real shea before, please note this stuff is as hard as a rock.  You&#x27;ll want to warm it up before using it, or cut/scoop pieces with a warm spoon/knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for skin, and if you use a small piece you can swipe it across your hair to tame fly-aways!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for my cuticles.  I have the nastiest, ugliest cuticles in the world.  This stuff work miracle with them.  Its the only thing Ive really found that can bring any moisture to my cuticles and keep them smoothed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in my order because it was hard chunks which did not completely fill the container.  It was full of air pockets due to the hard shea was not able to pack in. I have rec&#x27;d some from other sources that was soft and fully packed in container.  Plus the shipping was outrageous &amp; way more than my order.  I won&#x27;t order from there again.</li>
            <li> gritty...don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sending this back.  It&#x27;s advertised as 16 oz., but mine only weighed 13.1 oz. in the packaging.  Also, this shea butter is a funky yellow color.  Other shea butters I&#x27;ve had experience with are more of a cream color.  This is not what I ordered and definitely not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have used organic West African Shea Butter before from other vendors and it was never this yellow. I had to melt the Shea Butter then strain out impurities before using it for my soap. The yellow color remained in my bars so that colors did not remain the same (blue color turned into green because of the yellow soap). I would not purchase this Shea Butter again.</li>
            <li> Made a moisturizing bar with this product and it worked great!  Perfect for skin or hair.  Good price for what I got.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed to find out that real Shea butter should be ivory color and not that butterish yellow color I have. I&#x27;m not doubting that the Shea butter I received is not 100%, but the only way to get that yellowish butter color is by dye. I wish that they have stated that on the description. I wanted 100% Shea butter without dyes. Hopefully, the effects of the dye will not affect the usage of this butter.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter has a nice consistency and stays smooth. It is good for making sunscreens and body butter. The fragrance is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I love African Shea Butter.  It keeps my skin moist and not sticky.  I use it as a moisturizer on my face</li>
            <li> Just as I expected, no surprises. I have skin problems and I mix this with a lotion that has shea in it to help my skin. I am glad i found a place to get the pure shea butter at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Nature and Herbs and paid a total of twelve dollars and sixty-one cents including shipping for 16 oz.  Nature and Herbs shipped very promptly, shipment was wrapped in a padded mailer and then a cardboard mailer.  The butter was packed into two 8 oz plastic tubs.  This is my first purchase of shea butter, so I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare it to, but it smelled fresh - vaguely like cocoa butter.  It didn&#x27;t seem rancid at all.  It&#x27;s very thick.  The Amazon product description says it&#x27;s organic, but the label on the container only says \\&quot;100% Pure Africa Shea Butter.\\&quot;  I was willing to pay more for an organic product, but I don&#x27;t think this butter from Nature and Herbs is organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the suspicious part.  The color is a BRIGHT YELLOW.  Natural shea is supposed to be ivory in color.  This means either a root extract has been added to dye the product yellow OR this butter is NOT true shea butter, but rather African butter from a different tree.  So I&#x27;m not sure I have the real deal. I&#x27;m going to have to order from a different seller for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Shea Butter comes from the Karite tree and can be a variety of colors ranging from a slight yellow to an off white. Shea butter is never a bright yellow, the bright yellow butter is actually African butter which comes from an entirely different tree. The most expensive shea butter is East African Shea butter, because the butter is rare.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow me to post links to this information, so just do a google search for \\&quot;Yellow Shea Butter\\&quot; and watch the YouTube video that comes up in the search results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3-21-13: I ordered KAKOSI brand organic shea butter from the seller Icemans Thunder.  This is the real deal.  It was ivory in color and had a slightly different texture from the yellow butter.  It comes sealed in a heavy bag and was nine dollars and ninety five cents with free shipping for 16 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00B86PMC6 KAKOSI 100% Pure Organic Raw Virgin Shea Butter (16oz/1 Pound) Solid/Cream Temperature Dependent]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also find KAKOSI brand organic cocoa butter: [[ASIN:B009XEANGU KAKOSI Organic Cocoa Butter 16oz Bagged Solid/Cream Temperature Dependent]]Organic Raw Virgin Shea Butter (16oz/1 Pound) Solid/Cream Temperature Dependent]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also find KAKOSI brand organic cocoa butter: [[ASIN:B009XEANGU KAKOSI Organic Cocoa Butter 16oz Bagged Solid/Cream Temperature Dependent]]</li>
            <li> Loved this product. It lasted about 2 years for me. I could probably find it cheaper, but the price was good!</li>
            <li> Pure African Shea butter is one of the oldest forms of moisturizing around.  It has been used in Africa for centuries.  PURE RAW shea butter (not shea mixed with olive, mineral, or other oils...sometimes called Body Butters) is good for daily moisturizing of the body, face and hair.  It is good for scarring, soothing stretch marks and a host of other things.  Beware...a lot of retails (online and \\&quot;regular\\&quot; stores) sell low grades of shea butter OR shea mixed with other oils for unreal prices.  This product is what I buy form various African vendors at conventions and small ethnic locations.  It last long and it is real...no fancy packaging, etc.  Just the product in a plain plastic jar.  In addition to this I would recommend African Black Soap the best one is by DUDU Oson (I know I spelled it wrong) but you will know when you find it...it is a bit higher in price here at Amazon...but it is not a bad price.  You can use that for your body AND face and you will notice the difference over time best of all NO CHEMICAL ADDITIVES!!!  Since I have gradually made the switch to NATURAL body products my skin, nail and hair has been great.  NOTE: To get thereal value of this product I recommend order MORE than 1 @ a time to off set the shipping.  Just FYI.  Hope thai helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered shea butter from this seller before, and this batch is definitely NOT like my previous orders. The first two pounds I ordered came to me in bar form, and were very good quality ivory shea butter. My third pound came in a plastic tub and had a grittiness to it but was otherwise fine. THIS FOURTH POUND IS YELLOW! It came in the same plastic tub as the one before it, but now it&#x27;s yellow, not to mention, I think it&#x27;s been whipped!! It&#x27;s very, very soft, and melts and absorbs VERY easily, however, it&#x27;s as yellow as a daisy. The smell is what it should be, but I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m going to use it anyways since my skin isn&#x27;t having any reactions yet, I hope I don&#x27;t regret it later though. I won&#x27;t order from this seller anymore, this shea butter is just not the quality they used to send.</li>
            <li> I do not have much experience with Shea butter.  But, my previous butter (from another seller) was creamy white, basically odor-less, and smooth-melting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a mustard yellow, has a nasty smell to it and is gritty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I assumed it was sold by weight, not by volume.  I got 10.5 ounces by weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned.</li>
            <li> i bought this product a few times in the past from the same vendor. It used to be very good. The shea butter was in Ivory color. The smell is nutty. It made skin very smooth after application. My family liked them. But with the latest 2 orders I placed in Nov-Dec 2013, the shea butter was in bright Yellow color. Not sure if any dye was added or it came from bad nuts. Its texture was sandy like other buyer described. Its smell were different and not pleasant. I really like the ivory ones with my old orders. So I tried twice recently. After receiving 2 consecutive &#x27;bad&#x27; orders, I now wonder if this vendor will keep shipping the same &#x27;yellow&#x27; bags. So I will look around when I need more supply.</li>
            <li> it is a good product with one drawback, no matter how much you blend it,it still has a texture like sand and will not&lt;br /&gt;go on smoothly</li>
            <li> I use a lot of this for my son&#x27;s excema and the quantity was  a lot for the price. It wasn&#x27;t bleached white like the kind you buy in a jar or tube which is even better knowing it&#x27;s not chemically altered. Works great on super sensitive skin. It comes in a plastic bag so it helps if you have jar you can store it in as it is too thick for a squeeze bottle. Makes my skin more youthful looking too.</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I give them  2 stars since it shipped with amazon prime 2 day shipping. However this isn&#x27;t 100% ORGANIC shea butter. For starters the color isn&#x27;t as shown on the pictures a tanish white color. But the top was a deep yellow the middle was the tan color and the bottom again with the deep yellow. Shea butter doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;swirl\\&quot; of different colors. I always order mine from coastal scents and have never had an odd multi-color shea. I returned all 3 and will not order again.</li>
            <li> I really liked the purity and quality of this product. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> I am a novice soaper.  I live in a very rural area and could not find shea butter around.  So I took a chance and ordered this.  So far the product feels great just being rubbed into my skin.  But I have to tell you the thing I was most impressed with was the price and the service.  Other places I found on line were charging 2x as much for 1/2 the amount.  And the s/h were outrageous on the others.  I was told it would be available to ship after 4/20, but thanks to  GREAT customer service, I received it on 4/18.  4 days after I placed the order.  I promptly re-ordered so I will have plenty on hand.    If you want good pricing and good service and good product, this is the place to go.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get a solid answer of what &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; raw shea butter is supposed to look and smell like, some say yellow some say off white, some say strong smell some say none. But even if this stuff isn&#x27;t pure, its super moisturizing. Like I have had people ask to touch my skin again after shaking hands or brushing against them. That plus the price point makes this an awesome product!</li>
            <li> I have been using it as skin cream so far, no greasy feeling, the skin absorbs it well and it has no offensive odor. Really like it!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it to make home made shaving cream, but have not accomplished that yet, I think it will work well though.</li>
            <li> I do not have a reference point, as I never used unrefined shea butter before.  This product has rather faint tobacco smell and it is bright yellow, which, as I understand, suggests that something was added to it. Also, it is not certified by ASBI or any other organization, which leaves some doubts regarding authenticity.  It does not absorb into skin quickly, but seems to be a good emollient.  I use it on my feet and put on socks overnight - they are stained with dark spots in the morning.  Is it the way it&#x27;s supposed to be?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE.  I purchased shea butter from an ASBI-certified supplier.  Upon comparing the two products, it seems that there is definitely shea butter in the product that is being reviewed. The smell is the same as the ASBI-certified product. However, it is either not Grade A butter, or it is past the expiration date, or maybe it was reheated many times.  It is very grainy [which may be due to reheatings], takes much longer to melt when rubbed between the palms, and longer to absorb into skin than the ASBI-certified product.  It may also be mixed with some oil, because it is oilier than the ASBI-certified product, and its color is bright yellow, not ivory.</li>
            <li> I really love this. I&#x27;ll have it for a long time, and I use it for everything. I&#x27;m an actor in a very physically demanding play, performing barefoot, and my feet love being nourished before and after each show. I also use the shea butter on my lips to prevent chapping, and sometimes at night, I use it as a night cream before going to bed. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered quickly and was well packaged. When melted, it was not grainy at all. Slight &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; scent, but that&#x27;s to be expected with unrefined shea. Price was great and product performed well. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have never had/used pure Shea Butter before, but like this in a lotion recipe I made.  Good price, too.</li>
            <li> Nice lemony color, good smell, easy to use. Good packaging, also! Shipped and received as expected. All in all, great value.</li>
            <li> Great product for hair, but it has a strong odor, you will have to mix this with another butter, or just get the ivory shea, which has less of a smell.</li>
            <li> A wonderful experience and good to know I&#x27;m not putting chemical additives on my skin.  This butter works better than any expensive lotion on the market.  I love the smell; very natural, sweet and calming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this shea butter in my homemade body butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I have 4b hair, Your typical african coily hair. I use this in conjunction with jojoba oil and my hair is softer and shinier. Heat the butter and use about a teaspoon and a half of jojoba oil. Mix it up. I really cant tell the difference between \\&quot;real\\&quot; and fake butter but I have been ordering shea butter online for years and its the only thing that has gotten my hair too grow. I  was using Ultra Sheen, Pink Lotion, stuff called Super Grow, Doctor Miracle, Castor Oil and my hair didnt grow. Often it fell out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use Organix Moisture Milk shampoo and no conditioner. (for my hair only! You may want a conditioner) Or sometimes I use Mane and Tail deep conditioner maybe once a month. I noticed for my hair, when I use a conditioner, my hair shrinks to the scalp unlike when just shampooing my hair is a bit looser. While wet, i do a two strand twist and moisturize with the butter and jojoba oil. In the morning, my hair is still a lil damp but its shiny and so soft. After a week, my hair is still soft.</li>
            <li> I have ordered Shea butter a few times. This is a bit different consistency. Still feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> Several times I have ordered this product, and it works well. I have used it both by itself as well as with other oils such as organic argan oil and organic grapeseed oil. It is soothing to the skin. Besides, I have even used it by itself on my hair.  I liked the results very much.  I think that it is a good idea to use 100% Organic West African Shea Butter in combination with a favorite oil of yours. This way you double the goodness!</li>
            <li> Great quality. Shea butter is clean and quite soft!  Will work great in my homemade cosmetics!  Can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Used this for a home-made pomade recipe, which turned out fantastic!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is great! I store it in a dry cool dark place and it still is smelling good!  I would recommend this product if you were going to use over a period of couple months!  Just checked it again, NO RANCID smell! Yes!</li>
            <li> Product is rich and creamy. The Shea arrived very quickly. I will defiantly be ordering this product again for future lotions.</li>
            <li> I have always believed this was unadulterated shea butter,however,I have noticed  that it has some grainy substance in it and wondering if really it is as unadulterated as I had believed.I also recently got some real shea butter straight from west Africa and noted that it was so smooth when being applied and did not have this grainy sandy stuff that this product has.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways,if you have no other option of getting real straight from the source shea butter, this would be a good 2nd!</li>
            <li> its authentic.. generic... but good.. i have purchased it before offline. i got 2  deli type plastic containers of 8 oz</li>
            <li> I love this products it helps fade away dark areas and stretch marks its really works well. I love the smell could be over powering for people that don&#x27;t like the smell I love it so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. You can use it on anything hair and skin.</li>
            <li> use it in home made lip balm and lotion.  feels great as alone product.</li>
            <li> 2nd purchase, good quality and great for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely good moisturiser but it&#x27;s smell is waxy.  A little of this goes a long way.  My skin was cracking and this helped heal it.  The wrap for this was uninteresting so I had to find other containers for it.  Good value for all the product I received.</li>
            <li> I make homemade body products and this shae butter is the icing on the cake every time. It works very well as a stand alone product or incorporated in your bath and body products. Works especially well for eczema.</li>
            <li> This butter is wonderful.  I&#x27;ve used it on everything.  It has a bit of an fragrance, not much - but the moisture is amazing. It&#x27;s great for whole body - and is definitely a 24 hour moisturizer.  Great for lying in the sun - great for right after a bath.  It took a while to come in -- but it was worth the wait.  It looks odd, but don&#x27;t let that detract you- it&#x27;s the real deal.  Fantastic to put on hands and feet (with socks and gloves) before bed.  I loved it.  Used it all ---</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the price, have made diaper rash cream and hand lotion from it. Great quality shea butter. Has great, healing results on the skin.</li>
            <li> tHIS PRODUCT USEFUL IN RELIEVING SKIN DRYNESS AROUND CUTICLES AND THE PRICE IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE SAME PRODUCT YOU CAN PURCHASE FROM BOTIQUES IN THE FANCY BOTTLES.</li>
            <li> This product worked great on a rash I had.  I had the rash for a few months.  I used everything and now with the Shea Butter, gone in 4 days.  I am using it as a mixture with Olive Oil and Aloe before bed.  Love the soft skin in the morning.</li>
            <li> Originally purchased Raw Shae Butter for use in homemade deodorant, but now use it as a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I have had dried cracked feet for year, and lotion never seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of using Raw Shae Butter, daily, the difference is AMAZING!!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> This was my first order of Shea Butter.  It does have an odor, but I was aware it would.  It&#x27;s not that strong of an odor, really. I slathered this product on my hands for awhile (you don&#x27;t need much!) and rubbed it in for a good moisturizing, but when I washed my hands afterward I didn&#x27;t think the product had much of a lasting effect on my hands.  I want to mix it with lanolin to see if the reviews I&#x27;ve read work. I&#x27;ve also heard essential oils helped with the odor - but there are so many to choose from at the health food store I can&#x27;t decide which scent I&#x27;d like best.</li>
            <li> this stuff is really raw, works well but isn&#x27;t very clean. will only both you if you&#x27;re worried about seeing little specks in it</li>
            <li> I purchased this shea butter in March of 2012. I still have plenty left. I have been using it to make diaper rash ointment for my son. I combine coconut oil and shea butter and use this with every diaper change to prevent diaper rash. I also use it as a lotion to keep his body moisturized. I am very happy with this product. I think that it helps. I am thankful for an organic product at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> This product is pure and organic. The packaging was great. It was also a great price! Thank you! I cant wait to make product out of this!</li>
