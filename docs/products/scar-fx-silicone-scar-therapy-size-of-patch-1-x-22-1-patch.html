    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The surgeon was so impressed that he brought all of the nurses in to look at how the scar has healed and told them what I used.  </li>
            <li>Its best used as a nightly regimen, unless you&#x27;re lying around at home during the day.</li>
            <li>The areas with the Scar FX strip during the day seem to be healing best, plus the scars are not being irritated all day since the silicone is protecting it from rubs &amp; bumps.      </li>
            <li>All in all, this is a very good product</li>
            <li>but as for now I am a VERY VERY satisfied customer!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for the best part of a month and love it!  </li>
            <li>My Dr told me that this was a GREAT Product and he can tell that it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>I liked it best for my tummy tuck scar.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Scar FX is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Works great at flattening and smoothing your scar</li>
            <li>Great choice to fix the texture and smoothness of your scar.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because of all the good reviews that it had.</li>
            <li>I used this strips after my tummy tuck procedure and it was good</li>
            <li>Good price on Amazon</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how my incision looks after the reccomended 12 or more weeks!  </li>
            <li>and I am very glad that this strip stays in place on its own.      </li>
            <li>Now if you&#x27;re looking for a miracle, you need to basically use more than just this product, but this is definitely a good investment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong, so it feels supportive.</li>
            <li>It makes it very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I plan on using this for 3 more weeks per my surgeon&#x27;s advice.  </li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s a more curved incision because I don&#x27;t have an issue.  </li>
            <li>I have to say though this is on top of creams and your genetic healing genes.  </li>
            <li>I do wish the product came with more guidance on this.</li>
            <li>on top of that it is always bunching up when you move, so unless you stand in one spot and not move..</li>
            <li>KEEPING IT CLEAN!</li>
            <li>it sticks just fine</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t scar much and I heal fast, but this product is Great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li>but well worth the price!</li>
            <li>Much more cost effective and they stay on for about a week with regular washings (1x/day).</li>
            <li>Good luck, as you&#x27;ve probably had trouble of your own if you are researching these products.</li>
            <li>lift scars and it was ok at first, but quickly (one week)</li>
            <li>Ok... I haven&#x27;t left many reviews on amazon, although I am frequent customer, but I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li>I was amazed at how quickly it flattened out the scar.  </li>
            <li>and it helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m not convinced the scar has healed any more quickly using this than it would have under normal circumstances.</li>
            <li>This is my very first review on Amazon, So here goes..</li>
            <li>Use hot water and soap to keep it clean and when not wearing it, put it somewhere</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Also it got kind of gross and gummy.</li>
            <li>ended up buying a silicone cream and silicone strips from HEB (grocery store) for $17 for a month worth.</li>
            <li>The scar is still visible but has faded, but the most important thing is that it is completely flat.  </li>
            <li>I have two very large scars on both my arms.</li>
            <li>The product length is perfect with a little bit extra you can trim.  </li>
            <li>I notice that once it starts to lose stickiness of you wash it with warm water and soap and let it air dry</li>
            <li>This was my second favorite for every day wear.</li>
            <li>Going out with this and moving about a lot could easily lead to it becoming unstuck from your body - but overall I think adheres comfortably and stays in place (and my scar is not a straight line either).</li>
            <li>In the evening I take a bath and gently peel off the strips, wash in warm soapy water, rinse, and wrap them around a plastic bottle, sticky side down.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>The 22 inch strip was way too much for me</li>
            <li>, I did not see much difference in the color</li>
            <li>I really like this 22\\&quot; silicone strip</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone with longb straight scars to heal or fade.  </li>
            <li>I went and measured her scar and then bought this size so I could cut it into 3 pieces as I read they wear out fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to have extra that I can use when this one wear out.</li>
            <li>Also I would highly recommend using pure coconut oil in the show and bath, I grew up using this stuff</li>
            <li>actually came clean.</li>
            <li>Be prepared to clean it daily if you&#x27;re a man.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still searching for a decent scar fix.</li>
            <li>I can use a lot of it and let it soak in all around the damaged areas and older surgery scars too.    </li>
            <li>It adheres very well and so far has minimized my scar</li>
            <li>This particular size also performed WAY better than some other sizes from the same manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>I couldnt justify the expense for something that I cut to fit as I found that smaller pieces stayed on easier than larger</li>
            <li>I think when I start using it on the other arm I will cover it some how to keep it really clean.</li>
            <li>When I say gentleman beware, I mean that any type of body hair sticks right on, so keep the area you are using in it clean.</li>
            <li>I have seen many mixed reviews on this and was a little worried about buying it.</li>
            <li>Results are supposed to take 4 months or so, but so far it looks like it helps.</li>
            <li>This by far the stupidest thing I have bought for my scars-</li>
            <li>, it stays thicker and sticks longer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried so far, and I have tried a lot of products.  </li>
            <li>I use silicone creams on the areas of the upper scar that I can&#x27;t cover with a straight line.  </li>
            <li>and it is fading my 5 year old&#x27;s scar away.</li>
            <li>I put the strip across mt lower incision in the AM, and cut parts of a second strip on the parts of the upper incision where I can get a straight line, like under my arms.  </li>
            <li>It looks like just 2 small mosquito bites as where my other two incisions healed completely on their own, with only the arnica cream used over it.  </li>
            <li>major gripe with this?</li>
            <li>This silicone strips has completely flattened two 11 inch fasciotomy incisions in only 2 months.  </li>
            <li>and you barely see my scar.  </li>
            <li>First off, wearing it nightly for about 8-9 hours has noticeably helped my scar to become less pronounced.</li>
            <li>it needs to be clean at least once a week.</li>
            <li>Also, I am small, and I was able to cut this in half -</li>
            <li>This fits tummy tuck scars well, but it loses its stickiness rather quickly.  </li>

            <li> I wear it at night (because it&#x27;s the middle of the summer), and when it comes off in the morning, the scar is flat and fading.  </li>
            <li> I just trimmed away the extra and used some on the two little scars from my drains (those have nearly disaapeared in just three days!)  </li>
            <li> This is an expensive product and I expected much more than it delivered.</li>
            <li> Okay so I first used this product back in 2007 after I got a tummytuck to get rid of those nasty stretchmarks after my 2nd child.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it on one arm only because the other arm was still healing.</li>
            <li> The lower line had several infections and busted open a few times.  </li>
            <li> this was after working out and the strip was wet with sweat.  </li>
            <li> The upper line is broken and disjoint and includes several very rough areas that are raised and sore.    </li>
            <li> For the price I put into my surgery, this is not really a major investment and easier and less messy than spreading vitamin E oil on everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> me being Carmel Toned, of course there would be a dark mark after a cut.</li>
            <li> Sadly this didn&#x27;t do anything to help my scar, even though I used it very soon after the surgery, and used it as directed.</li>
            <li> I had stomach surgery and was left with a thick scar.</li>
            <li> so I had to tape it down,</li>
            <li> he might start mentioning it to his other patients!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing the other strips for 3-4 months without noticable results!  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions to a tee, and for long scars it&#x27;s hard to work with.</li>
            <li> After all the scargaurd only last for a week or two if you&#x27;re using it twice per day and that gets Expensive! .</li>
            <li> Scar FX has made some dramatic changes to the color of my scar in only 3 days!  </li>
            <li> All in all, my skin is a mess!    </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure I saw this in the instructions but have also used neosporin scar strips</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item in the past for a surgery scar and again this time for another surgery.  </li>
            <li> These were so hard to keep on your body.</li>
            <li> I wore this everyday for a few months and the scar is very thin.</li>
            <li> all that tape made my skin sensitive :(</li>
            <li> I can however say that having this on helped coat my scar keeping movement of clothing/binder from irritating the scar.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was buying these because they came from the advice of someone who had used them for her arm surgery (just as I had.</li>
            <li> The creams are expensive</li>
            <li> I like to use creams that are not as expensive as silicone in the evening, so</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t get dirty</li>
            <li> but it does get dirty and</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;d avoid wearing anything over it that could shed lint, for example, as this also sticks onto the strip - and things that adhere are difficult/almost impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is just worthless.</li>

            <li> After having surgery, I was told to get Scar Gaurd to begin to heal the lengthy scar that I have. me being Carmel Toned, of course there would be a dark mark after a cut. I had purchased Scar Gaurd for about $27 at my local drugstore but Decided to try this tape for an alternate inbetween. After all the scargaurd only last for a week or two if you&#x27;re using it twice per day and that gets Expensive! . When I wore this tape to a follow up appointment. My Dr told me that this was a GREAT Product and he can tell that it&#x27;s working. I have recommended others who are getting the surgery that I had. It really does work. The only drawback is clining it. you know that sticky stuff when it turns and it&#x27;s a bit gross trying to clean/scrape the gunk off but well worth the price!</li>
            <li> This silicone strips has completely flattened two 11 inch fasciotomy incisions in only 2 months.  The scar is still visible but has faded, but the most important thing is that it is completely flat.  The surgeon was so impressed that he brought all of the nurses in to look at how the scar has healed and told them what I used.  He hadn&#x27;t recommended that I use a silicone strip to assist with the scar, but I have a feeling he might start mentioning it to his other patients!</li>
            <li> I started using this 2.5 weeks after my abdominalplasty.  I was amazed at how quickly it flattened out the scar.  The product length is perfect with a little bit extra you can trim.  It adheres very well and so far has minimized my scar (my c-section scar became keloidal).  I plan on using this for 3 more weeks per my surgeon&#x27;s advice.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have only just started using this product. I can however say that having this on helped coat my scar keeping movement of clothing/binder from irritating the scar.  I&#x27;d recommend it for that. We&#x27;ll see how the scar factor turns out.</li>
            <li> This is my very first review on Amazon, So here goes.. I purchased this product because of all the good reviews that it had. I have two very large scars on both my arms. I have been using it on one arm only because the other arm was still healing. I like the product and I do think that it works. I just wish there was a way to keep cleaner or when you washed it actually came clean. I think when I start using it on the other arm I will cover it some how to keep it really clean.</li>
            <li> Bought this to put over my scar from an abominoplasty last month.  I wear it at night (because it&#x27;s the middle of the summer), and when it comes off in the morning, the scar is flat and fading.  Because my scar is curved, it isn&#x27;t completely self-adhesive - I use medical tape to hold it in place - but I expected that.  I wash it and keep it around a bottle and it&#x27;s holding up well!  Also, I am small, and I was able to cut this in half - I&#x27;m so excited to have extra that I can use when this one wear out.</li>
            <li> Ok... I haven&#x27;t left many reviews on amazon, although I am frequent customer, but I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I had a tummy tuck done back in Novemember of 2010 and started using a medical grade silicone strip that was purchased through my plastic surgeon.  I believe it was Mepilex.  Scar FX has made some dramatic changes to the color of my scar in only 3 days!  I have been wearing the other strips for 3-4 months without noticable results!  I can&#x27;t wait to see how my incision looks after the reccomended 12 or more weeks!  The 22 inch strip was way too much for me and I imagine would be plenty even for a larger woman or a male tummy tuck incision.  I just trimmed away the extra and used some on the two little scars from my drains (those have nearly disaapeared in just three days!)  The ScarFX strips are thicker than the ones provided at my plastic surgeon and it did shift once in the three days I have been using it... this was after working out and the strip was wet with sweat.  I read a couple reviews that stated they have to use tape to get it to stay in place...maybe it&#x27;s a more curved incision because I don&#x27;t have an issue.  I notice that once it starts to lose stickiness of you wash it with warm water and soap and let it air dry it sticks just fine (I&#x27;m not sure I saw this in the instructions but have also used neosporin scar strips and they recommend washing it daily)  Hopefully I get arround to leaving a following up review but as for now I am a VERY VERY satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> I tried just about every silicone scar product I could find. This was my second favorite for every day wear. It&#x27;s very strong, so it feels supportive. I liked it best for my tummy tuck scar. I tried it on my arm lift scars and it was ok at first, but quickly (one week) lost it&#x27;s adhesive quality. I recommend it for tummy tuck scars.</li>
            <li> This fits tummy tuck scars well, but it loses its stickiness rather quickly.  Be prepared to clean it daily if you&#x27;re a man.  Also, I&#x27;m not convinced the scar has healed any more quickly using this than it would have under normal circumstances.</li>
            <li> Sadly this didn&#x27;t do anything to help my scar, even though I used it very soon after the surgery, and used it as directed. Also it got kind of gross and gummy.</li>
            <li> Okay so I first used this product back in 2007 after I got a tummytuck to get rid of those nasty stretchmarks after my 2nd child.  My plastic surgeon recommended this to me it was about 10 dollars cheaper buying it from their office.  I used it faithfully till I basically lost it..lol Well it&#x27;s years later and you barely see my scar.  I have to say though this is on top of creams and your genetic healing genes.  I don&#x27;t scar much and I heal fast, but this product is Great and I just purchased another for my incisions from my lip contour on my inner/outer thighs. I use this in combination with my arnica cream and it works well. I am 3 weeks post op and I can wear shorts now.  It looks like just 2 small mosquito bites as where my other two incisions healed completely on their own, with only the arnica cream used over it.  Also I would highly recommend using pure coconut oil in the show and bath, I grew up using this stuff and it helps tremendously.  Now if you&#x27;re looking for a miracle, you need to basically use more than just this product, but this is definitely a good investment.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and it seems to help.  Results are supposed to take 4 months or so, but so far it looks like it helps.</li>
            <li> As with others who brought this item, I intended to help fade a scar (mine runs across my abdominal). First off, wearing it nightly for about 8-9 hours has noticeably helped my scar to become less pronounced. Its best used as a nightly regimen, unless you&#x27;re lying around at home during the day. Going out with this and moving about a lot could easily lead to it becoming unstuck from your body - but overall I think adheres comfortably and stays in place (and my scar is not a straight line either). For the price I put into my surgery, this is not really a major investment and easier and less messy than spreading vitamin E oil on everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My major gripe with this? KEEPING IT CLEAN! When I say gentleman beware, I mean that any type of body hair sticks right on, so keep the area you are using in it clean. Also, I&#x27;d avoid wearing anything over it that could shed lint, for example, as this also sticks onto the strip - and things that adhere are difficult/almost impossible to remove. Use hot water and soap to keep it clean and when not wearing it, put it somewhere it won&#x27;t get dirty (some use water bottles, I use a cleaned section of my tub wall). I do wish the product came with more guidance on this.</li>
            <li> Scar FX is a great product.  I have been using it for about 4 weeks now.  I have seen improvement in my scars healing.  It&#x27;s easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li> This by far the stupidest thing I have bought for my scars- I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is just worthless. It doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin so I had to tape it down, all that tape made my skin sensitive :( on top of that it is always bunching up when you move, so unless you stand in one spot and not move.. This product is trash!</li>
            <li> This is an expensive product and I expected much more than it delivered. I followed the directions to a tee, and for long scars it&#x27;s hard to work with. I&#x27;m still searching for a decent scar fix.</li>
            <li> These were so hard to keep on your body. Unfortunately I was buying these because they came from the advice of someone who had used them for her arm surgery (just as I had. same doctor and everything (same scar placement)) but they just didnt stay on. I couldnt justify the expense for something that I cut to fit as I found that smaller pieces stayed on easier than larger/longer pieces. Either way they just didnt stay on. So I tried using the sticky part of bandaids to keep it on, I tried paper tape, I tried regular medical tape... all 3 of which hurt my skin. I got irritations from the band aid adhesive that created mini looking boils. Folks, avoid that.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying a silicone cream and silicone strips from HEB (grocery store) for $17 for a month worth. Much more cost effective and they stay on for about a week with regular washings (1x/day).</li>
            <li> This helps with the feel of your scar.  It makes it very smooth.  My scar is still red (I have medium tone/tan  &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; skin) and will only fade with time.  I have purchased this item in the past for a surgery scar and again this time for another surgery.  Works great at flattening and smoothing your scar, I did not see much difference in the color my scar - I think only time will fade that. Great choice to fix the texture and smoothness of your scar.</li>
            <li> I had surgery which left scars from hip to hip and armpit to arm pit.  The lower line had several infections and busted open a few times.  The upper line is broken and disjoint and includes several very rough areas that are raised and sore.    All in all, my skin is a mess!    I really like this 22\\&quot; silicone strip, it stays thicker and sticks longer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried so far, and I have tried a lot of products.  This particular size also performed WAY better than some other sizes from the same manufacturer.  And at these prices, I need to have these strips last a while.  And I don&#x27;t want anymore tape on my skin, I was bandaged for weeks (maybe months!) and I am very glad that this strip stays in place on its own.      I put the strip across mt lower incision in the AM, and cut parts of a second strip on the parts of the upper incision where I can get a straight line, like under my arms.  I use silicone creams on the areas of the upper scar that I can&#x27;t cover with a straight line.  The creams are expensive so I use sparingly.    In the evening I take a bath and gently peel off the strips, wash in warm soapy water, rinse, and wrap them around a plastic bottle, sticky side down.  In the evening I use various scar and stratch mark creams over night.  I like to use creams that are not as expensive as silicone in the evening, so I can use a lot of it and let it soak in all around the damaged areas and older surgery scars too.    The areas with the Scar FX strip during the day seem to be healing best, plus the scars are not being irritated all day since the silicone is protecting it from rubs &amp; bumps.      All in all, this is a very good product and I would recommend it to anyone with longb straight scars to heal or fade.  Good luck, as you&#x27;ve probably had trouble of your own if you are researching these products.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the best part of a month and love it!  it can be taken off and washed and reapplied.</li>
            <li> I used this strips after my tummy tuck procedure and it was good but it does get dirty and it needs to be clean at least once a week.</li>
            <li> I had stomach surgery and was left with a thick scar. I wore this everyday for a few months and the scar is very thin. Good price on Amazon</li>
            <li> I have seen many mixed reviews on this and was a little worried about buying it. i bought it anyways and it is fading my 5 year old&#x27;s scar away. I went and measured her scar and then bought this size so I could cut it into 3 pieces as I read they wear out fast. We rotate them to get longer use out of them. Some nights it does fall off then we are left searching her bed for it.</li>
