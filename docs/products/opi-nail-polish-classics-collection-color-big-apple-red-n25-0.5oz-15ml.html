            <li>Perfect true vibrant red!</li>
            <li>I am never disappointed with OPI nail enamels.  </li>
            <li>What a rich color.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced, quick service, completely satisfied</li>
            <li>It is like a bright red apple...and O.P.I nail polishes it</li>
            <li>The photo shows this having a touch more orange in the color than it really does.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the polish thanks.</li>
            <li>This is without a doubt the most gorgeous red nail polish I have every used and the OPI name holds up its high standards with its wearability.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I question if this is real OPI because I don&#x27;t own any that chips this fast.</li>
            <li>Good product and stays on for a long time...</li>
            <li>It is red and sexy!  </li>
            <li>What fun.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>Great Polish- usually used by spas</li>
            <li>OPI is the only nail polish that stays on for more than 3 days.</li>
            <li>I started wearing red for the first time this summer and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>This is a quality product that never fails to satisfy.  </li>
            <li>Love red.</li>
            <li>OH YES MY FAVORITE RED</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t think of using any other kind.</li>
            <li>also the color was much darker than in the picture, I got it because I wanted a light red</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>fast hip.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have blue, golden, or orange undertones, it&#x27;s simply a solid bright red.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>and I got my items fast</li>
            <li>The shipping was good and it arrived prior to the expected date.</li>
            <li>I am an OPI frequent buyer, and this is my first time buying OPI from Amazon.</li>
            <li>so far i found to work well with water marble nails (having to drop in more than usual drops at a time so that it doesn&#x27;t turn pink in water) love it!</li>
            <li>This color is so vibrant and just the shade I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Very pretty shade off red.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rich red, also - it&#x27;s almost opaque with one coat &amp; completely with two.  </li>
            <li>and it was brand new</li>
            <li>It definitely lives up to the typical OPI top quality.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re after the 1950&#x27;s classic red nail color, this is the color for you.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I usually love opi nail polish because it doesn&#x27;t get thick and clumpy but when I used this the first time it started to get thick and stringy.</li>

            <li> Beautiful BRIGHT red! I will wear this all summer!</li>
            <li> OPI has always been a quality polish. Big Apple Red is the &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; timeless red color if that is what you&#x27;re looking for. It&#x27;s slightly darker in person than in the photograph. The photo shows this having a touch more orange in the color than it really does. If you&#x27;re after the 1950&#x27;s classic red nail color, this is the color for you.OPI as a brand is always a good choice with no bubbling and a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> It is red and sexy!  I love it abnd will keep some on hand.  My sweetie also approves!  What fun.</li>
            <li> color is slightly darker than shown but i like it even more.lots of compliments on this color and i just put it on today!</li>

            <li> Good product and stays on for a long time...no chipping. But could purchase at your local store.</li>
            <li> A girls best friend. Lol</li>

            <li> This is without a doubt the most gorgeous red nail polish I have every used and the OPI name holds up its high standards with its wearability. It is my &#x27;go-to&#x27; color.</li>
            <li> fast hip. great color</li>
            <li> Beautiful red nail polish. OPI is the only nail polish that stays on for more than 3 days. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Chips very quickly and easily. I am an OPI frequent buyer, and this is my first time buying OPI from Amazon. I question if this is real OPI because I don&#x27;t own any that chips this fast. I will not order OPI through amazon again.</li>
            <li> only red so far i found to work well with water marble nails (having to drop in more than usual drops at a time so that it doesn&#x27;t turn pink in water) love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this color. I started wearing red for the first time this summer and fell in love with it. I picked this color at the salon and wanted to purchase a bottle but they only had one left in stock so they wouldn&#x27;t sell it :(....so I ordered from Amazon. Beautiful color...not too bright...definitely a must have!!!</li>
            <li> The nail polish start chipping after 24 hours which is surprising for an OPI product.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful true red.  It&#x27;s a rich red, also - it&#x27;s almost opaque with one coat &amp; completely with two.

            <li> This is a beautiful color, and OPI still makes the best nail polish on the market.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> What is there to say...I just love this color. It is like a bright red apple...and O.P.I nail polishes it the best there is on the market. They hold up well above others. Great on dry time..Just always be sure to use a good bottom and top coat. O.P.I is the only polish that will last me for up to two weeks without chipping.</li>
