            <li>I will not be purchasing the triple conditioner or the butter as I didn&#x27;t feel they delivered outstanding results compared to my aussie line but the shampoo and the mask most definitely my #1 Natural Staple Shampoo/Conditioner!</li>
            <li>but I think I love this more as it is natural</li>
            <li>Pretty much everything was wonderful, but this deep conditioner blew me away.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, leaves hair extremely soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>This stuff work,  i find in order to see the magic of this product, for me, I have to leave it in for at least four to five hours but the results for me are great,</li>
            <li>I immediately fell in love with the shampoo as my hair was super soft after rinsing and &amp;#34;remained&amp;#34; that way even after deep conditioning with the honey mask and more importantly after &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too pricey and you get a lot for your moneys worth.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and feel healthy.</li>

            <li>It really softens my hair.  </li>
            <li>Many conditioners I purchase are either too heavy, or only sit on top of my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair feels really moisturized</li>
            <li>It also softening my hands, really soft.&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with this product.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a big thing because I haven&#x27;t been able to find a natural line yet</li>
            <li>I still have a good bit left from the sample pack and don&#x27;t see me having to repurchase for a while however the honey mask I will definitely need to repurchase as it was not enough</li>
            <li>I have loved the entire line since trying it a few months ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I like that the silicone is near the bottom of</li>
            <li>And it leaves my hair soft and manageable for days after treating it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m six months into my transition to natural hair and was looking for products that work on both textures of my hair.</li>
            <li>This product makes my natural hair easier to detangle and comb through.</li>
            <li>AND MADE IT SOOOO SOFT.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Natural&#x27; ....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Anything but Natural&#x27;, and leave God out of it.</li>
            <li>At least they are honest enough to TELL me</li>
            <li>I needed to add some silicone back in my hair regimen due to the silicone free products not taming or adding shine to my 4b/4c texture of natural hair ..</li>
            <li>But its so close to the bottom that there is barely any there.</li>
            <li>I think this DC reaches its full potential when used with other products from the line, so it may be worth it to buy at least the shampoo and conditioner that are directed for use before this product.</li>
            <li>This hair mask left my hair feeling SUPER SOFT and with very few tangles.</li>

            <li> This product give my hair &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34;.  In other words it keeps my hair style looking neat (I keep my hair in braids) with little or no frizz.</li>
            <li> I am a black woman with 4a/4b hair and I&#x27;ve tried many products. This has to be my most FAVORITE hair mask. It softens, detangles, and automatically defines my curls with ease. It&#x27;s also all natural ingredients so that&#x27;s a plus. I recommend this everywhere I go. You will not be disappointed with this. I promise you.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot honestly .. I needed to add some silicone back in my hair regimen due to the silicone free products not taming or adding shine to my 4b/4c texture of natural hair .. I like that the silicone is near the bottom of the ingredient list cause that means thus product isn&#x27;t over saturated with it .. But anyway I was not expecting to like this but I do after using it. My hair looks, feels, and smells great .. I got mine from Target for $17.99 and will buy again ☺</li>
            <li> I purchased this product alone after hearing the buzz about it on Instagram and reading a ton of great reviews on it. I had never tried a TGIN product before. The day it arrived, I washed my hair with Creme of Nature shampoo and then applied it. When I was applying it and after I had rinsed it out, I had no idea what everyone was talking about - my hair felt no different. If anything, it felt drier than it had before applying. I didn&#x27;t want to completely give up on this product, so I purchased the rest of the TGIN line (minus the serum) to see if that made a difference in the product&#x27;s performance. The rest of the line arrived today and I immediately got started. I shampooed and conditioned with the TGIN shampoo and conditioner, then applied the mask. OH MY GOSH. Pretty much everything was wonderful, but this deep conditioner blew me away. My hair had wonderful slip, was moisturized and my curls were popping when I rinsed it out. I finally understood what everyone else was boasting about! I think this DC reaches its full potential when used with other products from the line, so it may be worth it to buy at least the shampoo and conditioner that are directed for use before this product. Will definitely be repurchasing this and every other product from this line I have tried.</li>
            <li> I really love how this product makes it so easy for me to detangle my hair. Lots of slip, which is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I finally found a conditioner that works for my hair type(kinky, curly, and THICK)! I can comb through my hair without having this big hair ball afterward! And it leaves my hair soft and manageable for days after treating it. I know others will have different experiences because everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but if your still experimenting with your hair care products, I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I&#x27;m so upset that I used the last of it today; I&#x27;ll definitely be getting another jar asap!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It really softens my hair.  I use it as a deep conditioner underneath the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Ok this is some good stuff my hair was so soft ......love it ...&amp; wait I placed my order &amp; 30mins later I got a email saying your order has ship omg I love these people &amp; the packing was well done &amp;  3 days I had them in my hands😀 It can&#x27;t get no better then that</li>
            <li> Excellent deep conditioner for a curly/coily girl! Thank TGIN</li>
            <li> Love it...love the smell and the results! TGIN is the best...I have loved the entire line since trying it a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Helps with dry hair that is breaking..</li>
            <li> Handsdown aside from the Aussie moist this is the best conditioner I have ever used in my 3 years of being natural!  I got this line about 3 months ago from a friend who gave me a sample pack which contained shampoo, conditioner, honey mask and butter.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything as I&#x27;ve tried so many products so I was literally shocked with my results after first time use.  I prepooed and then used the shampoo followed by the honey mask as my deep conditioner.  I immediately fell in love with the shampoo as my hair was super soft after rinsing and &amp;#34;remained&amp;#34; that way even after deep conditioning with the honey mask and more importantly after &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34;! I tried the butter and it was okay and I also tried the triple moist conditioner and it too was okay.  I left off using these to try out the aussie moist line which I love but I wanted to switch it up for the next several months so now I went back to this line and I experienced the same results and realize why I love this product so much.  I love my aussie line as it works just the same and it&#x27;s cost effective but I think I love this more as it is natural and that&#x27;s a big thing because I haven&#x27;t been able to find a natural line yet that delivers the type of results I get with TGIN.  Also a little goes a lllonnggg way especially with the shampoo!  I still have a good bit left from the sample pack and don&#x27;t see me having to repurchase for a while however the honey mask I will definitely need to repurchase as it was not enough and thankfully my friend gave me a good amount of hers so I have a little to last me  until I can get another bottle.  I will not be purchasing the triple conditioner or the butter as I didn&#x27;t feel they delivered outstanding results compared to my aussie line but the shampoo and the mask most definitely my #1 Natural Staple Shampoo/Conditioner!</li>
            <li> Best deep conditioning hair mask ever. It&#x27;s not too pricey and you get a lot for your moneys worth. Love this stuff. Staple product.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, leaves hair extremely soft and manageable.  Great hair product line!  A little goes a long way with this product!</li>
            <li> just finished using tgin honey hair mask and i am extremely disappointed. smell - it smells like shea butter mix with cherry cool-aid. the consistency of the product is thin. my hair is damp and feels dry not soft as it claims. it does add a little shine but there is a dry starchy feeling to my hair. will never buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have thick, low porosity hair, so it is very difficult to find a good conditioner that works for me. Many conditioners I purchase are either too heavy, or only sit on top of my hair. But, this is perfect. It has great slip, and leaves my hair soft, moisturized, and easy to manage. For an extra boost I add in more honey. Yes, it has dimethicone, but its the second to last ingredient. This would be a problem IF the dimethicone was in the top five ingredients. But its so close to the bottom that there is barely any there. And, since dimethicine clings tightly to hair, it can even be beneficial for those who struggle to retain moisture, or who live in cold areas (like me.)</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner. It works as expected. My hair feels really moisturized</li>
            <li> This stuff work,  i find in order to see the magic of this product, for me, I have to leave it in for at least four to five hours but the results for me are great,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m six months into my transition to natural hair and was looking for products that work on both textures of my hair. I used this along with the other 4 products in the tgin line and loved it. This hair mask left my hair feeling SUPER SOFT and with very few tangles. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> This product makes my natural hair easier to detangle and comb through. I put it on my hair, scalp and edges then comb it through and put on a conditioner cap. I then go under the dryer for 20 minutes and rinse. My hair is soft and feel healthy.</li>
            <li> It is AMAZING!!! I LOVE IT. IT CONDITIONS MY HAIR WONDERFULLY AND MADE IT SOOOO SOFT. It moisturizes also which is a must for women of color. It also softening my hands, really soft.&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with this product.</li>
            <li> ...was going to try this until i saw DIMETHICONE in the ingredients! .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am insulted that this this silicone based product that is man-made in a laboratory is being sold in a product by a company called &#x27;Thank God It&#x27;s Natural&#x27; ....maybe they should consider changing their name to &#x27;It&#x27;s Anything but Natural&#x27;, and leave God out of it. This way they won&#x27;t have to keep watching for the lightening ...Disappointed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will save my $14.99 +$4.49 s&amp;h, run over to the local drugstore and purchase the largest tub of Petroleum jelly for a fraction of the price. At least they are honest enough to TELL me it&#x27;s gasoline I&#x27;m buying.</li>
