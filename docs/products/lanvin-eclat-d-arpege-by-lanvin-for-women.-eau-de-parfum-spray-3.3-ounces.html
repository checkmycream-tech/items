            <li>Unfortunately, love the scent</li>
            <li>, so you have to use it more than once a day.</li>
            <li>Always a favorite.  </li>
            <li>Sophisticated.  </li>
            <li>I am prone to headaches and love the fact that I can wear this perfume without triggering a headache.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love it...</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume before it is my favorite scent</li>
            <li>Like a perfect leasure day ful of fun, shopping, delicious food and fruits, while feeling pretty and fresh and young.</li>
            <li>Received this item which I was very excited about using.</li>
            <li>very cool case that it comes in.</li>
            <li>Most light perfumes get \\&quot;sweeter\\&quot; on my skin and this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>, she loved it very much&lt;</li>
            <li>and I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li>Must buy for anyone who is a Lanvin fan and likes strong fragrances.</li>
            <li>But it is a simple yet attractive color and design.</li>
            <li>Such a great, unpretentious smell .</li>
            <li>Clean, light lemony smell.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for giving a special gift for my wife but it is terrible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the fragance and at very affodable price.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I even like to fall asleep with it on.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>A new favorite for both of us.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a fake!</li>
            <li>I thought this place sells only good and real things.</li>
            <li>All right.</li>
            <li>My mom said, \\&quot;this is my most favorite perfume and I can&#x27;t find it at the department stores and the little fragrance shops,</li>
            <li>Awesome scent and really shocked at the price for the amount, huge value and would order another!</li>
            <li>It is very soft unique scent which gets lots of compliments.  </li>
            <li>Eclat D&#x27; Arpege arrived and was exactly what my wife had asked for.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, but it does not last.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years now and bought it for the first time with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love this perfume, especially in the summer.  </li>
            <li>Smart.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of D&amp;G light blue and this is my runner up!</li>
            <li>i really adore this purfume.</li>
            <li>Real thing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve smelled the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; perfume and I was mislead to believe this item was real.</li>
            <li>wife said it is too much</li>
            <li>wife loves this perfume but it is really terrible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Twice or 3 times I caught her taking the top off the empty perfume and indulging in it&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>well I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the real deal.\\</li>
            <li>Definitely not 100% original.</li>
            <li>Smells nice on my wife, and has a long lasting scent!</li>
            <li>Most definitely not worth the $</li>
            <li>Before I would have to buy it at Nordstrom,but I love that I can buy at amazon for so much less.</li>
            <li>The perfume is a classic.</li>
            <li>Service was simple, quick, on time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an everyday kind of perfume and you can smell it several hours (6-7) after you applied it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this since I bought directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I thought since it eas directly from Amazon</li>
            <li>My mom had this exact empty bottle in her bedroom for 10 years.</li>
            <li>No regrets.  </li>
            <li>Soft scent that last all day long.</li>

            <li> My mom had this exact empty bottle in her bedroom for 10 years.</li>
            <li> No regrets.  </li>
            <li> Soft scent that last all day long.</li>
            <li> Bottle arrived 9 days late from Xmas, but non the less she called me and told me how much she appreciated me getting her this perfume that she searched for on and off for 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my fiance and according to her, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Nor does the scent last as long.</li>
            <li> so i know how long it should last and how it should smell.</li>
            <li> It does not last really long</li>
            <li> For some one that has never worn this fragrance it would be easy to pass a fake off.</li>
            <li> Its a waste of hard earned money and a great disappointment.  </li>
            <li> when I wear this, it is very soft and delicate smelling.</li>
            <li> One negative: it is not very long lasting.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> ( so be careful who you bought it from!</li>
            <li> I finally cared enough to ask the story behind this empty bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my girlfriend to replace her empty bottle and after less than 1 month the fragrance is gone</li>
            <li> is my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> I had less risk, boy was I wrong!.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It must be watered down or tampered with!</li>
            <li> wife and I believe firmly this is not honest goods.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fake, the scent doesn&#x27;t even last five minutes.</li>
            <li> I would rate less than one star if I could!!</li>
            <li> But the one i have bought from amazon.com is fake.</li>
            <li> but I think this time I got fake one, I would spray on me couple of times and by the time I get to where ever that I am going to, you can&#x27;t even smell it on me anymore:</li>
            <li> the product I recieved is fake.</li>
            <li> I am very sad about it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, will not buy again from this seller.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> bought it as a gift. excellent smell, nice product</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, love the scent but it does not last, so you have to use it more than once a day.Hence you go through the bottle at a quicker pace.</li>
            <li> Always a favorite.  Sophisticated.  Smart.</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to this scent.  It is very soft unique scent which gets lots of compliments.  I am prone to headaches and love the fact that I can wear this perfume without triggering a headache.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance....</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!  It smells great.  I am so glad my mom turned me on to it and now I am going to return the favor and buy her a bottle.</li>
            <li> It was in it&#x27;s beautiful packaging, and it delivered the wonderful fragrance that I had been missing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> The perfume is a classic. Not overpowering and I have been using this for 6 years. Love the timelessness of this perfume .</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent. I purchased mine years ago and I got a lot of compliments whenever I wore them, both from men and women. The price here in Amazon is very good too.</li>
            <li> The same smell from the department store! It&#x27;s not a fake! I&#x27;m a fan of D&amp;G light blue and this is my runner up!</li>
            <li> i really adore this purfume.But the one i have bought from amazon.com is fake. I am very sad about it. I thought this place sells only good and real things.Be carefull, dont trust,better go to the store and spend some extra bucks.</li>
            <li> Like a perfect leasure day ful of fun, shopping, delicious food and fruits, while feeling pretty and fresh and young. One negative: it is not very long lasting.</li>
            <li> Eclat D&#x27; Arpege arrived and was exactly what my wife had asked for.  Getting it delivered quickly to my door was great</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my fiance and according to her, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long. After 10 minutes of spraying it, the smell is already gone. I didn&#x27;t expect this since I bought directly from Amazon. Also, the bottom of the bottle is somewhat deformed or out-of-shape.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a must have for all ladies. It is so good, effective even after laundry. All my girlfriends ordered since I got mine, they are all loving it</li>
            <li> 1/3 of the cost that I usually pay and the exact same product!!! Amazing scent!!</li>

            <li> This is one of my favorite scents!  I originally found this in Japan many years ago and have loved it ever since.</li>
            <li> What a scam! I bought this perfume for my girlfriend to replace her empty bottle and after less than 1 month the fragrance is gone and she&#x27;s only used it a few times. It smelled great for the first week. Now she has to spray it on until she&#x27;s dripping in it, and even then it disappears inside an hour! I want my money back.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my friend. It&#x27;s amazing !</li>
            <li> Definitely not 100% original. Smell doesn&#x27;t last</li>

            <li> I love this scent on me. Most light perfumes get \\&quot;sweeter\\&quot; on my skin and this doesn&#x27;t. I bought one for my mother who wears it as her daily scent now. A new favorite for both of us.</li>

            <li> I would rate less than one star if I could!! Received this item which I was very excited about using. I&#x27;ve smelled the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; perfume and I was mislead to believe this item was real. It was packaged up and delivered without any damages. This &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; can not hold a the smell longer than 10 seconds.. It must be watered down or tampered with! Most definitely not worth the $</li>
            <li> Great product! Smells amazing. I get compliments everywhere I go. Soft scent that last all day long. Love it! X</li>
            <li> The seller is nice. All right. Without the problems. The best quality!!!</li>
            <li> Lanvin is great, I love it, I did recommend to my friends who was thinking to buy some, and she got it</li>
            <li> I bought this for giving a special gift for my wife but it is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;My wife said it is too much watery.&lt;br /&gt;Although she sprayed the perfume on her 5 or 6 times, she couldn&#x27;t smell and feel the perfume because of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves this perfume but it is really terrible.&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I believe firmly this is not honest goods.</li>
            <li> Smells nice on my wife, and has a long lasting scent!</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments when I wear this, it is very soft and delicate smelling.</li>
            <li> great perfume fair price..</li>
            <li> If I could have returned the purchase I would have. For some one that has never worn this fragrance it would be easy to pass a fake off. But I have worn the fragrance  and the product I recieved is fake. It is not the same fragrance as purchased at Nordstroms. Nor does the scent last as long. Its a waste of hard earned money and a great disappointment.  I thought since it eas directly from Amazon I had less risk, boy was I wrong!.&lt;br /&gt;content://media/external/file/15384</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fake, the scent doesn&#x27;t even last five minutes. I bought this perfume before it is my favorite scent so i know how long it should last and how it should smell. Very disappointed, will not buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent and really shocked at the price for the amount, huge value and would order another!</li>
            <li> Such a great, unpretentious smell . It&#x27;s an everyday kind of perfume and you can smell it several hours (6-7) after you applied it.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, especially in the summer.  Clean, light lemony smell.  I love it so much that I even like to fall asleep with it on.  It does not last really long is my only complaint.  I bought the lotion as well and layer it to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> My mom had this exact empty bottle in her bedroom for 10 years. Twice or 3 times I caught her taking the top off the empty perfume and indulging in it&#x27;s scent. I finally cared enough to ask the story behind this empty bottle. My mom said, \\&quot;this is my most favorite perfume and I can&#x27;t find it at the department stores and the little fragrance shops, well I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the real deal.\\&quot; With that being said I took a chance with Amazon&#x27;s sellers and got my mom this perfume for 2012 Xmas. Bottle arrived 9 days late from Xmas, but non the less she called me and told me how much she appreciated me getting her this perfume that she searched for on and off for 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> Good light scent, nice price</li>
            <li> This perfume is so nice, it smells very good and it lasts on clothes. I will keep buying this for my wife.</li>
