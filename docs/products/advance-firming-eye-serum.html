            <li>The women I encountered were very charming in a used car salesman way - offering tons of compliments, asking questions, playing up the product, etc.</li>
            <li>I got that great</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>and my eye was line free, flawless and lifted.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy anything, but I walked around the rest of the day, still feeling the tightness and glancing in the mirror to see if it still looked as good.  </li>
            <li>the cream is really good, it absorbs immediately and does not make skin look all shiny.</li>
            <li>a product is so good, there will never be a NO REFUND policy.</li>
            <li>a suave, and very handsome Israeli man at a mall kiosk.</li>
            <li>The store is beautiful but it&#x27;s a HUGE scam.</li>

            <li>They would make it sound like you are getting a great deal</li>
            <li>; Truly, honestly, there was NO difference.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have be so polite to those kind of people.</li>
            <li>told me its price was $800 but for me he would give it to me for $499 because he liked me.</li>
            <li>(no, I&#x27;m in shock) that anyone would spend that kind of money.  </li>
            <li>and I really liked the peel that warms on your face when you add water.  </li>
            <li>Huh!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, will give it an honest try.</li>
            <li>I agree with many of the reviews.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get a chance to use my phone to look them up.</li>
            <li>The devil comes in many forms and that&#x27;s one of them.</li>
            <li>The result was astonishing.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;d know about &amp;#34;looking younger&amp;#34; but the skin does feel better.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $20 for any product anywhere else).</li>
            <li>had 0% chance of ever buying their BS products when I walked in and now I was thoroughly enjoying wasting this guys time knowing</li>
            <li>encountered these products at the Grand Canal Shoppes inside the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>OK, now for how my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>Hey, if you have nothing better to do with your money, go ahead and buy it.</li>
            <li>He went on and on in the most engaging and personable way, going from the $600 to $300</li>
            <li>True scammers!</li>
            <li>The product starts so highly priced that by the time he got to $70 I thought it was a really good deal.</li>
            <li>Fine lines, no improvement at all.</li>
            <li>(his cost, lucky me!)</li>
            <li>I see a huge difference in the fine lines on my skin.</li>
            <li>I was lured in by the offering of a free sample in Vegas.</li>
            <li>I asked him to throw in a face cream for free.</li>
            <li>So I made the mistake of falling for the FREE SAMPLE gimmick that a guy was screaming at me as I walked by the store.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>But I thought hey free sample let&#x27;s see what this store is about.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Never ever fall for their tactics, the discounts and free stuff.</li>
            <li>The price was dropped by 45% and then the salesperson added a free set to the deal if I bought that day.</li>
            <li>how fantastic the results will be yet has no guarantee that you can&#x27;t even return it 15 minutes after you buy</li>
            <li>I will go back to my own scrub, my L&#x27;Occitaine or Boots No. 7 and add a drop of olive oil and call it a day!</li>
            <li>; only good today of course.</li>
            <li>All the reviews about them are true.  </li>
            <li>I was told that these products are a treatment you have to keep using to get full benefits.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;He confirmed the policy and that&#x27;s when I said thanks for the free sample and got out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this was a WANT vs a NEED however; I am am middle age and the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li>totally worth it.</li>
            <li>and before I knew it, she had given me several more samples and then handed me off to another salesperson for a free trial of their products.</li>
            <li>They were right, pushy salespeople....</li>
            <li>right I wasn&#x27;t born yesterday dude</li>
            <li>No more fine line and bags under the eye!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After being run from one part of the store to another and having things put on my hands, face and arms while she threw things in a bag (that she claimed cost $5 normally but was giving me free of charge though I hadn&#x27;t agreed to buy anything), and having a slew of falling prices thrown at me</li>
            <li>I replied that I was looking at reviews of the product but hadn&#x27;t found much (which was true).</li>
            <li>My point is, what you notice first about someone isn&#x27;t their shoes, it&#x27;s their face, yet you&#x27;d spend $30-40 on shoes, would you</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t a fix for people with deep wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>(I know that many of these products \\&quot;do\\&quot; have an initial stinging/irritation, as noted by dermatologists).</li>
            <li>to say, I got suckered by a deep wish to look better.</li>
            <li>If you buy it from a store, you will be high pressed with the aggressive sales that make a used car dealer and a time share salesman look like a mild mannered kitten.  </li>
            <li>Do not make eye contact with them as you pass, or they drag you into the store and start putting cream on your face right on top of your makeup,??</li>
            <li>I was barely aware of purchasing and that I really didn&#x27;t want or need and a woman telling me to keep the receipt for the money-back</li>
            <li>A quick glance at the chemical-filled ingredients list reinforced my suspicions that these products were actually complete garbage (mineral oil in a $40 hand</li>
            <li>The offer went from $599/one bottle to $359/two bottles and a third free, then like $179 for all of it, then to $80</li>
            <li>Since when do damaged products still get a whole display shelf?</li>
            <li>These guys are very well trained in guerrilla sales tactics and are preying on insecurity.</li>
            <li>get up, say thanks &amp; start walking away without waiting for them to respond in any way.</li>
            <li>I would never spend that much money on skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told him I had never heard of their brand &amp; would never spend that much money on skincare.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>I bought the whole set of products in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>Super glad I&#x27;m wise to this crap, or I might have been out $599 for the first line they cast.</li>
            <li>looked in the bag, completely stupefied by what had just happened, and turned around to return it all right then but was told that I would have to do so at the</li>
            <li>Bought this at a casino outlet like many other reviewers.</li>
            <li>I just arrived home, several hours later, and my skin still feels wonderful, but I see no other benefit, i.e. less wrinkles or &#x27;lifting&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I found myself standing outside the store with a bag full of stuff</li>
            <li>I was just in Santa Barbara and was given the full treatment of eye cream, facial peel, serum et al, and the person administering it to me kept asking, &amp;#34;See</li>
            <li>So, the demo: He applied this stuff to the underneath of my eye - and it burned, btw - and then had me cover the treated eye and look at the untreated eye in the mirror, where he proceeded to attempt to point out &amp;#34;lines,&amp;#34; which I am actually lucky enough to not have.</li>
            <li>The Flamingo would do well to evict this high pressure sales gimmick from its lobby.</li>
            <li>I was buying my favorite dead sea cosmetics scrub in Pentagon City Mall, and the price the new salesman wanted was too high.</li>
            <li>So she started throwing in a lot of other free product.</li>
            <li>I kept saying no too expensive and finally,after many discounts, he offered a blemished box for a huge discount $80.00.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t produce promised or expected results any more than a $15 product from your local CVS or Walgreens, yet you can&#x27;t return it at all.</li>
            <li>But they put the cream on first and instantly I could feel my eye lift.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Please be warned all the sales people are trained by the company to use the same exact lines/ruthless tactics/pricing bargain techniques in every location, that border on fraud &amp; harassment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Their products are not worth a penny; now that i tried their products, i wouldn&#x27;t take them even if offered for free.</li>
            <li>and wow!  Price astronomical.  </li>
            <li>I feel completely \\&quot;had\\&quot; by a suave foreigner</li>
            <li>that case all you can do is complain to the FDA about suspicious practices and write an honest poor review as I&#x27;m doing here.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hours later, my mother and I were still scraping off the strange, flaky chunks left on our skin after our &amp;#34;collagen treatment.&amp;#34; A quick search for reviews of these products will yield similar stories to mine, with people purchasing up to $4000 worth of products that are unreturnable.</li>
            <li>Of course after seeing all the online reviews I&#x27;m so glad I stood firm!!</li>
            <li>I ALWAYS walk right by these people but the guy was really not looking.    </li>
            <li>All rules of decent polite public behavior should go out the window when dealing with these crooks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t looked at them in the store, so it wasn&#x27;t until later that I noticed that the samples they offered me were all the exact same product:</li>
            <li>Sigh I wished I had read the reviews before purchasing this item and a few more other items.</li>
            <li>Got sucked into a free sample/demo, despite insisting I was in a rush and would not be purchasing anything - which I reiterated at least five times.</li>
            <li>so I know their general tactics &amp;  WILL NOT be pressured to buy anything ever.</li>
            <li>I see it here and on Ebay for a little less than what they wanted to sell it to me for, but I worry a bit more about freshness or authenticity.</li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;one minute&amp;#34; demo turned into fifteen minutes of super hard selling.</li>
            <li>I was pulled into one of these stores in Vegas, totally not interested in this garbage being sold with high pressure sales tactics.  </li>
            <li>The above reviews of the really hard sell (something I ALWAYS steer clear of) is exactly what happened, by (YES)</li>

            <li> I ALWAYS walk right by these people but the guy was really not looking.    </li>
            <li> All rules of decent polite public behavior should go out the window when dealing with these crooks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t looked at them in the store, so it wasn&#x27;t until later that I noticed that the samples they offered me were all the exact same product:</li>
            <li> Sigh I wished I had read the reviews before purchasing this item and a few more other items.</li>
            <li> Got sucked into a free sample/demo, despite insisting I was in a rush and would not be purchasing anything - which I reiterated at least five times.</li>
            <li> so I know their general tactics &amp;  WILL NOT be pressured to buy anything ever.</li>
            <li> I see it here and on Ebay for a little less than what they wanted to sell it to me for, but I worry a bit more about freshness or authenticity.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;one minute&amp;#34; demo turned into fifteen minutes of super hard selling.</li>
            <li> I was pulled into one of these stores in Vegas, totally not interested in this garbage being sold with high pressure sales tactics.  </li>
            <li> The above reviews of the really hard sell (something I ALWAYS steer clear of) is exactly what happened, by (YES)</li>
            <li> I saw lines and wrinkles diminish right before my eyes within 5 minutes and even the dark circles were less pronounced.  </li>
            <li> night long my face burned, even after washing it several times.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;priestess.&amp;#34; What a bizarre and unsettling interaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> he showed me this gimmicky Gold magnetic mask you had to remove with a magnet no less.</li>
            <li> She asked me more questions about the reviews, stating that the company had a lot of &amp;#34;hackers&amp;#34; if I found anything bad.</li>
            <li> She also mentioned that her colleague, the one who was offended by my search for reviews, was sensitive to my negative energy, since she was a....</li>
            <li> But after a few seconds it became white anf flakey.  </li>
            <li> I said NO thanks</li>
            <li> Once she dropped the $600 price tag for one set of products, we politely said no thanks</li>
            <li> I was curious about the samples they had offered us:</li>
            <li> Anyway, I bought this along with the other eye cream they sell.</li>
            <li> The sales person was extremely pushy and started pointing out my imperfections, which I had no desire whatsoever to hear at the time.</li>
            <li> time I said no he would try to argue about me spending money on other things and trying to catch me unguarded when I had no answer.</li>
            <li> And on my way out, i would hear other salespersons use words like:</li>
            <li> When the salesperson saw what I was doing, she stormed off to the front of the store and engaged her colleagues in a heated conversation in a foreign language.</li>
            <li> Then nobody tells you you can&#x27;t return it if even a few minutes later even if no guarantees of a product that are promised during the hard sale take place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The salesman offered me the product at half price however with the Govt Shutdown and not receiving a paycheck</li>
            <li> He said, &amp;#34;What color shoes am I wearing, without looking?&amp;#34; I said, &amp;#34;black.&amp;#34; He then said, &amp;#34;well, you just guessed that because I&#x27;m wearing black.</li>
            <li> They are much less noticeable now.</li>
            <li> I kept saying no, I see my skin being slightly plumped.  </li>
            <li> Sun spots, slight improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad</li>
            <li> The stuff started itching and irritating my skin 30 mins later</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been harassed by those Dead Sea Mud/cream kiosks at malls</li>
            <li> Seriously, guy, try harder.</li>
            <li> Blackheads on nose, very slight improvement.</li>
            <li> She pushed me into a chair and started applying a variety of things to half my face while talking at a rate of at least 1000 words</li>
            <li> she went into a HARD sell mode.</li>
            <li> well he was trying so hard to con</li>
            <li> (DUH?</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the other eye told the truth</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I tried thermal mask, peeling gel and eye serum, and i just hate myself for actually spending money on them.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s when the game began.</li>
            <li> The demo of the firming eye cream was dramatic.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bargained with them a bit because it is expensive on their site.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was approached by a &amp;#34;hawker&amp;#34; at Miracle Mile Mall in Las Vegas. The store is beautiful but it&#x27;s a HUGE scam. The demo of the firming eye cream was dramatic. But when I told the sales lady I was in town all week and wanted to see how the test application affected my skin overnight and research the product on line she went into a HARD sell mode. Giving me a &amp;#34;special reduced price&amp;#34; only good today of course. I still said no. So she started throwing in a lot of other free product. I asked if she would agree to extend the package to me the next day, she said &amp;#34;No&amp;#34;. Of course after seeing all the online reviews I&#x27;m so glad I stood firm!!</li>
            <li> Bought this at a casino outlet like many other reviewers. They were right, pushy salespeople....but that doesn&#x27;t bother me, it is their job. I can deal with it. Anyway, I bought this along with the other eye cream they sell. I have been using it for 4 weeks - all over my face. I see a huge difference in the fine lines on my skin. I will probably buy this again.</li>
            <li> I was approached at the Pentagon City mall in VA by a salesman testing this product.  I must say the price is hefty but the results speak volumes.  The salesman offered me the product at half price however with the Govt Shutdown and not receiving a paycheck this was a WANT vs a NEED however; I am am middle age and the results were amazing.  I saw lines and wrinkles diminish right before my eyes within 5 minutes and even the dark circles were less pronounced.  If you can afford this product DO BUY IT!</li>
            <li> Got sucked into a free sample/demo, despite insisting I was in a rush and would not be purchasing anything - which I reiterated at least five times. My &amp;#34;one minute&amp;#34; demo turned into fifteen minutes of super hard selling. The offer went from $599/one bottle to $359/two bottles and a third free, then like $179 for all of it, then to $80 (his cost, lucky me!) for a &amp;#34;damaged&amp;#34; box that was still on display for some reason? Um . . . Since when do damaged products still get a whole display shelf? Seriously, guy, try harder. So, the demo: He applied this stuff to the underneath of my eye - and it burned, btw - and then had me cover the treated eye and look at the untreated eye in the mirror, where he proceeded to attempt to point out &amp;#34;lines,&amp;#34; which I am actually lucky enough to not have. Then he had me uncover the treated eye and asked &amp;#34;isn&#x27;t it an amazing difference?&amp;#34; Truly, honestly, there was NO difference. He kept trying to sell. I kept saying no and balked about the cost. Then he launched into this spiel about shoes. He said, &amp;#34;What color shoes am I wearing, without looking?&amp;#34; I said, &amp;#34;black.&amp;#34; He then said, &amp;#34;well, you just guessed that because I&#x27;m wearing black. My point is, what you notice first about someone isn&#x27;t their shoes, it&#x27;s their face, yet you&#x27;d spend $30-40 on shoes, would you not?&amp;#34; Oh my holy hell. Seriously. It was never ending. Super glad I&#x27;m wise to this crap, or I might have been out $599 for the first line they cast. Buyer beware. These guys are very well trained in guerrilla sales tactics and are preying on insecurity.</li>
            <li> I was lured in by the offering of a free sample in Vegas. The sales person was extremely pushy and started pointing out my imperfections, which I had no desire whatsoever to hear at the time. Then proceeded to put eye cream on before I even consented. Don&#x27;t be fooled you can get the same results with some preparation h under your eyes. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> Sigh I wished I had read the reviews before purchasing this item and a few more other items. I agree with many of the reviews. In stores they pressure you and get into your personal space. They literally get in your face as they talk you into buying their products. They would show me videos of their products telling me that lots of celebrities use them. They did that so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get a chance to use my phone to look them up. They are trained well to get you to buy their products. They would make it sound like you are getting a great deal but you are not! They even did a tag team trying to get me to buy their products. I shouldn&#x27;t have be so polite to those kind of people. I should have gotten up and walk away. Stay away from the store. The devil comes in many forms and that&#x27;s one of them. All the reviews about them are true.  True scammers!</li>
            <li> I was pulled into one of these stores in Vegas, totally not interested in this garbage being sold with high pressure sales tactics.  But they put the cream on first and instantly I could feel my eye lift.  They only did one eye.  The result was astonishing.  But after a few seconds it became white anf flakey.  I mentioned that and he said it was because they needed to add this eye serum.  So He added that and it melted it away and my eye was line free, flawless and lifted.  I didn&#x27;t buy anything, but I walked around the rest of the day, still feeling the tightness and glancing in the mirror to see if it still looked as good.  It did.  I&#x27;m 40 and it made my eye look like that of a teenager.  Unfortunately, the other eye told the truth so I had to keep my sunglasses on.  Now I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t a fix for people with deep wrinkles.  They wanted to sell me the pair for $350.  Said it was about $1200 online.  I wish I would have bargained with them a bit because it is expensive on their site.  I see it here and on Ebay for a little less than what they wanted to sell it to me for, but I worry a bit more about freshness or authenticity.</li>
            <li> I was literally dragged into a store in Las Vegas by a saleswoman while my husband and I were walking to lunch.  She pushed me into a chair and started applying a variety of things to half my face while talking at a rate of at least 1000 words a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being run from one part of the store to another and having things put on my hands, face and arms while she threw things in a bag (that she claimed cost $5 normally but was giving me free of charge though I hadn&#x27;t agreed to buy anything), and having a slew of falling prices thrown at me I found myself standing outside the store with a bag full of stuff I was barely aware of purchasing and that I really didn&#x27;t want or need and a woman telling me to keep the receipt for the money-back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked in the bag, completely stupefied by what had just happened, and turned around to return it all right then but was told that I would have to do so at the website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All night long my face burned, even after washing it several times.  While the puffiness under the one eye that she applied stuff to and the creases around my nose and mouth are still lessened after two days, my face still burns and I still can&#x27;t find a money back policy anywhere or figure out how to return the products.</li>
            <li> I was buying my favorite dead sea cosmetics scrub in Pentagon City Mall, and the price the new salesman wanted was too high. I asked him to throw in a face cream for free. After some haggling he agreed, so I walked away with this cream and a jar of the scrub I came for for $120 both. totally worth it. the cream is really good, it absorbs immediately and does not make skin look all shiny. don&#x27;d know about &amp;#34;looking younger&amp;#34; but the skin does feel better. I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so embarrassed. The above reviews of the really hard sell (something I ALWAYS steer clear of) is exactly what happened, by (YES) a suave, and very handsome Israeli man at a mall kiosk. I ALWAYS walk right by these people but the guy was really not looking.    My \\&quot;results\\&quot; were impressive. He went on and on in the most engaging and personable way, going from the $600 to $300 (sale today only) to $150 (his personal employee discount), to $79 for a damaged box (he probably ruined himself. The product starts so highly priced that by the time he got to $70 I thought it was a really good deal. (DUH? wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $20 for any product anywhere else). The stuff started itching and irritating my skin 30 mins later (I know that many of these products \\&quot;do\\&quot; have an initial stinging/irritation, as noted by dermatologists). I feel completely \\&quot;had\\&quot; by a suave foreigner (I always fall for those types!).    Two stars for the gimmick. I may try the product and see, but I&#x27;m suspicious now.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was almost physically pressured to buy this stuff. The Flamingo would do well to evict this high pressure sales gimmick from its lobby. Do not make eye contact with them as you pass, or they drag you into the store and start putting cream on your face right on top of your makeup,??</li>
            <li> I have bought it before and would recommend it to others, It seems to work for me and my sister</li>
            <li> So I made the mistake of falling for the FREE SAMPLE gimmick that a guy was screaming at me as I walked by the store.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve been harassed by those Dead Sea Mud/cream kiosks at malls so I know their general tactics &amp;  WILL NOT be pressured to buy anything ever. But I thought hey free sample let&#x27;s see what this store is about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be warned all the sales people are trained by the company to use the same exact lines/ruthless tactics/pricing bargain techniques in every location, that border on fraud &amp; harassment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEVER be pressured into thinking you should buy anything just to be polite or to stop the never ending spiel.&lt;br /&gt;Just get up, say thanks &amp; start walking away without waiting for them to respond in any way. All rules of decent polite public behavior should go out the window when dealing with these crooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guy was Isreali as he let me know and showed me the eye cream he recommended for me, and then another product that peeled off 7 layers of impurities..hmm yeah right I wasn&#x27;t born yesterday dude, I am a Science major.&lt;br /&gt;I know what was flaking &amp; peeling off was NOT my skin but some form of starch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He kept going ON &amp; ON and I was flabbergasted at the horribly aggressive sales tactics I was witnessing.&lt;br /&gt;Then he showed me this gimmicky Gold magnetic mask you had to remove with a magnet no less. OMG no thanks!&lt;br /&gt;He told me its price was $800 but for me he would give it to me for $499 because he liked me. I said NO thanks I would never spend that much money on skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said he would sell me all the 6 products he showed me for $499. I said No.&lt;br /&gt;He dropped it to $399, then $299. I still said no.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I said no he would try to argue about me spending money on other things and trying to catch me unguarded when I had no answer. Dude I could be a millionaire &amp; still do NOT have to buy jack from you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then He shows me this DAMAGED BOX that he could sell me for manufacturing cost - $79.&lt;br /&gt;But that I should not tell anybody I got that great a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had 0% chance of ever buying their BS products when I walked in and now I was thoroughly enjoying wasting this guys time knowing well he was trying so hard to con me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told him I had never heard of their brand &amp; would never spend that much money on skincare.&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw the No refund sign at the register and asked him about it cos that is an excellent Exit strategy!&lt;br /&gt;He confirmed the policy and that&#x27;s when I said thanks for the free sample and got out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a product works then the sales tactics will NEVER have to be so tacky &amp; pushy - like gypsies selling charm bracelets in Europe streets..&lt;br /&gt;If a product is so good, there will never be a NO REFUND policy.</li>
            <li> Never ever fall for their tactics, the discounts and free stuff. Their products are not worth a penny; now that i tried their products, i wouldn&#x27;t take them even if offered for free. I tried thermal mask, peeling gel and eye serum, and i just hate myself for actually spending money on them. For me, all red flags were raised when the sales person offered a mind blowing discount, which i should refused. And on my way out, i would hear other salespersons use words like: this is only for you, which part of their selling tactics.</li>
            <li> Bought products( including cream) in Vegas in 2013. Actually has worked and well. Can definitely see a difference in the wrinkles under my eyes. They are much less noticeable now.</li>
            <li> Where do I begin? Everything about this company is a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I encountered these products at the Grand Canal Shoppes inside the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. Two women were offering samples to people walking by. I took one and was immediately engaged in a conversation. She then offered me a &amp;#34;gift bag,&amp;#34; walking back into the store and offering the gift bag to me from there. Of course, I had to enter the store to take the bag and before I knew it, she had given me several more samples and then handed me off to another salesperson for a free trial of their products. The women I encountered were very charming in a used car salesman way - offering tons of compliments, asking questions, playing up the product, etc. Once she dropped the $600 price tag for one set of products, we politely said no thanks and that&#x27;s when the game began. The price was dropped by 45% and then the salesperson added a free set to the deal if I bought that day. As she continued to talk about the product with my mother, I pulled out my cell phone to read the reviews of this product. When the salesperson saw what I was doing, she stormed off to the front of the store and engaged her colleagues in a heated conversation in a foreign language. We got up and were stopped by another salesperson as we walked out of the store. &amp;#34;What were you looking at on your phone?&amp;#34; she demanded. I replied that I was looking at reviews of the product but hadn&#x27;t found much (which was true). She asked me more questions about the reviews, stating that the company had a lot of &amp;#34;hackers&amp;#34; if I found anything bad. She also mentioned that her colleague, the one who was offended by my search for reviews, was sensitive to my negative energy, since she was a....get this...&amp;#34;priestess.&amp;#34; What a bizarre and unsettling interaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, we left without purchasing anything. I was curious about the samples they had offered us: One sample at the front of the store, one extra gift bag offered for me for my skin type, and one gift bag for my mother in her skin type. I hadn&#x27;t looked at them in the store, so it wasn&#x27;t until later that I noticed that the samples they offered me were all the exact same product: hand moisturizer that had nothing to do with anyone&#x27;s skin type. They were just a ploy to get us into the store. A quick glance at the chemical-filled ingredients list reinforced my suspicions that these products were actually complete garbage (mineral oil in a $40 hand lotion?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hours later, my mother and I were still scraping off the strange, flaky chunks left on our skin after our &amp;#34;collagen treatment.&amp;#34; A quick search for reviews of these products will yield similar stories to mine, with people purchasing up to $4000 worth of products that are unreturnable. Please avoid this company.</li>
            <li> Hate to admit that the salesman made me feel that I looked like crap but my friend s could see that this product did indeed take the wrinkles away</li>
            <li> I was just in Santa Barbara and was given the full treatment of eye cream, facial peel, serum et al, and the person administering it to me kept asking, &amp;#34;See how your skin is lifted?&amp;#34;  I kept saying no, I see my skin being slightly plumped.  I was quoted approx. $2000 for 6 different products, $800 for three.  I was and still am astounded (no, I&#x27;m in shock) that anyone would spend that kind of money.  OK, now for how my skin feels.  It feels wonderful, smells very good and I really liked the peel that warms on your face when you add water.  I just arrived home, several hours later, and my skin still feels wonderful, but I see no other benefit, i.e. less wrinkles or &#x27;lifting&#x27;.  I know no product will &#x27;lift&#x27; your skin.  Thank you Dr. Oz for that lesson!  I was told that these products are a treatment you have to keep using to get full benefits.  Hey, if you have nothing better to do with your money, go ahead and buy it. I will go back to my own scrub, my L&#x27;Occitaine or Boots No. 7 and add a drop of olive oil and call it a day!</li>
            <li> Pressure from sales man with Israeli accent...Demo of this product with the eye cream and wow!  Price astronomical.  I kept saying no too expensive and finally,after many discounts, he offered a blemished box for a huge discount $80.00.  Saying that is the price he pays, etc.  So I did purchase the serum.  He said if I come back, he&#x27;ll offer the eye cream at the same price.  But don&#x27;t tell his manager!  Huh!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, will give it an honest try.</li>
            <li> If you buy it from a store, you will be high pressed with the aggressive sales that make a used car dealer and a time share salesman look like a mild mannered kitten.  Then nobody tells you you can&#x27;t return it if even a few minutes later even if no guarantees of a product that are promised during the hard sale take place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only product i know where someone tells you for 30 minutes how fantastic the results will be yet has no guarantee that you can&#x27;t even return it 15 minutes after you buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself doesn&#x27;t work for what it is marketed.  It doesn&#x27;t produce promised or expected results any more than a $15 product from your local CVS or Walgreens, yet you can&#x27;t return it at all. Stay away but it&#x27;s possible if you&#x27;re reading this you might have been suckered into buying it like I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that case all you can do is complain to the FDA about suspicious practices and write an honest poor review as I&#x27;m doing here.</li>
            <li> I bought the whole set of products in Las Vegas. After 3 months, here is what I see:&lt;br /&gt;Undereye bags, no improvement at all. Fine lines, no improvement at all. Deep nasolabial and marionette lines, no improvement at all. Sagging jowls, sagging neck, no improvement at all. Blackheads on nose, very slight improvement. Sun spots, slight improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sad to say, I got suckered by a deep wish to look better. Should have stuck with my $15-$25 drugstore products. I hope someone will read this review and save hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I bought it 2 month ago and the results are great! No more fine line and bags under the eye!!!</li>
