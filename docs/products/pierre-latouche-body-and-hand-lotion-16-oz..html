            <li>I love Latouche Body &amp; Hand Lotion</li>
            <li>High shea content, and great smell...</li>
            <li>I love the light scent of this product.</li>
            <li>It smell good and it good on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>it is a strong fragrance, however, so some may not like that.</li>
            <li>Hands down amazing!!!</li>
            <li>but, when I go out to the desert under tempertures of 110 degres Fareinheit and profusely sweating all day long, at the end of the day, I still feel the incredible clean scent all over my body.</li>
            <li>Great extra protection for men or ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, will buy again.</li>
            <li>I have often ordered this product directly from the company, but you must purchase a case (12 bottles), so I was very happy to be able to purchase just one bottle, but the consistency was much different in the lotion this time</li>
            <li>and she really enjoy how her skin look.</li>
            <li>The scent is light.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those scents that is not overwhelming or too strong but very pleasant and noticeable when you walk by.</li>
            <li>The best lotion hands down!!</li>
            <li>It smelled better on me than the lady I first encountered it on.</li>
            <li>She had only had a sample to bring home, and when I walked by her the fragrance was remarkable,,</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, it has a warm musk aroma and it last for hours.</li>
            <li>The smell is not the only good thing, it also leaves your skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>the fragrance is clean and mild.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was sooooo light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I love it and have even bought an extra bottle for my sweet neighbor that fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>It smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Compliments are many; not only from women, but men also love the scent.  </li>
            <li>, it is very gentle to the skin specially around the knees and elbows.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s thicker than usual, very hard to get out of the bottle, other than that, it&#x27;s great, smells wonderful and great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I can get used to a little attention lol.</li>
            <li>If u want a soft, moisturized, naturally glowing skin that smells good, this Body lotion is for u.</li>
            <li>This has more of a masculine scent, so I gave it to my husband and he loves it.</li>
            <li>I get my product quick and its exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>if you love razac you will love this its somewhat of a softer scent than razac but its a strong soft scent that last a while i don&#x27;t wear it on my skin because i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I normally receive lots of completements for the clean scent people smell from me.  </li>
            <li>I received my first bottle of this cream as a gift.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of the lotion it last all day.</li>
            <li>Bought this first from an African store and had to get more.</li>
            <li>Smell is nice, clean and long lasting!!</li>
            <li>It smells good and it last a long time.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a fragrance that will certainly grab your attention.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion it also moisturizes my dry skin very well.</li>
            <li>One older lady told me she was upset because she did not want anyone else wearing it!</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>, I did not let her use it as much as i did, so i searched till i found it and bought me 6 bottles</li>
            <li>Unsex Pierre La Touche is a very noticeable scent people always ask what are you wearing  &amp;#34;smiling&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>My husband is absolutely enthralled by it.</li>
            <li>I now have my whole family.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend the product.thank</li>
            <li>very light smell long lasting shine.</li>
            <li>It is soft and gentle on the skin and when you use it, there is no need for perfume.</li>
            <li>i love this lotion, i have been using this lotion for a few yrs now</li>
            <li>this is my new perfume.</li>
            <li>it makes the skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>I first introduced to P.Latouche lotion last year while my sister in law was visiting.  </li>
            <li>So my first day wearing the fragrance, I received the same response as I had encountered --</li>
            <li>I keep this bottle of cream next to me at my computer, I love the scent of the cream &amp; it is long lasting.  </li>
            <li>The scent is not overly invasive it is almost natural.</li>
            <li>You need no other perfume or cologne on while wearing this intoxicating fragrance.</li>
            <li>No other perfume could do this lotion justice.</li>
            <li>This is my mom-in-law&#x27;s favorite and it&#x27;s very hard to find.  </li>
            <li>I started to use the lotion in beetween my toes and feet in general</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing this lotion for many years but lately the scent is a pale imitation of the original.</li>
            <li>The scent is long lasting and other people always compliment me for the sweet aroma.</li>

            <li> This size bottle always last me a long time. It smells sooooo good! The scent is long lasting and other people always compliment me for the sweet aroma. I wish I could buy the small bottle, but it only comes in packs. So I use another bottle to carry the lotion around in. It&#x27;s also a great moisturizer. Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Hands down amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it has a warm musk aroma and it last for hours. Lots of compliments every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Is there a perfume with it?</li>
            <li> I love the light scent of this product. It smells clean and fresh. Not overpowering. Always get compliments when wearing this lotion</li>

            <li> Very nice. I wish the smell of the lotion were more fragrant.</li>
            <li> my grand daughter got one bottle of Pierre latouche lotion for her birthday, I did not let her use it as much as i did, so i searched till i found it and bought me 6 bottles gave her 2 and my daughter two and i took 2 ... i love it and i always get compliments when i wear it... thank you peirre la touche..

            <li> I LOVE IT AND SMELLS WONDERFUL TO WEAR ANYWHERE PLACE YOU GO NORTH TO SOUTH FROM EAST TO WEST NO MATTER WHAT CLIMATE YOUR IN IT WORKS WONDERS!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this lotion. The scent reminds me of someone I lost and it just brings back the memories</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been three years since I started using this body lotion and the compliments still keep coming. Strangers, especially women would stop me and ask me what cologne I&#x27;m wearing cos they want their boyfriend or husband to smell as good. When I tell them it&#x27;s just a body lotion they usually think I&#x27;m kidding. I can get used to a little attention lol. If u want a soft, moisturized, naturally glowing skin that smells good, this Body lotion is for u.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this lotion.  it makes the skin very soft.  the fragrance is clean and mild.  i get compliments everyday.  i do highlyrecommend this product.  this product was bought on Amazon</li>
            <li> I received my first bottle of this cream as a gift.  She got it from a spa.  I keep this bottle of cream next to me at my computer, I love the scent of the cream &amp; it is long lasting.  I get many compliments on the scent.  I feel fortunate to have found this cream on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 10 years and to this day get compliments on its aroma. The smooth feeling it gives your skin is remarkable. I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell but doesn&#x27;t keep my skin moisturized in the winter.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and can last for years without losing its perfumed smell or going rancid and smelling like old grease like some lotions can. I</li>
            <li> I am a male in the military and I had used this lotion since 2006 with no regrets. Great extra protection for men or ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use every day while I am off work or just going out. The scent is not overly invasive it is almost natural. I had been approached by females and males asking me what kind of scent do I wear, and to their surprise, I clarify to them that it is a lotion.  My wife and I share it. I even use it while I am here now in Afghanistan and it is a personal hygiene plus.  After long days working outside (sometimes normally I am in an Office Behind a computer) but, when I go out to the desert under tempertures of 110 degres Fareinheit and profusely sweating all day long, at the end of the day, I still feel the incredible clean scent all over my body. Since I runned out of Tea Tree Spay to protect my feets from bad odor (wearing boots all day 7 days a week) I started to use the lotion in beetween my toes and feet in general&lt;br /&gt;and what can I say is that at the end of the day I have no smelly feets. I normally receive lots of completements for the clean scent people smell from me.  Both my wife and I use it and we like it, it is very gentle to the skin specially around the knees and elbows. It sure can not beat Burts Bees Hand Lotion however, it is just great.  I made it a part of my daily higiene routine after shower and I will continue to use for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> Unsex Pierre La Touche is a very noticeable scent people always ask what are you wearing  &amp;#34;smiling&#x27;&#x27; There is no need to use any other scent with the Pierre. Latouche lotion. I am a gift giver and I want everyone to be introduce to this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> OMG...I just love, love, loooooooooooove this lotion, I love the delicious scent. I&#x27;ve never seen a lotion that literally lasts ALL DAY into the next morning!!! I put this lotion on @12 noon yesterday, it is now 7:52 the next morning and I can STILL smell this lotion on my skin and my tank top. My husband is absolutely enthralled by it. You need no other perfume or cologne on while wearing this intoxicating fragrance. No other perfume could do this lotion justice. Not only is it fragrant, but it&#x27;s moisturizing power is awesome. I purchased the big bottle, and then purchased the 12 smaller bottles as I want this fragrance with me at all times.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion but can&#x27;t wear it to work, my co-worker is allergic. I wore it to Church and several of the ladies are wearing it now. One older lady told me she was upset because she did not want anyone else wearing it! Makes your skin feel sooooooo good.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion, and I do recommend it, if you looking for a lotion that will last, this it it!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I discovered it at a festival.  A woman was selling it out of her kiosk booth and the fragrance caught my attention immediately. it  smells so wonderful and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I got this as part of a Christmas gift one year and since then I have given it to others who ask, \\&quot;what are you wearing?\\&quot; My sisters and their families love it, and so does my daughter and her family. When I was in the nursing home for post-surgery rehab, the cleaning staff would say it was the best the bathroom ever smelled because the fragrance clung to the room. It is soft and gentle on the skin and when you use it, there is no need for perfume.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that I have used since my mother gave me a bottle over a year ago.  I always get compliments about&lt;br /&gt;how good I smell.  I don&#x27;t have to wear any cologne/ perfume.</li>
            <li> Customer service is always awesome. This product was received on time and smells great. It&#x27;s the best lotion I&#x27;ve owned because it actually last all day and you don&#x27;t need anything else like perfumes and such.  It&#x27;s one of those scents that is not overwhelming or too strong but very pleasant and noticeable when you walk by. One of my coworkers says she likes to walk by my desk every now and then just to smell me lol its too funny.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, will buy again.</li>
            <li> It smelled better on me than the lady I first encountered it on. Wonderful womanly smell that lasts. I want to keep this lotion fragrance secret to myself,but it gives me away when I wear it. I love this lotion it also moisturizes my dry skin very well.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS LOTION! High shea content, and great smell...it is a strong fragrance, however, so some may not like that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than satisfied with the product. Matched my expectations.  Thank you. I&#x27;ll be preparing to place another order soon. I</li>

Every time I use this lotion I receive complements on how great I smell :-)</li>
            <li> If you want a sexy, head turning scent this is the one. This is not overbearing but quite memorable. Great product.</li>
            <li> This has more of a masculine scent, so I gave it to my husband and he loves it. Great Product!</li>
            <li> I have really bad allergies so I cannot use  colognes so this lotion was perfect.  Everywhere I go people tell me I smell so good and what is it I&#x27;m wearing.

            <li> I had been introduced to P. Latouche in by one of the members from my church who had visited her daughter in Chicago.  She had only had a sample to bring home, and when I walked by her the fragrance was remarkable,,, I had to stop and comment and then she told me the name.  Well several months went by and I decided to order for my self and Im sooooo glad that I did.  Now when people walk by me they stop and ask what fragrance I have on.  I only hope they do as I did and order for themselves.  A little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> I walked into my attorney&#x27;s office and instantly I asked what she was wearing (fragrance).  She told me, only to have her repeat it again.  The fragrance was sooooo light and fresh.  Just every once in awhile it would grab me and knew I had to have P. Latouche Body and Hand lotion.  It&#x27;s terrific!  So my first day wearing the fragrance, I received the same response as I had encountered -- it&#x27;s great and I will continue to wear this alternating with Angel (which I love also).

            <li> Smells very good will buy again. Scent lasts forever. Only need to appl a little.</li>
            <li> Smells divine ! And actually moisturizes  quite well.
