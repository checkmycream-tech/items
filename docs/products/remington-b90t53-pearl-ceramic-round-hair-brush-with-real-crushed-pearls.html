            <li>Love using this brush when styling my hair, great when using with my blow dryer and trying to get my hair nice and smooth with a bit or curl at the bottom.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good quality brush and it&#x27;s very pretty!</li>

            <li>It&#x60;s easy to use</li>
            <li>but I really like it, suprisingly smooth doest not pull out hair, feels good to hair and scalp</li>
            <li>The ionic/ceramic construction helps keep my hair smooth and the handle doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li>well, shopping for a new more robust brush today.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s got such a cute pattern!</li>
            <li>However I wanted to try this right away</li>
            <li>But its purpose on the face of this earth is to make our HAIR pretty, so screw what the brush looks like if it can&#x27;t manage to (painlessly) serve its purpose.</li>
            <li>This brush looks exactly like the one in the picture.</li>
            <li>The brush is high quality and well worth it.</li>
            <li>Very pinky and pretty.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much prettier than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I really loved my regular brush with crushed pearls</li>
            <li>The brush is very pretty and the actual \\&quot;brush\\&quot; part is fine.., but my hair is constantly getting caught in the crack between the handle and the head of the brush.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair</li>
            <li>They hurt my scalp and, if I am not careful and let it brush against my neck, I get lovely red scratch marks on the sides of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can get the hair down there - it all works fine!</li>
            <li>so I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>I have a new baby and</li>
            <li>I ordered this brush because I needed a new one for blow drying.</li>
            <li>tried to think of something that I could give it a second star for and almost did for the fact that it has a pretty design.</li>
            <li>pretty and is cheap&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to remove entangled hair from the middle</li>
            <li>20 m old twins-</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush to anyone with hair shoulder length or longer who want to achieve soft waves in their hair.</li>
            <li>but I recently just started blowing my hair straight..</li>
            <li>It helps tame the fly-away hairs, and leaves my hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Not suitable for very fine hair of medium length and less.</li>
            <li>I used it with a hair dryer to blow dry my hair straight, so there was some tugging on it, but I consider this normal use for a round barrel brush and the handle shouldn&#x27;t have separated that</li>
            <li>and so I dampened my hair in the shower and blew it dry with this brush- resulting in silky soft hair that looked like I went to the salon.</li>

            <li> You can not use this brush like a normal comb since it is a little bit tingling when it touches your head.</li>
            <li> I got this brush along with the flat brush and the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I think the bristles to this brush are too long</li>
            <li> Very painful and not so great for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dry (maybe 4 or 5 strands at a time).</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it is nothing special about this brush.</li>
            <li> I found this a little big for my hairstyle and also scratchy as some of the reviews noted.</li>

            <li> Bristles are too rough and hurt my scalp</li>
            <li> I have owned many brands of this style and never experienced this poor quality</li>
            <li> I gave it a number of tries, but the pain it causes is not worth the unspectacular job</li>
            <li> I bought this item based on recommendations by other reviewers</li>
            <li> I have to use with extreme care or find a way to block the gap where my hair always get caught.</li>
            <li> It dries hair like the other ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As was also mentioned, the bristles are extremely stiff and sharp.</li>
            <li> problem I think comes from the fact that the pink and brown parts are just glued together, with two small pins 180 degrees apart to reinforce.</li>
            <li> I used this brush less than a month before the round barrel part disconnected from the handle.</li>
            <li> ; it is so firmly caught you either have to rip your hair out of it, snip it, or break the handle off.</li>
            <li> Its even bang are not comfortable pulling.</li>
            <li> My issue is with the bristles, they are sharp and pointy and not nice on the scalp at all.</li>
            <li> One of the pins seems to have fallen out and that side slid completely off the base, the only thing keeping the parts together</li>
            <li> I end up having to hold the brush right at that spot to keep my hair from getting caught, which is very awkward.</li>
            <li> and it gets wrapped and caught in that seam at least once per blow</li>
            <li> big, awkward.</li>
            <li> I have medium - thick hair that is shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, wiry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult for my hair to get down to the metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks fancy but The bristles are sharp and painful to the scalp when brushing.</li>
            <li> Quality is so bad, dont waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> brush makes blow drying your hair a painful experience.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed when I found out that my hair always gets caught in the spot where the handle connects to the body of the brush.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap.</li>
            <li> This results in tearing, pulling, and breaking of the hairs that get caught in there... not to mention its painful!</li>

            <li> &amp;#34;oooo crushed pearls?&amp;#34; yes I fell for the fancy sounding gimmick, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush makes blow drying your hair a painful experience. I gave it a number of tries, but the pain it causes is not worth the unspectacular job it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start with, as some others have mentioned, there is a seam or joint where the head of the brush meets the handle. I have long, fine hair and it gets wrapped and caught in that seam at least once per blow dry (maybe 4 or 5 strands at a time). And when it gets stuck, it isn&#x27;t just &amp;#34;oh let me unravel this&amp;#34; it is so firmly caught you either have to rip your hair out of it, snip it, or break the handle off. Very painful and not so great for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As was also mentioned, the bristles are extremely stiff and sharp. They hurt my scalp and, if I am not careful and let it brush against my neck, I get lovely red scratch marks on the sides of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t get my hair sufficiently taut, either. It just kinda slips off the barrel, sometimes into the dreaded handle seam of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to think of something that I could give it a second star for and almost did for the fact that it has a pretty design. But its purpose on the face of this earth is to make our HAIR pretty, so screw what the brush looks like if it can&#x27;t manage to (painlessly) serve its purpose.</li>
            <li> It looks fancy but The bristles are sharp and painful to the scalp when brushing.</li>
            <li> I have a new baby and 20 m old twins- no time for washing every day! However I wanted to try this right away and so I dampened my hair in the shower and blew it dry with this brush- resulting in silky soft hair that looked like I went to the salon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good quality brush and it&#x27;s very pretty! It&#x27;s much prettier than I thought it would be. It&#x27;s also a bit larger than I&#x27;d anticipated, so I docked it a star. I would recommend this brush to anyone with hair shoulder length or longer who want to achieve soft waves in their hair. If you&#x27;re looking for tighter waves or curls, this is probably not the brush for you.</li>
            <li> I used to straighten my hair with an iron but I recently just started blowing my hair straight.. this brush workd great for it and the price is great :)</li>
            <li> Quality is so bad, dont waste your money on this product. It is a piece of junk. Do yourself a favor, do not buy.</li>
            <li> I found this a little big for my hairstyle and also scratchy as some of the reviews noted. I really loved my regular brush with crushed pearls so I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> This brush looks exactly like the one in the picture. Very pinky and pretty.  You can not use this brush like a normal comb since it is a little bit tingling when it touches your head. Just for fashion styling.</li>
            <li> I used this brush while drying my hair. It helps tame the fly-away hairs, and leaves my hair feeling silky smooth. Very nice brush and great price!</li>
            <li> Bristles are too rough and hurt my scalp&lt;br /&gt;Looks pretty and is cheap&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to remove entangled hair from the middle</li>
            <li> I got this brush along with the flat brush and the hair dryer. Awesome products all the way around! This brush is very nice. Easy to use..easy grip.</li>
            <li> I used this brush less than a month before the round barrel part disconnected from the handle. I used it with a hair dryer to blow dry my hair straight, so there was some tugging on it, but I consider this normal use for a round barrel brush and the handle shouldn&#x27;t have separated that quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I think comes from the fact that the pink and brown parts are just glued together, with two small pins 180 degrees apart to reinforce. Well, when used with the hair dryer I am guessing the glue didn&#x27;t stay stuck during repeated heating, and the pins just weren&#x27;t enough to keep the parts together. One of the pins seems to have fallen out and that side slid completely off the base, the only thing keeping the parts together now is the bristles, and it is unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, shopping for a new more robust brush today.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap. Handle broke a month after receiving it. I have owned many brands of this style and never experienced this poor quality</li>
            <li> I bought this item based on recommendations by other reviewers but I was disappointed when I found out that my hair always gets caught in the spot where the handle connects to the body of the brush. I have to use with extreme care or find a way to block the gap where my hair always get caught.</li>
            <li> The brush is very pretty and the actual \\&quot;brush\\&quot; part is fine.., but my hair is constantly getting caught in the crack between the handle and the head of the brush. OUCH! This results in tearing, pulling, and breaking of the hairs that get caught in there... not to mention its painful! I end up having to hold the brush right at that spot to keep my hair from getting caught, which is very awkward. I will be finding another brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s easy to use but unfortunately it is nothing special about this brush.It dries hair like the other ones.Will try to find something else</li>
            <li> This brush is great for blowing my curly hair out. The ionic/ceramic construction helps keep my hair smooth and the handle doesn&#x27;t get too hot. Plus it&#x27;s got such a cute pattern!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush because I needed a new one for blow drying. I love the design on it, and the handle is very comfortable. My issue is with the bristles, they are sharp and pointy and not nice on the scalp at all.</li>
            <li> have not tried it with heat yet but I really like it, suprisingly smooth doest not pull out hair, feels good to hair and scalp</li>
            <li> I have medium - thick hair that is shoulder length.  I think the bristles to this brush are too long and it&#x27;s difficult for my hair to get down to the metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I can get the hair down there - it all works fine!</li>
            <li> I have thick, wiry, curly hair. Works great in my hair and highly recommend it for curls. The brush is high quality and well worth it.</li>
            <li> big, awkward. Synthetic bristles. Not suitable for very fine hair of medium length and less. Its even bang are not comfortable pulling.</li>
            <li> Love using this brush when styling my hair, great when using with my blow dryer and trying to get my hair nice and smooth with a bit or curl at the bottom.</li>
            <li> el producto aduirido fue  identico al ofrecido muy completo para lo cual fue escogido  sin queja alguna hasta ahora volveria a comprarlo</li>
