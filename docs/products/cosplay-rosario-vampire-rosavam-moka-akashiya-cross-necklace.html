            <li> I&#x27;m going to remove the chain, replace the cross because it&#x27;s really small, and replace the beading then put them on a buckled leather choker instead of one that snaps because this one is really thin.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER it is not good for cosplay.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t uncomfortable or anything.</li>
