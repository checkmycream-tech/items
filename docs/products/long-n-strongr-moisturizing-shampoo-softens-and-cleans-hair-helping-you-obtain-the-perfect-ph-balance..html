            <li>I also take Biotin, since that makes your hair stronger and healthier and supposed to make it grow faster so it could be the combination of that and this shampoo that is giving me the best results.</li>

            <li>I was not too sure that this would even work</li>
            <li>With this it grows much more evenly.</li>
            <li>and I love it along with mane&#x27;n&#x27; tail hair products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad,</li>

            <li>there&#x27;s still more and more split ends popping up</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo my hair got thicker but not longer.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for now.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I loved the scent, I loved the way it left my hair!</li>
            <li>super impressed with this product, i noticed my hair was clean not heavy</li>
            <li>Personally, I loved this shampoo, I didn&#x27;t use the whole set, I only used the shampoo and I loved it!</li>
            <li>Smelled good, but didn&#x27;t make my hair grow... gave an extra star just because it smelled so amazing..</li>
            <li>This really is a great product, I definitely noticed my hair growing better and faster.</li>
            <li>The product is cheaply made and packaged and the ingredients don&#x27;t justify the price.</li>
            <li>Glad it was not expensive.</li>
            <li>After the first use I noticed my hair was softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE HOW MUCH MY HAIR HAS GROWN AND HOW MUCH STRONGER AND BRIGHT</li>
            <li>I bought the whole pack but prefer to just use the shampoo on most days.</li>
            <li>after using the whole thing my hair grew 4.5 inches!!</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference in the length of my hair after I used the first bottle of it, my hairdresser noticed it as well!</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients with oils that stimulate hair growth helped a lot &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>honestly I have tried everything for my hair, cause I straightened it so much when I was younger</li>
            <li>but I was expecting some better results than what got after I used the entire bottle.</li>
            <li>and I have not even finished my first bottle of shampoo yet.</li>
            <li>PEOPLE HAVE NOTICES SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>I stopped &amp;#34;coloring&amp;#34; it, go to the salon once every 3 months and have a morroccan hot conditioning treatment done.  </li>
            <li>My whole family is now using this shampoo!</li>
            <li>From the first time I use it</li>
            <li>Other than that I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great but!</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments about my hair being long anf thivk!</li>
            <li>&#x27;N Strong and recently started using the shampoo as well.</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time last night, the shampoo made my hair really soft, and it did loosen my curls up a bit, but that is ok</li>
            <li>Got it in good condition thank you but the product  is not recommended if u don&#x27;t want your hair hard ..</li>
            <li>i was really taken by this shampoo&#x27;s scent</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>and I really do think my hair is longer</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t lose much hair anymore.  </li>
            <li>but does it really make your hair grow faster and get rid of my split ends and breakage ?</li>
            <li>really, it dries out your hair.  </li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that my hair is much healthier and grows a lot faster.</li>
            <li>So if you want thick hair the shampoo is good</li>
            <li>In addition, every time I felt as if my scalp was becoming dry again, I used the shampoo and it solved my dandruff problem as well.</li>
            <li>But other than that this product is a lot better to handle instead of taking fifty thousand vitamins or pills for your hair growth.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>No shampoo I&#x27;ve tried has ever left my hair so soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>and ive had to color my new growth since using these products</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair SO SOFT!</li>
            <li>Those products and regime, COMPLETELY repaired my hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have problems growing my hair, it just doesn&#x27;t grow fast enough for me.  </li>
            <li>I want my hair to grow long after retiring out of the Military and having to keep it short for so many years.</li>
            <li>Right before my hair dried completely my husband</li>
            <li>It is now nice and long due to that not this harsh product.</li>
            <li>but I never really noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li>With that my hair did grow quickly, but very unevenly so it always looked shaggy and in need of a haircut.</li>
            <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars on other hair care products and have never found a product that works as well as this and as quickly.</li>
            <li>It really was less frizzy too.  </li>

            <li> It really was less frizzy too.  </li>
            <li> i have very thin hair but can fill a slight difference on how clean my scalp fills after a days worth</li>
            <li> Apparently it is not made for people who have relaxers.</li>
            <li> , I did not see a diffrence, maybe I didn&#x27;t use it long enough,</li>
            <li> too expensive for a small bottle, and it really isnt anything special, it doesnt lather well</li>
            <li> We all want long hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using Long</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the long part yet, will write again soon.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll wait and see when the bottle is done to see how long my hair has grown.</li>
            <li> but either way, after only a month or less my hair is definitely longer.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is exactly like watered down dish soap and the conditioner or \\&quot;hair lotion\\&quot; is very thin and does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from a dry scalp, and dandruff since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry brittle and braking.</li>
            <li> and since I have thin, curly hair, I try to take all the vitamins and oils I can get and this shampoo really helped out a lot!</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling greasy and weighed down.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this shampoo to anyone, especially if the price stays down.</li>
            <li> The it down side is that I wish the bottle was larger, for the price</li>
            <li> I think the bottle should be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> My hair was thin and curly and since I used this Shampoo, it&#x27;s really gotten thicker and longer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not worried about the &#x27;dried out&#x27; feeling, because i do use a deep conditioner once a month.  </li>
            <li> Not everyone will have the same results, and maybe the growth is all mental, but it didn&#x27;t turn my hair green or anything, and it didn&#x27;t fall out overnight.</li>
            <li> My hair was quite long, but I had my beautician cut about five inches of uneven</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be searching other websites till I find it</li>
            <li> Its just seems like any other shampoo</li>
            <li> I only do the hair ends because my hair is already thick.</li>
            <li> This product, I feel, has let me down.</li>
            <li> it feels like a greasy mess and has no ingredients to help the health of your hair.</li>
            <li> if you have long thick hair already dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a few times and haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
            <li> butI don;t want to waste the money to find out.</li>
            <li> I did however see my hair grew a few inches.</li>
            <li> my hair is already a little pass my bra strap !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how they claim it is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> It can make your hair hard so limit your use and follow the directions</li>
            <li> hard to comb out!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair with this product was not very impressed  with it and for the price .</li>
            <li> I fillet the defrance tough of my hair</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair than this product can thicken it up.</li>
            <li> and the condition of my hair is actually worse.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t too expensive</li>
            <li> l get  wrong  bottles</li>
            <li> this really stinks.</li>
            <li> Bc at my ends are bad every time I get a trim</li>
            <li> The texturizing balm is worthless</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Left my hair feeling greasy and weighed down. No noticeable growth, and I used it regularly.</li>
            <li> Personally, I loved this shampoo, I didn&#x27;t use the whole set, I only used the shampoo and I loved it! I loved the scent, I loved the way it left my hair! My hair was thin and curly and since I used this Shampoo, it&#x27;s really gotten thicker and longer and it just looks healthier and better!! I will definitely purchase this again! All natural ingredients with oils that stimulate hair growth helped a lot &#x3D;] I was also taking vitamins such as B-12, Prenatal, Hair Skin and Nails, Omega-3, and that might have helped a bit too and I was massaging my scalp daily and since I have thin, curly hair, I try to take all the vitamins and oils I can get and this shampoo really helped out a lot! (Vitamins and food choices also play a part as well)</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work. But all it did was remove my relaxer. Apparently it is not made for people who have relaxers. It should be reformulated to work for everyone. We all want long hair.</li>
            <li> too expensive for a small bottle, and it really isnt anything special, it doesnt lather well, i have to use alot of it to feel like its cleansing my hair. if you have long thick hair already dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair with this product was not very impressed  with it and for the price .</li>
            <li> super impressed with this product, i noticed my hair was clean not heavy and after several weeks i suddenly noticed hey my hair is getting longer. Goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> I used this item the same day i got it, to see if i will notice any difference of my hair..i was really taken by this shampoo&#x27;s scent it smelled great. Right before my hair dried completely my husband and i noticed the smoothness of my hair. I just started using this product so i&#x27;m yet to experience it even more..but for now i just can&#x27;t stop touching my hair because i did notice the texture of it..and it turned out great.. Thank you for sending it on a timely matter, the delivery for this item came way ahead of schedule and that even made me such a happier customer and the packaging of this item was so secured. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> My hair was quite long, but I had my beautician cut about five inches of uneven&lt;br /&gt;hair. So I&#x27;d like it to grow back even , if possible. I can&#x27;t say if this has made&lt;br /&gt;much of a difference or not! But I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
            <li> It smells great but I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in length or thickness. I&#x27;m looking for a product that does that so I&#x27;ll be searching other websites till I find it</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair fall out or anything but I was expecting some better results than what got after I used the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> I was not too sure that this would even work but it wasn&#x27;t too expensive so I bought it to try anyway and I really do think my hair is longer and I have not even finished my first bottle of shampoo yet. I did not buy the serum or hair treatment or whatever it&#x27;s called that it recommends to use if you&#x27;re using the shampoo so maybe my hair would be growing even faster if I did that but either way, after only a month or less my hair is definitely longer. I used to use the Mane &amp; Tail horse shampoo since I heard that makes your hair stronger, thicker, and grow faster but I never really noticed much of a difference. With that my hair did grow quickly, but very unevenly so it always looked shaggy and in need of a haircut. With this it grows much more evenly. I also take Biotin, since that makes your hair stronger and healthier and supposed to make it grow faster so it could be the combination of that and this shampoo that is giving me the best results. This shampoo also smells good, much better than the Mane &amp; Tail shampoo. I would recommend this shampoo to anyone, especially if the price stays down.</li>
            <li> This product strengthens the hair ends and I love it along with mane&#x27;n&#x27; tail hair products. It helps mend your ends so your hair can grow out but I would not recommend putting it all over your hair unless you need it. I only do the hair ends because my hair is already thick. If you have thin hair than this product can thicken it up. But other than that this product is a lot better to handle instead of taking fifty thousand vitamins or pills for your hair growth. It can make your hair hard so limit your use and follow the directions</li>
            <li> honestly I have tried everything for my hair, cause I straightened it so much when I was younger and it wouldn&#x27;t grow like at all. I didn&#x27;t believe this would work but I tried it because the reviews looked good, I just have to say it took about a month for it to actually show but my hair has actually grown! I&#x27;m so glad, This product ACTUALLY WORKS!! and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used this product for awhile and had no results at all. this really stinks. I got another product that actually works.</li>
            <li> I have been using Long &#x27;N Strong and recently started using the shampoo as well. My hair is in the best condition it has ever been since I started using these products. My hair was brittle and breaking, it is now smooth, shining, longer and thicker! I have spent hundreds of dollars on other hair care products and have never found a product that works as well as this and as quickly. Wish I could give a 10 star rating!</li>
            <li> I have used this product a few times and haven&#x27;t seen any results.I want my hair to grow long after retiring out of the Military and having to keep it short for so many years. This product, I feel, has let me down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from a dry scalp, and dandruff since I was a teenager. No shampoo I&#x27;ve tried has ever left my hair so soft and clean.  It smells good and I don&#x27;t have dandruff anymore...  At all! I&#x27;ve noticed my hair looks like its in better condition and I don&#x27;t lose much hair anymore.  Please don&#x27;t discontinue.  I&#x27;m very happy with this shampoo and I&#x27;m going to continue to buy it!!! :)</li>
            <li> After all of the reviews I have seen on this product I&#x27;m going to be ordering it tomorrow to try it out but does it really make your hair grow faster and get rid of my split ends and breakage ? Bc at my ends are bad every time I get a trim there&#x27;s still more and more split ends popping up .. An I don&#x27;t even style my hair with heat or anything... An will it also help with frizz , flyaways, an my baby hairs along my forehead? They won&#x27;t grow for nothing I&#x27;ve tryed EVERYTHING  so I&#x27;m hoping this product will help with all of my needs my hair is already a little pass my bra strap ! I hoping to archive to my belly button or to my waiste before schools here!! Hoping this will make it happen!!!</li>
            <li> I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE HOW MUCH MY HAIR HAS GROWN AND HOW MUCH STRONGER AND BRIGHT IT LOOKS. PEOPLE HAVE NOTICES SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> really, it dries out your hair.  I would not recommend it.  I had damaged hair, falling out.  I stopped &amp;#34;coloring&amp;#34; it, go to the salon once every 3 months and have a morroccan hot conditioning treatment done.  I also bought the repairing conditioner and shampoo by the same name.  Those products and regime, COMPLETELY repaired my hair.  It is now nice and long due to that not this harsh product.</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time last night, the shampoo made my hair really soft, and it did loosen my curls up a bit, but that is ok, i didn&#x27;t have to use the straightener on it. It really was less frizzy too.  I am going to have to use all three products.  I&#x27;m not worried about the &#x27;dried out&#x27; feeling, because i do use a deep conditioner once a month.  I don&#x27;t have problems growing my hair, it just doesn&#x27;t grow fast enough for me.  I have been taking the biotin, so now I will add this into the mix, and see how that works. Not everyone will have the same results, and maybe the growth is all mental, but it didn&#x27;t turn my hair green or anything, and it didn&#x27;t fall out overnight. So I will continue and see how it grows.</li>
            <li> I have tried this for couple weeks now and it states see improvements in 5-7 days and i see no change</li>
            <li> I started using this product 2 weeks ago. I can&#x27;t believe the change in my hair, my hair is longer and healthier and people stop me on the street to compliment me.this is the best product on the market</li>
            <li> Got it in good condition thank you but the product  is not recommended if u don&#x27;t want your hair hard ..hard to comb out!</li>
            <li> i have very thin hair but can fill a slight difference on how clean my scalp fills after a days worth and ive had to color my new growth since using these products</li>
            <li> This sampoo dryed out mine and my daughters hair. I&#x27;m not sure how they claim it is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> after using the whole thing my hair grew 4.5 inches!! love love love! I get so many compliments about my hair being long anf thivk!</li>
            <li> The product is cheaply made and packaged and the ingredients don&#x27;t justify the price. The shampoo is exactly like watered down dish soap and the conditioner or \\&quot;hair lotion\\&quot; is very thin and does absolutely nothing. The texturizing balm is worthless it feels like a greasy mess and has no ingredients to help the health of your hair. Despite all this I still finished all the hair products hoping I would still see growth but of course I didn&#x27;t and the condition of my hair is actually worse. My hair is dry brittle and braking. This product did nothing it promised. It is a gimmick product or scam and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo my hair got thicker but not longer. So if you want thick hair the shampoo is good</li>
            <li> Smelled good, but didn&#x27;t make my hair grow... gave an extra star just because it smelled so amazing..</li>
            <li> Waste of money! How can they sell this? It is a total mistruth. Glad it was not expensive. Don&#x27;t spend money, or time on this.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all. Very unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. After the first use I noticed my hair was softer and more manageable. In addition, every time I felt as if my scalp was becoming dry again, I used the shampoo and it solved my dandruff problem as well. My whole family is now using this shampoo!</li>
            <li> l get  wrong  bottles</li>
            <li> my hair has grown 👌 amazing! best hair shampoo I&#x27;ve ever bought to make my hair grow I recomend this 👏👏</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once but it made my hair look super healthy!! I love it. I don&#x27;t know about the long part yet, will write again soon.</li>
            <li> Its just seems like any other shampoo, I did not see a diffrence, maybe I didn&#x27;t use it long enough, butI don;t want to waste the money to find out.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results.. You get what you pay for</li>

            <li> This shampoo is wonderful, made my hair so soft and smelling good. Noticed a difference in the length of my hair after I used the first bottle of it, my hairdresser noticed it as well!</li>
            <li> From the first time I use it I fillet the defrance tough of my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for now. I did however see my hair grew a few inches. I guess I&#x27;ll wait and see when the bottle is done to see how long my hair has grown.</li>
            <li> great product, I bought this thinking it was a scam and all my hair was going to turn purple or somthing but I have noticed a lot of growth in my hair since I have purchased this item!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it I send it back no coment</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love this shampoo! I bought the whole pack but prefer to just use the shampoo on most days. I love the smell of this shampoo &amp; the way it leaves my hair feeling! I have also noticed that my hair is much healthier and grows a lot faster. I recommend it to anyone that Is trying to restore health to their hair and make it grow!! The it down side is that I wish the bottle was larger, for the price I think the bottle should be a little bigger. Other than that I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great but!</li>
            <li> This really is a great product, I definitely noticed my hair growing better and faster. The smell kind of reminds me of dog shampoo, but it is still a great shampoo</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair SO SOFT! I love it and I will not use anything else now.  If you have damaged hair or colored hair I 100% recommend this for you!</li>
