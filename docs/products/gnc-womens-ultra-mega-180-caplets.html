            <li> After finishing a couple of large bottles of multivitamins from different suppliers, I was tired of the medicinal smell (and taste). I wanted to try something better, so I did my research and chose to try these. They&#x27;ve been far superior to any other multivitamin and smell much better too!</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of vitamins, and I always end up going back to these because I feel great when I&#x27;m taking them.</li>
            <li> I am healthier and more energetic when I take my GNC Vitamins. I feel better and recommend this product to people who want to be more productive.</li>
            <li> I have only started taking these vitamins a couple of days ago but my energy level has already gone up quite a bit.  Imagine what I can do!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I only wish they were a little smaller and I did not need to take two of them a day!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, they make me feel really energetic!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I can hardly believe in the change!!!!!</li>
            <li> Have not used vitamins yet but disappointed to find I need to take 2 per day to get daily requirements.  Other multivitamins I have taken with similar ingredients and strengths only require one pill per day.</li>
            <li> My aunt got these vitamins for me.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything out of the ordinary from them, but as soon as I took the first one I noticed an obvious increase in energy.  I thought maybe it was in my head, but the energy kept coming...each time I took them.  I now only take one pill a day, but still feel the benefits.  These are great vitamins.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she&#x27;s loving it. According to her, she enjoys the new formula more than she did the older version of this product.</li>
            <li> Great product! I workout regularly so these are what I need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these vitamins for a few years now, and feel the benefit most when I am NOT taking them: I can&#x27;t believe how my energy and memory levels drop, and how sluggish I feel when I allow my intake of them to lapse. As for the complaint of a two a day requirement, I personally find two are not even neccesary, and I still feel great taking one a day. A word of caution: when buying these vitamins, make sure to purchase the tablets, NOT the capsules. The capsules are four a day, huge, and gross.</li>
            <li> product arrived exactly as ordered and on time.  priced well, we shall buy from this source as long as it is competitive</li>
            <li> It is my opinion that GNC makes the best vitamins. Over many years I&#x27;ve tried lots of supplements, and I find that I gravitate more and more to GNC. The product is great, but buying it on Amazon is a much better choice than buying it from GNC. The seller I got it from was fast and less expensive, even with my GNC gold card discount.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I felt really good while taking this product. I had to switch because this vitamin does not have potassium. Since I need the potassium I changed to another vitamin in the same line of products.</li>
            <li> For womens that cares. Good sources of vitamins, well balanced. For active and intelligent womens who are interested in stay healthy.</li>
            <li> Unlike many many other vitamins out there, there is a wide variety of vitamins at good doses in this choice. While you will have to take two pills to get the values listed in the ingredients, it is still an excellent choice for a vitamin. Much much better than some other choices such as centrum, or centrum silver or one a day.</li>
            <li> I notice an increase in energy a few days after taking them and the difference when I back off. Also, great benefits with speeding up hair growth.</li>
            <li> Please be aware this multi contains sucralose (splenda)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always suspected there was something in this vit. that was not agreeing with me because of the the symptoms that would take place about 2 hours after taking it. I liked the amount of b vit. and I am in menopause so I kept writing some of these feelings off as part of that until a recent 3 week break from the vit. and then reintroducing them. My suspicion was so strong that I have even searched in the past \\&quot;gnc vitamins making me sick\\&quot; or \\&quot;are gnc vit bad for you\\&quot;  trying to see if it was just me or if others were experiencing the same problems.  Of course there was a mix of thoughts which didn&#x27;t help me much.&lt;br /&gt; Only till just very recently did I find what that something in the vitamin is that could be causing such a problem for me and that is sucralose.  I came across the word searching for an alternative vit. and never thought to check the gnc brand for it, thought THEY would know better, but after another bad experience with them I just looked this morning and there it is.  It is easy to misread it as sucrose and I would not have known what it was anyway if I had read it right, but splenda I would have recognized.  I avoid artificial sweetners always and for anyone else who avoids them beware this vit. contains one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these vitamins for about 6 months now.  I noticed they seemed to have helped my hair and nails.  I take two of these and also take three cod liver oil capsule a day.</li>
            <li> Product shows immediate results that are sustained! One of the true &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; ULTRA vitamins available for women at an exceptionally fair price!!</li>
            <li> These supplements are great. I suffer from joint pain (weird because i&#x27;m pretty young)I have not had any since I started taking this supplement. Also For those of you trying to conceive this supplement do contain Folic Acid.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know really what to say about this product. Bought it for the wife and she takes it everyday. So Thank you.</li>
            <li> We bought this (for me; and my parnter, the male version) because my partner and I have tried Australian brands such as Swisse, Blackmores Cenovis and none of them gave us the energy that we require even if we only take 1 pill a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe we get to sleep at night as we don&#x27;t take 2 pills a day.  Great supplement!</li>
            <li> GNC products high quality as always.  Was an exceptional buy.  Great multi vit/mineral and easy on the stomach.  I thought maybe because of the price that they would have an experiation date of &amp;#34;soon&amp;#34; but they will be gone before the product expires.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipment. Better price, and I didn&#x27;t have to drive to a local GNC store to purchase. Very convenient.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t take the product because i can&#x27;t take vitamin K, and i seen that it caused mood swings. idk</li>
            <li> good. with high quality. easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I personally need it at the time.&lt;br /&gt;I feel pretty comfortable on it.</li>
    </ol>
