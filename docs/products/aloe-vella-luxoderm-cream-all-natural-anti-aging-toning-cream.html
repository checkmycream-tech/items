            <li>More than that</li>
            <li>I called to make SURE the product did not contain SORBITOL.  </li>
            <li>YOU CAN&#x27;T EVEN TURN THEM IN TO THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU. .</li>
            <li>Received my &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; read all the fine print on the packing slip that came in package regarding the &amp;#34;promotional offer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>If I have just not &amp;#34;read the fine print&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If I thought the product was worth $139.00 I would have kept it, gladly...</li>
            <li>the screw on top broke in the first week.</li>
            <li>that says they will charge you the full price of the product 15 days after the order date.  </li>
            <li>Quick.</li>
            <li>How say to pay for something that is so worth less.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;am</li>
            <li>I thought that the product must be so good that they can offer a low cost trial because people would have to come back for more.  </li>
            <li>; Well, Luxoderm could take top billing in the dictionary of old adages.</li>
            <li>It does have a very strong odor (FYI) that I personally found to aggravate my allergies</li>
            <li>my first two tubs of this cream were working for me.</li>
            <li>I was charged the full amount of $139 unexpectedly.  </li>
            <li>what kind of results are we expected to see in 14 days!!</li>
            <li>, I did not notice the fine print that says that they will automatically send you a duplicate order THE SAME DAY as the sample and that order will cost you $139 even though the invoice in the box says $13.90.  </li>
            <li>There is fine print at the very bottom of the last ordering page</li>
            <li>The product is very greasy.  </li>
            <li>really...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really see the results as to what the advertisement said.</li>
            <li>not so much.</li>
            <li>Still as much flab as before.</li>
            <li>far they have charged my card OVER THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS!!!  </li>
            <li>The product was not as great as they had promised, The firming affect was slight the smell was kinda odd.</li>
            <li>I found this product useful but not necessary.</li>
            <li>MAJOR SCAM!!!</li>
            <li>while they agreed to cancel any future shipments --- I was responsible to pay the $280.  </li>
            <li>The advertising for this company is a complete scam.  </li>
            <li>and I like it so far</li>
            <li>If the product was as good as these fake reviews claim, they would not have to scam people into buying it.</li>
            <li>I used it exactly as directed and noticed absolutely NO Change in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I do not like the smell very much either as other people have said.</li>
            <li>I have never encountered a less professional and more rude customer service department.</li>
            <li>Not only are the claims of a 47% average improvement of skin texture false, but thanks to the stench of this cream, your love life will be non-existent.</li>
            <li>There is no instant result with this product and never expected it to be.</li>

            <li> The other is only 30 d at a.</li>
            <li> This skin product reeks of dead fish washed ashore when you open the jar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;my appearance and will continue using for a while and will write another review in a few months.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Tried this product and it&#x27;s horrible as wanted something that didn&#x27;t have all of the chemicals that most of the other products have.</li>
            <li> When I called to cancel my order they informed me I was past my 15-day trial and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream over 6 weeks I not sure yet.  </li>
            <li> that sucks.</li>
            <li> and I spoke with a customer service today she was very rudely answered.</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t see any difference with this cream and it is unpleasant to use (bad odor, texture on skin).  </li>
            <li> A little disappointed for the price of this cream.</li>
            <li> Also, when dealing with customer service, and they are utterly an incredibly rude and impossible to deal with.</li>
            <li> I do like the product but is expensive am researching alternatives to it.</li>

            <li> The smell is awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> What a shame. my first two tubs of this cream were working for me. i didnt ever want to be out of it. so i get my third jar, and its consistency was very different. i opened it up, and lost about a third of it on my bedroom quilt. it just poured out.&lt;br /&gt;worse yet, its not doing its job. i am bummed. i dont think i&#x27;ll get another one ever again. that sucks.</li>
            <li> Tried this product and it&#x27;s horrible as wanted something that didn&#x27;t have all of the chemicals that most of the other products have. The smell is awful.  The product is very greasy.  Since I wanted to see if it would work and I could live with the other things I tried it for 3 weeks.  I took pictures of the before and even though have lost some weight, there is no difference in my skin texture and the lumps/bumps they say will go away still exist.</li>
            <li> OMG!!!!!  I CAN&#x27;T believe I fell for this!  MAJOR SCAM!!! Worst part is, my Luxoderm Cream order was bundled with Ayurskin Cream for the face  so I go hit with the $139.90 charge for each product or $279.80!!!!!  When I called to cancel my order they informed me I was past my 15-day trial and while they agreed to cancel any future shipments --- I was responsible to pay the $280.  What was I thinking?!?!?</li>
            <li> scam!! and does not work!! will charge you 139.00!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this provided the results i was looking for!!  It is on the costly side and so I chose not to continue using the product!  while retinol is costly for the amount of product you get i think it works 10 times better</li>
            <li> PURCHASED FOR A FRIEND</li>
            <li> DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I love this product as it firms my skin!</li>
            <li> Received my &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; read all the fine print on the packing slip that came in package regarding the &amp;#34;promotional offer&amp;#34;. Even if you cancel within the 14 day trial they will still charge your credit card $139.00!! What ever you do, do not open the second jar if you want to return the product (they will bill you for it)! If I thought the product was worth $139.00 I would have kept it, gladly... but it&#x27;s a scam and really... what kind of results are we expected to see in 14 days!! If it sounds too good to be true, it is! It does have a very strong odor (FYI) that I personally found to aggravate my allergies (so if you have allergies be aware)&lt;br /&gt;I only had the product for 1 week, called to cancel any further orders and asked for the return RA# next thing you know as soon as I hung up the phone they charged my credit card!! I contact my credit card company and told them that they are not authorized and stopped the withdrawal!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream over 6 weeks I not sure yet.  I don&#x27;t like smell and I spoke with a customer service today she was very rudely answered.</li>
            <li> I found it very difficult giving this procuct 2 stars.  I used it exactly as directed and noticed absolutely NO Change in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;For all of those future customers wanting to try this product....&amp;#34;BUYER BEWARE&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Sound&#x27;s like it dosen&#x27;t work !! How say to pay for something that is so worth less.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;am so happy I didn&#x27;t order any.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a change in my wrinkles as well as under the chin skin. I use Retinol Serun for Wrinkles under it as well as adding Organic castor oil to the lotion, just a drop does the trick. I do like the product but is expensive am researching alternatives to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Luxaderm for close to 3 months, wanted to give it a fair shot and an honest review.  I have seen noticeable changes over time with&lt;br /&gt;daily use once a day, too expensive to use twice a day.  I have flabby arms from weight loss and my arms have toned up some and any&lt;br /&gt;dimpling has smoothed out. Do I think it will totally tone my skin no, I think surgery can only do that. But It have nicely improved&lt;br /&gt;my appearance and will continue using for a while and will write another review in a few months. There is no instant result with this product and never expected it to be. I do not like the smell very much either as other people have said. Take care</li>
            <li> Thiefs..!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! iTS A SCAM</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t see any difference with this cream and it is unpleasant to use (bad odor, texture on skin).  More than that, I did not notice the fine print that says that they will automatically send you a duplicate order THE SAME DAY as the sample and that order will cost you $139 even though the invoice in the box says $13.90.  You have to pay to return it plus a restocking fee.  If the product was as good as these fake reviews claim, they would not have to scam people into buying it.</li>
            <li> I called to make SURE the product did not contain SORBITOL.  They ASSURED me it did not!!!  I received the product and the use of it sent me to the ER!!!  Called company 5 times. . .hung up on twice. . .on hold a total of over 2.5 hours.  If I have just not &amp;#34;read the fine print&amp;#34;. . .that would have been MY FAULT.  This however IS LUXODERM&#x27;s fault.  I received the product on day 15 (which is the last day to return) . .so far they have charged my card OVER THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS!!!  Everything happened on day 15!!!!  THIS IS A SCAM!!!  YOU CAN&#x27;T EVEN TURN THEM IN TO THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU. . .because everything listed is the PACKING company&#x27;s address not Luxoderm.  THESE PEOPLE NEED TO BE STOPPED!!!!  The add said NO RISK GUARANTEE. . .sure, NO RISK TO THEM.  SCAM. . .CROOKS. . .LIARS. . .I do NOT see how these folks sleep at night. . .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really see the results as to what the advertisement said. A little disappointed for the price of this cream.</li>
            <li> The product was not as great as they had promised, The firming affect was slight the smell was kinda odd.</li>
            <li> cream is great...packaging? not so much. the screw on top broke in the first week. sort of inconvenient...</li>
            <li> The advertising for this company is a complete scam.  I signed up for a $5 trial.  I thought that the product must be so good that they can offer a low cost trial because people would have to come back for more.  Wrong.  This was not a $5 trial.  There is fine print at the very bottom of the last ordering page that says they will charge you the full price of the product 15 days after the order date.  I was charged the full amount of $139 unexpectedly.  I called the company to return the product and was on hold for an hour.  I had to pay to ship the product back AND I will be charged a $10 restocking fee.  Any product that works well would not have to sink to this unethical style of advertising.</li>
            <li> An amazing cream that has a pleasant strong scent that goes away. This cream does what it says, I like to use it around my sagging neck and jowls area also around sides of my mouth, it stings a bit, then goes away, I guess a sign that it is working. Placing foundation over it is tricky though as it leaves the skin feeling sticky. You will have to use a powder only foundation and pat it on rather than stroke it on. Also a bit pricey, but then it is one of those miracle creams. I like to use it over the wrinkless cream, its partner cream. Try it, you will love what transformation takes place before your eyes on your face and neck!</li>
            <li> Hide your wallet. Quick. Ever heard the phrase, &amp;#34;this stuff sounds too good to be true?&amp;#34; Well, Luxoderm could take top billing in the dictionary of old adages. This skin product reeks of dead fish washed ashore when you open the jar. Imagine rubbing this cream on your thighs every day! The smell lingers and lingers, rank beyond words. Not only are the claims of a 47% average improvement of skin texture false, but thanks to the stench of this cream, your love life will be non-existent.</li>
            <li> I found this product useful but not necessary.</li>
            <li> Would give it zero if that was an option! MISLEADING. States 60 day trial but only 1 product has 60 days. The other is only 30 d at a. Don&#x27;t waste money!!!!!!! Still as much flab as before. Also you get 2 bottles,but if you try second bottle refund is negated why send it if you&#x27;re not supposed to try if? FREE TRIAL COST ME OVER 200.00, with no results it doesn&#x27;t work!!!!!</li>
            <li> OK but expensive after trial.</li>
            <li> Of all the facial products I&#x27;ve tried, I can say this is the only one where I actually see a difference. I use it on my neck -not my face - but I can see a difference in the skin. This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Not only is this product not effective, the advertisement is very deceptive. Also, when dealing with customer service, and they are utterly an incredibly rude and impossible to deal with. I have never encountered a less professional and more rude customer service department.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and I like it so far</li>
