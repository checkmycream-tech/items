            <li>Also, I am very happy with it controlling my acne.</li>

            <li>but it did an excellent job getting rid of all my blackheads.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>But either way, I&#x27;m very happy with how well my skin is looking these days.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s best to use a cleanser with out moisturizer or anything that will leave a residue on your face, it affects the efficacy of the peel).  </li>
            <li>Lol!  </li>

            <li>Every time I read reviews saying \\&quot;It&#x27;s a miracle\\&quot; or \\&quot;Best product</li>
            <li>This peel is just perfect.</li>
            <li>All in all, a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>My skin looks the best it has in over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>May 6th, really impressive because I&#x27;m in Toronto Canada.  </li>
            <li>Best thing I ever bought for acne.</li>
            <li>This is the best balance for me, as well as the glycolic acid they make.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve found on amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Really awesome...</li>
            <li>great product!</li>
            <li>Great!!!</li>
            <li>:D</li>
            <li>Then I decided to see what was the best reviewed acne treatment on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed: scars were there still.    </li>
            <li>GOOD LUCK!!!!</li>
            <li>you serivce excellent</li>
            <li>I tried Glycolic acid for months and wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>I used it as directed and am so impressed.</li>
            <li>which is probably the best I can say about this.</li>
            <li>The peeling is perfect.</li>
            <li>This is the best thing to help keep your pores from clogging.  </li>

            <li>This is one of the best \\&quot;over the counter\\&quot; product I have ever</li>
            <li>I am extremely impressed.</li>
            <li>This gel peel was perfect.</li>
            <li>Salicylic Acid is working great at minimizing the blackheads!  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent treatment for clearing up blemish-prone skin and maintaining a clearer complexion.</li>
            <li>Probably not for everyone, but it worked for me and I&#x27;m very happy.  </li>
            <li>I also purchased the skin PH balancer which feels awesome after rinsing off the peel.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had the best skin; it&#x27;s always been oily and I suffer from blackheads and large-ish pores.  </li>
            <li>and I have seen wonderful results.</li>
            <li>Cellbone Technology is a great product!</li>
            <li>This product is great!  </li>
            <li>And I am very happy for what I am getting out of it.</li>
            <li>Best thing to do is take your shower after your minutes are up and rinse off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to use it forever!!!</li>

            <li>They have beautiful skin, like a 20-something should.</li>
            <li>and my skin has been beautiful since and has not returned to its prepeel state even after I stopped the peels.</li>
            <li>I see this beautiful skin appearing.</li>
            <li>my face has become beautiful again.</li>
            <li>The consistancy is good and the strenght is perfect.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>Now almost all of my acne is gone, I just need to get rid of the scars, which this is also doing a great job of.</li>
            <li>this works great, just what i wanted.</li>
            <li>which was great.</li>
            <li>My neighbor commented on how great my face looked on day 3.</li>
            <li>but i decided to brave it anyway.</li>
            <li>This doctor gives great tips on skin.    </li>
            <li>But THEN, I read great reviews for this product, so I decided to try it out.     </li>
            <li>Oh and great shipping</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>Still happy.</li>
            <li>I was not taking any chances LOL</li>
            <li>That alone is a great reason to get this.</li>
            <li>It was working great</li>
            <li>I am using Cetaphil and it works great.</li>
            <li>it would be great where i could use a product that would reduce the oil</li>
            <li>I used it on my clients and myself and have seen great results.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I thought my face was in hell, lol.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great industry to make money I bet.</li>
            <li>The acne on both cheeks has improved greatly, however, my forehead hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li>I have been seeing great results.</li>
            <li>I have also started to use this on my chest and it has been working great there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for selling this Its a great product.</li>
            <li>Greatly helped my acne prone skin when nothing else worked for years.</li>
            <li>Another great thing about this product is that it evens out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>That 20 minutes burned lol</li>
            <li>and I see a great difference already.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m so happy.</li>
            <li>But this one has been great.  </li>
            <li>This was a great discovery for me.  </li>
            <li>Buy it you will be happy.</li>
            <li>but I have to say this is a great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great peel.  </li>
            <li>I know it will take quite awhile for my skin to look as great as I want it too</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Product works great, noticeable immediate improvement, though not drastic.</li>
            <li>As others have said, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>(but both are great).</li>
            <li>I have been using for a week now, and I have never found a product that works as great.</li>
            <li>For the price and quality, it was great.</li>
            <li>(I have experienced the burning in the Doctors office).</li>
            <li>I am so proud of my face texture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>For the value, it&#x27;s great and it works as stated.</li>
            <li>This works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seeing a specialist is the best thing to do, so do this regimen at your own risk.</li>
            <li>I feel hopeful and happy because this product works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cost certainly is a great value.</li>

            <li>This one is great.</li>

            <li>I use salicylic or glycolic in my face lotion sometimes and those work great</li>
            <li>but you have to do something to distract you while its on lol.  </li>
            <li>Even if it doesn&#x27;t, its still a great product for people prone to get blemishes.  </li>
            <li>Even if it doesn&#x27;t, its still a great product for people prone to get blemishes.  </li>
            <li>dancing, LOL, or folding laundry, or play cnady</li>
            <li>Use this for acne every once in a while for spot treatment leaving it on for about 30 seconds, but the reason this is a great product is it cured my planters wart.</li>

            <li>great stuff.</li>
            <li>works great.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;ve been fighting the great fight against acne for years now.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews I see from freaked out people have a great deal to do with them not understanding how chemical peelswork.  </li>

            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this stuff!!</li>
            <li>It is important to know how your skin will react to a peel!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and very effective.</li>
            <li>Very effective product</li>
            <li>It was still very effective.</li>
            <li>Were very nice and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>amazing!</li>
            <li>but I found an amazing fix and my skin looks!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, its still an amazing product!</li>
            <li>It was amazing!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I have used the peel twice and my skin is amazing!  </li>
            <li>It was amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff, as I said burns and tingles, but when the procedure is done - my skin feels amazing!</li>
            <li>This amazing!</li>
            <li>and then up it to once a day for a week and saw amazing results!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>It was amazing!</li>
            <li>I am sure with repeated use (it says 6 treatments for best results)</li>
            <li>(ps don&#x27;t buy that it&#x27;s OTC products you can buy at the store, just do the evaluation and it&#x27;ll tell you what to buy :P)</li>
            <li>I used neutrogena healthy skin moisturizer and my skin felt great!</li>
            <li>its been about three weeks now since ive started using this product and the results are remarkable.</li>
            <li>great shipping time and good tracking.</li>
            <li>Happy with the product, shipping time and price!!! :)</li>
            <li>impressed me the most was after my brother used it.</li>
            <li>I have so many great things to say about this product!</li>
            <li>My skin tone is nice and even too!  </li>
            <li>My suggestion is if you use this product stay indoors for some days , because your face will not look pleasant at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SOOOOO EXCITED!!!    </li>
            <li>Im 30 with fair skin</li>
            <li>I thought i&#x27;d give this a go as i&#x27;ve heard good reviews about it.</li>
            <li>I had a salicylic peel at my dermatologist&#x27;s office and loved the results.</li>
            <li>after 3 days I look like I did 3-5 years ago (wrinkle wise)</li>
            <li>I think in combination with good face products, anyone will probably see some good results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never reviewed anything on Amazon before, but this stuff was just too good not to say something about it.</li>
            <li>But it does feel really good when its placed on your skin.</li>
            <li>and you will be good to go.</li>
            <li>but I think this will be a good start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but once you get  use to it you&#x27;re all good.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a good sign.</li>
            <li>It has done a good job of reducing the appearance of my acne scars, and has helped increase skin cell turnover.</li>
            <li>This is also good in spot treatment, I should add.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never take the time to write reviews but this peel worked so good</li>
            <li>Beyond the blackheads that plague my t-zone, my skin is in good shape.     </li>
            <li>This product works really good</li>
            <li>I loved the results.</li>
            <li>Use this product wisely.</li>
            <li>It feels good after having the sting on your face.</li>
            <li>and yet again it was a good choice!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Diaper rash creams contain Zinc - which is really good for skin health.</li>
            <li>:This is a wonderful product but like everything else in life, it&#x27;s not idiot proof.</li>
            <li>it does a good job.</li>
            <li>But this one wasn&#x27;t so good.</li>
            <li>I am not trained so this was a good starter.</li>
            <li>Works good, good service</li>
            <li>Good for oily skin and acne, but \\&quot;always\\&quot; read and follow directions.</li>
            <li>Invest  in a good moisturizer like emu oil to put on after.</li>
            <li>Good choice for immediate results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked so good.</li>
            <li>I feel it was good investment</li>
            <li>and I have a feeling I will see good results.</li>
            <li>Good Luck.</li>
            <li>I have had good results with the use of this peel.</li>
            <li>good stuff</li>
            <li>I figured this peel was a good place to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>did me good</li>
            <li>it burned a surprising amount.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I read some really good reviews on this product and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I spend a good two minutes letting it work its way all over my face.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for people that want to reduce the spots and light wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I saw the good reviews and wanted to remove the acnes and acne marks by purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li>Good luck to all using this product.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of good reviews on this</li>
            <li>Water is a good neutralizer, so I just rinse in the shower,</li>
            <li>Use a good moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**For those who have good results with &#x27;frosting&#x27;</li>
            <li>Idk… I figure flakey is good, even though i prefer non flakey?</li>
            <li>good purchase</li>
            <li>I do recommend using a good moisturizer and even supplementing it with a good serum with lots of cell communicating ingredients and antioxidants.  </li>
            <li>which is totally a good sign thus explains the word PEEL on this product.</li>
            <li>NO MATTER HOW GOOD OF A CONDITION YOUR SKIN IS IN</li>
            <li>Good product, works as described.  </li>
            <li>I think that for me BHA is superior to AHA for my skin-type</li>
            <li>good stuff.</li>
            <li>I had an allergic reaction to it, so it wasn&#x27;t the best fit for me</li>
            <li>My face is always even and beautiful now, this is definately my favorite of the peels skin laboratory puts out.</li>
            <li>I feel beautiful :-)))</li>
            <li>/&gt;It didn&#x27;t perform miracles but the results were good, and I was very pleased with this product; I recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product, I just haven&#x27;t had good results.</li>
            <li>The shipping and service is quick, the product is excellent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a wonderful product and a wonderful way for getting medical office results at home for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>Am very very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>[ I decided to buy this peel in combination with the glyco/lac peel because so many people I know rave about how great the peels are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of skincare products from just about every brand out there: Fresh, Philosophy, Murad, Proactiv, Ole Henriksen, DDF (which is awesome but not for this), Skoah, Dermalogica, Skyn Iceland, etc etc.  </li>
            <li>and i experienced no problems at all, just be sure to follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>I am VERY SATISFIED with my results and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>I love this peel and the price is great.</li>
            <li>Additionally, make sure you have a great non-irritating serum and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this product and it is a great value.  </li>
            <li>Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad that I took that fateful chance.</li>
            <li>I plan to use it more often, but things are going great.</li>
            <li>is a wish list with lots of skincare goodies that I love where you can find some GREAT stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a great moisturizer to put on after the application, you&#x27;ll need it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, no irritation, beautiful results.</li>
            <li>For $20 this is a great deal,  now I am excited about trying the glycolic peel too!  </li>
            <li>but I reapplied the peel on day 3 for another 2 minutes and the results were even better!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Use an spf most definitley!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>

            <li>You&#x27;ll love what you see in the mirror!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend more!</li>
            <li>I use it quite often, much more often than it is recommended - 3-4 times a week!</li>
            <li>You rub the gel on your face with a cotton ball and let it work its magic!</li>
            <li>I love this peel!</li>
            <li>Sellers, list this poison because many of us are avoiding it!</li>
            <li>I will keep using this product for sure!    </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>If anything, it already looks better!</li>
            <li>Perfect and exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>and it worked even better!</li>
            <li>Just keep expectations reachable.&lt;br /&gt;;) best of luck and keep smiling</li>
            <li>Beats having to make an appointment, drive and pay a lot more for someone else to do it!</li>
            <li>Before using this, I wasn&#x27;t able to leave the house without caking on layers of foundation and now I honestly have no problem going out without any at all!.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I use it often and many of their products!</li>
            <li>aside, the peel works wonderfully and does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>But the flakes are very kind and easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>get that this product is good for acne scars and pimple prevention, but I was also hoping it was good for fine line</li>
            <li>Very good, powerful product.</li>
            <li>Great product and very fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>In fact, before I purchased it I told everyone I&#x27;d found this amazing peel on Amazon</li>
            <li>Well I deiced to try this peel, and it was absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>These products are really amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is an amazing product, but not for me.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and did wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Its amazing and everyone who has ance should try it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>, it works amazing if used correctly.  </li>
            <li>My husband also uses the peel for his face and it has done an amazing job on his skin.  </li>
            <li>but when I read the amazing reviews this product had on Amazon</li>
            <li>This peel is really amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It was amazing</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li>It can be purchased real cheap on the web.</li>
            <li>This works amazingly well for that use.</li>
            <li>amazing product,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how all these people talk about the amazing results.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll be honest</li>
            <li>sure you use a good moisturiser</li>
            <li>So, if that&#x27;s what you want which I think anyone who does not have too much \\&quot;skin\\&quot; issues might, this is the perfect product.</li>
            <li>I am trying to relieve some of my acne scars and this one is nice.</li>
            <li>Assuming Origins was really effective, I have nothing to blame but the peel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I started the peel I used a cotton pad and rubbed rubbing alcohol all over my face, which ouch, kind of stung.</li>
            <li>Build up to a time that would be effective for you, and it will give results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li>I will also recommend applying this product on to some kind of cotton pad to use as an applicator to facilitate the application process.     </li>
            <li>I will recommend some kind of moisturizer to alleviate the drying of the skin.  </li>
            <li>thanks to skin laboratory for this awesome product!!!</li>
            <li>You have to assess your own skin sensitivity to see what you can/can&#x27;t handle</li>
            <li>I decided why not take something good and make it better?</li>
            <li>Loved it then, love it now.</li>
            <li>It is an extremely effective spot treatment and weekly peel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Salicylic acid is self-neutralizing and thus neutralizing it with a baking soda and water solution will do more harm than good.</li>
            <li>I tried every kind of cleanser you can name...</li>
            <li>Lathering on tons of moisturizer afterwards is the most rewarding part, your face feels incredibly baby-soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>This is an effective product.</li>
            <li>When applying, it feels warm immediately.</li>
            <li>For me, it tingled about 30 seconds in, and then by a minute it was a warm stinging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months and find it to be ok on melasma and sun spots, but surprisingly good on my rosacea.  </li>
            <li>I recomend this product to anyone that has struggled with acne and is ready to give up, try this and see how wonderful you face can look.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been working with Chemical Peels for years and we have really liked how this product works.  </li>
            <li>, it was so nice</li>
            <li>and I honestly see no difference.</li>
            <li>I guess you ahve to make sure you have a good ventilation when applying this.</li>
            <li>For all of you who have scars of your own or who know someone who can&#x27;t get their&#x27;s to go away, recommend this product PLEASE.</li>
            <li>Im not too thrilled about</li>
            <li>i used this kind before.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re the kind who could not tolerate pain than i suggest to stay away from this peel), after the 1 minute is up</li>
            <li>/&gt;Followed by THAYER&#x27;S Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner which i bought here on Amazon</li>
            <li>APPLYING THAYER&#x27;S Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this stuff.</li>
            <li>Besides that, this is a great product, and its really made my face look much better!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also going to use a bit over the rest of my face because it DOES smooth out the flesh very nicely.     </li>
            <li>This product works the best of anything I have ever tried to keep my skin clean and smooth with no breakouts.</li>
            <li>I am so excited and happy with this product...</li>
            <li>The balancer is worth the [...] bucks!!!</li>
            <li>It takes time - but it will be worth it!!!</li>
            <li>My skin will never be perfect but it is now 100x better than it used to be, all thanks to this product!</li>
            <li>The packaging is ideal and the bottle is dark, which is excellent for the preservation of the potency of the contents.</li>
            <li>The blackheads are most bothersome because they&#x27;re exceptionally noticeable on my nose and chin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that I had a face full of acne, I just have never been happy with the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li>I have received salicylic peels 20% from the dermatologist office with great results - full peel within 7 days and no additional acne.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t gotten any more large pimples since I started this peel which is awesome.</li>
            <li>It is amazing and the price is even more amazing.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fairly used to strong products, but regardless my skin dries up and looks flaky, no matter what.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already super happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It is a very strong gel peel.</li>
            <li>it is very strong</li>
            <li>so acne comes very easily.</li>
            <li>Very happy with it so far!</li>
            <li>This one is good for every 10-15 days treatment but b/c of my age, I&#x27;ll need something stronger for the fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li>For me, the best product to clear acne and soothe my skin is still Queen Helene&#x27;s Mint Julep Mask:</li>
            <li>Neutralizer skin pH balancer helps balance the pH of your skin for the safe and effective neutralization after peeling.]]</li>
            <li>In my attempts to find suitable cleansers, from mud bars to sea salts and everything in between, I came across the salicylic acid peel.    </li>
            <li>will the  hope that I will  achieve more effective results.</li>
            <li>It makes the skin around my mouth flaky for a couple of days but using a good noncomedogenic, fragrance free lotion afterwards helps.</li>
            <li>Do some of your own research and try to find some competitive products that work better.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really good for reducing the size of huge acne.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found it most effective to use it twice a month &amp; leave it on for 30 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li>By far, it is the  best peel I have ever encountered.</li>
            <li>It worked and I liked it, but after using 4 tubes I was looking for something more</li>
            <li>Apart from that, it is a good peel to start off with and advantage is even people with no experience like myself could get started and comfortable with it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a way to get rid of premenstrual zits, What i&#x27;ve found to be more effective is to ice the zit immediately when you start to feel it forming under the surface.</li>
            <li>Wow am I happy that I bought this!  </li>
            <li>So far its the best thing i&#x27;ve tried for acne,</li>
            <li>I think that is the safest and most effective way to use this product.</li>
            <li>B002NBJAWI Physicians Formula Tinted Moisturizer SPF-15, Fair to Light 1122 1 fl oz (30 ml)]] and a translucent face powder</li>
            <li>I cant even imagine what it will do for me after the recommended 6 treatments for full results!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things about salicylic acid, but I don&#x27;t know if it just isn&#x27;t right for my skin</li>
            <li>arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li>My sensitive areas peeled quite a bit and underneath revealed very smooth, perfect lookin skin.</li>
            <li>(forgot the term te dermatologist gave) for years and have been trying to get it off my chest for YEARS and this stuff makes it fade every day and so far it has done more in a week than I have in those years!!!</li>
            <li>So far so good!!! :-)</li>
            <li>I used this product for 4 weeks, once every 5 days and the only outcome was incredibly dry/old looking skin even if I used a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>And I have never been able to use a moisturizer without breaking out-so it is nice to be able to use one now.  </li>
            <li>I applied this to my nose where my freckles are the most abundant and the most visible.</li>
            <li>This product is great for beginners, the tingle was still very intense -</li>
            <li>Better yet, buy form a reputable company that can give good and accurate instructions.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying the first time I tried it, I didn&#x27;t apply it \\&quot;right\\&quot; (LOL).</li>
            <li>Happy I tried this first instead of spending the money on a chemical peel at a doctors office.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true my skin starts to tingle when I apply the salicylic peel, but it&#x27;s good because I know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>I found this online and ordered it because of the reviews, though I must admit some sounded too good to be true.</li>
            <li>My skin is very smooth now and the hyperpigmentation is almost gone.  </li>
            <li>I have had some very light peeling and i feel like my skin has improved after a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li>A good, Cetaphil-like lotion quickly took care of that.    </li>
            <li>Best price I found, super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I also used it for fine lines works nicely with the glycolic acid would recommend using the both a day apart or so.</li>
            <li>Which is fine, please don&#x27;t have the warrior mentality about this stuff because I honestly believe that you get better results by gradually easing into it.</li>
            <li>but I am 25 years old, very fair skin, also mild-moderate acne.</li>
            <li>I have very fair and sensitive skin, so I was a bit worried about redness, and peeling.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair and sensitive skin and seem to have hormonal acne that started in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to use since my skin is very fair and sensitive.</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend using her steps for the use of this product, as it will greatly help with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have noticed an improvement I have a healthy glow to my skin</li>
            <li>sure it burns with application and gets some getting used to</li>
            <li>I have tried the peel and I must say I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>just more tingling</li>
            <li>Make sure to purchase the neutralizer with this though, it does tend to burn.</li>
            <li>Sure I got hyperpigmentation</li>
            <li>I would sincerely recommend everyone to steer of this product.</li>
            <li>skin is so baby smooth!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Plus, my skin looks baby smooth!</li>
            <li>If you need more education, research on youtube for a channel called \\&quot;DermTV\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I just be sure to moisturize after using...as the directions state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I thought I would never be able to say that.</li>
            <li>in fact, I feel better without it.</li>
            <li>It works so much better</li>
            <li>I needed another bottle and realized that the salicylic acid is more specialized for acne</li>
            <li>my skin looks so nice, even,and what is the most important</li>
            <li>I used to break out every day and now it is maybe once a week, but it is getting better....</li>
            <li>Well, I love this product and it definatelly help me have a better skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know much more than that about the science of peeling, but 20% of salicyclic acid seemed more like a percentage a dermatologist would prescribe.</li>
            <li>, a lot more will work even better.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I followed the directions; I didn&#x27;t leave it on longer than 8 minutes, and I didn&#x27;t use it more than once a week.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is appropriate or not...</li>
            <li>I love it,  it works.</li>
            <li>-Face became much more smoother, the scars got blended in(not</li>
            <li>I have never been so pleased with a product in my life.</li>
            <li>Man am I pleased.  </li>
            <li>I need more time to tell.</li>
            <li>Most acne clearing gels have 2 % salicylic acid ingredients, this has 20% ...</li>
            <li>I love the refreshing feeling of the peel after its washed off.</li>
            <li>It does burn a bit, but make sure you read the directions.</li>
            <li>and I think this product would benefit those who have pustule acne alot better since that lays on the surface as opposed to underneath the skin like mine.  </li>
            <li>My acne has improved alot, my skin is getting better every week I use this.</li>
            <li>TCA peel seems to work better with the Salicylic acid peel.</li>
            <li>I use prescription Retin A as well and this works so much better.</li>
            <li>This time, I was able to leave it on for about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure to follow the instructions step-by-step</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad this stuff exists...</li>
            <li>&quot; I love the results, I peel once a week and will taper off to once a month soon.</li>
            <li>I am able to apply the solution faster and spread it more evenly.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you wash your hands with soap and water after the solution has been applied to your face.</li>
            <li>If it is peeling or irritated allow more days in between uses.</li>
            <li>micro needling is the better way to go, be patient but that works better</li>
            <li>I guess I can not leave it until my life style become healthy.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I have to pour a bit more into my hand to get it all done.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have already ordered more, even though I have not even used a quarter of the bottle that I started with.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>My blackheads seem to be more pronounced</li>
            <li>Hopefully with continued use, I will see better results.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad to say that this one did.</li>
            <li>and it eventually got better, please let me know.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in my 30s and get more acne now than I did as a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;Oral</li>
            <li>and I am peeling much more</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, for sure.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to follow the instructions to the letter for safety.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>After 1-2 months, I stopped and started using Origins (serum + moisturizer) and my skin was making much better progress.  </li>
            <li>A year ago my skin was PERFECT, unblemished and smooth.</li>
            <li>Maybe I should use it more than once a week?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through many 3-step acne product lines including AcneFree, Clinique Acne Solutions, and others that either irritated my skin or just didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how to rate this product.</li>
            <li>I am glad I tried the product though and know that my face can handle chemical peels.</li>
            <li>The peeling that&#x27;s most noticeable is on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Most make up, perfumes, and lotions break my skin out into a rash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to start looking for a better moisturizer to use that</li>
            <li>If acne and blackheads are really your deal, I would still suggest the acne.org Treatment to tighten pores; however, if that also isn&#x27;t your deal whatever cream or serum deals with you would go great &lt;here&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I found it and look forward to additional glow![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>skin is not awful.</li>
            <li>For me personally, the 20% peel is perfect.</li>
            <li>I have stopped using this because for me it causes more damage than it fixes.</li>
            <li>(I used a paper towel folded into a triangle to apply and my favorite healing lotion since I couldn&#x27;t wait to buy gauze and the recommended non-comedonic moisturizer.)</li>
            <li>It will get better off and on, but it never sticks.</li>
            <li>I want to be able to use makeup to enhance features, not cover them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>anyone has any advice, I&#x27;d love to hear it.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s one more product?</li>
            <li>Just be patient and persistent. :)</li>
            <li>i love to see bc</li>
            <li>This is the best anti-acne product that I ever buy, it works just in 1 week, the only thing you have to do is use a cream fro hydration.</li>
            <li>It will sting for sure upon application, but will not be noticeable after removal of product.  </li>
            <li>I used to get really shiny about an hour after applying my makeup, but now my face looks great throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>:]  </li>
            <li>That alleviated the pain almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this and hope to see even more results.</li>
            <li>I am ordering some more when I use this.    </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have bought her proactive and many over the counter products that just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>you will love this product.  </li>
            <li>I will be sure to put plenty on.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to do this</li>
            <li>More sanitary than using a brush over and over also.</li>
            <li>(happened to the area that \\&quot;stung\\&quot; most when peel was on).  </li>
            <li>I am guessing that I&#x27;m going to like the results of this peel better than the combo peel because it is stronger</li>
            <li>I was able to leave the combo peel on for 5 minutes on non-sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>this with the oil and the dirt and the touching of the face and boom--constant acne, with severe cysts.    </li>
            <li>Anything more than 2.5%</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to get the results promised.  </li>
            <li>My pimple scar seems like it looks a bit better, but that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li>However, after 5 minutes or more the acid is neutralized and I could see immediate improvement on my skin, smoother and the redness was gone.  </li>
            <li>With the help from Neutrogena&#x27;s pore refining skin toner, oil-eliminating cleanser, and Skin Laboratory&#x27;s gel peel, my skin looked a lot smoother and had a healthy glowing feel.</li>
            <li>so I can have a spotless and healthy skin once again.</li>
            <li>and I sometimes use it more often than advised(don&#x27;t do it because I do).</li>
            <li>Once a week, and skin is so much better.  </li>
            <li>(I wouldn&#x27;t use more than once a week though).  </li>
            <li>This is because after applying this my skin broke out even more.</li>
            <li>Update: 3 weeks after product.</li>
            <li>This literally has done more damage than harm to my face.</li>
            <li>Why do I here about Proactiv more than this product?</li>
            <li>after a year of investigating i looked further into the salicylic acid peel and found that this is the best product to use for pores because it works from the inside out, not just the surface.</li>
            <li>i am 100% satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>i am 100% satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I recommended it to my friend and she&#x27;s in love with it also.     </li>
            <li>Also the  instructions said to wash off with plenty of water but maybe a PH neutralizer would be better.</li>
            <li>it almost goes on more like a toner, with a cotton pad wiped across the skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne and oily skin for more than 15 years.</li>
            <li>No cleansing, toning or even moisturizing because i thought that would give me more spots</li>
            <li>, i had  so many acne scars</li>
            <li>The truth is that these skin acids can and are used safely on ebony skin tones and have been for years.</li>
            <li>I just bought some more.</li>
            <li>I can use the gel more than once weekly for more than 10 minutes each with no adverse results</li>
            <li>then Glycolic for 8 min( for me salicylic gives me more pain not glycolic).</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>I try to do a peel once a week, sometimes skipping a couple so that my skin can replenish itself appropriately.</li>
            <li>You know your skin better than anyone else.</li>
            <li>Also, do not use this product more than once a week...</li>
            <li>The directions said to use to before the acid peel (and Acid/Beta peel) but I wasn&#x27;t sure about the pH or the sensitivity of my skin to this stuff.    </li>
            <li>This product is EXTREMYLY potent, but the results have been outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My patience has built up after using sooo many products and waiting for results.</li>
            <li>I should have known better.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>The results got better and better as I used it.</li>
            <li>I have had so many problems with my skin.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Its just dries the top layer of the skin but the cystic pimple is still underneath.     </li>
            <li>Ugh...But it is better than before.</li>
            <li>glad I tried this out.</li>
            <li>It will be a spot that will need repeat applications for sure</li>
            <li>My acne is sooooo much better.</li>
            <li>It is NOT going to work for everyone to apply this every night and leave it on, that&#x27;s not how it is designed, but it is as close to amiracle product as I have been able to find.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased.  </li>
            <li>Instead of buying cosmetics with salicylic acid in them already, this allows me much more choice.  </li>
            <li>There is a probably a better way, but this works for me.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will work for me again in my age.  </li>
            <li>and I am really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>(need to see a dermatologist someday!), but this peel seems to be helping it look better for now.</li>
            <li>make up to tinted coverage and and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>No acne, no problems, just want better looking skin.</li>
            <li>My acne has stressed me out more than school work, and I would always try to cover it up with foundation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue using this product for the recommended 6 weeks and see what happens then :)  </li>
            <li>: My skin looked and felt better than it had in years of doctors visits and</li>
            <li>: My skin has never looked better and the scars are beginning to fade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I sincerely wish them luck in finding a solution.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s  &amp; like many others I&#x27;ve tried just about every product out there for my hormonal acne.</li>
            <li>I used it more consistently, I&#x27;m sure my skin would look even better.</li>
            <li>You can use this product without going to a spa and spending $100 or more.</li>
            <li>Although the instructions say not to keep it on for more than 5-7 mins, I keep it on for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>and my face looks way better</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>I did not feel any more buring.</li>
            <li>applied the lactic peel(Intense Repair 88% Lactic Acid Peel Kit with Hyaluronic Acid Repair Cream) to even out the many blemishes</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working much better that way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working ok, dries out my pimples</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re both definitely better than just using face wash and 2.5% SA or BP spot treatments that you can get at the store</li>
            <li>the more you use it, the more change you will see, but give it time.</li>
            <li>make sure to use gloves and ALWAYS moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li>if you want a moisturizer that will help brighten your skin more, look for Avalon brand vitamin C lotion.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use a lot of moisturizer and sun screen throughout the process.</li>
            <li>To get your desired results, make sure you do not OD on peels and give your skin time to replenish.</li>
            <li>I am a lovely latina.</li>
            <li>I bought many products cover up, concealers, foundation.</li>
            <li>Started in the springtime, and now my skin is looking a bit smoother and more mellow-toned.</li>
            <li>But my skin also tend to peel more than I would like after using it.  </li>
            <li>seems more pratical and works better for me.</li>
            <li>It will make these problems MUCH better with time.  </li>
            <li>Soon, my skin started looking a lot better, smoother, and the tone was more even.</li>
            <li>If I am having more acne issues I will follow up the salicylic acid peel with Benzoyl peroxide, but nothing more than 3%</li>
            <li>I will be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did not order the stronger one.</li>
            <li>I hope it helps your skin, too! :)</li>
            <li>I am in LOVE with this product.  </li>
            <li>So because it is going deeper, it is going to shed the deeper layers of skin as well as the top layer.  </li>
            <li>This is why you get better results with Salicylic Acid (BHA)</li>
            <li>I already feel much more confident.  </li>
            <li>Most of my breakouts occur with PMS or when I&#x27;m under a lot of stress.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a diminish in the scarring, and am hoping one day they will be gone for the most part.</li>
            <li>after two weeks or so your skin and acne does look much better.</li>
            <li>Also, for the love of god do not use this all the time.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week which is more than safe and does the job.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my third week (using it 2 times a week), and OH MY GOODNESS, my skin looks awesome!</li>
            <li>Most of friends now want to try this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been acne free for months!</li>
            <li>And being acne free is a dream!</li>
            <li>though I know they&#x27;re not going to go away, I just want something I can do at home to slough off the top layer of the skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is potent and works well.  </li>
            <li>I am an esthetician and have experience with many types of acid products.</li>
            <li>When used on my healthy skin, it did not peel at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about out and need to order more.</li>
            <li>But still my skin is lovely after I wash this off.</li>
            <li>Apply Egyptian Magic or coconut oil heavily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to leave it on for 6 minutes while using a piece of paper to fan my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen Mederma and Mama Lotion do a better job with a 10th of the pain of this product...</li>
            <li>im not using it more then 1 or 2</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product, but since it was \\&quot;professional\\</li>
            <li>now I LOVE</li>
            <li>2 stars is more than generous.  </li>
            <li>but it did what it was supposed to, blend it in a lot better.</li>
            <li>Most of the people I know kept telling me that the scars were \\&quot;barely\\&quot; noticeable.</li>
            <li>I was seeing some results in my acne, but nothing to really say it was a great product.</li>
            <li>Once I was doing it more often, I was seeing more improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>I just saw them faster using it more often, and who doesn&#x27;t like that?</li>
            <li>On a whim I decided to give it one more go.</li>
            <li>Using this product is still a love/hate relationship, but for the most part it is love.</li>
            <li>If I could put pictures up from before and after, I would :)  </li>
            <li>The reason I give this product 5 stars is because it is the only product that gave me the best results within a week, AND I had/have no breakouts (what so ever) since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>That is how I was able to notice \\&quot;It</li>
            <li>Two of them were really cute.</li>
            <li>and then you&#x27;ll have a better idea on which one to order and what to expect.  </li>
            <li>MUCH more than those</li>
            <li>This peel has done more for my rosacea than Finacea, TriLuma cream and all those trips to the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>And, that I had to give it time for it to work its magic.</li>
            <li>Throughout the week, I made sure I follow the instructions</li>
            <li>Beats proactiv for sure.    </li>
            <li>but overall it is great for ance scars toooooo!!!</li>
            <li>I am able to use it for 4-5min every day without peeling/frosting.</li>
            <li>If you follow directions, do patch test and watch time you will be pleased.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be abandoning this \\&quot;entry-level\\&quot; chemical peel because I feel like I&#x27;ve dodged a bullet re more permanent skin damage.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much better.</li>
            <li>and was able to leave it on for the maximum time of 8 minutes by sticking my head in the freezer...</li>
            <li>I dont use it very often, but would probably see great results if i used it weekly.</li>
            <li>how many times I tapped it off.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t get better.  </li>
            <li>I have many crater scars from 11+ years of acne.</li>
            <li>I received many compliments for my skin</li>
            <li>I have had problem skin all my life (I am 21 now and started having acne at 8-so much fun) and as a result I have used my fair share of prescription grade and drug store grade products.</li>
            <li>but as soon as you wash it off you can visibly see where it is doing its magic.</li>
            <li>This made my skin break out MORE.</li>
            <li>skin above my lips looks awesome.</li>
            <li>That worked ok..</li>
            <li>I really LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>It will peel the top layer of existing blemishes too which helps to speed healing.  </li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t expect a drastic change at once, but I&#x27;m sure with continued and controlled use my scars</li>
            <li>Like many people, I have truly tried every product out there.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure what the effect is going to be look like when I put them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the many reviews.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s where I notice the tingling the most.</li>
            <li>I leave it on for about 5 minutes, then I add more to the jawline area where I have cystic acne and some bumpy scarring.</li>
            <li>I still used it and finished the bottle because I just wasn&#x27;t sure what was going on.</li>
            <li>Love this product, changed my LIFE.</li>
            <li>worked better than any acne meds from the dermatologist, and helps more than birth control did too.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and blackheads, mostly on my chin and nose.  </li>
            <li>However, I wish I would have ordered a greater solution like 35% instead.</li>
            <li>and hopefully I will see more results with my blemishes.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product!</li>
            <li>To those to who it worked for then I am glad it works.</li>
            <li>I was able to distract myself for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I was so sure it was going to work</li>
            <li>is acne.org&#x27;s regimen &amp;their products, benzoyl peroxide works for my face,not salicylic, now that I know that I won&#x27;t be touching this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this product has worked so well for others, but for me it seems to be a bust.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many products - over the counter and prescription.  </li>
            <li>but like most say, it makes your skin SMOOTH!  </li>
            <li>but I like washing my face because it is so smooth!</li>
            <li>So as I&#x27;m maturing, I started looking into how to take better care of my face.</li>
            <li>more that once.</li>
            <li>I rubbed that onto my skin instead and have found that it keeps my skin much better hydrated than lotion.</li>
            <li>I tried to wash it more and more but it wouldn&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li>, please elaborate in the comments and indicate your type of skin, ethnicity and skin color.</li>
            <li>I have had many people ask what I am doing</li>
            <li>I use the 20% peel once a week for two months at a time, taking two weeks off and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Product works ok.  </li>
            <li>but now I just tip my fingers over the top and use them to spread the peel.  </li>
            <li>I love using the Salicylic Acid Gel Peel.</li>
            <li>I have given up on foundation all together because I love the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li>After using the product for 2 weeks the break outs almost disappeared and my complexion has been so much more clearer.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t keep it on my skin for more than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>About for many years I stayed on a strict regimen of Retin A, benzoyl peroxide, and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love this salicylic peel.  </li>
            <li>i will write more after awhile....</li>
            <li>Then it just kept getting better.  </li>
            <li>I use often and love this product.</li>
            <li>potent, dont use more than once a week.</li>
            <li>Now, i know that a majority of people misconstrue that indented acne scars are from the effect of picking on acne, which is not always the case for most people.</li>
            <li>but I am sure he is able to do them himself now.</li>
            <li>None of them was realized after using it many times.</li>
            <li>Contrary it made some scars darker and more visible.</li>
            <li>peel again on my face, hands, arms, and chest :).  </li>
            <li>:) To be safe, I am going to wait a week</li>
            <li>MUCH more.  </li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more and continuing the therapy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed and so thankful finally something is working!</li>
            <li>-I also apply vaseline (I use the kind that has cocoa butter mixed in, it smells so good!)</li>
            <li>But armed with both of these products, a good skin regimen, and eating healthy,  I am confident more than I was a year ago that I won&#x27;t have to hide under a inch of makeup pretty soon.</li>
            <li>I am very excited to have found this peel.</li>
            <li>I also have gotten completely unsolicited comments from my friends and family (Some of whom I hadn&#x27;t told about the peel) saying how good my skin has been looking, so I know it isn&#x27;t all just wishful thinking on my part!</li>
            <li>This peel impressed me so much it prompted my first ever Amazon review.</li>
            <li>and my skin comes out nice and clean.</li>
            <li>The breakout quickly went away and my skin is looking better every day!    </li>
            <li>This step is very important because the peel is most effective when the skin is completely clean and free of any residue, oils, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO HAPPY that I finally discovered the magic of salicylic acid!</li>
            <li>My scarring is improved and my skin tone is becoming much more even.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be alarmed or discouraged, in the long run this is for the best.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go for make-up first</li>
            <li>Number one, it does burn pretty good.  </li>
            <li>but this was pretty good.</li>
            <li>and it is working pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Good first time peel for oily skin.</li>
            <li>I have pretty good skim skin</li>
            <li>It would be good to get a face moisturizer with aloe, because it may irritate your skin at first.   </li>
            <li>I had pretty good skin to start with</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this it burned like hell, and I think I have a good tolerance to pain.</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited about this!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: I&#x27;m very happy with this product, doing more progress on clearing my skin more than over a thousand dollars of other products.</li>
            <li>Success!!</li>
            <li>(Happy New Year)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have learned to live with...not happily but as a matter of nature.</li>
            <li>and I will look great in my new skin.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome because it takes away the layers of your skin to get new skin growing, promote healthy cell growth, and with fresh skin it is acne free.</li>
            <li>Now after I use the peel my face looks much better, it has this kind of renewed fresh look to it.</li>
            <li>I have battled mild acne for years--the kind where no matter</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find anything this strong or at this price anywhere.  </li>
            <li>so I develop sunspots more easily than those who are not genetically-inclined.</li>
            <li>A lot of water will do the job to get it off, but strong acids like this will be better neutralized by something specifically designed to do so.</li>
            <li>So far so good but to be honest</li>
            <li>I have never had a facial or experienced any kind of chemical peel.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with what I&#x27;ve seen already and would recommend this product  to anyone who wants to see a real improvement in problem skin - and we all have problem skin in some way, don&#x27;t we?</li>
            <li>I am absolutely astonished that after so many years of battling and trying to hide my acne, it is gone for good, as well as all the scars and pock marks from picking and squeezing to get rid of blemishes</li>
            <li>but because the company is selling it to anyone who wants it and they are not giving good and safe instructions on use and removal of this product.</li>
            <li>far I am MORE than happy with the outcome.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I feel this is an AMAZING product that is very cost effective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I feel this is an AMAZING product that is very cost effective.  </li>
            <li>I now have the type of skin that is clear more often than it is breaking out... something I haven&#x27;t experienced since I was</li>
            <li>I am a happy buyer and I will continue to have clear skin with this product!</li>
            <li>Fine, ok, that means it worked.  </li>
            <li>But i am always able to exfoliate it off easily and conceal it easily.  </li>
            <li>Skin also feels much more smooth without any pimples appearing all the time.</li>
            <li>Read all the instructions, and most importantly listen to your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right from the first use I noticed a radical decrease in pore size (look in a close up mirror 10 minutes after peel and again in the morning to note change), that it was easier to extract goop from my pores and that any cream or treatment worked more effectively proceeding a peel.  </li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>I am so surprised by what a great product this is.  </li>
            <li>I went to work this morning with minimal make-up and it feels absolutely wonderful</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done three peels so far and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I have become more comfortable using this peel and also leaving it on for longer periods</li>
            <li>My acne scars seem to have become more smooth, my face doesn&#x27;t looks as ruddy.</li>
            <li>Well I decided to try this product and so far great</li>
            <li>My skin is so much more even and smooth, and the acne scars are beginning to fade.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re unsure about the peel or if you become overly sensitive to the peel it may be best to talk with a dermatologist, but the most important thing is to follow the instructions EXACTLY.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with the purchase so far.</li>
            <li>i noticed that the tags were getting burned and becoming whitish.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and a lot of professional sites that all said this was a great product and the recovery time would be negligible.</li>
            <li>The Salicyclic Acid 20% Gel Peel, is great for somewhat sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>A friend of mine recommended this to me, and I was surprised and happy when after a month I no longer had any signs of scars on my face.</li>
            <li>My spots were really looking good and fading away.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a good starter peel to really see where you are at regarding chemical peels and your skin.</li>
            <li>I start to flake days afterwards, but it&#x27;s worth it for the nice skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like real acid in the movies (good thing for me)</li>
            <li>Good luck and much caution recommended.  </li>
            <li>Real powerful stuff.</li>
            <li>Friends and family have not stopped complimenting me about my new, beautiful skin--they say not only do I look great</li>
            <li>Amazingly, the product doesn&#x27;t try up your skin right away.</li>
            <li>I saw results right away with this product, its amazing.</li>
            <li>but as of right now i still havent found that amazing product</li>
            <li>The clogged pores and acne will come out real easy and your skin will be super super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That being said, I tried this product for the first time today and already love it!</li>
            <li>It was so cool!  </li>
            <li>You can easily burn your skin.  </li>
            <li>But honestly, it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast and the peel arrived early (in perfect condition).</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t use the peels I use face washes and lotions to prevent breakouts and reduce scars, but the face washes and lotions easily cost me over $80 per month.  </li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t use the peels I use face washes and lotions to prevent breakouts and reduce scars, but the face washes and lotions easily cost me over $80 per month.  </li>
            <li>My skin is much more even toned since using it and it looks much more fresh and youthful.</li>
            <li>This is soooo easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have very mild acne</li>
            <li>I think I will easily get about 15 to 20 applications out of this bottle.</li>
            <li>(my skin dries out easily</li>
            <li>I can easily extract the whiteheads after.</li>
            <li>and my skin tolerates it easily.  </li>
            <li>but I have been putting on toner and that has really been a more effective way of moisturizing my skin immediately after using the peel.    </li>
            <li>So for me it has been much cheaper and much more effective than anything else that I could have used during that time.    </li>
            <li>Rinse with cool (not luke warm) COOL water.</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest using this product.</li>
            <li>20% is really strong.  </li>
            <li>My glycolic peel is strong (40-50%) and I&#x27;m scared that it may overwhelm my skin.    </li>
            <li>So far so good :)</li>
            <li>Strong.  </li>
            <li>but I felt a strong sting immediately.  </li>
            <li>So... if you can just get yourself through the first 3 or 4 minutes, you&#x27;re good to go for the full 7!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>The product is strong and stings my skin</li>
            <li>Some of these products are too strong.</li>
            <li>This product is strong, and you should use it with caution.  </li>
            <li>However, do not give in to the idea that keeping this gel peel on your skin for more than the recommended high of 8 minutes will get better results -- this stuff is potent, so start out keeping it on for one or two minutes at most, then work your way up to the longer treatment.  </li>
            <li>My mother says I should be happy, as this will stave off major wrinklage, but, whilst I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, I&#x27;d like it to be one shade of color until that time.  </li>
            <li>First of all, the shipping was AMAZING.</li>
            <li>it feels really cool and refreshing when the product is on my face.</li>
            <li>I have used many many facial products, but not one as good at this one.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to leave it on for the full 8 minutes from that point on.  </li>
            <li>My skin burns when this on, and it has taken about two months for me to be able to keep it on for the full 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that it clears blemishes fast!  </li>
            <li>Upon my first used, I liked it.</li>
            <li>so i started to put cool water on my face, as i suspected the acid was not coming off and was, in fact, burning even more.   </li>
            <li>So BE AWARE that you will get one if you are prone to them or carry the virus (not the std kind).</li>
            <li>I bought this item to use as a  mild chemical peel, but happily discovered that it works well in controlling new acne breakout.</li>
            <li>This peel has yielded the best results, hands down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also getting fine lines.</li>
            <li>Then I use an AHA cream around my eyes for my fine lines.</li>
            <li>Overall, even though it&#x27;s my first day on this product, I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>and then I&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>and I would be fine.  </li>
            <li>A huge warning in advance is if you can&#x27;t take the pain of a strong burning or tingling sensation then this product is not for you.</li>
            <li>That would have been fine if it weren&#x27;t for my obsession with picking every pimple that I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m beginning to develop fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Considering the price and the result, this is a fine product.</li>
            <li>My skin feels wonderful - amazingly clean and soft, and it looks clearer, brighter and much smoother.</li>
            <li>I am fine with, but this also makes me prone to UV exposure</li>
            <li>We never bought the neutralizer and it works fine without it.</li>
            <li>my fine lines are prominent&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>So once a week is fine for me.  </li>
            <li>my skin quickly got used to this, because i would leave it on for up to 10 mins or more</li>
            <li>This stuff is strong and is not to be taken lightly.  </li>
            <li>Helps zap blemishes quickly!</li>
            <li>this gets results quickly!  </li>
            <li>I luckily had a neutralizer product on hand and was able to save my skin.</li>
            <li>Luckily I have some Obagi Hydroquinone cream!  </li>
            <li>But when used consistently, this is a great product to increase cellular turnover, which will keep your pores more clear and will reduce inflammation.  </li>
            <li>By giving your skin time to heal, and  a little patience, you can get almost perfect skin.</li>
            <li>(I will take Ibuprofin first to help the stinging) to help myself work up to the TCA, which is supposed to sting like a mother! :)  </li>
            <li>I might get a pink flush after I put it on, but I am very fair and have some roscea on my cheeks and</li>
            <li>: I ran out of the stuff and have ordered another bottle, but i have not been getting acne after i stopped, so i think it played a huge role in it.</li>
            <li>my goodness are my pores huge again\\&quot; --</li>
            <li>When I woke up this morning, one of my pimples had a huge whitehead on it but some of the others were minimized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking huge, pus-filled cysts building up along my face like houses lining up beach-front property.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference even after the 1st use.</li>
            <li>I immediately saw a huge difference in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li>Huge, cystic pimples that I would try to pop and nothing would come out.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel oily at all - a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>I already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I am light brown by complexion.</li>
            <li>I followed up with an oil free moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>If anyone has any tips please feel free to respond</li>
            <li>It is also reducing the bumps on my face which is also fantastic.</li>
            <li>This product is really fantastic.</li>
            <li>You may want to go out and buy a light lotion/moisturizer to go with this skin peel.</li>
            <li>Apply product with a cotton ball evenly all over face using a q-tip to get around the nose and lips precisely</li>
            <li>this company is great, the peel always arrives earlier than quoted.</li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;i do see my skin is a light tighter..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone for about two weeks and the results have been simply fantastic.</li>
            <li>Yes, I experienced initial redness   3.  </li>
            <li>This is the 4th week and her skin is almost acne free.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;d look in the mirror, I&#x27;d notice smooth or gunked up pieces of skin.  </li>
            <li>Your pores will then smooth out.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel fantastic</li>
            <li>It took me only one application to see results, but about a month to see good results like the others around here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started light, then added time and more liquid to each session.</li>
            <li>and I was acne free for two weeks.</li>
            <li>I tried everything from Proactiv Solutions to every over-the-counter acne medication available on the market.    </li>
            <li>It makes sense that the most potent way to make best use of a topical medication is to attack the skin in a way such as this (i.e. by shedding).  </li>
            <li>This product is only a catalyst and to an extent greatly accelerates this process.      </li>
            <li>My second peel was the salicylic 20% peel by Skin Laboratory and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>After I use it, it takes literally a week for my skin to stop peeling and become smooth.</li>
            <li>Not only will your skin looks great</li>
            <li>Wash your face three times or two times a day, use sun screen, and oh i forgot to mention the day after the peel I use (Acne free 10 percent benzol peroxide lotion    </li>
            <li>The company also sent a free sample of another acid peel.  </li>
            <li>It works great on teenage acne.  </li>
            <li>My son got great results in a very short period of time.  </li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is a great moisturizer that actually penatrates my skin.</li>
            <li>I have a light brown complexion, so i had some discoloration and it has been somewhat cleared.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t another product like this for such a great price.</li>
            <li>I apply lightly to breakouts.</li>
            <li>It burned away all existing pimples and i woke up the next morning with people commenting on how great my skin looked.</li>
            <li>, blackhead free skin.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Then I wash it off after 5 minutes and then put on an oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Just in the nick of time too because I have an important event coming up</li>
            <li>overall happy with this product, would recommend.</li>
            <li>as though my skin looked/felt great the very next day but through-out the week there was nothing.</li>
            <li>I had never done any facial peels before, and was nervous about the burning sensations that some reviewers had experienced.</li>
            <li>I am an experienced peeler and this one hurt from the second I put in on.</li>
            <li>After using this product it is important to use some type of non-comedogenic moisturizer with an SPF of 30.  </li>
            <li>cheap</li>
            <li>but it is also more powerful.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the OTC spot remover with some success but it takes continuous use of 30 or more days.  </li>
            <li>If you just want to do some light peels or use it for spot acne treatment...</li>
            <li>After rinsing with lots of water I apply Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer with SPF 30.  </li>
            <li>I follow up with the Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I purchased the pH Balancer from Cellbone to use after the peel, with the Balancer, Cellbone included a free 35% Gylocolic Lactic Peel -</li>
            <li>I used the neutralizer and my skin was so smooth.</li>
            <li>Wipe this product on lightly, like a toner, with a cotton pad, avoiding my eyes, sides of my nose, and mouth.  </li>

            <li>Make-up goes on smooth like a dream.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good; my ultra-sensitive skin has taken well to treatments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old with fair, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>I been using this product weekly and so far so good, I am seeing improvement.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve started to use this products my skin looks much better and it does not get oily so fast any more.</li>
            <li>My face is now flawless and the red marks are diminishing fast.</li>
            <li>I do the treatment twice a week at night, and it&#x27;s been good so far.  </li>
            <li>This is as good as it gets professional result.</li>
            <li>It is quite good so far and the product met my expectations.</li>
            <li>I have fair, sensitive skin and this product has done nothing.</li>
            <li>far so good.</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old, I guess it is fair to say I have \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; skin and takes 20% peel with out any problems.</li>
            <li>The only time I had a problem was when I got over-zealous about it and did it 2 or 3 times in one week -- then I aggravated my skin, thinking if once was good, then 2 or 3 times would be even better, which it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you have a very warm and wet washcloth waiting for you in the sink before you start</li>
            <li>Cheap,efficient, and just plain wonderful!!</li>
            <li>I came across this product and with such great reviews, I was so excited to try it</li>
            <li>Thank You so much!!!</li>
            <li>, I tried the baking powder water solution and Man does that really sting!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any huge fading of my brown spot in the first two weeks, but I might have had more luck if I had kept using the product.</li>
            <li>Many of my pimples had become unclogged and were shrinking, many light acne scars had disappeared completely, the stubborn scars had noticeably faded, and my fine lines became even finer.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a strong and effective salicylic acid available!</li>
            <li>I bought this salicylic acid peel to help the mild occasional acne and to just get a good peel and more even tone to my skin.</li>
            <li>The first and most important thing I can express with peels of this nature(glycolic, salicylic, and lactic) is that you need to be PATIENT.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you try it and try all of the tips that I&#x27;ve provided, because I&#x27;ve had amazing results using them</li>
            <li>This is a great sunscreen/moisturizer to followup with as it has a little skin tone evening/ brightening effect and it smells so nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>if I pick or they are bright, takes half the time to heal up- nice of Olay to discontinue the line.)  </li>
            <li>I washed it off with plenty of cool water aft 1 minute and my skin feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>I was familiar with peels and how they were supposed to lift off severe acne scarring and associated discolorations in stages through a peeling process.</li>
            <li>- it didn&#x27;t work for me, but it was worth a try!</li>
            <li>I wrote this original review over 6 months ago.  </li>
            <li>Ok I used it for the first time</li>
            <li>It feels more hot than anything else.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this product, the amount of time after use before my skin would look better was around 2 days.  </li>
            <li>Using it every 5-7 days (I use it every Sunday) is sufficient for great long term results.  </li>
            <li>So i am excited to see the results after 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this peel, I haven&#x27;t even had to use concealer, as my skin tone is significantly evening</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried everything except accutane.</li>
            <li>and I am excited to move up to the 30%.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this peel for almost 2 weeks now and have seen a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>IT WAS WELL WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li>First, don&#x27;t use it more than every 4 days or so depending on your skin.  </li>
            <li>If you follow the directions you should see a significant improvement in your skin within a month.  </li>
            <li>and this has been the only product in the market I have found that&#x27;s been as successful as it claims.  </li>
            <li>-this is a powerful product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to see what the results would be with along term use.</li>
            <li>My skin tone has improved significantly.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I noticed that my skin already looked more luminous and felt so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many products to clear my skin &amp; nothing has worked as well as this!  </li>
            <li>I need to get more consistent in use</li>
            <li>Darker then it originally was including areas on my nose</li>
            <li>The acne bumps were significantly minimized- not gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally got it for my Keratosis Pilaris</li>
            <li>For the first time I am in control of my face - my skin tone looks much better too.</li>
            <li>(it bubbles a lot more with the lactic acid, no worries), face gets really hot for a moment, just keep applying until you do not feel burning.</li>
            <li>(it bubbles a lot more with the lactic acid, no worries), face gets really hot for a moment, just keep applying until you do not feel burning.</li>
            <li>I tried it exactly how instructions showed and even though it  made me break out more i stuck with it for months, in the end</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but I&#x27;ve only done three applications - it does look noticeably better, so I&#x27;m standing by my initial review.</li>
            <li>(apply with a small fan brush works best)</li>
            <li>They are almost completely gone leaving my skin looking very smooth!</li>
            <li>Be warned, this peel burns like a mother, but is so worth it!</li>
            <li>After three peels done weekly, I have seen remarkable improvements in the superficial scarring on my cheeks and a definite evening out of the pigmentation of my skin.</li>
            <li>To my dismay, I woke up in the morning with significant brown patches.</li>
            <li>I was so excited but</li>
            <li>Seriously  worth it!</li>
            <li>It stings just a bit, but for this price and the results, the ending outcome is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I was NOT disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Really excited about the process.  </li>
            <li>If you educate yourself first, you will feel so much better and not freak out</li>
            <li>Clean you area where you are going to apply this using an unscented body wash.</li>
            <li>Gently clean off the water using a cotton cloth (DO NOT RUB).</li>
            <li>Clean with a cotton cloth (DO NOT RUB).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also probably worth mentioning that the only peeling I experienced was on my chin, which was COVERED in super-inflamed pimples.</li>
            <li>but now I have no problem going out with a clean face.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve always liked how salicylic acid makes the overall appearance of my skin look better.</li>
            <li>I researched online for tricks to remove blackheads and was advised to try a salicylic acid mask on my problem areas to clean out the pores.</li>
            <li>I did however splurge and buy 100% natural Argan oil as a recommendation from another reviewer, and since Argan oil has so many more added benefits for your skin</li>
            <li>It is not necessarily a miracle cure, but a HUGE help in fighting the good fight.</li>
            <li>Apply a REALLY GOOD lotion, don&#x27;t skimp on cheap facial lotion here.</li>
            <li>I use it about 2x a week rubbing it on the area with a clean q-tip.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean my pores once in a while</li>
            <li>Clean face with cotton ball damp with rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li>I rinse, clean with Witch Hazel Toner, apply peel...</li>
            <li>Not only did I receive this order SUPER quick, I was eager to use it because of ALL of the GREAT reviews</li>
            <li>You must have Sodium bicarbonate to clean your face after applying it.</li>
            <li>After using the Salicylic Acid (20%) for 3 weeks now, it cleared my mild pimples off my forehead, and my huge pores had tightened up.</li>
            <li>I clean my face in a steamy shower.  </li>
            <li>washed my face with Cetaphil then used Witch Hazel on a cotton ball to start my face with a clean surface.</li>
            <li>I bought it after reading so many positive reviews</li>
            <li>I am glad I thought about it again and all these positive comments confirms my decision.  </li>
            <li>but this works far much better!</li>
            <li>So far I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trust me, once all of the dead skin is gone, you&#x27;ll love how fresh and beautiful your skin looks.</li>
            <li>For those with some experience with chemical peels, this is nothing special.</li>
            <li>it also liquifies blackheads, so you can biore strip right after to pull out everything!</li>
            <li>My experience with most peels, especially salicylic acid, is that it is VERY easy to get sunburn after use even during the winter months.  </li>
            <li>As long as use this regulary my face is clear and looks great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked up facial peels before and at the time it seemed like a good idea.</li>
            <li>so I rinsed well with cool water and</li>
            <li>I rinsed with cool water and used a noncomodogenic moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>Despite trying numerous dermatologists, I never got what I considered good results - just a three minute visit and a couple of scripts.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about it.</li>
            <li>Anyway overall this is a good product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I could say enough good things about this peel.</li>
            <li>I use a hair dryer on my face, on the cool setting, while I am waiting the 8 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I then rinse my face with lukewarm to cool water for about 2 or 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>and I recommend it to everyone that wants better skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will probably increase the time to the full 8 minutes and frequency as others have to see faster results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just bought a stronger concentration from Skin Obsession because I would like more intense results.</li>
            <li>I think this is better for spot treatment rather than the whole face.  </li>
            <li>After seeing such good reviews for this product, I gave it a try today.</li>
            <li>I got this last week and have used it twice already, it burns a fair bit but leaves my skin feeling and looking amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Even if it doesn&#x27;t cure my acne completely the oil elimination is so nice I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to using this peel again and leaving it on full face for longer.  </li>
            <li>The acid will sting more and won&#x27;t provide much help.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>I figured leave good enough alone.</li>
            <li>I believe when I use all of glycolic acid, my facial condition will be good.</li>
            <li>I go back &amp; forth) which is really good for your skin as well.</li>
            <li>It will take awhile to get the full benefit from the peel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone from a full coverage</li>
            <li>we as consumers can buy a product such as this at a fair price.</li>
            <li>To aid in this while the product is on your face fan your face with some paper or put your hair dryer on cool while the Peel is on your face.</li>
            <li>With that said, I&#x27;ve found that the peel is not painful for me</li>
            <li>From what I can tell, it is not cystic acne and is not painful.)</li>
            <li>I tried OTC acne products,not much difference, heck I tried so many things</li>
            <li>Sure I&#x27;d get some peeling but nothing really changed.</li>
            <li>I really have enjoyed the results and</li>
            <li>My hyper pigmentation hasn&#x27;t showed much improvement, but I just need to give it more time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hyper pigmentation hasn&#x27;t showed much improvement, but I just need to give it more time.  </li>
            <li>gone!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2-3 weeks, using it  every week as a full peel, but in between peels i use it as a miracle spot treatment and to get rid of a gnarly sunspot i have.</li>
            <li>so I could leave it on the full 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Maybe a more aggressive dermatologist would have done some sort of treatments to fade my redness, but my doctor was very nonchalant about my skin, told me that I was basically stuck with the redness.  </li>
            <li>In my own experience i recommend applying some castor oil after to leave your skin soft and help neutralize the acid.    </li>
            <li>I am a red head with medium to fair skin.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I really do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked my way up to the full eight minutes, and the burning isn&#x27;t to terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any good advice for this problem, not from derms nor various estheticians.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I&#x27;m even giving bottles away as Christmas presents.</li>
            <li>I love it really works greats</li>
            <li>but it got such good reviews that I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I leave this on for five minutes, then I rinse with cool water and baking soda to neutralize the acid.</li>
            <li>it has kept my facial blemishes to a minimum, lightened up sun spots and people tell me my skin looks good after I use it.  </li>
            <li>just use cool to lukewarm water and rinse, rinse, rinse and rinse some more&lt;</li>
            <li>She also said it is a good idea to get a facial done with extractions when using this product.  </li>
            <li>but it was not bad at sll&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The healing process was not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I tan very easy and am very sensitive to the sun (hyperpigmentation),</li>
            <li>found the cost of this product to be VERY reasonable when you consider how easy it is to go to any drugstore, makeup counter or makeup/skincare store.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Surprisingly it has not dried out my face however the first time I used it, I did break out, but it cleared up quickly.</li>
            <li>Great product I have just used it once but can feel the difference my face feels smooth and less oily</li>
            <li>The peel is effective, easy to apply, and it doesn&#x27;t run when applied properly.</li>
            <li>After i used all my salicylic acid, my right side of face was acne free</li>
            <li>The face did not react as strong as the first time.</li>
            <li>And my face reacted as strong as I first time used it.</li>
            <li>but I have high hopes that my skin will be much smoother and more appealing.</li>
            <li>used to suffer from acne and used accutaine for 10 months and my skin was clear and felt great for about 5 months, but after that, I started breaking out again (to a smaller degree, but my skin was supposed to be clear for good).</li>
            <li>My skin is visibly clearer, lighter due to the fact that the hyperpigmentation is fading, i just look great</li>
            <li>I will be excited to write a review that would be worth 10 stars to me.</li>
            <li>I have great results with this acid in other products but have never tried this strength until now.  </li>
            <li>I am a Caucasian, 20 year old female with very fair and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle is small but the product applies easily and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be able to get much more than the 15 applications</li>
            <li>This stuff is seriously the best thing I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I am a licensed cosmetologist &amp; have received esthetics training, but those willing to READ, follow instructions &amp; be patient should do fine applying this product &amp; receiving its benefits.</li>
            <li>It keeps that fresh clean look on your face all the time.</li>
            <li>I first got a glycolic acid and started to use it and it worked pretty well, my skin was much more even and healthier.</li>
            <li>but i think it clogged my pores and cause mild acne.    </li>
            <li>I bought this product to help even out some redness and solve mild acne.</li>
            <li>I have mild papular acne</li>
            <li>This peel will slowly clear your pores and leave your skin more even and acne free.</li>
            <li>My tolerance to the stinging sensation grew quickly, and I did not go through any peeling.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is for people with oily skin, or severe acne, or mild acne, or something that I don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>But even after leaving it on for such a short time I have had great results!  </li>
            <li>I am now able to leave it on for several minutes and am seeing more noticable improvement.</li>
            <li>If anything, I might apply this on a larger zit, but beyond that, I don&#x27;t think this is the best thing for my entire face.  </li>
            <li>I had a mild breakout on my chin and forehead after this peel in areas</li>
            <li>After about two days, I noticed mild peeling.  </li>
            <li>However, when I saw mild inflammation from acne, I would use both.  </li>
            <li>In conclusion, I&#x27;ve listened to many stories and tried many different products to make my nose not look like Rudolf the Reindeer.  </li>
            <li>Best part is, I don&#x27;t even need a expensive cleanser and moisturizer to have healthy skin now.</li>
            <li>I have never seen results with a product this quickly.</li>
            <li>Since A.Americans have more pigment in their skin, this is more likely to happen to them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for acne-prone skin, and gentle enough that you could use it on a teenager.</li>
            <li>I suffer from mild acne</li>
            <li>but it quickly disappeared the day after.</li>
            <li>It just became super unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Mild stinging.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne and some clogged pores and the winter season</li>
            <li>My skin has quickly and drastically improved-</li>
            <li>I have been using the peel very 5 days or so, and my friends have noticed how clear and bright my face looks.</li>
            <li>20% Gel Peel save for pregnant women??&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has helped me with acne scars and mild pigmentation that was visible on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mild peeling.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother with the mild salicylic acid products that do nothing for acne.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>that background, this salicyclic peel is rather mild for me.</li>
            <li>Luckily my face was not scared</li>
            <li>, I understood that other reviewers said you&#x27;ll break out before it gets better, well, I broke out but never got better!</li>
            <li>I am so happy because I was always asked about my scars and I was very self-conscious, but now I don&#x27;t think they are noticeable enough to attract anyone&#x27;s attention.</li>
            <li>Some quick FYI:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I am making progress, and it does not evaporate so quickly as to cause application problems.</li>
            <li>My skin is also really sensitive, it gets irritated very easily.</li>
            <li>product worked great, wasn&#x27;t too strong and I only peeled slightly or not at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so when I first applied it - the burning sensation was a huge surprise.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference my very first time.  </li>
            <li>Although I experienced a bit of irritation for about 1hr afterwards, the next morning my skin looked better than ever and my pores were visibly smaller.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and am very pleased by the results after only one use.</li>
            <li>Using the copper along with it (peel in the morning, copper 2x at night), the scar has become much more like the normal surrounding skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very responsible company !    </li>
            <li>Thank you very much !</li>
            <li>I think someone with the same skin situation as me would really benefit from this product and for the really great price, its worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li>this gives you very fast results!</li>
            <li>Generally you must neutralize any acid then remove it with a warm cloth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered from pretty severe acne problems for about four or five years now, and my face hasn&#x27;t been free of a breakout since before my teens.</li>
            <li>brushes are pretty cheap and they are fan brushes</li>
            <li>glad I read other reviews because I created my own ph balancer for after I rinse the peel.  </li>
            <li>This product is good but definitely not professional quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a slave for skincare, so I&#x27;ve tried many different peels over the last 16 years,  this one by far gave me the best result for an at home treatment.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Then I follow with a good moisturizer like Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Beauty Facial Cream or Curel&#x27;s Ultra Healing (both are great on sensitive skin and even open skin).</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product after reading all of the great reviews on it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this product more that once a week since skin needs time for new skin cells.</li>
            <li>love my new skin peel</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t try this before, I was contemplating getting laser done, but this seams to be an easy fast and inexpensive way to solve my problem.</li>
            <li>(which by the way don&#x27;t help much unless its very mild acne).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Had acne, acne scarring, large pores, oily skin, and two fine lines on my forehead when I bought product.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li>I had suffered from hyperpigmentation, acne, fine lines and large pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though I had been using VERY high SPF and very water/sweat proof, on my face for many years...and was wearing it FULL TIME on this trip...</li>
            <li>This is very very important as this layering causes a deeper peel and consequently more sensitive new skin.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so a great success for one person may not mean everyone will benefit from this peel.  </li>
            <li>I will say that the first time I used it, there was significant discomfort.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so terrified of burning my skin off, that I literally put it on for 10 seconds the first time!</li>
            <li>I think the acid in this is even higher than the wart remover Compund W!</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with this peel!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, it did sting!</li>
            <li>VERY next morning, my skin was NOTICEABLY better!</li>
            <li>: THIS WILL STING/BURN AT FIRST!</li>
            <li>This product works exactly how it says it will!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>I feel that Professional Laboratories has done a splendid job by doing an exhaustive research and then presenting this product to the public for cosmetological use.</li>
            <li>so glad I can use it on the white heads and just wipe it off so easily without having to pop it.</li>
            <li>My background: I am very light skinned and in my early thirties.</li>
            <li>Felt my skin looks very smooth and soft for weeks after I used it.</li>
            <li>My skin is very smooth and clear now.  </li>
            <li>But the consecutive times i first clean my skin of all dirt and oils by swiping it with rubbing alcohol and then apply the peel.</li>
            <li>I clean my chest with alcohol first and then dab it all over my chest.</li>
            <li>I think this product can really bring great results if you are super careful about using it and don&#x27;t give up.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about using this at home, but I followed the directions to the tee and am so happy with my results.  </li>
            <li>The fine lines on my forehead are virtually undetectable unless if my face gets oily, which only happens if I go without showering for more than 3 days</li>
            <li>But for people with delicate skin this is probably very good.</li>
            <li>I have seen the most improvements in my acne, but not so much with any large pores or scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin but find this to be very tolerable, perhaps because my face has “hardened” from of all the harsh things I’ve tried for acne and rosacea throughout my life.</li>
            <li>- Make sure you use a good and light moisturizer after the peels, otherwise your skin will likely get very dry.</li>
            <li>But some advice, if you are using this stuff frequently make sure to put some sunscreen on, because your skin will be much more sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li>I have been using this peel for a few weeks now hoping for great results like I read in the reviews.</li>
            <li>This product is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen a huge reduction in acne, however, but am hopeful that it will do that in time.</li>
            <li>Now that it is the third week, most of my huge pores that I got before has either shrunk, or disappeared.</li>
            <li>Amazing results - I am going to try the 30% next.  </li>
            <li>The overall pigmentation is just amazing.</li>
            <li>However, paying for the peel to be administered was not as fun.</li>
            <li>But so far I am quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Applied thrice, no change but skin thickening seemed to be becoming normal.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice much change until maybe 2 weeks ago, and each day it keeps getting better.</li>
            <li>totally worth the 18 bucks.</li>
            <li>For me, it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>: I would say to give it a try and see for yourself since its much more cost efficient then going to spas as I have in the past!It does make ur skin feel nice and smooth but the peeling part sucks.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use lots of moisturizer and try to use something all natural.</li>
            <li>I was peeling around the edge of my nose &amp; it was kind of gross</li>
            <li>I had kind of given up hope for any topical treatments!</li>
            <li>Worth</li>
            <li>I am only on level one, but if I am seeing this kind of results I can&#x27;t wait to work my way</li>
            <li>Definitely worth what you pay.</li>
            <li>If nothing else, the salicylic for spot treatments alone is worth it.  </li>
            <li>, I thought I would be a part of the 90% success story I found on Amazon .  </li>
            <li>Your skin will be sensitive and red immediately after use and will then become flaky (using a moisturizer helps greatly but will not prevent this).  </li>
            <li>Ok I just just this on Monday March 23, and belive me this product so far what it did</li>
            <li>This was kind of my last test on trying to correct my face.</li>
            <li>It might seem like I have a lot of qualifires, but I do believe this product to be worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>So in desperation, I&#x27;ve decided I need to start my skin over fresh.</li>
            <li>As the directions instructed, the first time I tried the full face peel, I kept it on for one minute</li>
            <li>Ever since then, I haven&#x27;t been able to completely control my acne.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try if you suffer from acne.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better and been so clear.  </li>
            <li>Still, worth a shot.</li>
            <li>but I think the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>, i have rarely acne</li>
            <li>so definitely  it worth to try it.    </li>
            <li>I have had breakouts for most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s seriously powerful stuff.  </li>
            <li>but I believe it&#x27;s worth it for the end result.</li>
            <li>The feeling I had around my nostrils (the most sensitive part of my face) caused me to remove it.</li>
            <li>I KNOW that the peel was effective even in that short of a dose.  </li>
            <li>However, it worked better for me when I just applied it directly on my skin.    </li>
            <li>and my face is clear for the most part.</li>
            <li>a treatment so simple could be so effective (for periodic cystic acne on cheeks).  </li>
            <li>I gave up on any kind of help from the medical professionals and started reading up on what alleviates acne.  </li>
            <li>I honestly cant imagine my life without these peels now, i&#x27;m totally smitten.</li>
            <li>My son and I both have used this peel many times, and it really didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference for either of us.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the peels purchased and used by Skin Obsession, this just wasn&#x27;t worth the time or money.</li>
            <li>My face was much more sensitive</li>
            <li>I Liked the effects from the initial couple of peels.</li>
            <li>I felt it wasn&#x27;t worth the side effects to continue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using a brush, cotton pads, cotton balls, and finally decided that my own fingers work best.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, my skin looks the same.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve implemented Zinc Supplements &amp; Flaxseed (fresh ground or oil</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 2 months now and my skin feels so soft and looks more radiant.</li>
            <li>If you can handle the tingling/burning sensation, it really is worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already noticing that my acne scars are fading and my skin appears more clear and toned.</li>
            <li>But for the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth the try.  </li>
            <li>after reading the reviews on this product i felt as if it was worth a buy.</li>
            <li>The peeling stays close to skin and is never flaky, it kind of reminds me of the texture of a peel off mask, but to a lesser degree.  </li>
            <li>laugh lines were yellowish brown and my chin and the area around my lips and nose were brown.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have found that as long as I followed a lengthy routine of exfoliating, stridex pads, and then benzoyl peroxide it help me pretty good</li>
            <li>I have happy, clear, refined skin, FINALLY!</li>
            <li>so I dont have wrinkles just lines from my smile</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am so pleased I found an economical option to the spa-grade treatments.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I used it because my face is soooooooo oily, but no breakouts except rare cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>WOW EVEN BETTER.</li>
            <li>A some burn is good because it&#x27;s actually removing your dead skin which of course doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li>I rarely make it through 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>, this product is absolutely worth the $$.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s RARE for me to get cystic acne</li>
            <li>Yes, it does sting, but its worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Ive gotton a peel done for $50 at a place</li>
            <li>It worked very quickly(a week or so), and should work great for anyone with any rough skin/callus/wart type issues.</li>
            <li>Given its price, it’s certainly worth a shot for those who have tried everything else without success.</li>
            <li>Your skin will be far more sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The moisturizer with SPF 30 is worth using even if you don&#x27;t think that it is needed.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the effort.</li>
            <li>IF I DIDN&#x27;T HAVE DONE SO MANY OF THEM OVER THE YEARS, DONE BY PROFESSIONAL.</li>
            <li>(I rarely go over that amount of time because of what&#x27;s happened when I do).</li>
            <li>Its definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>$16 is a worth try.</li>
            <li>I smile</li>
            <li>I can tell everyone from my own experience with acne that the only products that work for me are the prescription ones with sulfur in them</li>
            <li>So, buy it, its so worth it</li>
            <li>in photoshoots, i have perfect skin and don&#x27;t have to wear a bunch of makeup to cover up and make the acne worse.</li>
            <li>This is definatly worth a buy.</li>
            <li>I think if I keep using it twice a week, I will see more results and the bumps will completely clear.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Ok for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t look oily after it has been absorbed).</li>
            <li>I have had to use this product more frequently than the instructions in order to achieve desired effect.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>is worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but had to for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Try this, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gotten more sensitive.</li>
            <li>Have tried a popular \\&quot;by mail\\&quot; acne treatment that includes several steps that did not help a bit.</li>
            <li>and obviously no results.&lt;br /&gt;I am kind of in shock about how this product, if anything, isn&#x27;t for beginners, but for me is like putting water on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li>did talk to my esthetician about this product and she highly recommends it but stresses the importance of going easy.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt/feels and looks very smooth, clean, brighter and tighter than prior to using (experience after using both peels).</li>
            <li>At first, it stung so much but now, I can handle the max amount of time easily.</li>
            <li>It works better than most other acne products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>first time you use this product if you can manage 2 minutes you are a super hero.  </li>
            <li>I am 32 and have had consistent mild acne since I was 11</li>
            <li>used it 3 times with Neutralizer skin pH balancer and Iam pregnant in  the first month, now I am freaking out</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a bit strong for normal skin..</li>
            <li>really helped clean my pores and gave my face a nice overall glow.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to do the job, but not so strong that it leaves me in pain or with rashes.  </li>
            <li>This chemical peel is a remarkable product that is worth the time, money and a little pain.</li>
            <li>I due recommend using a good moisturizer after.</li>
            <li>Great product, my breakouts have really diminished and i&#x27;m only on my second application, comes with full instructions and works greeeeat!</li>
            <li>Before buying this product, I read the reviews and the impression I got was that it was really good but can be risky due to its potency.</li>
            <li>Well first time is definitely that the most comfortable.</li>
            <li>After I would apply it, my whole face would start rapidly heating up and it is a bit to endure, but the results are well worth it!</li>
            <li>You will turn heads again--but for the right reasons.</li>
            <li>My sister is trying it right now.</li>
            <li>Cleared up my face right away.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see or feel any results right away</li>
            <li>but it did bring some yuckiness to the surface right away....</li>
            <li>Right away I could see the difference.  </li>
            <li>I still have persistent acne on my right cheek</li>
            <li>right now all the breakouts are drying and clearing away.   </li>
            <li>i ordered it and began using it right away.</li>
            <li>Acne and blackheads were greatly diminished with the first use, fine lines were less noticeable, sun spots faded, and skin texture was more smooth and firm.</li>
            <li>But, right away i saw my skin getting firmer and clearer.</li>
            <li>I noticed results right away.</li>
            <li>If you apply this on the right schedule your skin will look fab.</li>
            <li>The scar area is about to fall off right now.</li>
            <li>right -</li>
            <li>You can get the jojoba oil right here on Amazon too.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t include the right directions to remove it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it right after you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>you can tell it&#x27;s working right away.  </li>
            <li>If I have a pimple coming on, this will either immediately reduce the size and redness or bring the infection right to the surface so that I may extract it.  </li>
            <li>tried this as a way to even out my tone, but right before I received the product I got an episode of cysts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>problem I&#x27;m trying to solve with this peel is scarring on the sides of my face and these bumps on my right jawline that I think are dormant cystic acne lesions.</li>
            <li>However, I continued to apply onto my nose and then to my right chin.  </li>
            <li>I use neutrogena wrinkle repair, it is not greasy and leaves just the right amount of moisturizer without leaving my oily skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>and they answered me right away.  </li>
            <li>and I must say I have seen positive changes!</li>
            <li>My mother and friend have bought this product and are seeing the positive change in their skin too!</li>
            <li>No matter how long you leave it on, immediately, your skin feels softer and more smooth and it just appears tighter.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m cheap, I buy a lot of things but don&#x27;t spend much ;-))</li>
            <li>I have used Salicylic Acid peels in the past with great success.  </li>
            <li>:P All the review kinda made me think there was going to be some instant action.</li>
            <li>and I noticed considerable stinging in the exact locations where my pores were largest and most clogged - nose, cheeks, chin and part of my forehead.</li>
            <li>Since my skin had never had a peel applied to it before the salicylic acid kind of stung and made my face red at first.  </li>
            <li>For those who know what they&#x27;re doing and have used active treatments before, this is a great weekly peel to keep major acne outbreaks at bay and smooth out the skin&#x27;s surface.     </li>
            <li>I never had a lot of acne, but I have a lot of white heads just under the skin that got infected very easy.</li>
            <li>Its very strong so you may want to start out only using once a week and then gradually work your way to 2 to 3 times a week.</li>
            <li>However, this is very strong, and I could put it on my face only for 60 seconds.</li>
            <li>After only 30 seconds on my face, I knew it was a VERY strong acid.</li>
            <li>She also explained that salicylic acid is highly effective in a high enough concentration to actually clean out the lining of the pores.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you add a little vaseline to your moisturizer, your skin will be amazing in the morning (no dryness and no pimples)!</li>
            <li>I now have about one breakout a month and the majority of my face now has very large, clogged pores.</li>
            <li>and I have what most people would consider mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li>I just make sure I use a heavier moisturizer on that day and night, and I exfoliate with a facial sponge and that takes care of it quickly.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have ever used with success.      </li>
            <li>Rinse very well with cool water and apply the lotion they suggest.</li>
            <li>Before I applied the peel, I washed my face with a gentle cleanser using warm/hot water and rinse in cool water.</li>
            <li>The great results outweigh this one small downside.</li>
            <li>I make sure to start with the forehead, then to my chin, upper lip, then my checks as that is the most sensitive for me.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any excessive dryness or redness.  </li>
            <li>It is a normal looking nose as smooth as you would expect for someone my age if not smoother.</li>
            <li>My scars from years from the acne are lighter and I see my pores in a better shape and in general my face has been behaving like never.</li>
            <li>For any skin issue, removing a top layer, or exfoliating is generally the procedure.  </li>
            <li>I think it was great for me to start out with a small concentration.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it isn&#x27;t white colored (like the kind you buy in the local drugstore!)</li>
            <li>I now use this once or twice a week for just a few mins at a time and then follow with a benzoyl peroxide cream at night, which I use most nights and a light oil free moisturiser.  </li>
            <li>and i saw my large pores shrunk tremendously</li>
            <li>and I seem to be doing fine so far!      </li>
            <li>However, at the first try, I felt a burning sensation right after application.  </li>
            <li>A great overall facial skin problem solver.</li>
            <li>It is dries out easily and is naturally oily.  </li>
            <li>However, if you used this product and liked it lotsbut was then plagued by redness and dry skin</li>
            <li>I use a brush to put it on as a cottonball soaked up to much into itself and didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting an adequate amount on my face.</li>
            <li>What did work- sticking with a gentle routine of cleaning with a mild ph cleaner and applying an oilfree lotion with 2% salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li>even more exciting knowing that that same peel would cost me upwards of $150 if I were to go to a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>This is a far better value and really works, no frills.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the direction that come with the bottle, which I do not find effective enough, I experimented and it worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>After peeling, I have soft, smooth and fresh looking skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they charged me about 100 bucks for a peel and eventually they charged me less because the ladies there loved me.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I read around a lot before purchasing, so I had a mixture of baking soda and water ready.</li>
            <li>I had finally resigned myself to Acutane - this was my last attempt before going to the dermatologist to get started and it works GREAT.</li>
            <li>I did my 3rd peel last night and this time i tried to brave it out and applied it for 2.5 mins</li>
            <li>I USE St. Ives Facial Moisturizer, Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin on my face and neck - layering more under my eyes and on my laugh</li>
            <li>skin is very sensitive to sunscreen, and it&#x27;s important to apply sunscreen after using this peel.  </li>
            <li>kind of wish I started with a stronger concentration as funds are limited</li>
            <li>Enjoy your clear skin!</li>
            <li>It does burn the first few times but you tolerate it more and more.</li>
            <li>Generally the more melanin in your skin the more likely you are to scar.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve notice that as long as I get regular facials with someone who is Good with extractions and follow up with a light peel, my skin clears up.</li>
            <li>The seller ships very fast.  </li>
            <li>let you know in couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Sunday april 8, its about 3 weeks using the product need to tell you my skin feel much smoother than before, it help me with my breakouts still got some of them but not like before, it also help me with some dark spots, so far happy and cant wait to see full results.</li>
            <li>I have had very fast results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am beginning to doubt this product very much.</li>
            <li>do recommend this product and think the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Immediately I had glowing skin - it definitely faded some very light scarring on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>what i order ty and was very fast and shipped was what i wanted  ty</li>
            <li>These are personal details but very important when using this product.</li>
            <li>Normally, doing this to your skin would result in waking up with a break out, but since your pores are so clean after the peel, I&#x27;ve found that they do not get clogged even when I rub oil into them.</li>
            <li>Be sure to put on sunscreen and moisturister to protect the young skin, especially under strong sun.</li>
            <li>I was very excited about trying this product (I&#x27;m in my mid twenties and am starting to notice early signs of aging skin, despite taking good care of my face and staying out of the sun).</li>
            <li>I use retin-a and still get acne though not nearly as bad as when I was in high</li>
            <li>Most of the clogging is gone, I don&#x27;t feel the little bumps under my skin any more and my skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li>Once the toner had absorbed, I took a cotton ball and quickly applied the salicylic acid (don&#x27;t get too close to the sensitive areas underneath your eyes!)</li>
            <li>It has helped tremendously with new acne outbreaks!</li>
            <li>It is amazing what this stuff can do just be careful.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>I applied the first treatment for 2 minutes, it had started to sting a bit at about the 2 minute mark</li>
            <li>but i was sceptical at first because i understand that Salicylic Acid is not for everyone</li>
            <li>Apply a moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 30 or higher.   </li>
            <li>, I mosturize, I tried many different exfoliants...</li>
            <li>:) My skin is back to how it once was, pre-mid-twenties.</li>
            <li>Noticeable improvement with first use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to wear make up anymore to feel pretty,</li>
            <li>I really hope you try this product!</li>
            <li>I have used so many products to try to control my acne (moderate) but nothing until this has come</li>
            <li>exactly_ like this product.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast too!</li>
            <li>When I saw the Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel on Amazon.com, I was reluctant at first.</li>
            <li>I guarantee you the results will be evident almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t advise anyone to stay away from the product as it obviously worked for many people.</li>
            <li>If you are considering one of those acne programs like Proactive or Murad, please try this first.</li>
            <li>I tried this salicylic acid peel for the first time, and noticed almost immediate results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone, then I&#x27;ll probably try the Glycolic or maybe a combo-peel once I feel confident enough to do</li>
            <li>I am amazed this addressed so many different problem areas on my face.  </li>
            <li>But i suggest follow their instructions first before adjusting it.</li>
            <li>I started first using this product with a moisturizer</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to first time chem peel users.</li>
            <li>For the first time, acne is resolved (I have used the peel once a week for about six weeks).  </li>
            <li>Acne will worsen after the first treatment - wait it out - it will improve Dramatically.</li>
            <li>Forehead &amp; Chin first before i proceed.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m really optimistic!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I literally felt like the skin was burning off my face.  </li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t stand the pain and can only tolerate a minute or two the first couple times you use this product you will still see outstanding results.  </li>
            <li>I found it thanks to this peel!</li>
            <li>The first time, I used a gel (Neutrogen Grapefruit \\&quot;something\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>The first time I used this peel, I felt my face was burnt.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly, and used witch hazel as my toner as recommended.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time.  </li>
            <li>I had lost hope of having pretty skin and was just depending on make-up to cover the acne.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, I followed the instructions to the letter, I washed my face with Cetaphil soap, used a toner, and then the peel.  </li>
            <li>After the third or fourth peel, I finally saw a glimpse of the beautiful skin I once had!</li>
            <li>The product does state that it will not always get immediate results and that it make take up to 8th or 9th peels before real results are shown!      </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a peeling the way I used to peel when I first started using Retin-A.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to magically eliminate all of the spots that the acnes have left on my face, but I expect a gradual change.</li>
            <li>will absolutely continue to use this product!</li>
            <li>Considering this is the first time I have ever had an chemical peel on my face professional/unprofessional I decided to pick one of the lowest chemicals, being this 20% peel.</li>
            <li>So the first day I applied the peel was a Sunday.</li>
            <li>I guess my pores have gotten smaller, skin softer, and it is a bit more \\&quot;glowy\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Proactiv was the best treatment I used, but for a college student, it was expensive to keep up with.</li>
            <li>and I need a better facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>the first time I used it on myself, but that also diminished with every use.  </li>
            <li>The first time I applied it with a brush</li>
            <li>Overall, I will follow instructions more closely and not try to rush the re-growth.  </li>
            <li>, I know exactly how you feel.</li>
            <li>The first day I got it, I used it for two consecutive days.  </li>
            <li>There was quite a bit of peeling on my nose after the first couple uses</li>
            <li>I prefer this over higher strength peels.</li>
            <li>Overall seems like a safe adjuvant to home acne treatment.</li>
            <li>I have pretty oily skin</li>
            <li>I used the Salicylic first because it was a Saturday</li>
            <li>Today when I applied the combo peel I applied all over my face without putting it around my nostrils and left the peel on for 3 times longer than I was able to leave it on around my nose.  </li>
            <li>so just try it out the first time and wash it all off as soon as one area has been stinging for a couple of seconds.  </li>
            <li>had it not been my first use of it.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t pair it up with the glycolic nor the BP.  </li>
            <li>The first 2 days i can see my face getting ready to peel and the 3-5th day its peeling a lot and its worth it...</li>
            <li>will definitely continue to buy more of this supplier&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once a week for three weeks, and it definitely helps my skin, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it more than once in a week.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li>Honestly, it does peel some skin off the scar, but the scar never really goes away.  </li>
            <li>At first I tried to follow the instruction to apply the acid on cosmetic pad</li>
            <li>This works really well for breakouts!</li>
            <li>and I recomend it if its your first time undergoing a glycolic acid treatment.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>However, I read some reviews and they stated that the reason it broke out was because it was bringing my future breakouts up top.</li>
            <li>At first it peeled and flaked my skin.  </li>
            <li>The first application had a burning sensation on my face.  </li>
            <li>It has been a real life saver for me!</li>
            <li>The first time I put it on 8 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have some raised scarring that is fading also for the first time from these peels.  </li>
            <li>You can only use this product at MOST every 5 days, I would recommend once per week.  </li>
            <li>I am a caramel complexion (like Tyra Banks), my first peel ever was the Skin</li>
            <li>The first peel stayed on for 1 minute</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a relief to have finally found a product that can really penetrate pores and deliver a great result.</li>
            <li>This item did not cause the skin to peel, and we followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>I had a pretty oily skin, thus i used once every two days.</li>
            <li>thanks mom!)</li>
            <li>Just be aware.</li>
            <li>I have to buy more actually.</li>
            <li>I used this product exactly as instructed when it came.</li>
            <li>On top of the acne, my skin was red around my nose and my mouth.  </li>
            <li>advice is to use this if you have used a peel in the past and are looking to step up to a more potent peel.</li>
            <li>made simple and the Microdelivery Exfoliating wash my skin looks better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>did NOT see results the first time I used this though.</li>
            <li>Product works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I broke out at first</li>
            <li>After meeting with an esthetician who suggested I spend $980 on Obagi &amp; an additional $500 on chemical peels, I thought I&#x27;d try this peel first.</li>
            <li>And if it&#x27;s ok to use the facial wash brush like Clairsnic  mia the day after using the Salicylic peel?</li>
            <li>Thanks for sharing!</li>
            <li>Even till this day, it stings for the first 5 minutes and my skin has not gotten used to the harshness, but I continue to apply it.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions closely, 1 minute for the first time and gradually increasing until 8 minutes every application.</li>
            <li>I saw results after the first use.</li>
            <li>Moderate to servere acne getting better.</li>
            <li>My acne is better and my pores are smaller.</li>
            <li>First, I have to tell you about my skin.</li>
            <li>The first treatment was 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Yes, it burns like hell at first, but I think it&#x27;s not unbearable</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week and the first bottle I used got me 15 uses (</li>
            <li>&amp; then I apply my skin lotion on top of my entire face.  </li>
            <li>it hurts so much!  </li>
            <li>I forgot all about it until recently many years later, I am getting age spots.  </li>
            <li>My skin is clear and acne free.  </li>
            <li>I was nervous when I first applied this peel, I thought I was going to burn my face off.</li>
            <li>So for my first time I set the timer for one minute after I applied the peel.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how to describe it.</li>
            <li>My acne has not diminished entirely, but I would say it has gotten better.</li>
            <li>My face is smoother, my scaring is DEFINITELY smaller, and most of my acne is going away.</li>
            <li>but the skin is beginning to look tighter and more youthful with smaller pores.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the a Neutralizer skin pH balancer as it most definitely helps with calming the skin post</li>
            <li>I was only able to tolerate the salicylic for about 2.5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I figured the improvements I saw the first day would be the extent of it&#x27;s power.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a first.  </li>
            <li>It burns for the first 5 min &amp; then subsides after.</li>
            <li>My first time, I could only bear it for around 5 minutes, but I feel like that was mostly hype built up from knowing that it was going to sting.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t wind up peeling any more than I would have if I left it on for 5 minutes, but that is just my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes me look younger for sure..</li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue the application, but with the stronger dose next time.</li>
            <li>(I did try keeping it on for 10mins for the first time and nothing happened).</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just the first time</li>
            <li>first time, it was burning after 30-seconds</li>
            <li>after the first use, we saw a difference.</li>
            <li>This was the first strength peel I started started out with.  </li>
            <li>Rather than go to a stronger solution, I think regular, consistent use of a milder solution is better long-term.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I have a reasonably healthy diet and daily exercise.</li>
            <li>and I can get rid of/prevent more acne with the solution if I feel a problem area starting.  </li>
            <li>So, I ordered this and Glycolic Acid and got them the first of August.</li>
            <li>First the results on the nose.</li>
            <li>Here is exactly what I did.</li>
            <li>It works, and it works pretty well, but it&#x27;s not a miracle product.</li>
            <li>I might move up to a higher acid concentration and see how that works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it works better next time.</li>
            <li>burns.works pretty well.using it as spot treatment instead of a mask</li>
            <li>The tattoo is getting lighter but you need to be consistent.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does reduce pore size if used consistently.</li>
            <li>and she says NEVER use higher then 2%.</li>
            <li>I am a first time user, you can tell the difference.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ll tell you why: BHAs are different in the fact that they go DEEPER into your pores than AHAs, because they dissolve oil (they LOVE that stuff).  </li>
            <li>Although this product scared me at first and can be quite drying, it still deserves all 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>After my first time using it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first peel and have been using it for a couple months.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve bought tons of items on amazon and this is my first review.  </li>
            <li>;)    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I finally found something that works!!</li>
            <li>So while it felt hot while it was on, it didn&#x27;t result in any peeling.</li>
            <li>Finally, although many reviewers seemed to be concerned that it doesn&#x27;t come with a PH neutralizer, according to my doctor PH neutralizer (like baking soda) is optional.</li>
            <li>I saw drastic results after the first treatment.</li>
            <li>and I stay away from the sun as much as possible, my face can take more.</li>
            <li>I started noticing more visible sunspots on my cheek in the last 6 months albeit the fact that I do have a beauty regimen and moisturize with spf 30</li>
            <li>followed the instructions exactly as recommended.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I left the product on for more then 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>If you leave it on for more than 60 seconds or you don&#x27;t fully wash off the peel, your face will become red and irritated.  </li>
            <li>(large recurring zits right before my monthly cycle).</li>
            <li>If you have some spare cash then definitely try this :)</li>
            <li>My face is always oily and feels hot.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Years of Accutane and prescription medication obviously did nothing, so what&#x27;s one more try?</li>
            <li>It seemed to be working better as a spot treatment than an overall mask.</li>
            <li>Okay so I&#x27;ve only used this product for two days</li>
            <li>or so I noticed the top layer of my skin was starting to peel.</li>
            <li>the most they&#x27;ll give me are antibiotics that only upset my stomach.</li>
            <li>I first got it I was using the peel once a week for fear</li>
            <li>I caution everyone because this product should be used EXACTLY as directed, and everyone should try a test spot first.  </li>
            <li>have been consistently using once a week for about two months now</li>
            <li>skin definitely looks way brighter and clearer with this though :)</li>
            <li>and my face does not get irritated (unlike the first week).   </li>
            <li>The first day you try it for the first time, try focusing on that one pimple on your face (day-by-day for 5 days)...</li>
            <li>They seem to work at first</li>
            <li>HAVE A FAN CLOSE BY AND WATCH YOUR SKIN TO BE SURE IS NOT ACTUALLY BURNING.</li>
            <li>Be sure to do it well in advance of a big day.</li>
            <li>I put it on my forehead first, then wait 2-3 minutes to apply to the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li>I saw reslults after the first use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely way, way more than just 10 peels.</li>
            <li>The first time I saw my face brighten and lighten up.</li>
            <li>I just got done using this peel, following top commenter Elane&#x27;s steps 1 - 8.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>If you like pain and love looking red for a day then this is for you</li>
            <li>First let me say I just did my first peel about 20 minutes ago</li>
            <li>I will update more later.</li>
            <li>So, decided to take my chances with extraction again and was able to squeeze a bit out and use a pair of tweezers to pull the entire comodone out.</li>
            <li>My crater scars are much better and my skintone is brightened and air brushed.</li>
            <li>A lot of people recommended a neutralizer to use after the peel, but I think, start off with the peel and see how your skin reacts to it first.</li>
            <li>As i continued using this product and my tolerance level became longer, i noticed that i was not peeling as i did with first application and my cheeks are the problem areas with spots scattered about.</li>
            <li>and while I noticed some frosting on her back - she still has not peeled and she started breaking out more.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>Maybe I was just living in a cave for too long, but I didn&#x27;t know how effective these peels really are.</li>
            <li>This is potent enough.</li>
            <li>I really wish I had tried salicylic acid sooner!</li>
            <li>started breaking out in pimples for first time since I was 14&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am applying that first, then Polysporin then Cetaphyl.  </li>
            <li>First, let me say, that I have acne (pink/red) marks on my skin from pimples.</li>
            <li>My face (except for maybe my cheeck-bones) feels ok with this product on, especially my forehead and neck.</li>
            <li>I purchased some witch hazel and cotton balls and always  use that first.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I bought a salicylc acid</li>
            <li>I will submit more information of the effect of this product later.</li>
            <li>so it only looks marginally better immediately after the peel.</li>
            <li>Since the first day i applied it with cotton swabs</li>
            <li>I read another review that stated to use a baking soda and water paste to neutralize, which works really well!  </li>
            <li>The next time I just did it on the spots where the acne scars were and that seemed to work a lot better for me.  </li>
            <li>never before written a review on Amazon, but was so satisfied with product that I simply HAD to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>sure that you read the directions of the peel and use a toner beforehand to help open up your pores so the peel can dig deeper.</li>
            <li>Salicylic has many benefits described above.</li>
            <li>The problems went away and the texture of the sking is still getting better (pores are smaller).</li>
            <li>Wash your face first then follow with toner to remove excess oil which helps the peel to penetrate your pores.</li>
            <li>For up to 2 weeks after using the peel, there are no visible blackheads on my nose and my face is extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with moderate acne for many, many years starting when I was 13 or 14.  </li>
            <li>She is a chemist that actually designed products for many well known business out there.  </li>
            <li>It needs to be 2% or higher.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d spend a lot more in a med spa or a dermatologists office for the exact same product to use 1 to 3 times.</li>
            <li>The combination of these products are working wonders for my skin and would be my first recommendation for anyone with skin problems.</li>
            <li>i am wondering if i need the higher %...</li>
            <li>This product comes with clear and detailed instructions on how to use the same safely and efficaciously.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I saw a dermatologist, had microdermabrasion, and tried many different products,  Nothing truly worked.  </li>
            <li>And I think it actually makes me break out more than make my face</li>
            <li>Slow peel which is great to keep from irritation.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying a chemical peel.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a chemical peel at home on myself.</li>
            <li>, i was immediately interested to try out this peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(The Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay is a clay mask and is best used with Apple Cider Vinegar, it helps extract all the impurities deep within the pores and it leaves your skin radiant and pore free.</li>
            <li>You have to follow the instructions and use it for a minute the first time then increase the time with each use.  </li>
            <li>*nothing* clears up my occasional breakouts better - or faster - than this product.</li>
            <li>Well, I really felt the sting on my face this time!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend seeking a dermatologist first before buying this product.</li>
            <li>Have a fan ready to reduce the sting - it is not unbearable, but it&#x27;s nice to cool the face down while waiting for it to work.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with the results but definitely test this product first to make sure it is safe for your skin and only use it on problem areas at the recommended every 3 days because I was using it over my entire face and noted some spots were getting dry.</li>
            <li>I am a black male, very fair skinned/light skinned.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t write reviews, but this product is totally worth it, first the shipping was super fast, I ordered it on April 29th  got it in the mail day before yesterday</li>
            <li>The sensation is pretty intense, however beauty hurts right?</li>
            <li>2-3 months of derma roller plus copper at night, and a gentle peel every other morning, can literally remodel the scar and allow you to rebuild more normal, healthy skin in place of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve kept it on for the maximum 7 minutes every single time I&#x27;ve used it, even the first time, and that&#x27;s probably why I&#x27;ve had such great results</li>
            <li>The first time I let it sit on my face for a minute, then 2 minutes the next time, then became brave and left it on the full 8 minutes, which did seem to make me peel a little more.</li>
            <li>, that really dry part under nostril, around lips and chin, smile lines----dead skin peeled off to reveal healthy</li>
            <li>At first I tried the recommended of one application per week but apparently the solution is not as strong as some reviewers made it out to be.</li>
            <li>Does that mean using it once a week won&#x27;t give you great results?</li>
            <li>have been following the peel with Kiehl&#x27;s Midnight Recovery Concentrate (100% natural btw), followed by 100% pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum (also an AMAZING find on amazon that is powerfully hydrating).</li>
            <li>I saw improvements right away in how much smoother my skin looks.</li>
            <li>If I see any positive results after continuous use of this product, I will be sure to update my review to a proper rating.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was the reduction in stress in my life, getting more adequate sleep, not being a teenager anymore, eating more fruit, or just the soap and always using clean cloths to wash, but I only get spot breakouts that are small and go away quickly, which I can live with.</li>
            <li>After all the dead skin fell off my face, I looked refreshing and the fine lines gone, however the brown spots from acne and sun were still there.</li>
            <li>The peeling is barely noticeable, and my skin looks so vibrant and healthy after each peel.</li>
            <li>I have been using every other night vs once ever week, and it is just amazing.</li>
            <li>when i first starting using it i couldn&#x27;t stand it for more than 1 min, now I can handle the whole 8 min.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT buy this product, it is not worth the chance of getting a chemical burn like so many reviewers have had!</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t even notice much peeling, but I realized that it was because I wasn&#x27;t putting very much on.</li>
            <li>Two days ago, I finally made it up to eight minutes, and my skin is peeling significantly today!</li>
            <li>I also have only experienced minimal flaking.</li>
            <li>, After 4 minutes I RAN to the sink and as I passed a mirror I was horrified to see a bright red \\&quot;goatee,&#x27; after a total face application.  </li>
            <li>Epiduo, Murad, Proactive, Clean and Clear, Neutrogena, Clearisil, EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel 10</li>
            <li>Perhaps the people giving this 5 stars are putting it on more frequently and for longer, but they have extraordinary tolerance (or fried facial nerves.)  </li>
            <li>BUT a majority of Salicylic acid peel users including my twin went through the same phase as i did before seeing great results, so i&#x27;m not disheartened by a few breakouts as it has shown a tremendous improvement on the size of my pores</li>
            <li>ahhhh...after the pain subsides your face will feel soft and soOo clean.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have acne, I have a different skin condition, Keratosis pilaris, so I decided to give this a try, because as many have mentioned, for the price you really have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this will work long term or not, but, for now, it&#x27;s pretty fantastic!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve skipped this product for one two respective occasions and my skin simply did not look as good those weeks.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely a process to figure out what your sensitivity levels are, but I think it is certainly wise to start on the low end of peel intensity and work up from there.</li>
            <li>With more intense peels, you can only do them once every three weeks to a month, but with this peel you can do it weekly.</li>
            <li>I have had this product for several months and while I really wanted to love this product, It just doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if anything, this seemed to completely confuse my skin, throwing it completely out of wack and triggering more breakouts.  </li>
            <li>All in all, nothing to get scared of with the word &#x27;acid&#x27;; its pretty safe for use at home - just dont leave it on your face for too long.</li>
            <li>and it was more irritating than effective.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m trying to get back into the habit of using it regularly while trying to decide what a good frequency is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING too, and I was about to pay a lot of $$ to get a professional facial or see a dermatologist for some kind of help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To my surprise, I was able to handle it very well: ten minutes, twice a day.</li>
            <li>The larger and more defined scars, however are still visible and hasn&#x27;t changed much at all.</li>
            <li>I also have pretty oily skin, resulting in blackheads and large pores across my \\&quot;T zone\\&quot; area.</li>
            <li>I moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;After moisturizing obsessively for 3 days---it&#x27;s starting to patch and peel nicely to reveal fresh, smooth, even skin without dark blackheads and enlarged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It simply felt squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>i have 2 acne forming, acne free on my right face and two acne on my left face.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely the right fit for me.</li>
            <li>I got married last summer and my dermatologist gave me a VERY strong antibiotic to ensure that my face would be clear for my wedding.</li>
            <li>About a month and a half ago, I received this product by mail and relieved that I would get the beautiful skin I used to have when I was  back in my teens.  </li>
            <li>However, in the past I&#x27;ve found that a strong benzoyl peroxide, even though it burns, was better at treating my skin problems.)</li>
            <li>Some people have \\&quot;thiner\\&quot; skin layers and 20% may be too strong, especially if this is your First.</li>
            <li>I hope I continue to see positive results</li>
            <li>None positively impacted my skin and, in fact, the ointments irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>I saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this product so decided to try it.</li>
            <li>By the fifth day, I saw positive results.</li>
            <li>I agree with all the positive reviews about this product.  </li>
            <li>So far i can say that this really leaves your skin smooth and REALLY does shrink pores.</li>
            <li>but the description did say that the solution neutralizes on your face after 8 mins, so that explains why i was able to have it on for so long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 39 &amp; have been suffering w/adult acne for way too long and have tried so many products.  </li>
            <li>When you first put it on you will feel an intense itching and/or burning.</li>
            <li>I was definitely very scared when I first did the peel.</li>
            <li>After 4 days whatever issues you had are pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li>These bumps would go from inflamed to non-inflamed, but pretty much never healed or went away; they are gone.</li>
            <li>Also, the processing was pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I was willing to spend so much money on it</li>
            <li>For the first two weeks, I wasn&#x27;t really hopeful.</li>
            <li>have to say, it REALLY does hurt/ burn the first time.</li>
            <li>really burns like hell when you first apply it; but</li>
            <li>The burning sensation while using the peel was more intense than from the day before, so only used it once and will most likely skip a treatment for day 3 and just use my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I am used to the tingling, but those sensitive to the burn may find relief using a tabletop fan to cool the face.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so I was a little weary at first, but the 20% solution has worked great for me so far!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in fine lines, but I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles anyway, and I don&#x27;t think it penetrated enough to help reduce acne redness, but since I&#x27;m not breaking out anymore that will help overall reduce acne redness.</li>
            <li>Note that I use to have super oily skin, plus i live in Singapore (a VERY HUMID country/environment)</li>
            <li>I am excited because I see amazing new skin emerging underneath, and at this point since I only have acne scars left, I am hoping to see them fade over time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also starting to see my first fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>If you manage that much without crying you have exceptional tear ducts and/or pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I stuck with it, because the first few times, I just got some mild exfoliation from it.</li>
            <li>Throughout high school, I had problematic skin but most of my pimples were tiny pimples spread out on my forehead, temples, side of cheeks, and chin.  </li>
            <li>The problem with most products is that they don&#x27;t have a high enough concentration of salicylic acid to do this.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use moisturizer because it will leave your skin feeling dry and flaky for about a week.</li>
            <li>I have a combo skin type but more on the dry side</li>
            <li>Acne shrunks quickly and old scars diminished.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t peel my skin, or clear my spots, luckily I didn&#x27;t get any redness or irritation.</li>
            <li>But all of this is better than the red bumpy scabby normal stuff that I lived with on a day to day basis.  </li>
            <li>This only lasted for a day and was very mild.  </li>
            <li>This chemical which is extracted from a plant hormone does tend to dry out most skin types.  </li>
            <li>after a months use the tone of my complexion is around 95% improved, it&#x27;s smooth with no redness, no itchiness and no dry scaly patches (from rosacea).</li>
            <li>It can make the peel sting a bit more if your face is really dry, so use discretion when choosing to apply a toner.</li>
            <li>Then i wondered if I could get those kind of results for less</li>
            <li>I rinsed for a minute or two, making sure to be 100% thorough, then followed the directions by patting dry with a cotton pad and applying Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>so much so that i&#x27;ve pretty much stopped using anything else.</li>
            <li>and I get big scars easily.</li>
            <li>have had mild adult acne for about a year now.  </li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive too.</li>
            <li>, however, I see no dramatic long-term improvement.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is as strong as the SA peels you get with a facial.  </li>
            <li>Every single day my skin looks better.</li>
            <li>so it certainly doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>unless you have an exceptionally large face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus the large pores I am plagued with are looking tighter/smaller already.</li>
            <li>I also have large pores on my  cheeks close to my nose.</li>
            <li>but i have large pores</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using large amounts for up to 7 minutes</li>
            <li>After a couple hours I put on Eucerin redness relief night cream, which is also a miracle worker if you have redness in certain areas of your face.  </li>
            <li>I have been blessed with large pores (</li>
            <li>I have large pores on my nose, chin and between eyebrows.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t do it all the time, just when a large blemish appears.  </li>
            <li>B004Z209HS Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil 4 fl.</li>
            <li>well, it&#x27;s pure oil (it feels like olive oil), so its like returning the oil to your face that you had stripped away (</li>
            <li>I had a blackhead above my eyebrow and after using this peel, it came right to the surface and came right out!</li>
            <li>When I was ready to remove the peel I rinsed my face with copious amounts of cool water and then patted my face dry with a clean towel.</li>
            <li>i cant wait for the full results :) finally something for aging skin that has teenage acne!</li>
            <li>have been using this for a few weeks now and LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I have so many scars from the acne and new acne continue to appear daily.</li>
            <li>Afterward, I enjoy smooth clearer skin and much less oil production.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my face, thus far have not exceeded 1 minute, once a week due to the intense \\&quot;tingle\\&quot;, &amp; it works for minimizing pores &amp; getting the top layer of dead skin off the surface (a nice, smooth feeling &amp; appearing result).  </li>
            <li>After 2 applications of the salicylic peel, I can completely see a difference - my face looks and feels smoother, I have no new acne and the acne scars are fading quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no visible change in my skin, but it feels so much more soft and clean than with any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Some people might see the frosting right at the first time while others like me will see in few applications, that is because it is doing its job from top to bottom.</li>
            <li>I am starting to see the wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>My experience with this peel has been consistent with many of the other customer reviews.  </li>
            <li>It has also erased fine lines, extra plus.</li>
            <li>but it was fine the next week</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to use it until gone and then make a final decision on whether it has helped pore size, sun spots, fine wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin clear and smooth, and is mild enough to not need rinsing off.</li>
            <li>I probably wont purchase this particular peel again unless I go for a higher level.</li>
            <li>I bought this product with very high hopes.</li>
            <li>Overall I am impressed with this product because it helps clear my dead skin and regenerate new skin.   </li>
            <li>and I get dark spots very easily.  </li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that the peel burns A LOT more when your skin is very dry when applying it.</li>
            <li>My routine starts with a double-cleanse; the first one to get rid of my make up, and the second to clean as if from scratch.</li>
            <li>Of course, before applying, you aren&#x27;t supposed to use micro-dermabrasion products and you&#x27;re supposed to have a very clean, dry face.</li>
            <li>I had pretty high hopes for this item</li>
            <li>If you have never done a peel at home, I highly recommend you start with the 20% and as your skin get use to it then move on to the higher concentration.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but this stuff was killer on my skin.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t very good at keeping up with these routines</li>
            <li>The only time I had any peeling was when I got a little peel happy and applied Alpha Hydroxy on off days.   </li>
            <li>The only thing I experienced was a little bit of stingy...</li>
            <li>If you want better results than last time (resulting in more peeling) you leave it one a little longer.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve got acne to loose! :)</li>
            <li>Like many of you, I&#x27;ve spent so much time, emotion, energy and money looking for something ...</li>
            <li>Not only has it cleared my skin and minimized my huge pores it also cleared up hyper-pigmentation from acne.</li>
            <li>Yes, I experienced peeling a few days later  4.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because they need to provide more instructions with how to use the product and if you aren&#x27;t careful, you can really burn yourself.</li>
            <li>so i called it then not knowing when to really stop</li>
            <li>I know it seems very enticing to buy a face peel, and use it at home without having to go to the derm.</li>
            <li>And for that I was already very grateful for.</li>
            <li>I did a couple times, I didn&#x27;t like the result too much.  </li>
            <li>THANKS FOR READING.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much clearer, smoother, and</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t break out that much...</li>
            <li>, I ordered the cellbone pH neutralizer along with it and they actually give a free 15ml sample of the glycolic 35% peel.</li>
            <li>and I finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.</li>
            <li>The peel itself made my skin smoother and diminished the size of my pores; I saw these results immediately, and received several compliments on how smooth my face looked.</li>
            <li>While I would recommend this to someone who wants smoother skin, I would not recommend it for clearing acne, as it seemed to aggravate my spots rather than soothe and exfoliate them.  </li>
            <li>it really didn&#x27;t burn at all</li>
            <li>it was more of a tingling  feeling it did crystalize some but not much in my opinion</li>
            <li>I followed directions and though it did sting for the 8 minutes you&#x27;re supposed to leave it on, I didn&#x27;t see much peeling after nor did I see any difference in my skin</li>
            <li>This stuff does tingle a bit, but very bearable.</li>
            <li>May buy this (in the 100 mL bottle) after i get rid of my red spots to maintain an acne free face.        </li>
            <li>and I really notice a difference in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>thats why i don&#x27;t know if this product is really working yet.</li>
            <li>it hurt so much.</li>
            <li>Ive tried a lot of products and this one didnt really work for me...</li>
            <li>I have zero blemishes thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li>that was very drying &amp; the peel just aggravated that dryness.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really know what yo expect</li>
            <li>I had very oily skin and acne issues.  </li>
            <li>I have never seen results that work so fast in treatments.</li>
            <li>any suggestions would be much appreciated.</li>
            <li>The treatments really work, but if you haven&#x27;t built up your skin&#x27;s \\&quot;readiness\\&quot; with some home treatments, even over-the-counter acne washes with 2% salicylic, the burning this peel will produce will be too much for you.</li>
            <li>After just one use my acne scars were much lighter, and my skin felt like a babies.</li>
            <li>It really did work for me.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I have used antibiotics a couple of times and that really seemed to help with the acne.  </li>
            <li>Skin really burned-</li>
            <li>Wash your face with a gentle cleanser, do not exfoliate.</li>
            <li>This stuff works fast.</li>
            <li>it worked really well.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>The itching/burning wasn&#x27;t as intense as I may make it seem.</li>
            <li>Pores don&#x27;t seem to have changed much.  </li>
            <li>Wash face really well, either with my SkinSonic or just in the shower</li>
            <li>then gently rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use Acne.org Treatment (a really gentle 2.5% benzoyl peroxide cream) every night as well.  </li>
            <li>This time I applied it with my fingertips and it didn&#x27;t sting much at all.</li>
            <li>and I could tolerate it for much longer than that,</li>
            <li>Shipping was also very timely.</li>
            <li>I do have lots of severe blackheads on my nose and chin, which is really why I bought this peel.</li>
            <li>In that case, I didn&#x27;t really want to leave the house for days.</li>
            <li>It works best on \\&quot;mild\\&quot; pimples, which is disappointing because I bought this hoping to reduce the appearance of what I like to call my monster pimples (cystic pimples).</li>
            <li>It was very embarrassing.</li>
            <li>By doing that I was able to keep the product on the rest of my face for a couple minutes with minimal discomfort.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t seem to have much effect on skin discoloratiom, I plan on purchasing the glyco/lax peel to take care of that.   </li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t really seen any difference..</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>This product is very helpful in both acne and acne scars.</li>
            <li>I have acne scars from years and years ago, and it&#x27;s really helped them fade away.</li>
            <li>product works really well</li>
            <li>so i can&#x27;t tell too much about this concern</li>
            <li>This way you will have a gauge for what areas to be most careful with.</li>
            <li>I had a lot of scarring and this helped so much.</li>
            <li>but once I apply the peel it starts to dissapear fast.</li>
            <li>I had gone to many different dermatologists and have done everything from being on birth control, taking antibiotics (which killed all the \\&quot;good bacteria\\&quot; in my body and left me with severe yeast infections), and even having a laser peel on my face.  </li>
            <li>My acne was very persistent, I felt hopeless.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really hoping the pimples will be gone soon...</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really shrink my pores</li>
            <li>it is intense.</li>
            <li>I know they are there because I analyze my skin too much</li>
            <li>, shipping was fast, I got it 3 days after I place my order.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had much of a need for a while.  </li>
            <li>Also, at this concentration, I don&#x27;t see the need to leave it on much longer.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>(you can also go to your local craft store and buy a cheap art brush in a size 10 or so or a fan brush.)</li>
            <li>Although I have very oily skin-I have needed both these things to combat the harshness of this</li>
            <li>If you really have an acne problem give this time be patient</li>
            <li>Not everyone will experience peeling all the time, and not that I really wanted that.  </li>
            <li>Burned a whole helluva lot though.</li>
            <li>have tried absolutely every skin product known to man (I am in my 30s and have had problem skin since I was in the 4th grade).</li>
            <li>and I was really looking forward to have my skin dramatically improved....</li>
            <li>so it did not bother me too much since i thought it&#x27;ll stop eventually</li>
            <li>I still have acne scars, which have not decreased AT ALL.</li>
            <li>and I cannot really determine its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>but I was very encouraged by all results so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In addition, this stuff can be very painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it has really, really helped.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use this as a peel.</li>
            <li>It has really made an improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>i really wish i had never used this product.</li>
            <li>I do so gently, and I dab the towel on my face</li>
            <li>and I really see a difference.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product to whom ever is reading this as well as my friends.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s something I really can&#x27;t control, but I had a 50$ gift card to Amazon and was determined to find SOMETHING to help.</li>
            <li>It does nothing, really.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 4 weeks now and waited to post my review as I wanted to see if it would really work/help.</li>
            <li>this is where I don&#x27;t so much like the product, I have been using it for 4 weeks</li>
            <li>The next morning my skin looked radiant and smooth.  </li>
            <li>used on my oldest daughter acne it works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have used another one much stronger than this</li>
            <li>and I was using this product as directed once every week, but it wasn&#x27;t doing much</li>
            <li>I read up on salicylic acid and for some it can make the skin shed so much</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, you can layer this on and it gets very intense.&lt;br</li>
            <li>someone with acne scars, I can say this has worked in a reasonable manner.</li>
            <li>It works but you need so much on your skin to work</li>
            <li>around the nose and mouth) stand with your face in front of a fan that helps, wash really well with water and then immediately use moisturizer and the burn goes away.</li>
            <li>I hopeI haven&#x27;t grossed you out too much</li>
            <li>This area improved so much that one day I went to apply the Salicylic</li>
            <li>THAT was very gratifying.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really say how much it helped because I just got out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use on whole face.</li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>After a lot of research I started trying the lactic acid peels, which are very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>With Murad, no matter how much moisturizer I used, I still felt \\&quot;creaky.\\</li>
            <li>This chemical peel really is the real deal.</li>
            <li>so I have been subjected to \\&quot;the real</li>
            <li>Face feels so much smoother.</li>
            <li>I like that feeling; let&#x27;s me know its doing its job, haha.</li>
            <li>The results have been really satisfactory.</li>
            <li>I just got the bottle today and used it straight away.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really burn (but you could feel something).</li>
            <li>The one drawback: it is an extremely intense pain.</li>
            <li>Try use it like 2 days before going out so there isnt as much flaky skin.</li>
            <li>My 70 y/o skin does very well with this product</li>
            <li>I just wanted to let people know that if they don&#x27;t make it the whole 7 minutes, they do still get benefit.</li>
            <li>After much research online and deliberation I bought this product.</li>
            <li>- it is not as gentle as everyone states</li>
            <li>Work your way into this product, as it is very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel much stinging</li>
            <li>My skin is reacting very well to this medication.</li>
            <li>During this time i had gotten around 3 chemical peels through my dermatologist, which really didnt seem to do much for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually comfortable to go outside without any makeup</li>
            <li>This stuff really burns.</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t give it 5 stars as of yet.</li>
            <li>but no worse then putting a liquid bandaid on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say how often you use it really depends on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I found it wasn&#x27;t a very controlled application-not something you want when dealing with acid.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>I used this product for 5 weeks, once a week, and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It is important to have control over where the gel is applied, and letting using your hands will likely lead to skin irritation and drying on your hands.  </li>
            <li>This product is really great.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I have also tried every brand of acne abrasive soap, gentle soap, scrub, toners, lifters, tighteners, clay masks, rubbery peel masks, over the counter pills...ect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a chemical peel at a spa and this peel burned much....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried blue light therapy, which is costly and results are not permanent.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, its really does work.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on my whole face very often; I like to use it as a spot treatment.  </li>
            <li>so very</li>
            <li>Now, if you don&#x27;t get this stuff off fast it will start to burn.</li>
            <li>This stuff is intense.</li>
            <li>the reviews and figured I&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for 3 weeks before realizing that I shouldn&#x27;t really be putting myself through this.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work as a peel.</li>
            <li>(much safer)  </li>
            <li>, so I take some CeraVe lotion on a damp washcloth and gently rub in a circular motion all over my face.  </li>
            <li>light facial</li>
            <li>do NOT let the percentages deceive as to how much of a wallop these products pack when it comes to the \\&quot;tingling sensation\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Furthermore in order to sooth my skin every night after doing this I would slather it in Jojoba Oil and really rub it in like a gentle massage.</li>
            <li>I know however it takes about two weeks for your skin to purge itself when you start a skin regime that is as intense as this.</li>
            <li>Much of this is now gone.</li>
            <li>It really ruined my skin.</li>
            <li>very good)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sleep much</li>
            <li>will look much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will absolutely self-neutralize after anywhere from 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Considering how expensive most products are with salicylic acid, I think this is a great deal and can totally work for you.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice any difference except my skin feels \\&quot;tighter\\&quot; after I wash it off.  </li>
            <li>The skin around my nose is much thinner</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s most noticeable in my forehead where the skin there is smoother and has minimal spots to begin</li>
            <li>and it really helps.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
            <li>but I felt very tightness and dryness around my nose</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too much of a puss to handle the pain</li>
            <li>This really minimized that.  </li>
            <li>Talk about fast results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I stayed home for two weekends feeling like I got the plague, which made me very depressed.</li>
            <li>I find that products with Salicylic acid work very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I used this for 6 months weekly</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It has really improved my skin.</li>
            <li>I am now ready to increase to the 30% solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really do recommend reading and adhering to the instructions that come with the bottle.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>This peel can be very drying</li>
            <li>The reviews on here really encouraged me to give this a try</li>
            <li>but it is much easier to extract after this peel.</li>
            <li>If you absolutely feel like you need a chemical peel, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>This was really what I have been looking for it did the job...</li>
            <li>use a gentle cleanser with cucumber extract for my face wash &amp;#34;BRAND:</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my skin</li>
            <li>my son&#x27;s acne is a real problem.</li>
            <li>and I was very happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>hurt a bit for the 1st time but was very tolerable afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my whole life</li>
            <li>The product is gentle on the skin if used according to the directions..</li>
            <li>My pores are nearly non-visible, my face is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The first time, I left it on for 3 minutes and rinsed it off with cool water.</li>
            <li>I had some redness and peeling only on my most sensitive areas of my face about 36-48 hours after using the peel.</li>
            <li>In addition to this product, I washed my face with warm water to open up my pores and then I used Neutrogena&#x27;s pore refining toner to reduce the size of my pores and to clear old skin.  </li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on many products including proactive</li>
            <li>My face is almost completely clear most of the time, but recently I&#x27;ve been getting some pimples hear</li>
            <li>I sure appreciated that because I was curious about it.  </li>
            <li>After the first week i noticed i was breaking out with more than average acne in my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li>Here is my own direction: I place a few drops of gel into my palm.</li>
            <li>In reviews people spoke of heavy peeling and nice skin tone after a while.</li>
            <li>I stopped going to the dermatologist a few years ago and have been trying to treat my skin problems on my own.  </li>
            <li>You will build resistance slowly and dont forget to wear good sunblock lotion.</li>
            <li>I have and my face felt like sand paper, get some good thick face cream.</li>
            <li>It had a mild tingle(after about 2 minutes when I&#x27;d rinse with cool water) and left my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Since I have been using this product, my forehead is clear!!!</li>
            <li>Make sure to apply a heavy moisturizer right after.</li>
            <li>And i do hope to see some improvement with preventing new acne or might have try a higher strength.</li>
            <li>FOR NEW PEELERS: If you are thinking that you might try a peel for the first time, I would like to encourage you to spend some time getting to understand how chemical peels work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the long term effects of this product and as of right now, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read several that said the title of \\&quot;Peel\\&quot; was facetious as most people don&#x27;t actually notice any skin peeling; others said that the skin would peel the first 48 hours and then look so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got way more results than I expected!</li>
            <li>I am not saying it made my acne vanished, but it helped me way more that any other product that I have tried before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the first time in years, my face is clear and I am starting to enjoy not wearing make-up.  </li>
            <li>(This instant gratification alone makes it worth the price!)</li>
            <li>First, the bottle will last you much longer than you think, so the price is worth it.</li>
            <li>I did some research and believe I had a Copper/Zinc imbalance now for many years due to my Copper IUD.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go into details because you can find out more about it on other sites.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product 6 times now, and I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement of my overall complexion.</li>
            <li>The first time, I left the product on for only a couple of minutes, as I was feeling a burning sensation mostly around my nose.</li>
            <li>My struggle with acne is much the same as everyone else&#x27;s-persistent acne that refuses to quit despite medication and special washes and creams like Proactiv and skin</li>
            <li>Pores are so much smaller, face is clean and radiant.</li>
            <li>My complexion is so many different shades that I could never leave the house bare faced.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m 26 and STILL have problems, mainly with clogged pores and what seems like too much oil production.  </li>
            <li>peculiar.&lt;br /&gt;i do my peel at night, starting with a clean face</li>
            <li>I use it in conjuction with herbal pills that support liver function &amp; help to clean the blood such as Murad clarifying pills.</li>
            <li>If your looking for the real deal this isn&#x27;t it, but it does a decent job if used correctly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product that will literally clean out your pores.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to try this along with switching to a more natural face wash and facial lotion and also using a very soft bristle</li>
            <li>was delightfully surprised that it is very gentle</li>
            <li>One VIPeel treatment cost me $375 and that was on special, 6 weeks later I did another VIP treatment, I saw no improvement in my skin</li>
            <li>So definitely don&#x27;t do this before a date or a special event!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So definitely don&#x27;t do this before a date or a special event!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For 2 days my face was severely red in those areas it looked like I got a black eye or a good beating.</li>
            <li>This peel, the Salicylic 20% is not as strong as the professional, but I have been getting similar results.  </li>
            <li>Initially, I saw no changes in the clearness of my skin and it actually made my skin very dry at first, then very oily even when using a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Red marks and scars on my cheeks with significantly lighter, skin looked even MORE radiant and all active blemishes were GONE!  </li>
            <li>As of today I have around a week and a half using the product and besides been excited from the prior reviews I am in love with it and the reaction of my face.</li>
            <li>Very clear instructions, cheap enough that even though it didn&#x27;t work for me, I don&#x27;t feel like I got ripped off!    </li>
            <li>As many other reviewers have mentioned, it normally worsens the breakout before it clears it up</li>
            <li>In the first month, I did not see clear changes.</li>
            <li>Even though my face is completely clear of blemishes, I still have to wear makeup because I just don&#x27;t have pretty skin.</li>
            <li>Even when my skin is pretty clear (for me)</li>
            <li>So I first purchased this product nearly a year ago.</li>
            <li>It burned and tingled with the first use, but I quickly developed a tolerance, so that I could leave it on way over 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Used the full 8 mins the next day, started to see improvements.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll check back in 6 weeks when I&#x27;ve had a series of mini peels for a full review.</li>
            <li>Okay so i have acne holes and dark brown spots from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>face first, then sensitive areas for reduced time.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have guessed properly exactly where my sensitive areas were before using the peel all over</li>
            <li>Proactiv and other topical medications are only programmed to be dissolved into the the epidermal tissue of the skin, so to me it makes more sense that by causing the outer skin layer to shed and be renovated, it will do a lot more (in terms of clearing skin and reducing pore size).  </li>
            <li>I then used cool water and nothing else and scrubbed my face using only my hands and within 30 seconds I found relief from the burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I look like a snake for the first 3-4 days after using the product.</li>
            <li>Even if a product took away many of the actual pimples i was still left with very bumpy skin.  </li>
            <li>I leave it on for only about 4 - 5 minutes before rinsing with copious amounts of cool water in the shower.</li>
            <li>works nicely for me and helps diminish small lines and crepe type wrinkles in my aging skin.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the results were pretty much the same as the first two weeks.</li>
            <li>I will change my rating to a 5 if I&#x27;m able to use Amby on my dark spots without reoccuring break outs.</li>
            <li>The next day, the true extent of the effects was seen (I think skin continued sloughing off throughout the night).</li>
            <li>First, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is not overly sensitive and if I left this product on for more than three or four minutes I was nearly in tears at the stinging and burning sensation.</li>
            <li>Definitely follow the instructions when they say to build up to the full amount of time this sits on your face.</li>
            <li>The neck, chest, hands and arms didn&#x27;t hurt a bit; left them on for the full eight min.  </li>
            <li>I had some frosting and moderate tingling, but not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>Its more like the itching you get in your feet while you&#x27;re driving, and you just can&#x27;t reach down to itch it</li>
            <li>It has definitely decreased the redness that comes with this, which is awesome because I&#x27;m not particularly fond of looking like I&#x27;m blushing all the time.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and advise that you take it slow at first and DO NOT GIVE up on it, be consistent and safe.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to read the instructions carefully!!  </li>
            <li>If you only have slight acne or the occasional breakout this strength should work beautifully.</li>
            <li>(your skin will be a little red afterwards) and use a good moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>Color wise my skin tends to be a little reddish but overall</li>
            <li>With only 30 seconds, you cant expect much; my skin was a bit tight; when I woke up, it had a very even tone and looked lovely, which is a word I would rarely use to describe my skin</li>
            <li>After reading all these amazing reviews on this product and having no luck with getting rid of my past acne scars I went ahead and bought this with high hopes.</li>
            <li>Cannot tell if it will be effective on dark spots, not enough time, but I will use in future since I could feel the difference in how smooth my face feels.</li>
            <li>skin has gone from being rather unremarkable--you know, not bad enough to notice, but not good enough to notice either--to beautiful.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to see how it will be after a few more treatments, especially for my son.</li>
            <li>Really burns and you need to follow directions, but it does make your face shiny and new.</li>
            <li>My skin has a whole new look and feel after decades of severe acne.</li>
            <li>I have high hopes that this product will continue working and that I will be able to wear something other than turtlenecks all winter!</li>
            <li>question is, for the first time yesterday, I applied this under my eyes with a Q-tip on my fine lines and had to remove it immediately (about or less than a minute).</li>
            <li>This method also makes you use less solution so you will have more than the 15 applications that are in each bottle.</li>
            <li>tried antibacterial soap, more moisturizer, less moisturizer, sulphur soap, no soap, every facewash on the shelf.</li>
            <li>But it made my skin look better, less hyper-pigmented from all the sun-filled activities this summer.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to do it more often, on a routine basis to see it get less oily over time.</li>
            <li>Make sure your skin is hydrated before putting on the peel because it hurts much less then.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying this mainly for the discolorations and acne.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t leave the product on for more than 4 minutes yet the last and final time I did, the skin on my chin burned off leaving bruises.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered from mild to moderate acne since my teens.  </li>
            <li>Where I was only having mild breakouts before, my face now resembles that of my acne scarred adolescence.</li>
            <li>My problem is the nose and chin, mainly the bottom portion of the nose.     </li>
            <li>I used to have a mild occasional acne problem</li>
            <li>I am pleased to say that after only one use, my acne is starting to fade.</li>
            <li>suddenly this year may be because I always stay up late and have great pressure(I have never had acne before).</li>
            <li>At first, I noticed that I did have more small pimples showing up on my nose within about 24 hours of using the acid.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, the bumps I mentioned earlier were now turning into pimples which were going away just as quickly as it would come.  </li>
            <li>For me this is much too frequent and I don&#x27;t feel that there is much benefit to using it this often.  </li>
            <li>After doing massive research, I decide to use a derma-roller, super cop 2x, and salicylic acid peels on the scar.</li>
            <li>I definately would recommend this if you have mild to moderate acne.  </li>
            <li>but this particular company is 100%.  </li>
            <li>but I decided it would be ok if I left it on my skin for ten minutes</li>
            <li>Better to be safe than sorry.</li>
            <li>I also get the classic outbreaks around my chin/mouth area and temples.</li>
            <li>but I mainly use the salicylic for spot treatments once a week</li>
            <li>It definitely burns when you put it on, so I&#x27;ve only been able to tolerate it for about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>just make sure you remove the mask the second your face turns red and frosting begins.</li>
            <li>Works decently well, but takes a while.</li>
            <li>makes my face flakey red, and more prone to breakouts, especially not being in the sun, pool and tanned all the time.</li>
            <li>There are MANY treatments in one tiny bottle, so don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re \\&quot;wasting it\\&quot; with only one or two minute treatments.</li>
            <li>Think I got an older one.</li>
            <li>I currently only have 3-5 pimples on my face, all of which I&#x27;m confident will disappear in the next week or so.</li>
            <li>Now I feel like I got rip off all these years by paying a professional to do something as simple as a Light Peel.  </li>
            <li>SERIOUSLY, I&#x27;D NOT DARE TO DO THIS</li>
            <li>Would recommend because let&#x27;s face it, if you&#x27;re interested in a product like this, you will do anything to get rid of acne, including taking on some facial stinging ;)</li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping that it would help fade my sun spots and melasma, which is mainly on my forehead and under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I was only able to tolerate it for a minute total.  </li>
            <li>This is the main ingredient in wart removers.</li>
            <li>Pores are getting smaller, skin overall looks better.</li>
            <li>know this is a long review, but I just had so much to say about this true miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li>She knows what actually works and doesn&#x27;t work for many different skin types.  </li>
            <li>, overall I&#x27;m quiet satisfied with this peel.</li>
            <li>A lot of blackheads around nose and chin area is my main problem.  </li>
            <li>Your skin may peel a little bit after the first couple of times using it, but for the most part there will not be visible peeling (unless you have incredibly sensitive skin and/or have never used an exfoliant.</li>
            <li>Every single pore was clogged and I had huge pimples and marks galore.</li>
            <li>After the shower, I gently pat my face dry and apply Shikai Borage Oil Facial Moisturizer, which is very light, all-natural, and unscented.</li>
            <li>I will say that I&#x27;m glad I had a few professionally done first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest following the guidelines as suggested in the directions:  not leave on for more than 8 minutes although I think that would be much too long a time.  </li>
            <li>Finally, if it burns too much then rinse right away.</li>
            <li>My t-zone is more normal and less oily.</li>
            <li>Go easy on the first few applications.</li>
            <li>During this time, I felt such a strong sensation on my nose that I couldn&#x27;t bare.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I got high expectation on this</li>
            <li>(one can of course buy a neutralizer if one is so inclined, but I highly recommend this step.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sheesh, this is long and I am aware my Process (if reading this out loud make sure to properly emphasize the P)</li>
            <li>I have a high pain tolerance (four kids...natural childbirth) but it does burn.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, just try it for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>and I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product, but suggest you do a patch test and follow directions to avoid pain and embarrassment.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend both the product and the company.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend a Neutralizer if you are going to use this peel-</li>
            <li>, I still need a fan on high during application.</li>
            <li>If this works when I was in high school</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the jojoba oil in conjunction with this.</li>
            <li>In high school I used Retin-A and that was when the hyperpigmentation started.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have a high tolerance for pain</li>
            <li>highly suggest instead of buying a PH stabilizer, use baking soda.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>you are looking for noticable results and a stronger peel I highly recommend the TCA peel by Skin Laboratory.</li>
            <li>so my skin was not used to such a high concentration of salicylic acid, or any other kind of acid for that matter.  </li>
            <li>I still have some discoloring from past acne, but it covers easily with a light dusting of the Bare Minerals foundation I have been using for years.  </li>
            <li>My skin under my eyes were slightly pink and my fine lines now look like wrinkles!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was out in the sun for a little, and I could literally feel the sun beaming on my skin much more in the areas where I had applied the salicylic acid.</li>
            <li>For anyone out there who is considering having a iron mask forged to hide their adult acne, DON&#x27;T!!</li>
            <li>The skin around my pimples seemed to look a little bit better.</li>
            <li>many people pointed out, it did make my skin peel a little.</li>
            <li>but I do get MANY little clogged pores of both blackheads and whiteheads.  </li>
            <li>This product is extremely strong and extremely concentrated and thus must be used with high caution.  </li>
            <li>In addition to acne gel, I&#x27;ve tried facial cleaning product from Clean and Clear and the Walmart brand benzoyl peroxide cleaning pads.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;After a couple uses, I find my skin more firm and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Overall highly recommended and worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, so this was unexpected.</li>
            <li>I am a 43 year old Caucasian woman and have had acne my whole life.  </li>
            <li>My face has really started to clear up.</li>
            <li>This shocked me in a wonderful way, because this peel isn&#x27;t supposed to improve these things specifically.</li>
            <li>His skin looked rough before, but now it looks smooth.  </li>
            <li>One last thing I have to say is that this product is cheaper and more effective than the $500 laser treatment I paid for and all those doctor visits and useless prescriptions</li>
            <li>My skin in these areas was a light shade of pink after rinsing.     </li>
            <li>My skin is no longer the light shade of pink</li>
            <li>and my skin look so much smoother and clear.</li>
            <li>It has really helped to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>I decided to order this product after spending way too much money on professional chemical peels.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t turn very red at all when using this mask, and I really don&#x27;t feel irritation on my face; however, I decided the second time that I used the product to do my upper neck (under my chin) and that area of skin turned bright red for about a day.  </li>
            <li>I developed melasma about 5 years ago and tried TriLuma cream for a year or so, but it never did much for me.  </li>
            <li>, my skin looks much improved - clear with shrunken pores.  </li>
            <li>I have had problem skin for years, very oily and frequent break outs.</li>
            <li>The next day it was scabbed up, so I continued to use it and it peeled after about 2-3 days, and now I&#x27;m left with more natural looking skin.</li>
            <li>Most of my blemishes are starting to peel, which will leave behind newer, much better looking skin.</li>
            <li>My acne has been there for many years, so maybe it takes long to disappear entirely.</li>
            <li>At fist I thought it was just normal breakout.</li>
            <li>I am going to stick with this therapy for few more days till my skin becomes in tone with my neck.    </li>
            <li>I am going to order few more for my friends too.</li>
            <li>and I dont leave it on past 3 mins cuz the burn is more intense.</li>
            <li>After using the product a few more times, I can tolerate the stinging for longer now, I&#x27;m up to 3-4 minutes now.</li>
            <li>After this passes your skin will look and feel significantly better in every way for a few days until you use it again and the process repeats itself.  </li>
            <li>So I will be using this in conjuction with the peel until my skin returns to normal.</li>
            <li>Acne didn&#x27;t subside, it just carried on its normal routine.</li>
            <li>(tried this with just alcohol a few times and that adds more redness recovery time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did this one first, my skin is pretty tolerant to medications since I&#x27;ve had acne for so long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping after a few more treatments, they&#x27;ll be all gone.  </li>
            <li>I have a few tiny dent-type scars that blend into my smile lines mostly.</li>
            <li>It not only shortens the length of time I have acne, but keeps me from getting scarring and makes the overall condition of my skin far better.</li>
            <li>I applied the gel peel on top of the dried skin toner.    </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I followed the directions of keeping it on for only one minute (and building it a minute at a time each use) and I used it on my whole face.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin anyway, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised that this burned rather ferociously the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know for sure.  </li>
            <li>Around 21, my skin cleared up for the most part, though I&#x27;d get a few break outs around the week of menstruation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>time, along with the frosting, there were varying shades --the more dead skin you have, the browner</li>
            <li>On first use it can burn quite a bit, but after several uses you don&#x27;t notice it so much.</li>
            <li>You are pretty much making your skin naked to the atmosphere and the sun</li>
            <li>first time I used the salicylic acid peel, I followed the instructions and left it on only for a minute on only the areas with most breakouts.</li>
            <li>Stick with AHA and BHA at the most and heavily use sunscreen after that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One week I apply the salicylic acid peel and smear my face with Egyptian Magic for a few days while my skin recovers.</li>
            <li>At the moment I am doing a salicylic acid peel and use Egyptian magic for a few days until the peeling is over.</li>
            <li>Apply Egyptian Magic or coconut oil heavily.  </li>
            <li>Neutragena and Aveeno can burn my skin, so I normally use Vanicream sunscreen after this peel.  </li>
            <li>you save a lot of money and pretty much the same results.</li>
            <li>I ended up using an eye droppers to make sure I don&#x27;t waste any.</li>
            <li>off.&lt;br /&gt;- peeled off skin with my fingers, washed my face, and scrubbed more dead skin off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking at my skin this morning and almost cried because I never thought my skin would look so normal.</li>
            <li>think the reason that so many people on here have had unsatisfying results with this product is because they do not allow the peel to work on their skin long enough.</li>
            <li>Although this isn&#x27;t a very deep peel, it is a powerful product so use with caution and follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But too many years of using the Retin A started to create the problem of rosacea and was too harsh to use every night.  </li>
            <li>It is good, just a little makes skin dry.  </li>
            <li>Followed the process with a high SPF to protect the new me.</li>
            <li>I have been suffering from acne since 8th grade, and am now about to graduate high school and made my New Year&#x27;s Resolution to get rid of my acne for college.</li>
            <li>BUT as I was watching it in action, I could see really old \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; zits coming to the surface!!!</li>
            <li>the dead skin started peeling off and there was new smooth pretty skin.</li>
            <li>The vitamins and minerals or whatevers in these pills makes my skin more even looking, and I haven&#x27;t even had any new zits in the past couple weeks which is unusual for me unfortantely.    </li>
            <li>It is not hard to use.  </li>
            <li>And the product shouldn&#x27;t be left on for more than 8-10 minutes, MUCH less at first.  </li>
            <li>I am a biracial (african american/korean) with oily, mild adult acne skin.  </li>
            <li>Washed my face with a mild cleanser (Cetaphil), dabbed my face with alcohol to remove excess oil, and then took vaseline and lined my mouth eyes, and near my nose to protect from potential chemical burns.</li>
            <li>I use step 8 to eliminate dry, flakey skin after a peel, but I have SUPER combination skin that is, at times in the same places, super oily and super dry</li>
            <li>However, these were small pimples and went away quickly and were not painful like cystic ones.  </li>
            <li>so it is easy to control the application and get the peel on evenly and fast to avoid an uneven result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it is easy to control the application and get the peel on evenly and fast to avoid an uneven result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time on my face, I did not do much, and I purged for two days with acne -- about a week later my skin was clear and a little more oily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many other products that have me applying and reapplying for 3 to 4 days with way worse results, so I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with this.</li>
            <li>I bought a Groupon recently for a salycilic peel (right before I bought this product).  </li>
            <li>I did another treatment right before bed to help with the peeling, and used a regular cream moisturizer afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I noticed some peeling on the left cheek and a lot of peeling on the right.</li>
            <li>The texture also appeared different right away, I will use this once a week for a month</li>
            <li>I had no problem applying it to my entire face right from the start.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t use it long because became pregnant and opted to stop for safety.</li>
            <li>I saw a dry piece of skin ready to fall off and it peeled right off along with the scar.  </li>
            <li>It really zaps blackheads like no other!</li>
            <li>and she told me to clean my face daily and just use the general acne treatment products</li>
            <li>It keeps in the fridge just fine and its nice and cold on my face after the peel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I read other peoples reviews and was excited but didnt clear up much</li>
            <li>I would suggest using it for only a few minutes at first to make sure your skin can handle it  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to use this product due to the high reviews.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad itch, it&#x27;s mild and wont last past the first day.</li>
            <li>If they did, new ones took their place.</li>
            <li>and I broke out with three new pimples.</li>
            <li>you WILL get new ones if you do.</li>
            <li>I notice spots on my face where my skin is peeling; bringing out new skin.  </li>
            <li>has helped keep my acne to about 1 eruption a week, where before I was getting one or two new pimple a day.</li>
            <li>Because I was new to the \\&quot;peel\\&quot; world, I let it sit for 3 minutes</li>
            <li>So I gave up and tried to embrace my new marks all over my face...</li>
            <li>If you suffer from hyperpigmentation, the shedding of the skin will eventually even out the spots as new layers of skin are generated.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this peel in a search for a new skincare product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what the new skin looks like</li>
            <li>Those are just my warnings to new users.</li>
            <li>I DID go to the dermatologist to help prevent new acne, which I learned I have cystic acne, plus OCD on picking at it.</li>
            <li>I remember some of the reviews describing the occurrence of the new pimples</li>
            <li>leave it on for the suggested five minutes if you are completely new to at home</li>
            <li>I cut out everything new I could think of that I&#x27;d added to my regime, anywhere from skin products, to vitamins to food.</li>
            <li>I help my skin heal by using hydrocortisone cream 2-3 times a day and this helps the skin peel itself to reveal your new, baby-soft skin underneath.  </li>
            <li>I use it often times when noticing a new pimple or cyst forming, applying a dab with a q-tip.</li>
            <li>I have realistic expectations and hope for a little more glow in my skin and slightly cleaner looking/easier to clean pores.  </li>
            <li>Had to stop when I moved because the new place has almost 0 humidity &amp; this peel made my skin super dry.</li>
            <li>I am a huge believe in facial oils for daily use.  </li>
            <li>If you are like me however, once you stop using this, if you have a bad habit like picking your skin then you will need to continuously use this or get better habits :) only thing that I don&#x27;t enjoy about this is that because it is literally getting rid of you old skin cells, you can feel a burning sensation.</li>
            <li>The problem with black skin is that it hyperpigments easy and by the time</li>
            <li>I then apply the mixture very carefully to my clean face and neck without rubbing, being extremely careful not to get any product into my eyes.</li>
            <li>Instructions are so easy, and the product works in less than 8 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, I hope this review has shined some light on people who are experienceing the same thing as me :0)</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;rough patch\\&quot; on my chin has nearly disappeared with three light treatments since day 1.</li>
            <li>If you have the extra money and a weekend to stay home and hide out, the benefits of a deeper peel done by a professional is definitely worth the time.</li>
            <li>This came in really handy with my recent outbreak of acne, I wash my face with a regular cleanser and pat my face dry.</li>
            <li>My skin tolerates spot treatments as needed but be careful and make sure your skin can tolerate the extra treatments.  </li>
            <li>Newer scars are completely gone, older one faded just a bit.</li>
            <li>It will neutralize after several minutes and doesn&#x27;t sting as much as the whole face</li>
            <li>my skin is as soft, pink, moist and wrinkle free as a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>seriously, anyone with skin issues of any kind would benefit from this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After you remove the peel, your skin will get super dry.</li>
            <li>Warning, you can&#x27;t use this if you have sensitive skin, it definitely burns, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>The first day I started this product, I had a very large pimple on my cheek...and by the second week, &#x27;that pimple&#x27; shrunk, the third week</li>
            <li>Something I saw no other reviewers really put.</li>
            <li>I have oily combination, very sensitive, skin and decided to try this peel.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>For someone who has Never had one, I would highly recomend going to a professional to see what % they&#x27;d use on you</li>
            <li>I will continue using this treatment, and highly recommend it so far.</li>
            <li>I kept it on for a little over 3 minutes and it was hot, very hot.</li>
            <li>Because my right shoulder is nearly clear and that stopped breaking out about a year before my left stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because my right shoulder is nearly clear and that stopped breaking out about a year before my left stopped.  </li>
            <li>I definitely prefer more frequent but less intense peels because I don&#x27;t like having to drop out of my life while I&#x27;m doing them.</li>
            <li>Feels like it&#x27;s sucking and killing all the bacteria and after three-four weeks of using it now my chins is completely CLEAR!</li>
            <li>(my derm explained it essentially removes the first layer of skin to allow the breakout to be exposed to the medication), but after that the healing process is speedy.</li>
            <li>acne was \\&quot;zapped\\&quot; immediately and fine lines were less.</li>
            <li>My skin peeled with the first use only.   </li>
            <li>Used first for 2 mins, and had no effect, upped it to 4, same result.</li>
            <li>As far as the peel on your face, yes it does sting but its managable!  </li>
            <li>I definitely felt the stinging/burning sensation the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>The first time is recommended at only 1 minute</li>
            <li>I have brown skin, so I&#x27;m aware that my skin can react differently to it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I only did a spot treatment and had it on my skin for 4-5 mins.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion would be to do the first application when you have no plans to be anywhere just in case you break out like I did.</li>
            <li>I left it on for 6 minutes the first time.  </li>
            <li>I only had the product for a minute the first time</li>
            <li>,  the product is producing more pimples than I have ever seen in a lifetime, that is not to say the the peel itself is damaging my face (i.e. chemical burn, spots,  excessive drying, etc.).   </li>
            <li>I recently ordered this product and after the first use my skin was glowing and cleared the acne within 24 hrs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always better to be safe than sorry!  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t try and leave it on for ten minutes the first time or you might burn yourself.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;Im tan; hispanic not dark at all and not light just tan &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Then, I slough off the dead skin to reveal a fresh layer of unblemished and fresh looking baby skin.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I could only leave it on for about 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Now, the first time I put this on, there was a definite burning pain.</li>
            <li>I am 41 years old and wondering when all this was going to stop!  </li>
            <li>Back to the peel:  first time around, burn city.  </li>
            <li>Well, this worked wonders for my old acne scars, my oily skin and as for break-outs, almost non-existent!</li>
            <li>First off, Im 18 with combination/oily skin that occasionally gets gets inflamed pores.</li>
            <li>All of my persistent acne has disappeared (completely!).  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I had my first breakout at the age of ten</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 2 days but on the first day I noticed results the morning after I had used it.</li>
            <li>other reviewer had given a link to a different brand which was quite a bit more pricier</li>
            <li>did the peel for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>The first 2 applications, I didn&#x27;t see much of a result, but by the third, WOW WOW WOW.  </li>
            <li>product also evens out my skin tone which had suffered scars from past acne :)</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t imagine starting out with a higher concentration.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product for anyone who has acne, acne scars, and redness and wants results!</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time last night, and im not going to lie, it burned like hell.</li>
            <li>Now, I can say that only because my skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive and I have also screwed around with a lot of different products and chemicals on it before (microdermabrasion, light peels from the drugstore, glycolic acid face wash, benzoyl peroxide, atralin, etc)</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I left it on my skin for four minutes, then put on toner.  </li>
            <li>my face looks brighter(vibrant) and the acne is completely gone!</li>
            <li>First I would do my back and then my face.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re still pretty red.</li>
            <li>At first it was just some redness that was no big deal.</li>
            <li>If you have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; bathroom lighting it actually masks a lot of the first stages.</li>
            <li>Fewer blackheads, pores appear smaller (actually just cleaner :), skin is smoother, fewer blemishes after several uses.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t cure your acne completely but it helps to control breakouts!</li>
            <li>Usually with peels your skin gets better day by day.    </li>
            <li>Absolutely less scars, my fine lines are GONE, FIRMER skin, evening out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Pretty basic.  </li>
            <li>Think will use a higher percentage next time.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, do not even touch this stuff!</li>
            <li>No biggie, it was only the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I followed the directions and left it on for exactly 60 seconds.  </li>
            <li>tried this product the first time and left it on for one minute.  </li>
            <li>After the first two times using this product there is a very big difference in the appearance of my face.  </li>
            <li>so I could get a feel for what was normal as far as redness and burning</li>
            <li>Thankfully, the whitening, rash, and melting seemed to \\&quot;clear up\\&quot; and my skin seemed normal again after about one or two hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Length of Time:I have used it twice, the first time the instructions said of 1 minute, and the 2nd time approx.</li>
            <li>I cannot wait for my next peel as it looks like the results are going to be stellar.  </li>
            <li>but when I did this the first time, it definitely bothered me a lot.</li>
            <li>The deep texture on my left lower cheek is still there, but significantly improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li>On first application she felt no stinging and did not peel (left it on for 7 minutes).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to use a facial peel for so long to combat sun damage, MANY acne scars,current acne, and general dullness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the first second it will burn like fire while its neutralizing, however after that all the burning will be gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are usually not inflamed but they are bumpy, as if there&#x27;s something underneath each one.</li>
            <li>First let me say that Im a big skin laboratory</li>
            <li>I took a before and after photo from when I first started to last night</li>
            <li>I have tried various regimens that worked to some degree but never always or consistently until now.</li>
            <li>or so I have also been using a acne medication supplement for overall skin health and its been working pretty darn well;    </li>
            <li>Within the first application after waiting only one week (I recommend 5-7 days between applications), the results showed!  </li>
            <li>left on for 2 minutes the first time.  </li>
            <li>Wow, zits be gone!</li>
            <li>I take meticulous care of my skin, use a good moisturizer daily, get regular facials, and even a few med spa chemical peels this year.  </li>
            <li>My old scars are lighter, and the pimples that occasionally pop up dry out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>This is not to say that you have to be super careful forever but just until the new skin has been exposed for a while.  </li>
            <li>is it ok for me to use tis pruduct at the same time with pro active?</li>
            <li>This acid doesn&#x27;t dry up after two weeks in the container and is strong enough to kill skin abberations.</li>
            <li>After all, even though we may not notice to a daily basis, new skin cells are consistently in rejuvenation and our skin cells are multiplying to replace old skin cells.  </li>
            <li>so clumsy people like me can&#x27;t break it so easily!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using minocycline (anti-boitic --- part of the tetracycline family and is the most powerful anti-biotic they have) and only used Prascion (a sulfur based topically applied wash) a few times.</li>
            <li>Like most of you, I&#x27;m just desperate to get clear complexion, spending thousands of dollars over the years, trying different kind of treatments.</li>
            <li>I find it helps a lot with keeping my skin clear of acne and new blackheads as well as help keep my make up in place if I put it on the night before and then don&#x27;t wash my face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very conflicted with this product, I wanted to try an over the counter product before i go to a professional for a chemical peel, and after doing research and reading reviews i decided to go with this one, but it doesnt do much good or bad for my skin, right after i use it</li>
            <li>Over the last 2 weeks, my skin has been pretty clear.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I have a light brown, age spot on the side of my face that is about an inch by a half an inch.</li>
            <li>It was pretty clear, but I could only take it for about a week.</li>
            <li>I started using regular Dove soap and Cetaphil wash, and salicylic acid twice a week at first, and it&#x27;s all that&#x27;s need to clear the face.</li>
            <li>Like the pamphlet said, my skin did feel a bit dry after using, but the dry sensation went away on its own without needing a second product.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for some kind of miracle to clear up old acne scars on my back and to even out skin tone, reduce pores on my tzone, and clear up a few acne marks on my face</li>
            <li>Maybe it would have worked if she did it more often or had a higher % acid, but she didn&#x27;t want to keep making it worse.  </li>
            <li>I did learn to only wash my face by hand before I apply the peel; when I use a Clarisonic first, it makes my face too sensitive</li>
            <li>and my acne mostly consists of blackheads all around and small whiteheads around my cheeks/mouth/jaw and occasional large cyst like zits that never pop &gt;:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 17 years old and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>have only had a professional AHA peel once, but I can honestly say it felt very similar to the one in the bottle-though the results are not as extreme as those from a asthetician.</li>
            <li>I am careful not to use any other sloughing products, scrubs etc unless I have been working in the garden and am really grubby, since I think it&#x27;s important to be gentle with one&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>While I had the typical set of pimples in high school, once I reached college and in the throes of my 20&#x27;s, the acne came full force.  </li>
            <li>I have tried trips to the dermatologist, spa treatments, OTC products all with limited success.</li>
            <li>A week later, when i felt that it&#x27;s safe to applythe peel again, I increased my application time by 30 seconds, the following day i found 2 new breakouts on my forehead and chin which did dry out soon after.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s usually some mild scabbing and peeling on the third day of using the acid, but the skin comes off cleanly.</li>
            <li>I used every other day for the full 8 mins every time.</li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t experience major peeling right away, the next day my sensitive areas did peel quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I just want to report that I am able to use the product much less often with the same result.  </li>
            <li>However, after I used the peel last night, I noticed this morning that those two spots looked MUCH better - less inflamed and well on their way to healing.</li>
            <li>(I was more or less convinced that I will simply never get rid of my acne).</li>
            <li>Some frosting during the peel and moderate dry skin with light brown patches for about 3-4 days after.  </li>
            <li>My once super deep, big blackheads are almost gone.</li>
            <li>I got BIG acne and pimples on my face and my face just did not bounce back quickly.  </li>
            <li>I happen to have exceptionally large pores pretty much all over my face, asian american, but regular use of this product</li>
            <li>Below is other products that i use in conjunction to this peel and my current skin regime, hope this helps those of you who are looking to soften your indented acne scars and combat active acne&#x27;s (GOOD LUCK EVERYONE!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I thought the first time was bad, I then became acquainted with what I&#x27;m sure is similar to the sensation of 50 bees stinging your face over and over.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, the first time I applied it, I applied very little and barely rubbed my face with a cotton-pad, so honestly I didn&#x27;t see much results in those few days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 yr old female who has struggled with mild acne since middle school.  </li>
            <li>I had tried numerous products with certain percentages of salicylic acid in it, but I took note that this product was a GEL PEEL with 20% salicyclic acid.</li>
            <li>Also, please note that as other reviewers have said, you will SEEM to break out more when using this for the first few times.</li>
            <li>it!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this stuff with a little bit of trepidation, but after reading many reviews and deciding to give it a go as my last resort before heading to the dermatologist I couldn&#x27;t be any happier!</li>
            <li>EXCEPT where the creases are in my nose (beware for that area) -- washed it off after one minute and the next day my skin seemed a little better.  </li>
            <li>For those who have read the book, many of the products recommended are either hard to find or not around anymore.  </li>
            <li>After reading other reviews and how mild the product was I decided to use the product anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started by wiping down the area with rubbing alcohol, then I used an old clean concealer brush</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work for my skin- combination skin with tiny pimples in the TZone plus occasional large zits.  </li>
            <li>The skin is very dry as expected, but the brown patches were much more noticeable than my professional peel.  </li>
            <li>a little pink in the morning, but very even toned :)  could probably use a stronger % for those areas, but not too worried about</li>
            <li>week one: After the initial use, I started breaking out a little more with a lot of whiteheads and sensitive under the skin bumps.</li>
            <li>Have only used 2 times, but so far not seeing any difference in the aging brown spots, which is the reason for my purchase per the ad....will give it a little more time to see if its going to make a difference...</li>
            <li>When using Renova or other retinoids, my skin would have dry, flaking patches which were more unsightly.</li>
            <li>peel can also be used for reasons other than your face, but you should avoid using it in large quantities, over large areas of skin, or too frequently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed an improvement and less breakouts since i&#x27;ve been exercising 30 min a day several days a week, drinking more water and adding more raw fruits and vegetables to my diet, also taking low doses of vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) supplements which is supposed to help balance hormones during that time of the month.</li>
            <li>my skin looks awesome, the only bad thing is they sent me</li>
            <li>I have been suffering from acne from 8th grade and now I am a senior who suffers from  great stress from college and school work.</li>
            <li>I decided to discontinue using it and my face started to clear.</li>
            <li>I am not a nurse, but frosting is what seems to clear up the skin, so if it does not frost, chances are you are not getting rid of your problems.</li>
            <li>my skin was almost always perfectly clear.</li>
            <li>Nothing would make them clear up.</li>
            <li>Will clear up your skin like it states.</li>
            <li>BURNS when you rinse it off, causes some redness, and DIDN&#x27;T clear my acne.    </li>
            <li>Not enough where someone could really notice, unless they stood directly in front of me.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been this clear.</li>
            <li>I always wash my face and then use alcohol all over to clear and prep my skin for the acid.  </li>
            <li>and there wasn&#x27;t a product out in the market that could give me the clear skin I have longed for.  </li>
            <li>They told me that all the toxins in my skin will rise up to the surface but in about three months, I will see visibly clear skin.  </li>
            <li>You may do permanent damage to your skin if you don&#x27;t wash it off when your body clearly knows that it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin clear and even.</li>
            <li>It is the only thing I&#x27;ve tried that has helped me clear up so much.</li>
            <li>I can still see it clearly.      </li>
            <li>Instead of using acne gel, I used Neutrogena&#x27;s Rapid Clear Oil-Eliminating Foaming Cleanser to keep my skin dryer.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so clear that I have gotten compliments from people at work.</li>
            <li>I have found that I do not have to use the peel as often anymore, but I do still need to use it for maintaining my clear skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping to clear my acne.</li>
            <li>but i just wanted to have clear skin.</li>
            <li>The insert clearly states no longer than 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>I wanted to muscle through this period reading that this will clear up eventually</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t had a professional facial in about 4 months, and I really didn&#x27;t want to drop $100 on another, so</li>
            <li>My face is 99% clear</li>
            <li>THIS HELPS KEEP COMPEXTION CLEAR AND TIGHTENS PORES.</li>
            <li>Even my girlfriend said \\&quot;your skin is looking really clear</li>
            <li>It did take about two weeks of twice-a-week use to totally clear up.</li>
            <li>had all of given up at ever having clear skin at the ripe ol&#x27; age of 25.</li>
            <li>i give this five stars because it kept my face clear when i have hormonal breakouts....</li>
            <li>Every since I started using this 4 months ago, my skin is almost completely clear.</li>

            <li>I swear, I&#x27;m just an all around happier person because I&#x27;m not always feeling self conscious about my skin.</li>
            <li>, i have used it 3 times so far.</li>
            <li>I started having severe adult acne breakouts in 2004.</li>
            <li>Since that time, I have tried every conceivable product on the market.</li>
            <li>The price seems reasonable enough, too.</li>
            <li>I have seen marked</li>
            <li>The results i got were:  -Pores got smaller noticeably on the nose, but not as much on the cheeks.  </li>
            <li>To get my skin used to it initially (be warned, I don&#x27;t really know the correct usage of this stuff</li>
            <li>I started having problems with adult onset acne at about age 25 - am now 40.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 34 years old</li>
            <li>and I have really sensitive, semi-dry skin.  </li>
            <li>and I can last the whole 10 minutes.      </li>
            <li>The second time I could stand it much easier.  </li>
            <li>It really depends on the cleanser you use prior to.  </li>
            <li>&quot; but i have seen more breakouts lately with the use of this peel.</li>
            <li>I would classify my skin as combination sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I anticipate that they will eventually peel completely off.</li>

            <li>That succes was short lived, the week after, I broke out (still breaking out) with volcanic-like pimples that are ready to erupted.  </li>
            <li>The pimples are coming back so fast before the scars would disappear.  </li>
            <li>After much searching, I have finally found the solution and instead of being embarrassed by the way my skin looks, I often receive complements.  </li>
            <li>I have used three applications so far and i am amazed at the results.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>do not buy if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This peel got such fabulous reviews (and was such a low price) that I decided to give it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just really surprised I don&#x27;t have peeling even though everybody does.  </li>
            <li>Following the same exact steps as my first application except I left the peel on for about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Used it 3x so far.</li>

            <li>and I was in absolute agony the entire minute.</li>
            <li>I realize these are sensitive areas; however, these are the areas I get white/black heads and I as hoping this peel would help reduce these, since it wasn&#x27;t working on my cystic pimples.</li>
            <li>After years of dealing with scrubs and acne products I already know where my sensitive spots are, so I kept the acid away from the area surrounding my mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 24 years old</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a whole lot of difference in my pore size/black heads, but I have been using this peel for several months now</li>
            <li>my skin prob isn&#x27;t sensitive</li>

            <li>My old acne scars have diminished as well.    </li>
            <li>I use Nivea Soft moisturizing cream afterwards because it has the vitamin E and jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li>I have adult acne</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 14 year old daughter who has suffered from acne for about 4 years now.</li>
            <li>The second week of using this her skin was clearing up very well.</li>
            <li>I have been using Retin-A since I was 16 years old.</li>
            <li>I also developed \\&quot;melasma\\&quot; 3 years ago...</li>
            <li>Ever since I developed the melasma 3 years ago I have been searching for a cure that I could afford</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s like Drano for your skin&#x27;s pipes, clearing out all the gunk and allowing the natural process of your skin to take over.  </li>

            <li>So far I&#x27;ve never had any peeling around the pimple area</li>

            <li>I predict all the marks on my shoulders will be completely gone within 1 year.  </li>

            <li>I predict all the marks on my shoulders will be completely gone within 1 year.  </li>
            <li>I started getting acne young, when i was about 10</li>
            <li>For professional results, I think that you just need to go to the professionals.</li>
            <li>I do not use the product on my forehead or near my eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the peel I added the argan oil all over my face and back and rubbed it in real well.</li>
            <li>My skin felt extremely soft and relaxed after this.</li>
            <li>years, I suffered from adult onset acne.  </li>
            <li>My acne has lessened, and so has the greasy quality my skin naturally has.</li>
            <li>The gel immediately causes areas of blemishing to abate and controls areas of more complex, vexing blemishing.</li>
            <li>My scars are primarily on my cheeks &amp; a few on my forehead.</li>
            <li>My skin was a complete wreck because I tried out the Oil Cleansing Method.</li>
            <li>4 minutes with this product on left my arm feeling much smoother.</li>
            <li>PLEASE- if you have a darker skin tone, are prone to scarring or hyperpigmentation, consult a professional before putting this product on your skin.</li>
            <li>I needed to get all that old damaged skin off.</li>
            <li>and I have adult acne,</li>
            <li>I surprised.</li>
            <li>My husband bought me this stuff as I am 27 years old</li>
            <li>Week three: Still breaking out but not as much with the pimples disappearing at a faster rate and smaller pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But if you do have this product give it at least 6 weeks before you decide that it does not work, after all you have had acne most of your life and 6 weeks is a blip on the radar.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve read enough about chemical peels to know that you really should rinse with a neutralizer.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>For me to take the time out of my ridiculously busy life to leave a review for this product speaks for itself.  </li>
            <li>One time, I decided to take the risk and just left it on my face for the whole day.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early 30s with olive</li>
            <li>but I used it directly as described and it didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>It is even fading my old acne scars.</li>
            <li>I looked in the mirror this morning and nearly cried at how blotchy, bumpy and spotted my skin is.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had PMS-related cystic acne along with some blackheads and whiteheads since my early thirties.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m young</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve kept my skin under control using proactiv everyday(all 3 steps), trying out sulfur mud masks which I really like as well as a lactic acid peel by this same company.</li>
            <li>you dont want to leave it on long in the beginning if this is your first time trying it at home.</li>
            <li>And wow, what an improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>I developed Rosacea as an adult, about 40 or so, I&#x27;m 58/male.</li>
            <li>an old batch expires in 4 months.</li>
            <li>I noticed a much improved appearance (red acne marks faded, bumps diminished, etc.).  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin and after having a baby, my face exploded in volcanoes.</li>
            <li>If you decide to purchase this product please also purchase a pH neutralizing product and have it ready so that you can properly remove this acid.</li>
            <li>So far my regimen has been improving my skin texture, smoothing it out and controlling my acne.</li>
            <li>and I do not have sensitive skin as I&#x27;d never had a problem with any glycolic peels.</li>
            <li>DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT NEAR YOUR EYES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried using this because i was getting adult acne on my chin</li>
            <li>am a 30 year old woman and of COURSE during</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does it help with acne, but also with my whole complexion.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>For those with sensitive skin, it will make you feel like your skin is on fire!!&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>like one reviewer noted yes it doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of a scar</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and had no problem tolerating the product, but I didn&#x27;t see any difference with my acne.  </li>
            <li>Took about 2 weeks for my skin to clear up completely</li>
            <li>This peel is very much professional grade and burns like ....</li>
            <li>One of those things that happens when you get old.</li>
            <li>Tried this three times so far, it looks like it will take a week or two but will work.</li>
            <li>I would give this five, except it did not meet my (perhaps wild) expectations.</li>
            <li>It can leave your skin reddish and sensitive but you can see immediate results.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with some excema on my face.</li>
            <li>Going to step away from chemicals now and try all natural.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin or anything.</li>
            <li>Old scars</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has severe adult acne break outs and he loves this product too.</li>
            <li>My acne has almost completely disappeared as a result of these peels as well.</li>
            <li>Maybe i&#x27;m just too sensitive</li>
            <li>I had an 18% salicylic peel done by a professional.  </li>
            <li>For all those acne sufferers, go get your peels done by a professional.  </li>
            <li>Completely.</li>
            <li>I am a 34 year old hispanic woman with a tn or mediterranean complexion.</li>
            <li>But if I get busy with something else and get distracted, it is tolerable.  </li>
            <li>Now, I can leave it on for 15 minutes until it is completely soaked in and don&#x27;t even notice it.  </li>
            <li>Baking Soda is a natural acid neutralizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one TCA peel done professionally a couple years ago</li>
            <li>The next morning, my skin looks much smoother and even.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s no where near 20%.</li>
            <li>I must say i bought this in hopes that i will burn my skin tags on some sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t very itchy even though i left it on them for 5 minutes every time.</li>
            <li>but now i feel alive again when i have clear skin.</li>
            <li>it really has been the only solution to my acne.</li>
            <li>In my early 40s, medium complexion.  </li>
            <li>I think my skin is clearing up too (adult cystic acne).</li>
            <li>My face is a bit sensitive sometimes but not overly sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I do NOT have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>If you know you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting professional peels for years, and my skin is used to the process.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li>The scars aren&#x27;t even there anymore, and my skin is overall much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read online that chemical peels are used to professionally remove scars</li>
            <li>This is coming from a girl who has bought countless scar-removal creams and has never seen much improvement.</li>
            <li>and I seem to have far fewer skin breakouts.</li>
            <li>Almost completely gone in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>, I have milia around my nose and on my chin which it hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of completely</li>
            <li>I am a 44 year old mom and grandmother who still had to deal with acne...</li>
            <li>50% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)]].</li>
            <li>Save up the cash and see a professional.</li>
            <li>I was getting peels professionally every month.  </li>
            <li>While it hasn&#x27;t completely eliminated the scars, it does peel some skin off the scar, and has made them almost invisible.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews on wow, this is making my skin clear up</li>
            <li>My hormones completely changed after having my daughter.  </li>
            <li>I tried naturally getting rid of my acne using lemon juice every night for a couple weeks with no improvement.  </li>
            <li>it does whats its supposed to; burns outer layer of skin to removie old damaged cells.&lt;br /&gt;extremely</li>
            <li>See a professional skin Doc.</li>
            <li>a week I use this peel and wow...</li>
            <li>Just started up the Retin-A again this week, so my skin is a bit sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I was completely sold.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>I figured my skin may be used to Salicylic Acid since I have been using cleaners containing salicyclic acid since my early teens.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also purchased the Glycolic peel which I&#x27;ve only used a few times and Kiss My Face Pore Shrink which I&#x27;ve tried and love.</li>
            <li>I expected some purging but it seemed to bring out 30 years worth of gunk onto my face.</li>
            <li>People with moderate to sever acne need a good product that actually contains probably at least 4-20%.  </li>
            <li>The pimples on my forehead haven&#x27;t completely gone away yet, but they&#x27;re getting better slowly over time.</li>
            <li>(slowly increase the time you leave it on your face, don&#x27;t leave it on the full 8 minutes the first time as you don&#x27;t know how sensitive your skin will be to this</li>
            <li>i tried it and it still burned i think its slowly getting better</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t be shy, go ahead and order this product because you can&#x27;t afford not to be good looking.</li>
            <li>it has had good effects, it has randomly burnt my skin every now and then.</li>
            <li>AND...... it works, slowly but surely.  </li>
            <li>My skin is thick and oily and has tolerated many peels.  </li>
            <li>I dab a little bit from a Qtip right onto an emerging pimple and it disappears so fast.</li>
            <li>One caveat: I have  normal to dry skin, so I found it better to use it twice monthly rather than once a week, as it can be a little drying.</li>
            <li>I was only able to leave it on for probably less than 30 seconds the first time, the second time putting it on, I could only handle a minute</li>
            <li>Both of these products have limited ingredients, and I&#x27;ve found them to be gentle and highly restorative for after the peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve become pretty good at covering my pimples, but Acne products definitely dry my skin out and make it really difficult to use makeup.</li>
            <li>The 20% helped me with the black heads: they fell right off!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars only because I think I might find a better technique to use it in the near future but other than that this product is a 1.</li>
            <li>I still have to use moisturizing lotions and other products each month, but when I use this peel I am only spending about $10 per month for face wash and lotion, and I have found that this size bottle of peel is good for a few months.  </li>

            <li>It was not immediate but my face got a little better after each treatment - Then after the first complete round of treatment (6 weeks)</li>
            <li>This is the only thing i have used that has had a major effect on the large pore festival i used to have on my face.</li>
            <li>I wanted to combat the dry flakey skin first.</li>
            <li>At first, I just used lotion because that was what was recommended, but when I did so my face stayed dry for days (even when I applied it generously).</li>
            <li>Six weeks later, under the care of a dermatoligist specializing in people of color, my skin has mainly returned to the pre-peel state as far as the breakouts are concerned.</li>
            <li>You get acne the first few times you do this---the more toxicity your skin has to purge once the dead layers come off--</li>
            <li>After nearly a month of use, I can say that many small scars have disappeared and the big ones look flatter and softer.</li>
            <li>I was excited as i thought that It would peel the rest of the dead skin from my face.</li>
            <li>I alternate between full face application and spot application to specific areas only, because I&#x27;m not an aesthetician and don&#x27;t want to overdo it.  </li>
            <li>I have oily and sensitive skin with facial acne since high school</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on the same spot more than a few nights in a row otherwise it can dry out the skin too much and cause it to...</li>
            <li>When I discovered this on Amazon and read the other reviews, I decided to give it a try since so many others seemed to have success with their serious acne and skin issues.</li>
            <li>This does NOT mean every 40 year old Skin will have the same reaction!</li>
            <li>Not only did it clear up my acne, but it made my skin feel soft and new.</li>
            <li>(there are still pimples, but there are less), the texture is smoother, and the large pores on my nose have shrunken!!  </li>
            <li>If your skin is extremely dry from all the harsh product use it will naturally make tons more oil and clog the pores.</li>
            <li>Fine lines around my eyes have lessened, as well as furrow lines seem less deep.  </li>
            <li>But be careful to follow direct exactly, so you dont damage your skin.</li>
            <li>I continued to use this peel for a month, once/week, the acne was kept in a stable situation, which was not totally removed, but not serious as before.</li>
            <li>I have 7 larger pimples, 3 small pimples, and many bumps on my face.  </li>
            <li>and I did it about once a week and then steadily upgraded to multiple times a week.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>main issues -- congested skin, big pores.</li>
            <li>overall , a decent product for acne prone skin,</li>
            <li>The first several times I barely last a minute.</li>
            <li>it works particularly well for the whitehead and cystic types (especially the swelling).  </li>
            <li>white (pale)&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: normal / combination&lt;br /&gt;Use: attempted to clear skin of acne &amp; acne scarring</li>
            <li>Those fine wrinkles are gone and the deep wrinkle is much less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first application I only left on for two minutes.</li>
            <li>I first apply to the thicker areas of my face that coincidentally need the extra peeling -- sides of face, jawline -- then I do the T-zone starting with the forehead them</li>
            <li>also found that fanning my face with something heavy-duty, like a plate, takes away the burning sensation and makes it much easier to get through those first few minutes.</li>
            <li>The real improvements this peel provides don&#x27;t show immediately but come after using the product consistently for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it about once or twice a week for the past three weeks now and my scarring has tremendously gone down and my skin feels extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think that it stings other than, maybe, the first minute you put it on, but definitely nothing one can&#x27;t take.</li>
            <li>but if 3 does little or nothing i may have to go for a full 8 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As of right now, using the product only SIX times (once every 5 days) there is not a single zit, red mark, bump, or pimple ANYWHERE on my face! :</li>
            <li>When I had finally removed enough layers of dead skin then an amazing amount of fluid came out.</li>
            <li>I had such high hope for this product.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest you get a cotton swab for this, put over bottle, tip for a second or two</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I think a previous reviewer mentioned being Tyra Banks&#x27; complexion--which is the same skin tone as I am, so I did see some redness on my cheeks, but I&#x27;m 90% sure it was because of the wash cloth I used (it was a bit rough, but I didn&#x27;t have any other clean ones).  </li>
            <li>my acne is starting to clear up as well as fading the newly formed scars on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The way I think of it, when you use this, you speed up the exfoliating/healing process by constantly burning away old skin and bringing in new skin.  </li>
            <li>The way I think of it, when you use this, you speed up the exfoliating/healing process by constantly burning away old skin and bringing in new skin.  </li>
            <li>I know they recommend the BHA as best for acne, but it seems to dry my skin out so badly</li>
            <li>I MAY have some less acne, but I definitely do not see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>No down time here, and no redness like some people mentioned,</li>
            <li>Great for a home facial and taking off some dead dull skin .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple products, either online or in store with such positive reviews, but never worked for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Aftercare is also important, every day I put sunblockand after using the acid I put some oil, usually argan or tamanu.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I only gave it 4 because this really should be a medical grade product to be applied by a professional.</li>
            <li>It did not frost it just felt tighter, and my pores looked remarkably small and smooth.</li>
            <li>For a  long time I was using a product that was 15% from another company that cost twice as much.  </li>
            <li>I do not have to use any other kind of concealer or spot coverage, which I have in the past.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I followed the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li>For 2-3 days afterwards, the skin begin to exfolidate and peel, revealing fresh pink skin underneath, just like the result of the $70 facial professional job.</li>
            <li>I would use this once a week, alternating with this and the gly/lac peel, for about 4 weeks, then the last 2 weeks of my first cycle I would put this one on first, leave it for a couple of minutes, then apply the gly/lac over the salicylic and leave on for another few minutes.</li>
            <li>that where not dark.</li>
            <li>i have seen a dermatoligist and am now using a product to try to reverse the affect and bring my orginal pigmentation back to normal.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve stopped using it, things are getting back to normal.</li>
            <li>The people claiming you put it on and next day your skin looks normal are exaggerating.</li>
            <li>I went back to the review and people said it was normal.</li>
            <li>* encourage washing off this peel with normal BAKING SODA mixed with water.</li>
            <li>This salicylic acid was exactly what I needed to get rid of pesky closed comedones along my chin.  </li>
            <li>Will have to see later down the road if it will cause a significant change or not.</li>
            <li>56, fair skinned, freckled with oily skin, large pores on my nose and at least 5 small hypertrophic sebaceous bumps, left side of my face.  </li>
            <li>(The stinging was a little more than I had expected.)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back on it again to clear out the leftover pink spots and to try to get all the pores open to get the full beard in.    </li>
            <li>Then, I ordered Palmer&#x27;s Skin Lightening cream, it seemed like my skin was getting better at one time but would return to black when I looked in the mirror other times.</li>
            <li>the only thing it didn&#x27;t do for me is to prevent new acne from forming.</li>
            <li>Its work well on new white heads, but does not do anything for cystic pimples.</li>
            <li>no directions with it not very happy about that dont know how to use it , dont know if it would order again but was very fast and exact</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve finally found the secret to amazing skin</li>
            <li>Both times I cleansed my skin with a gentle cleanser, patted my face dry and used an alcohol prep on my face to remove any excess surface oil on the skin.</li>
            <li>I decided not to buy the toner or witch hazel, seemed like a waste of money when it clearly states that you can just use water to neutralize the peel and rubbing alcohol to clean the area prior to the peel.</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old, with oily skin, moderate breakouts, mild acne scarring, forehead wrinkles, and slight jawline sagging.</li>
            <li>While waiting, I clean my dish and make a mixture with baking soda and cold water (does not need to be a paste, just make sure you have enough baking soda).  </li>
            <li>It does dry your face out, but that&#x27;s the whole point.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, I pat dry gently.</li>
            <li>After 2 treatments my old acne scars are even fading, and old blackheads that have been embedded forever suddenly \\&quot;popped\\&quot; out!!</li>
            <li>Take your time and see some videos about the salicylic acid peel you would see its complete normal&lt;br /&gt;After two day as expected I did got breakouts but not that much.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much healthier, which is a blessing for someone who has lived her entire life with multiple skin problems.</li>
            <li>For shoulders though, the skin is much thicker and traditional creams and methods just don&#x27;t penetrate well enough.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne since I was in grade school and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve tried that actually seemed like it really works.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t notice any changes in my back so far, but I&#x27;m hopping for it to clear too.    </li>
            <li>I may have left it on too long too in my zealous first time attempt.  </li>
            <li>the results I&#x27;ve gotten so far are the complete opposite of my goals!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews that state that skin will get worse and may develop acne before it gets better, but I need to ask for a professional opinion.</li>
            <li>I was hesitatant to try something else since nothing ever worked - but for less than $20 it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>I read from a medical journal that you can actually become poisoned from using this too much.</li>
            <li>Be careful if you have sensitive skin because this does sting a bit and will cause your face to peel and flake if you use too much too often.  </li>
            <li>so there is more exposure to the thin and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have received a few messages suggesting that this scarring make actually be rosacea, but a dermatologist ruled that out and confirmed that these types of peels can cause permanent hyper-pigmentation or scarring.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the peel arrived, I decided to wait after my third application to write a review on this peel as I thought it should be more than sufficient time to at least see what it does to my skin.</li>
            <li>Whenever I break out this clears my face up quickly and is not too harsh.</li>
            <li>About two months ago, I purchased Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel( I wanted to start with least strong product).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and you just start off slow.  </li>
            <li>When I was young, I remember getting a dark skin pigmentation that just kept getting bigger on my forehead and two more in other areas of my face.  </li>
            <li>I kept ATLEAST 6-13 pimples every single day for 3months straight using this product&amp; I&#x27;m not exaggerating.</li>
            <li>It said your skin will gradually peel but mines was just tight red dry and itchy and felt like I was clogging my skin even more because it did not eventually peel off.</li>
            <li>My skin is now *extremely* dry, flakey and old, and I&#x27;ve developed acne!!</li>
            <li>the major ones thought)  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many thousands of dollars I&#x27;ve spent on beauty products at your usual beauty store claiming to get rid of adult acne.</li>
            <li>I have only used it 4 times and WOW!</li>
            <li>No regrets!</li>
            <li>I barely needed to wear makeup!</li>
            <li>For the first couple weeks, as other reviewers have said, the acid brings out impurities from under the surface and will result in some breakouts but BE PATIENT.</li>
            <li>Nothing major.  </li>
            <li>The larger pimples have not necessarily stopped, however, when I first feel one under my skin, I dab the peel onto that one specific site and leave it on.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this does exactly what it says it will do, although I don&#x27;t think it does it quite as well as other reviews have said.</li>
            <li>and I assumed it was because I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough and my face is naturally oily so the peel didn&#x27;t affect it too much.</li>
            <li>no other creams, masks, etc... were helping with either of these things&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No other product has worked this well.</li>
            <li>and I felt a major difference.</li>
            <li>My other higher potency glycol acid/lactic acid peels don&#x27;t make me this flakey.</li>
            <li>as other reviewers already noticed i did not have any effect for the first time</li>
            <li>I was hoping to soon see a decrease in dark spots, however I became pregnant and had to discontinue my entire regime.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin apparently and after just 1 application of this my skin dried out tremendously.</li>
            <li>After a recent breakout (of the kind I had not seen since my early teens), I was left with little pimples and some dark blemishes.</li>
            <li>These types of pimples are very hard to treat with benzoyl peroxide and do not respond well to many types of treatments.</li>
            <li>Then I apply a thin layer of peel with a fan brush, moving quickly and evenly across the face, taking special care not to let the brush rest on any part of my face for too long.</li>
            <li>It diminished the size of my pores, completely gained my natural skin tone back, and almost completely got rid of the zits only after 4 weeks of use.    </li>
            <li>I also have had very dark circles under my eyes for many years due to my olive skin complexion.</li>
            <li>Be patient, consistent and very very careful and you will be rewarded.</li>
            <li>I used it steadily for 10 months, maybe every other week, before I realized THIS was the source of my new problem.</li>
            <li>and I am doing a few more touch up peels to target a few new blemishes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and have had occasional blemishes in the chin area since my early 20&#x27;s, usually hormonal and very rarely maybe a big cystic one.</li>
            <li>I have also had large pores for a long time especially on my nose and chin...</li>
            <li>It stung a little but was totally bearable and not bad at all.</li>
            <li>The day after peel I am a little red (not bad at all).  </li>
            <li>(stay away from benzoyl peroxide while using peels).&lt;br /&gt;Apply salicylic acid/Lactic acid peel with fan brush (I use only a droplet from pouring).&lt;br /&gt;While waiting, I clean my dish and make a mixture with baking soda and cold water (does not need to be a paste, just make sure you have enough baking</li>
            <li>Do be sure to rinse with cold water for a minute and then use a baking soda/water paste to VERY GENTLY wash your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, especially to people who have a lot of white heads.</li>
            <li>Other times, I use Aveeno Positively Radiant since it has SPF.</li>
            <li>I continue to use this product with the hopes that i will be blemish free or at least close to it.</li>
            <li>I believe my problem is probably internal but this peel helped clear me up some regardless.  </li>
            <li>I started using this in the midst of a breakout and it has definitely helped clear me up.</li>
            <li>My old scars are still dark and very visible.</li>
            <li>I even persisted with the cleansing hoping it would clear up but no such luck.</li>
            <li>Try it out and see your skin condition clear up and improve overall.</li>
            <li>It is also the ONLY thing that will clear up my face with record</li>
            <li>i posted an unretouched pic from my last shoot to show how clear my skin was.</li>
            <li>I may try it again whenever I visit friends &amp; family in humid areas just to see if it&#x27;ll work later, or just to maintain my skin when it&#x27;s finally clear.</li>
            <li>This helps clear my pores, takes off access makeup which my facial wash miss out, it has helped decrease my pores and has helped tighten and smooths the texture of my skin.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have noticed over the years my skin was looking old, with open pores and crows feet.</li>
            <li>I use bare minerals.</li>
            <li>and my skin was so soft and my healing acne scars were turning white.</li>
            <li>Scars did not really change much.</li>
            <li>It turned one of my already dark spots darker, I really hope this is not permanent!</li>
            <li>and I have barely had any breakouts at all, maybe one pimple every five days.</li>
            <li>I am 35 year old Hispanic female.</li>
            <li>My face was red but it completely stopped hurting.</li>
            <li>As soon as I&#x27;m done using it, my skin it much softer and there is usually minimal visible peeling.  </li>
            <li>I only wish that there were a natural alternative that produced these results.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks my skin got scaly so 1 day I steamed some water and let my face just sit near the steam &amp; suddenly</li>
            <li>and I barely get pimples.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from meds,prescribed topical solutions, 100s of face washes, homopathic natural approach etc etc.</li>
            <li>Alot of \\&quot;frosting\\&quot; occured on the sensitive parts of my face such as cheek bones just under the eyes, my nose and around my mouth.</li>
            <li>i couldnt bare to look at myself in the mirror</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t bare the burning</li>
            <li>I am African American with very oil skin and hyperpigmentation left from using Proactive serveral years ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid $250.00 for a professional peel &amp; have seen the same results.</li>
            <li>The first time I left it for 15 minutes, the second and third times I left it on for about 30.</li>
            <li>-- it just barely stings -- but</li>
            <li>It was much milder than I expected during and after application.</li>
            <li>: I am now 53 years old, and have been using this product as a weekly peel and daily spot treatment for about 2 years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>next time i will have a professional do it</li>
            <li>I have done a couple of peels so far, but my only issue is the scarring that this stuff has done.</li>
            <li>I suffered from adult acne for the last 8 years.</li>
            <li>I am 24 years old and still have acne problems especially around menstruation.</li>
            <li>Much to my relief, the product did not burn like I expected it to.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY product so far that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>and it can burn your skin if you are not careful or do not do your research before you use this product.</li>
            <li>I am a 21 year old female (using my boyfriends&#x27;s Amazon account, of course) with stress-induced acne and plugged pores on the nose and chin, as well as unevenness under nostrils and acne scarring on either side of my chin.</li>
            <li>and I barely need any foundation coverage at all.</li>
            <li>I have only used this one and the Glycolic acid peel thus far but let me tell you,</li>
            <li>/&gt;- 30 year old female with tan skin</li>
            <li>&amp; I used this product 3-4x/week starting the 3rd week &amp; used it regularly for almost 6 weeks &amp; didn&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
            <li>I have only done one treatment and so far I have had fewer  breakouts.</li>
            <li>If you are used to getting regular peels by a professional, you will like the results of this product.</li>
            <li>Stats about me:&lt;br /&gt;19 year old Caucasian female.&lt;br /&gt;Struggled with severe acne during puberty and moderate acne</li>
            <li>I also think the constant cell turn over and stripping started to cause sebaceous hyperplasia because the skin could not get enough moisture to the surface fast enough.  </li>
            <li>Not quite gone, but barely noticeable anymore.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 17 year old male</li>
            <li>But I will keep it as a professional product as part if my back bar..</li>
            <li>First application, I had it on for 8 minutes with minimal to moderate stinging and redness.</li>
            <li>But by the next day my skin was back to normal.  </li>
            <li>When I woke up in the morning, many of the blackheads had decreased in size or disappeared.  </li>
            <li>Most treatments helped the acne, but made my eczema worse.</li>
            <li>It slowly absorbs into the skin no need to rub too much (is FANTASTIC for oily skin)</li>
            <li>few times my eyes have watered from the burning (obvioulsy I don&#x27;t apply to my eyes), but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Start small, rinse off well with lots of cool water, and moisturize immediately.  </li>
            <li>Even using good lotion I still peel like crazy.</li>
            <li>far as results, this stuff practically eliminates my pores for the first few days</li>
            <li>I have large pores on my cheeks, black heads, old pigmentation scars.</li>
            <li>Based on my experience ~ (I have combination skin, typically oily throughout the day with drier patches in certain areas of thinner skin, frequent breakouts, some acne</li>
            <li>I noticed right away that my skin felt a little tighter.</li>
            <li>Recently, some of the cysts, if left alone, would kind of dry out but leave hard bumps underneath.</li>
            <li>The first week, the redness in my face went down and my bumps lessened.</li>
            <li>and i mean RARELY breakout nowadays and that her skin is so clean and less oily than mine</li>
            <li>Also, start where skin is the thickest or less sensitive, I made the mistake of starting in my nose and the liquid pooled on the side of my nsoe and really hurt!</li>
            <li>because i need something that i could use as daily maintenance or use several times a week to reduce oil and prevent new acne from forming but where there is no downtime as i need to work.</li>
            <li>Several days later, you start to see new, softer skin appear.</li>
            <li>but the white heads dried up really quick.</li>
            <li>and then I washed it off, and used the neutralizer (VERY IMPORTANT STEP), after I dried my face, I dabbed on a little Tree Tea Oil.</li>
            <li>Even using Finacea twice a day I&#x27;d have flare ups occasionally, was very surprised that it stopped entirely with this peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Immediately after the first treatment my face got brighter and my pores had gotten less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll feel tingles and slight burning, so read the directions first.  </li>
            <li>It just feels hot and slightly stings.</li>
            <li>I have used other peels in the past with better results.</li>
            <li>Also i had small stinging in certain spots nothing that I really noticed because that skin is way different from my face</li>
            <li>I am a 25 year old female, and throughout the last 3 years I have had major on and off problems with acne.</li>
            <li>This product has shown positive signs clearing the dark spots on my face too.</li>
            <li>My chest is still not perfect by it certainly has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>and i can say that it really works for large pores (at least their appearance,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried other brands of acne gel with benzoyl peroxide, but they didn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>I have been prescribed hormonal birth control to deal with it, Retin - A, have used 10% benzyol peroxide cream, and EVERY other product out there (Acne Free, among all the other big brands, some of which provided some temporary relief).</li>
            <li>(that is a whole other topic)...</li>
            <li>I also recommend stopping the usage of other intense skin care regimens (retinol, Retin A, microderms, laser, etc.)</li>
            <li>But then again, other products haven&#x27;t really worked either, so I think it may be a hormonal issue</li>
            <li>but I may not have used it long enough to effect much of a change (only about once a week for three weeks.)</li>
            <li>First you should know that I have been struggling with acne since I was 12 and have been on everything you can think of and have spent countless dollars on solutions, concoctions, pills that ultimately did not work.</li>
            <li>After several uses, I did start to peel and my face was dry in certain parts (especially my chin, around my nose, and at my temples).</li>
            <li>This product does what it says but be very careful and be very cautious with the amount you use.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything until a few days later when dry areas started peeling---blackhead and huge pores on sebum clogged nostril</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only been applying it to the pimple areas and not my entire face since its already clear...</li>
            <li>It stings like crazy, but is mild enough that I don&#x27;t need any downtime, which is important for me as I need to show up for work every day.  </li>
            <li>This morning the area wasn&#x27;t in the least bit red or dry, so I decided it was okay to use on my face.</li>
            <li>I use it without moisturizers because my skin is pretty oily so after a few hours my skin becomes normal and dry but then gets oily again.</li>
            <li>I was afraid I was getting some kind of adult onset acne or cysts.</li>
            <li>I had set the timer for 4 minutes because I figured I&#x27;ve done a few professional peels which was much stronger than 20%, I could tolerate it</li>
            <li>For some background, I am a 25 year old Asian female with combo-oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I eventually started covering bigger areas for 3-5 minutes, and my breakouts are almost completely gone now only after 2 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know I will be going out to some social event or any prolonged outdoor activity</li>
            <li>If I know I will be going out to some social event or any prolonged outdoor activity, I take a break from the peels until after the activity(ies).</li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, I am a 28 year old Asian female.</li>
            <li>35yr old white female.</li>
            <li>My mild to moderate acne began clearing up within days and the treatment seemed to last a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I actually find putting my face in front of a fan more irritating than without.</li>
            <li>On a side note my acne actually got worse on my forehead before it got better.</li>
            <li>My derm also said there&#x27;s no such thing as things getting worse before they get better.....</li>
            <li>5% and more is very serious to your skin..  </li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s better to beat the dead horse than assume it is dead)</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s better to beat the dead horse than assume it is dead)</li>
            <li>The results definitely make the stinging for a few minutes worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 4 weeks now (applying it once a week ), and haven&#x27;t had a single new breakout.</li>
            <li>It is less noticeable when I haven&#x27;t been in the sun for a very long time (winter time), but even with high SPF it still appears MUCH DARKER as soon as the sun hits my face and doesn&#x27;t go away at all during summer months.</li>
            <li>salicylic acid is generally not that strong in terms of peeling so get a higher % if your skin isn&#x27;t crazy sensitive</li>
            <li>forehead started to get little frosted bumps that turned into pimples the first time---</li>
            <li>It does sting a little when first applied.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Skin type: 20-something, very oily, acne-prone, sensitive, semi-pigmented, pale</li>
            <li>if you catch it early on and apply this to it the next two days after it will simply flake off instead of having to be popped (which nobody wants to do-gross, and which also causes dark spots, also unsightly).</li>
            <li>I have done 2 peels so far and have seen a large reduction in the red scars, and the deep pock marks have a less cavernous appearance.</li>
            <li>but they leave red scar for a long time while the new ones keep popping out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a product nowadays that receives such high reviews, especially when the product is inexpensive and deals with a sensitive issue (appearance).&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews here on Amazon and researching Salicyclic Acid 20% on the internet, the believeable consensus is that this peel works very well.</li>
            <li>The first time i left it on for 5 mins with slight burning on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>(I left the peel on for less than a minute for my first use).</li>
            <li>The first time I could only leave it on about a minute and a half, and now I&#x27;m about to five minutes.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product because after the dry skin went back to normal</li>
            <li>It will also make your face blotchy and uneven, if you do too long too quickly.  </li>
            <li>Your face may be a bit red (like a sunburn) but it doesn&#x27;t last long, I HIGHLY suggest doing this at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Alba Deep Sea Facial Mask left on for 5-30 minutes (it doesn&#x27;t really dry out and is VERY moisturizing mud</li>
            <li>20% strength is powerful enough to notice an overall change in my skin clarity and texture in about 2 weeks, but gentle enough that I didn&#x27;t experience excessive discomfort during application or dry skin patches after.</li>
            <li>dark patches are now much lighter, pimples still there but smaller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion</li>
            <li>Although it takes time this product really worked and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to rid their face of acne or other irritations.</li>
            <li>leave it on my face for 5-6 minutes and don&#x27;t feel much of a burning sensation, but my skin has probably become resilient from the numerous other products I&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products out there including biocutis, which doesn&#x27;t do anything, and Proactiv Solution, which actually works but it leaves my skin very oily/greasy.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really change my skin other than to make white blotches</li>
            <li>My face looked the exact same (still acne present and dark spots galore)</li>
            <li>I would not recommend for people who are young or minor pimples.</li>
            <li>I havent had it for long, although I&#x27;m already highly sensitive to almost everything.</li>
            <li>First week: I applied twice that week giving a few days in between applications.</li>
            <li>the first few times I used it.  </li>
            <li>for at least one week before and after the full peel process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I decided to try this salicylic acid gel peel because although I mostly have scarring from old pimples all over my forehead, I also have occasional breakouts of two or three in random places on my face.</li>
            <li>For the first few times it burns alot.</li>
            <li>Lotion, firming masks, rubbery peel masks, hot showers followed by rubbing the dead skin on your face, immediately followed by lotion.</li>
            <li>first few times I used this peel</li>
            <li>The first week I used this product once a day everyday for about a minute, yes it does burn</li>
            <li>and I so I looked around for something a little easier on the pocketbook and still natural oil with high reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>no new pimples developed (Its been a week I only have old deep ones left).</li>
            <li>My super large, clogged pores appear smaller with less gunk and the small pimples I had last night are now gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had consistent little white plugs I could see burrowing under the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li>(On the up side, if you had a HUGE pimple you needed to take care of stat you could dab this stuff on it as a spot treatment and seriously overnight it sucks it dry, a HUGE upside to this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used salicylic acid in my other products, but I needed something stronger for my cluster and quarter sized dark spot of blackheads on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning to those with sensitive skin and are prone to infectious outbreaks, those of you know what I am talking about, well, this product warns that it may cause an outbreak and in my first use, it did.</li>
            <li>The first time I looked in the mirror after a treatment I was literally shocked because my pores were so smooth they were practically invisible!</li>
            <li>so I have dry spots and oily spots and frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li>Let face completely air dry and then apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li>After I use it, any blemishes that I have heal much quicker and leave less scarring.  </li>
            <li>But, ever since i used this peel my skin is half as oily and my skin doesn&#x27;t break out as much.</li>
            <li>I have acne and dark marks, olive complexion, and real oily skin especially in the summer months.</li>
            <li>The first 3 times I used this product, I was in total shock because it took off dead skin that was still just sitting there in the crevices of my nose.    </li>
            <li>First bottle is almost done and lasted a few months; WILL order a second soon.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and it has been impossible for me to find a good product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an Asian-Indian in my late 20s with tan/oily skin and mild acne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this seems like a decent product if you have active, inflammatory acne</li>
            <li>My boyfriend&#x27;s very imflamed pimples die down after the very next day of usage.</li>
            <li>To try to help this, I&#x27;ve began to monitor my diet (limited fried foods, dairy, citrus, fats) and increase my amount of water intake in hopes that my skin will notice and clear up.</li>
            <li>I have very large pores on my nose and chin and damage from past and ongoing cystic pimples in those areas.  </li>
            <li>Because I didn&#x27;t know how my skin would react, I left the Peel on for only 2 minutes (this is plenty for the first few times).     </li>
            <li>The first few times I only left it on for maybe 2 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li>face with gentle face wash or african black</li>
            <li>Cleanse face with gentle face wash or african black soap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product 4 times in the last week and a half for the whole 8 mins.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After doing the layering 2 times, I finally peeled and was very careful to wear high sun block, hat, sunglasses and no rides in convertibles or sun-roofed vehicles.  </li>
            <li>Ill keep you guys updated with what happens in the next 2 months or whatever because its only been 1 month, and full results may take much longer.</li>
            <li>Also, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel super tight or dry after I use it as long as I apply a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I am not sure that this formulation is right for my African American skin.</li>
            <li>After researching some at home alternatives for peels, and less expensive options, I decided to try this since it seems more gentle.</li>
            <li>The back of my neck, just below the hair, I had signs of aging (wrinkles, big ones) and the whole area was BLACK.</li>
            <li>Used it on a large blemish I had and literally was gone within a few days.</li>
            <li>but they are mostly small and dry up quickly.  </li>
            <li>I never had much acne growing up, but it would seem that each little pimple left a mark on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little sensitive on my cheecks and definitely near my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave this product 4/5 stars, simply because I feel that the burning sensation when it is on my face is a little too much.</li>
            <li>I learned that the hard way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really worth trying.  </li>
            <li>It died down a lot now that I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s but my main problem is every pore on my face is big and clogged.</li>
            <li>The first time I used a cotton ball and it was very little burning</li>
            <li>I tried Neutrogena Skin ID and used it exactly as directed for about a month or so with very little to no results.  </li>
            <li>My brother had really bad acne,  like his whole face was covered with huge zits, after using this once a week for a month, his acne has cleared up completely.  </li>
            <li>I guess you have to take the good with the bad here.</li>
            <li>But I feel like if it&#x27;s hurting so badly, it&#x27;s gotta be doing something good to the skin</li>
            <li>I am patient because I used to have acne on the face and it took a few years for that to clear up completely scars and all.  </li>
            <li>I have so far used it every few days just for spot treatment and my skin has been clear.</li>

            <li> But either way, I&#x27;m very happy with how well my skin is looking these days.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s best to use a cleanser with out moisturizer or anything that will leave a residue on your face, it affects the efficacy of the peel).  </li>

            <li> Best thing I ever bought for acne.</li>
            <li> This is the best balance for me, as well as the glycolic acid they make.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found on amazon.com.</li>

            <li> great product!</li>
            <li> Great!!!</li>
            <li> :D</li>
            <li> Then I decided to see what was the best reviewed acne treatment on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed: scars were there still.    </li>
            <li> GOOD LUCK!!!!</li>
            <li> you serivce excellent</li>
            <li> I tried Glycolic acid for months and wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> I used it as directed and am so impressed.</li>
            <li> which is probably the best I can say about this.</li>
            <li> The peeling is perfect.</li>

            <li> I am extremely impressed.</li>
            <li> This gel peel was perfect.</li>
            <li> Salicylic Acid is working great at minimizing the blackheads!  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent treatment for clearing up blemish-prone skin and maintaining a clearer complexion.</li>
            <li> Probably not for everyone, but it worked for me and I&#x27;m very happy.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased the skin PH balancer which feels awesome after rinsing off the peel.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had the best skin; it&#x27;s always been oily and I suffer from blackheads and large-ish pores.  </li>
            <li> and I have seen wonderful results.</li>

            <li> and my skin has been beautiful since and has not returned to its prepeel state even after I stopped the peels.</li>
            <li> I see this beautiful skin appearing.</li>
            <li> my face has become beautiful again.</li>
            <li> The consistancy is good and the strenght is perfect.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> Now almost all of my acne is gone, I just need to get rid of the scars, which this is also doing a great job of.</li>
            <li> this works great, just what i wanted.</li>
            <li> which was great.</li>
            <li> My neighbor commented on how great my face looked on day 3.</li>
            <li> but i decided to brave it anyway.</li>
            <li> This doctor gives great tips on skin.    </li>
            <li> But THEN, I read great reviews for this product, so I decided to try it out.     </li>
            <li> Oh and great shipping</li>
            <li> Great Product.</li>
            <li> Still happy.</li>
            <li> I was not taking any chances LOL</li>
            <li> That alone is a great reason to get this.</li>
            <li> It was working great</li>
            <li> I am using Cetaphil and it works great.</li>
            <li> it would be great where i could use a product that would reduce the oil</li>
            <li> I used it on my clients and myself and have seen great results.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I thought my face was in hell, lol.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great industry to make money I bet.</li>
            <li> The acne on both cheeks has improved greatly, however, my forehead hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li> I have been seeing great results.</li>
            <li> I have also started to use this on my chest and it has been working great there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for selling this Its a great product.</li>
            <li> Greatly helped my acne prone skin when nothing else worked for years.</li>
            <li> Another great thing about this product is that it evens out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> That 20 minutes burned lol</li>
            <li> and I see a great difference already.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m so happy.</li>
            <li> But this one has been great.  </li>
            <li> This was a great discovery for me.  </li>
            <li> Buy it you will be happy.</li>
            <li> but I have to say this is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great peel.  </li>
            <li> I know it will take quite awhile for my skin to look as great as I want it too</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> Product works great, noticeable immediate improvement, though not drastic.</li>
            <li> As others have said, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> (but both are great).</li>
            <li> I have been using for a week now, and I have never found a product that works as great.</li>
            <li> For the price and quality, it was great.</li>
            <li> (I have experienced the burning in the Doctors office).</li>
            <li> I am so proud of my face texture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> For the value, it&#x27;s great and it works as stated.</li>
            <li> This works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seeing a specialist is the best thing to do, so do this regimen at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I feel hopeful and happy because this product works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cost certainly is a great value.</li>
            <li> for my results, again, they have been great.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great buy.ty</li>

            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great.</li>
            <li> and I think it works great.  </li>
            <li> its also great to put on a pimple that you see coming on.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great.  </li>
            <li> This was a great deal.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product.</li>
            <li> works great on acne, well, helps anyway.</li>
            <li> Those worked great in clearing up my congested skin</li>
            <li> This one is great.</li>
            <li> A great peel that doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;overdo\\&quot; it.</li>
            <li> The great thing about this product is its potency, but that also means it will sting like the dickens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> which is great.</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I bought this.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> This product will do a great job</li>
            <li> I use salicylic or glycolic in my face lotion sometimes and those work great</li>
            <li> but you have to do something to distract you while its on lol.  </li>
            <li> Even if it doesn&#x27;t, its still a great product for people prone to get blemishes.  </li>
            <li> Even if it doesn&#x27;t, its still a great product for people prone to get blemishes.  </li>
            <li> dancing, LOL, or folding laundry, or play cnady</li>
            <li> Use this for acne every once in a while for spot treatment leaving it on for about 30 seconds, but the reason this is a great product is it cured my planters wart.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> great stuff.</li>
            <li> works great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely incredible, and my acne problems were fairly severe.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for the scars the acne leaves since I heard it works great for this purpose.</li>
            <li> works great to reducing pimple overnight</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been fighting the great fight against acne for years now.  </li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews I see from freaked out people have a great deal to do with them not understanding how chemical peelswork.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff for helping with blemishes and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this stuff!!</li>
            <li> It is important to know how your skin will react to a peel!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and very effective.</li>
            <li> Very effective product</li>
            <li> It was still very effective.</li>
            <li> Were very nice and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> amazing!</li>
            <li> but I found an amazing fix and my skin looks!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, its still an amazing product!</li>
            <li> It was amazing!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I have used the peel twice and my skin is amazing!  </li>
            <li> It was amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff, as I said burns and tingles, but when the procedure is done - my skin feels amazing!</li>
            <li> This amazing!</li>
            <li> and then up it to once a day for a week and saw amazing results!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> It was amazing!</li>
            <li> I am sure with repeated use (it says 6 treatments for best results)</li>
            <li> (ps don&#x27;t buy that it&#x27;s OTC products you can buy at the store, just do the evaluation and it&#x27;ll tell you what to buy :P)</li>
            <li> I used neutrogena healthy skin moisturizer and my skin felt great!</li>
            <li> its been about three weeks now since ive started using this product and the results are remarkable.</li>
            <li> great shipping time and good tracking.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product, shipping time and price!!! :)</li>
            <li> impressed me the most was after my brother used it.</li>
            <li> I have so many great things to say about this product!</li>
            <li> My skin tone is nice and even too!  </li>
            <li> My suggestion is if you use this product stay indoors for some days , because your face will not look pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SOOOOO EXCITED!!!    </li>
            <li> Im 30 with fair skin</li>
            <li> I thought i&#x27;d give this a go as i&#x27;ve heard good reviews about it.</li>
            <li> I had a salicylic peel at my dermatologist&#x27;s office and loved the results.</li>
            <li> after 3 days I look like I did 3-5 years ago (wrinkle wise)</li>
            <li> I think in combination with good face products, anyone will probably see some good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never reviewed anything on Amazon before, but this stuff was just too good not to say something about it.</li>
            <li> But it does feel really good when its placed on your skin.</li>
            <li> and you will be good to go.</li>
            <li> but I think this will be a good start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but once you get  use to it you&#x27;re all good.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a good sign.</li>
            <li> It has done a good job of reducing the appearance of my acne scars, and has helped increase skin cell turnover.</li>
            <li> This is also good in spot treatment, I should add.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never take the time to write reviews but this peel worked so good</li>
            <li> Beyond the blackheads that plague my t-zone, my skin is in good shape.     </li>
            <li> This product works really good</li>
            <li> I loved the results.</li>
            <li> Use this product wisely.</li>
            <li> It feels good after having the sting on your face.</li>
            <li> and yet again it was a good choice!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Diaper rash creams contain Zinc - which is really good for skin health.</li>
            <li> :This is a wonderful product but like everything else in life, it&#x27;s not idiot proof.</li>
            <li> it does a good job.</li>
            <li> But this one wasn&#x27;t so good.</li>
            <li> I am not trained so this was a good starter.</li>
            <li> Works good, good service</li>
            <li> Good for oily skin and acne, but \\&quot;always\\&quot; read and follow directions.</li>
            <li> Invest  in a good moisturizer like emu oil to put on after.</li>
            <li> Good choice for immediate results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked so good.</li>
            <li> I feel it was good investment</li>
            <li> and I have a feeling I will see good results.</li>
            <li> Good Luck.</li>
            <li> I have had good results with the use of this peel.</li>
            <li> good stuff</li>
            <li> I figured this peel was a good place to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did me good</li>
            <li> it burned a surprising amount.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I read some really good reviews on this product and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I spend a good two minutes letting it work its way all over my face.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for people that want to reduce the spots and light wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I saw the good reviews and wanted to remove the acnes and acne marks by purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> Good luck to all using this product.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of good reviews on this</li>
            <li> Water is a good neutralizer, so I just rinse in the shower,</li>
            <li> Use a good moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**For those who have good results with &#x27;frosting&#x27;</li>
            <li> Idk… I figure flakey is good, even though i prefer non flakey?</li>
            <li> good purchase</li>
            <li> I do recommend using a good moisturizer and even supplementing it with a good serum with lots of cell communicating ingredients and antioxidants.  </li>
            <li> which is totally a good sign thus explains the word PEEL on this product.</li>
            <li> NO MATTER HOW GOOD OF A CONDITION YOUR SKIN IS IN</li>
            <li> Good product, works as described.  </li>
            <li> I think that for me BHA is superior to AHA for my skin-type</li>
            <li> good stuff.</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to it, so it wasn&#x27;t the best fit for me</li>
            <li> My face is always even and beautiful now, this is definately my favorite of the peels skin laboratory puts out.</li>
            <li> I feel beautiful :-)))</li>
            <li> /&gt;It didn&#x27;t perform miracles but the results were good, and I was very pleased with this product; I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product, I just haven&#x27;t had good results.</li>
            <li> The shipping and service is quick, the product is excellent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a wonderful product and a wonderful way for getting medical office results at home for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> Am very very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> [ I decided to buy this peel in combination with the glyco/lac peel because so many people I know rave about how great the peels are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of skincare products from just about every brand out there: Fresh, Philosophy, Murad, Proactiv, Ole Henriksen, DDF (which is awesome but not for this), Skoah, Dermalogica, Skyn Iceland, etc etc.  </li>
            <li> and i experienced no problems at all, just be sure to follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> I am VERY SATISFIED with my results and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I love this peel and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Additionally, make sure you have a great non-irritating serum and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product and it is a great value.  </li>
            <li> Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad that I took that fateful chance.</li>
            <li> I plan to use it more often, but things are going great.</li>
            <li> is a wish list with lots of skincare goodies that I love where you can find some GREAT stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a great moisturizer to put on after the application, you&#x27;ll need it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no irritation, beautiful results.</li>
            <li> For $20 this is a great deal,  now I am excited about trying the glycolic peel too!  </li>
            <li> but I reapplied the peel on day 3 for another 2 minutes and the results were even better!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Use an spf most definitley!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> This makes me Love Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love what you see in the mirror!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend more!</li>
            <li> I use it quite often, much more often than it is recommended - 3-4 times a week!</li>
            <li> You rub the gel on your face with a cotton ball and let it work its magic!</li>
            <li> I love this peel!</li>
            <li> Sellers, list this poison because many of us are avoiding it!</li>
            <li> I will keep using this product for sure!    </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> If anything, it already looks better!</li>
            <li> Perfect and exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> and it worked even better!</li>
            <li> Just keep expectations reachable.&lt;br /&gt;;) best of luck and keep smiling</li>
            <li> Beats having to make an appointment, drive and pay a lot more for someone else to do it!</li>
            <li> Before using this, I wasn&#x27;t able to leave the house without caking on layers of foundation and now I honestly have no problem going out without any at all!.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I use it often and many of their products!</li>
            <li> aside, the peel works wonderfully and does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> But the flakes are very kind and easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> get that this product is good for acne scars and pimple prevention, but I was also hoping it was good for fine line</li>
            <li> Very good, powerful product.</li>
            <li> Great product and very fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>

            <li> but when I read the amazing reviews this product had on Amazon</li>
            <li> This peel is really amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It was amazing</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li> It can be purchased real cheap on the web.</li>
            <li> This works amazingly well for that use.</li>
            <li> amazing product,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how all these people talk about the amazing results.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll be honest</li>
            <li> sure you use a good moisturiser</li>
            <li> So, if that&#x27;s what you want which I think anyone who does not have too much \\&quot;skin\\&quot; issues might, this is the perfect product.</li>
            <li> I am trying to relieve some of my acne scars and this one is nice.</li>
            <li> Assuming Origins was really effective, I have nothing to blame but the peel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I started the peel I used a cotton pad and rubbed rubbing alcohol all over my face, which ouch, kind of stung.</li>
            <li> Build up to a time that would be effective for you, and it will give results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li> I will also recommend applying this product on to some kind of cotton pad to use as an applicator to facilitate the application process.     </li>
            <li> I will recommend some kind of moisturizer to alleviate the drying of the skin.  </li>
            <li> thanks to skin laboratory for this awesome product!!!</li>
            <li> You have to assess your own skin sensitivity to see what you can/can&#x27;t handle</li>
            <li> I decided why not take something good and make it better?</li>
            <li> Loved it then, love it now.</li>
            <li> It is an extremely effective spot treatment and weekly peel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Salicylic acid is self-neutralizing and thus neutralizing it with a baking soda and water solution will do more harm than good.</li>
            <li> I tried every kind of cleanser you can name...</li>
            <li> Lathering on tons of moisturizer afterwards is the most rewarding part, your face feels incredibly baby-soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> This is an effective product.</li>
            <li> When applying, it feels warm immediately.</li>
            <li> For me, it tingled about 30 seconds in, and then by a minute it was a warm stinging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months and find it to be ok on melasma and sun spots, but surprisingly good on my rosacea.  </li>
            <li> I recomend this product to anyone that has struggled with acne and is ready to give up, try this and see how wonderful you face can look.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been working with Chemical Peels for years and we have really liked how this product works.  </li>
            <li> , it was so nice</li>
            <li> and I honestly see no difference.</li>
            <li> I guess you ahve to make sure you have a good ventilation when applying this.</li>
            <li> For all of you who have scars of your own or who know someone who can&#x27;t get their&#x27;s to go away, recommend this product PLEASE.</li>
            <li> Im not too thrilled about</li>
            <li> i used this kind before.</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re the kind who could not tolerate pain than i suggest to stay away from this peel), after the 1 minute is up</li>
            <li> /&gt;Followed by THAYER&#x27;S Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner which i bought here on Amazon</li>
            <li> APPLYING THAYER&#x27;S Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this stuff.</li>
            <li> Besides that, this is a great product, and its really made my face look much better!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also going to use a bit over the rest of my face because it DOES smooth out the flesh very nicely.     </li>
            <li> This product works the best of anything I have ever tried to keep my skin clean and smooth with no breakouts.</li>
            <li> I am so excited and happy with this product...</li>
            <li> The balancer is worth the [...] bucks!!!</li>
            <li> It takes time - but it will be worth it!!!</li>
            <li> My skin will never be perfect but it is now 100x better than it used to be, all thanks to this product!</li>
            <li> The packaging is ideal and the bottle is dark, which is excellent for the preservation of the potency of the contents.</li>
            <li> The blackheads are most bothersome because they&#x27;re exceptionally noticeable on my nose and chin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I had a face full of acne, I just have never been happy with the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have received salicylic peels 20% from the dermatologist office with great results - full peel within 7 days and no additional acne.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t gotten any more large pimples since I started this peel which is awesome.</li>
            <li> It is amazing and the price is even more amazing.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fairly used to strong products, but regardless my skin dries up and looks flaky, no matter what.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already super happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It is a very strong gel peel.</li>
            <li> it is very strong</li>
            <li> so acne comes very easily.</li>
            <li> Very happy with it so far!</li>
            <li> This one is good for every 10-15 days treatment but b/c of my age, I&#x27;ll need something stronger for the fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> For me, the best product to clear acne and soothe my skin is still Queen Helene&#x27;s Mint Julep Mask:</li>
            <li> Neutralizer skin pH balancer helps balance the pH of your skin for the safe and effective neutralization after peeling.]]</li>
            <li> In my attempts to find suitable cleansers, from mud bars to sea salts and everything in between, I came across the salicylic acid peel.    </li>
            <li> will the  hope that I will  achieve more effective results.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin around my mouth flaky for a couple of days but using a good noncomedogenic, fragrance free lotion afterwards helps.</li>
            <li> Do some of your own research and try to find some competitive products that work better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good for reducing the size of huge acne.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found it most effective to use it twice a month &amp; leave it on for 30 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> By far, it is the  best peel I have ever encountered.</li>
            <li> It worked and I liked it, but after using 4 tubes I was looking for something more</li>
            <li> Apart from that, it is a good peel to start off with and advantage is even people with no experience like myself could get started and comfortable with it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a way to get rid of premenstrual zits, What i&#x27;ve found to be more effective is to ice the zit immediately when you start to feel it forming under the surface.</li>
            <li> Wow am I happy that I bought this!  </li>
            <li> So far its the best thing i&#x27;ve tried for acne,</li>
            <li> I think that is the safest and most effective way to use this product.</li>
            <li> B002NBJAWI Physicians Formula Tinted Moisturizer SPF-15, Fair to Light 1122 1 fl oz (30 ml)]] and a translucent face powder</li>
            <li> I cant even imagine what it will do for me after the recommended 6 treatments for full results!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about salicylic acid, but I don&#x27;t know if it just isn&#x27;t right for my skin</li>
            <li> arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li> My sensitive areas peeled quite a bit and underneath revealed very smooth, perfect lookin skin.</li>
            <li> (forgot the term te dermatologist gave) for years and have been trying to get it off my chest for YEARS and this stuff makes it fade every day and so far it has done more in a week than I have in those years!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good!!! :-)</li>
            <li> I used this product for 4 weeks, once every 5 days and the only outcome was incredibly dry/old looking skin even if I used a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> And I have never been able to use a moisturizer without breaking out-so it is nice to be able to use one now.  </li>
            <li> I applied this to my nose where my freckles are the most abundant and the most visible.</li>
            <li> This product is great for beginners, the tingle was still very intense -</li>
            <li> Better yet, buy form a reputable company that can give good and accurate instructions.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying the first time I tried it, I didn&#x27;t apply it \\&quot;right\\&quot; (LOL).</li>
            <li> Happy I tried this first instead of spending the money on a chemical peel at a doctors office.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true my skin starts to tingle when I apply the salicylic peel, but it&#x27;s good because I know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I found this online and ordered it because of the reviews, though I must admit some sounded too good to be true.</li>
            <li> My skin is very smooth now and the hyperpigmentation is almost gone.  </li>
            <li> I have had some very light peeling and i feel like my skin has improved after a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li> A good, Cetaphil-like lotion quickly took care of that.    </li>
            <li> Best price I found, super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I also used it for fine lines works nicely with the glycolic acid would recommend using the both a day apart or so.</li>
            <li> Which is fine, please don&#x27;t have the warrior mentality about this stuff because I honestly believe that you get better results by gradually easing into it.</li>
            <li> but I am 25 years old, very fair skin, also mild-moderate acne.</li>
            <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin, so I was a bit worried about redness, and peeling.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair and sensitive skin and seem to have hormonal acne that started in my 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to use since my skin is very fair and sensitive.</li>
            <li> I very highly recommend using her steps for the use of this product, as it will greatly help with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have noticed an improvement I have a healthy glow to my skin</li>
            <li> sure it burns with application and gets some getting used to</li>
            <li> I have tried the peel and I must say I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> just more tingling</li>
            <li> Make sure to purchase the neutralizer with this though, it does tend to burn.</li>
            <li> Sure I got hyperpigmentation</li>
            <li> I would sincerely recommend everyone to steer of this product.</li>
            <li> skin is so baby smooth!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Plus, my skin looks baby smooth!</li>
            <li> If you need more education, research on youtube for a channel called \\&quot;DermTV\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I just be sure to moisturize after using...as the directions state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I thought I would never be able to say that.</li>
            <li> in fact, I feel better without it.</li>
            <li> It works so much better</li>
            <li> I needed another bottle and realized that the salicylic acid is more specialized for acne</li>
            <li> my skin looks so nice, even,and what is the most important</li>
            <li> I used to break out every day and now it is maybe once a week, but it is getting better....</li>
            <li> Well, I love this product and it definatelly help me have a better skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know much more than that about the science of peeling, but 20% of salicyclic acid seemed more like a percentage a dermatologist would prescribe.</li>
            <li> , a lot more will work even better.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I followed the directions; I didn&#x27;t leave it on longer than 8 minutes, and I didn&#x27;t use it more than once a week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is appropriate or not...</li>
            <li> I love it,  it works.</li>
            <li> -Face became much more smoother, the scars got blended in(not</li>
            <li> I have never been so pleased with a product in my life.</li>
            <li> Man am I pleased.  </li>
            <li> I need more time to tell.</li>
            <li> Most acne clearing gels have 2 % salicylic acid ingredients, this has 20% ...</li>
            <li> I love the refreshing feeling of the peel after its washed off.</li>
            <li> It does burn a bit, but make sure you read the directions.</li>
            <li> and I think this product would benefit those who have pustule acne alot better since that lays on the surface as opposed to underneath the skin like mine.  </li>
            <li> My acne has improved alot, my skin is getting better every week I use this.</li>
            <li> TCA peel seems to work better with the Salicylic acid peel.</li>
            <li> I use prescription Retin A as well and this works so much better.</li>
            <li> This time, I was able to leave it on for about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure to follow the instructions step-by-step</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad this stuff exists...</li>
            <li> &quot; I love the results, I peel once a week and will taper off to once a month soon.</li>
            <li> I am able to apply the solution faster and spread it more evenly.</li>
            <li> Just make sure that you wash your hands with soap and water after the solution has been applied to your face.</li>
            <li> If it is peeling or irritated allow more days in between uses.</li>
            <li> micro needling is the better way to go, be patient but that works better</li>
            <li> I guess I can not leave it until my life style become healthy.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to pour a bit more into my hand to get it all done.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have already ordered more, even though I have not even used a quarter of the bottle that I started with.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> My blackheads seem to be more pronounced</li>
            <li> Hopefully with continued use, I will see better results.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad to say that this one did.</li>
            <li> and it eventually got better, please let me know.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 30s and get more acne now than I did as a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;Oral</li>
            <li> and I am peeling much more</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, for sure.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to follow the instructions to the letter for safety.  </li>
            <li> I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> After 1-2 months, I stopped and started using Origins (serum + moisturizer) and my skin was making much better progress.  </li>
            <li> A year ago my skin was PERFECT, unblemished and smooth.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should use it more than once a week?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through many 3-step acne product lines including AcneFree, Clinique Acne Solutions, and others that either irritated my skin or just didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how to rate this product.</li>
            <li> I am glad I tried the product though and know that my face can handle chemical peels.</li>
            <li> The peeling that&#x27;s most noticeable is on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Most make up, perfumes, and lotions break my skin out into a rash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start looking for a better moisturizer to use that</li>
            <li> If acne and blackheads are really your deal, I would still suggest the acne.org Treatment to tighten pores; however, if that also isn&#x27;t your deal whatever cream or serum deals with you would go great &lt;here&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad I found it and look forward to additional glow![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> skin is not awful.</li>
            <li> For me personally, the 20% peel is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using this because for me it causes more damage than it fixes.</li>
            <li> (I used a paper towel folded into a triangle to apply and my favorite healing lotion since I couldn&#x27;t wait to buy gauze and the recommended non-comedonic moisturizer.)</li>
            <li> It will get better off and on, but it never sticks.</li>
            <li> I want to be able to use makeup to enhance features, not cover them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> anyone has any advice, I&#x27;d love to hear it.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s one more product?</li>
            <li> Just be patient and persistent. :)</li>
            <li> i love to see bc</li>
            <li> This is the best anti-acne product that I ever buy, it works just in 1 week, the only thing you have to do is use a cream fro hydration.</li>
            <li> It will sting for sure upon application, but will not be noticeable after removal of product.  </li>
            <li> I used to get really shiny about an hour after applying my makeup, but now my face looks great throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> :]  </li>
            <li> That alleviated the pain almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this and hope to see even more results.</li>
            <li> I am ordering some more when I use this.    </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have bought her proactive and many over the counter products that just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> you will love this product.  </li>
            <li> I will be sure to put plenty on.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to do this</li>
            <li> More sanitary than using a brush over and over also.</li>
            <li> (happened to the area that \\&quot;stung\\&quot; most when peel was on).  </li>
            <li> I am guessing that I&#x27;m going to like the results of this peel better than the combo peel because it is stronger</li>
            <li> I was able to leave the combo peel on for 5 minutes on non-sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> this with the oil and the dirt and the touching of the face and boom--constant acne, with severe cysts.    </li>
            <li> Anything more than 2.5%</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t able to get the results promised.  </li>
            <li> My pimple scar seems like it looks a bit better, but that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> However, after 5 minutes or more the acid is neutralized and I could see immediate improvement on my skin, smoother and the redness was gone.  </li>
            <li> With the help from Neutrogena&#x27;s pore refining skin toner, oil-eliminating cleanser, and Skin Laboratory&#x27;s gel peel, my skin looked a lot smoother and had a healthy glowing feel.</li>
            <li> so I can have a spotless and healthy skin once again.</li>
            <li> and I sometimes use it more often than advised(don&#x27;t do it because I do).</li>
            <li> Once a week, and skin is so much better.  </li>
            <li> (I wouldn&#x27;t use more than once a week though).  </li>
            <li> This is because after applying this my skin broke out even more.</li>
            <li> Update: 3 weeks after product.</li>
            <li> This literally has done more damage than harm to my face.</li>
            <li> Why do I here about Proactiv more than this product?</li>
            <li> after a year of investigating i looked further into the salicylic acid peel and found that this is the best product to use for pores because it works from the inside out, not just the surface.</li>
            <li> i am 100% satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> i am 100% satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I recommended it to my friend and she&#x27;s in love with it also.     </li>
            <li> Also the  instructions said to wash off with plenty of water but maybe a PH neutralizer would be better.</li>
            <li> it almost goes on more like a toner, with a cotton pad wiped across the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne and oily skin for more than 15 years.</li>
            <li> No cleansing, toning or even moisturizing because i thought that would give me more spots</li>
            <li> , i had  so many acne scars</li>
            <li> The truth is that these skin acids can and are used safely on ebony skin tones and have been for years.</li>
            <li> I just bought some more.</li>
            <li> I can use the gel more than once weekly for more than 10 minutes each with no adverse results</li>
            <li> then Glycolic for 8 min( for me salicylic gives me more pain not glycolic).</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> I try to do a peel once a week, sometimes skipping a couple so that my skin can replenish itself appropriately.</li>
            <li> You know your skin better than anyone else.</li>
            <li> Also, do not use this product more than once a week...</li>
            <li> The directions said to use to before the acid peel (and Acid/Beta peel) but I wasn&#x27;t sure about the pH or the sensitivity of my skin to this stuff.    </li>
            <li> This product is EXTREMYLY potent, but the results have been outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My patience has built up after using sooo many products and waiting for results.</li>
            <li> I should have known better.  </li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> The results got better and better as I used it.</li>
            <li> I have had so many problems with my skin.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Its just dries the top layer of the skin but the cystic pimple is still underneath.     </li>
            <li> Ugh...But it is better than before.</li>
            <li> glad I tried this out.</li>
            <li> It will be a spot that will need repeat applications for sure</li>
            <li> My acne is sooooo much better.</li>
            <li> It is NOT going to work for everyone to apply this every night and leave it on, that&#x27;s not how it is designed, but it is as close to amiracle product as I have been able to find.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased.  </li>
            <li> Instead of buying cosmetics with salicylic acid in them already, this allows me much more choice.  </li>
            <li> There is a probably a better way, but this works for me.</li>
            <li> I am sure it will work for me again in my age.  </li>
            <li> and I am really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> (need to see a dermatologist someday!), but this peel seems to be helping it look better for now.</li>
            <li> make up to tinted coverage and and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> No acne, no problems, just want better looking skin.</li>
            <li> My acne has stressed me out more than school work, and I would always try to cover it up with foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using this product for the recommended 6 weeks and see what happens then :)  </li>
            <li> : My skin looked and felt better than it had in years of doctors visits and</li>
            <li> : My skin has never looked better and the scars are beginning to fade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I sincerely wish them luck in finding a solution.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s  &amp; like many others I&#x27;ve tried just about every product out there for my hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> I used it more consistently, I&#x27;m sure my skin would look even better.</li>
            <li> You can use this product without going to a spa and spending $100 or more.</li>
            <li> Although the instructions say not to keep it on for more than 5-7 mins, I keep it on for 2 hours.</li>
            <li> and my face looks way better</li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> I did not feel any more buring.</li>
            <li> applied the lactic peel(Intense Repair 88% Lactic Acid Peel Kit with Hyaluronic Acid Repair Cream) to even out the many blemishes</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working much better that way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been working ok, dries out my pimples</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both definitely better than just using face wash and 2.5% SA or BP spot treatments that you can get at the store</li>
            <li> the more you use it, the more change you will see, but give it time.</li>
            <li> make sure to use gloves and ALWAYS moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li> if you want a moisturizer that will help brighten your skin more, look for Avalon brand vitamin C lotion.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use a lot of moisturizer and sun screen throughout the process.</li>
            <li> To get your desired results, make sure you do not OD on peels and give your skin time to replenish.</li>
            <li> I am a lovely latina.</li>
            <li> I bought many products cover up, concealers, foundation.</li>
            <li> Started in the springtime, and now my skin is looking a bit smoother and more mellow-toned.</li>
            <li> But my skin also tend to peel more than I would like after using it.  </li>
            <li> seems more pratical and works better for me.</li>
            <li> It will make these problems MUCH better with time.  </li>
            <li> Soon, my skin started looking a lot better, smoother, and the tone was more even.</li>
            <li> If I am having more acne issues I will follow up the salicylic acid peel with Benzoyl peroxide, but nothing more than 3%</li>
            <li> I will be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did not order the stronger one.</li>
            <li> I hope it helps your skin, too! :)</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this product.  </li>
            <li> So because it is going deeper, it is going to shed the deeper layers of skin as well as the top layer.  </li>
            <li> This is why you get better results with Salicylic Acid (BHA)</li>
            <li> I already feel much more confident.  </li>
            <li> Most of my breakouts occur with PMS or when I&#x27;m under a lot of stress.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a diminish in the scarring, and am hoping one day they will be gone for the most part.</li>
            <li> after two weeks or so your skin and acne does look much better.</li>
            <li> Also, for the love of god do not use this all the time.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week which is more than safe and does the job.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third week (using it 2 times a week), and OH MY GOODNESS, my skin looks awesome!</li>
            <li> Most of friends now want to try this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been acne free for months!</li>
            <li> And being acne free is a dream!</li>
            <li> though I know they&#x27;re not going to go away, I just want something I can do at home to slough off the top layer of the skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is potent and works well.  </li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and have experience with many types of acid products.</li>
            <li> When used on my healthy skin, it did not peel at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about out and need to order more.</li>
            <li> But still my skin is lovely after I wash this off.</li>
            <li> Apply Egyptian Magic or coconut oil heavily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to leave it on for 6 minutes while using a piece of paper to fan my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen Mederma and Mama Lotion do a better job with a 10th of the pain of this product...</li>
            <li> im not using it more then 1 or 2</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product, but since it was \\&quot;professional\\</li>
            <li> now I LOVE</li>
            <li> 2 stars is more than generous.  </li>
            <li> but it did what it was supposed to, blend it in a lot better.</li>
            <li> Most of the people I know kept telling me that the scars were \\&quot;barely\\&quot; noticeable.</li>
            <li> I was seeing some results in my acne, but nothing to really say it was a great product.</li>
            <li> Once I was doing it more often, I was seeing more improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I just saw them faster using it more often, and who doesn&#x27;t like that?</li>
            <li> On a whim I decided to give it one more go.</li>
            <li> Using this product is still a love/hate relationship, but for the most part it is love.</li>
            <li> If I could put pictures up from before and after, I would :)  </li>
            <li> The reason I give this product 5 stars is because it is the only product that gave me the best results within a week, AND I had/have no breakouts (what so ever) since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> That is how I was able to notice \\&quot;It</li>
            <li> Two of them were really cute.</li>
            <li> and then you&#x27;ll have a better idea on which one to order and what to expect.  </li>
            <li> MUCH more than those</li>
            <li> This peel has done more for my rosacea than Finacea, TriLuma cream and all those trips to the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> And, that I had to give it time for it to work its magic.</li>
            <li> Throughout the week, I made sure I follow the instructions</li>
            <li> Beats proactiv for sure.    </li>
            <li> but overall it is great for ance scars toooooo!!!</li>
            <li> I am able to use it for 4-5min every day without peeling/frosting.</li>
            <li> If you follow directions, do patch test and watch time you will be pleased.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be abandoning this \\&quot;entry-level\\&quot; chemical peel because I feel like I&#x27;ve dodged a bullet re more permanent skin damage.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much better.</li>
            <li> and was able to leave it on for the maximum time of 8 minutes by sticking my head in the freezer...</li>
            <li> I dont use it very often, but would probably see great results if i used it weekly.</li>
            <li> how many times I tapped it off.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t get better.  </li>
            <li> I have many crater scars from 11+ years of acne.</li>
            <li> I received many compliments for my skin</li>
            <li> I have had problem skin all my life (I am 21 now and started having acne at 8-so much fun) and as a result I have used my fair share of prescription grade and drug store grade products.</li>
            <li> but as soon as you wash it off you can visibly see where it is doing its magic.</li>
            <li> This made my skin break out MORE.</li>
            <li> skin above my lips looks awesome.</li>
            <li> That worked ok..</li>
            <li> I really LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> It will peel the top layer of existing blemishes too which helps to speed healing.  </li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t expect a drastic change at once, but I&#x27;m sure with continued and controlled use my scars</li>
            <li> Like many people, I have truly tried every product out there.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure what the effect is going to be look like when I put them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the many reviews.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s where I notice the tingling the most.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for about 5 minutes, then I add more to the jawline area where I have cystic acne and some bumpy scarring.</li>
            <li> I still used it and finished the bottle because I just wasn&#x27;t sure what was going on.</li>
            <li> Love this product, changed my LIFE.</li>
            <li> worked better than any acne meds from the dermatologist, and helps more than birth control did too.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and blackheads, mostly on my chin and nose.  </li>
            <li> However, I wish I would have ordered a greater solution like 35% instead.</li>
            <li> and hopefully I will see more results with my blemishes.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product!</li>
            <li> To those to who it worked for then I am glad it works.</li>
            <li> I was able to distract myself for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was so sure it was going to work</li>
            <li> is acne.org&#x27;s regimen &amp;their products, benzoyl peroxide works for my face,not salicylic, now that I know that I won&#x27;t be touching this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this product has worked so well for others, but for me it seems to be a bust.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many products - over the counter and prescription.  </li>
            <li> but like most say, it makes your skin SMOOTH!  </li>
            <li> but I like washing my face because it is so smooth!</li>
            <li> So as I&#x27;m maturing, I started looking into how to take better care of my face.</li>
            <li> more that once.</li>
            <li> I rubbed that onto my skin instead and have found that it keeps my skin much better hydrated than lotion.</li>
            <li> I tried to wash it more and more but it wouldn&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> , please elaborate in the comments and indicate your type of skin, ethnicity and skin color.</li>
            <li> I have had many people ask what I am doing</li>
            <li> I use the 20% peel once a week for two months at a time, taking two weeks off and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Product works ok.  </li>
            <li> but now I just tip my fingers over the top and use them to spread the peel.  </li>
            <li> I love using the Salicylic Acid Gel Peel.</li>
            <li> I have given up on foundation all together because I love the way my skin looks.</li>
            <li> After using the product for 2 weeks the break outs almost disappeared and my complexion has been so much more clearer.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t keep it on my skin for more than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> About for many years I stayed on a strict regimen of Retin A, benzoyl peroxide, and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I love this salicylic peel.  </li>
            <li> i will write more after awhile....</li>
            <li> Then it just kept getting better.  </li>
            <li> I use often and love this product.</li>
            <li> potent, dont use more than once a week.</li>
            <li> Now, i know that a majority of people misconstrue that indented acne scars are from the effect of picking on acne, which is not always the case for most people.</li>
            <li> but I am sure he is able to do them himself now.</li>
            <li> None of them was realized after using it many times.</li>
            <li> Contrary it made some scars darker and more visible.</li>
            <li> peel again on my face, hands, arms, and chest :).  </li>
            <li> :) To be safe, I am going to wait a week</li>
            <li> MUCH more.  </li>
            <li> I plan on ordering more and continuing the therapy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed and so thankful finally something is working!</li>
            <li> -I also apply vaseline (I use the kind that has cocoa butter mixed in, it smells so good!)</li>
            <li> But armed with both of these products, a good skin regimen, and eating healthy,  I am confident more than I was a year ago that I won&#x27;t have to hide under a inch of makeup pretty soon.</li>
            <li> I am very excited to have found this peel.</li>
            <li> I also have gotten completely unsolicited comments from my friends and family (Some of whom I hadn&#x27;t told about the peel) saying how good my skin has been looking, so I know it isn&#x27;t all just wishful thinking on my part!</li>
            <li> This peel impressed me so much it prompted my first ever Amazon review.</li>
            <li> and my skin comes out nice and clean.</li>
            <li> The breakout quickly went away and my skin is looking better every day!    </li>
            <li> This step is very important because the peel is most effective when the skin is completely clean and free of any residue, oils, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO HAPPY that I finally discovered the magic of salicylic acid!</li>
            <li> My scarring is improved and my skin tone is becoming much more even.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be alarmed or discouraged, in the long run this is for the best.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go for make-up first</li>
            <li> Number one, it does burn pretty good.  </li>
            <li> but this was pretty good.</li>
            <li> and it is working pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Good first time peel for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have pretty good skim skin</li>
            <li> It would be good to get a face moisturizer with aloe, because it may irritate your skin at first.   </li>
            <li> I had pretty good skin to start with</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this it burned like hell, and I think I have a good tolerance to pain.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited about this!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: I&#x27;m very happy with this product, doing more progress on clearing my skin more than over a thousand dollars of other products.</li>
            <li> Success!!</li>
            <li> (Happy New Year)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have learned to live with...not happily but as a matter of nature.</li>
            <li> and I will look great in my new skin.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome because it takes away the layers of your skin to get new skin growing, promote healthy cell growth, and with fresh skin it is acne free.</li>
            <li> Now after I use the peel my face looks much better, it has this kind of renewed fresh look to it.</li>
            <li> I have battled mild acne for years--the kind where no matter</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find anything this strong or at this price anywhere.  </li>
            <li> so I develop sunspots more easily than those who are not genetically-inclined.</li>
            <li> A lot of water will do the job to get it off, but strong acids like this will be better neutralized by something specifically designed to do so.</li>
            <li> So far so good but to be honest</li>
            <li> I have never had a facial or experienced any kind of chemical peel.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with what I&#x27;ve seen already and would recommend this product  to anyone who wants to see a real improvement in problem skin - and we all have problem skin in some way, don&#x27;t we?</li>
            <li> I am absolutely astonished that after so many years of battling and trying to hide my acne, it is gone for good, as well as all the scars and pock marks from picking and squeezing to get rid of blemishes</li>
            <li> but because the company is selling it to anyone who wants it and they are not giving good and safe instructions on use and removal of this product.</li>
            <li> far I am MORE than happy with the outcome.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I feel this is an AMAZING product that is very cost effective.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I feel this is an AMAZING product that is very cost effective.  </li>
            <li> I now have the type of skin that is clear more often than it is breaking out... something I haven&#x27;t experienced since I was</li>
            <li> I am a happy buyer and I will continue to have clear skin with this product!</li>
            <li> Fine, ok, that means it worked.  </li>
            <li> But i am always able to exfoliate it off easily and conceal it easily.  </li>
            <li> Skin also feels much more smooth without any pimples appearing all the time.</li>
            <li> Read all the instructions, and most importantly listen to your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right from the first use I noticed a radical decrease in pore size (look in a close up mirror 10 minutes after peel and again in the morning to note change), that it was easier to extract goop from my pores and that any cream or treatment worked more effectively proceeding a peel.  </li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> I am so surprised by what a great product this is.  </li>
            <li> I went to work this morning with minimal make-up and it feels absolutely wonderful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done three peels so far and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have become more comfortable using this peel and also leaving it on for longer periods</li>
            <li> My acne scars seem to have become more smooth, my face doesn&#x27;t looks as ruddy.</li>
            <li> Well I decided to try this product and so far great</li>
            <li> My skin is so much more even and smooth, and the acne scars are beginning to fade.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re unsure about the peel or if you become overly sensitive to the peel it may be best to talk with a dermatologist, but the most important thing is to follow the instructions EXACTLY.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase so far.</li>
            <li> i noticed that the tags were getting burned and becoming whitish.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and a lot of professional sites that all said this was a great product and the recovery time would be negligible.</li>
            <li> The Salicyclic Acid 20% Gel Peel, is great for somewhat sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this to me, and I was surprised and happy when after a month I no longer had any signs of scars on my face.</li>
            <li> My spots were really looking good and fading away.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a good starter peel to really see where you are at regarding chemical peels and your skin.</li>
            <li> I start to flake days afterwards, but it&#x27;s worth it for the nice skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like real acid in the movies (good thing for me)</li>
            <li> Good luck and much caution recommended.  </li>
            <li> Real powerful stuff.</li>
            <li> Friends and family have not stopped complimenting me about my new, beautiful skin--they say not only do I look great</li>
            <li> Amazingly, the product doesn&#x27;t try up your skin right away.</li>
            <li> I saw results right away with this product, its amazing.</li>
            <li> but as of right now i still havent found that amazing product</li>
            <li> The clogged pores and acne will come out real easy and your skin will be super super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That being said, I tried this product for the first time today and already love it!</li>
            <li> It was so cool!  </li>
            <li> You can easily burn your skin.  </li>
            <li> But honestly, it&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast and the peel arrived early (in perfect condition).</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t use the peels I use face washes and lotions to prevent breakouts and reduce scars, but the face washes and lotions easily cost me over $80 per month.  </li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t use the peels I use face washes and lotions to prevent breakouts and reduce scars, but the face washes and lotions easily cost me over $80 per month.  </li>
            <li> My skin is much more even toned since using it and it looks much more fresh and youthful.</li>
            <li> This is soooo easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have very mild acne</li>
            <li> I think I will easily get about 15 to 20 applications out of this bottle.</li>
            <li> (my skin dries out easily</li>
            <li> I can easily extract the whiteheads after.</li>
            <li> and my skin tolerates it easily.  </li>
            <li> but I have been putting on toner and that has really been a more effective way of moisturizing my skin immediately after using the peel.    </li>
            <li> So for me it has been much cheaper and much more effective than anything else that I could have used during that time.    </li>
            <li> Rinse with cool (not luke warm) COOL water.</li>
            <li> I would strongly suggest using this product.</li>
            <li> 20% is really strong.  </li>
            <li> My glycolic peel is strong (40-50%) and I&#x27;m scared that it may overwhelm my skin.    </li>
            <li> So far so good :)</li>
            <li> Strong.  </li>
            <li> but I felt a strong sting immediately.  </li>
            <li> So... if you can just get yourself through the first 3 or 4 minutes, you&#x27;re good to go for the full 7!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> The product is strong and stings my skin</li>
            <li> Some of these products are too strong.</li>
            <li> This product is strong, and you should use it with caution.  </li>
            <li> However, do not give in to the idea that keeping this gel peel on your skin for more than the recommended high of 8 minutes will get better results -- this stuff is potent, so start out keeping it on for one or two minutes at most, then work your way up to the longer treatment.  </li>
            <li> My mother says I should be happy, as this will stave off major wrinklage, but, whilst I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, I&#x27;d like it to be one shade of color until that time.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the shipping was AMAZING.</li>
            <li> it feels really cool and refreshing when the product is on my face.</li>
            <li> I have used many many facial products, but not one as good at this one.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to leave it on for the full 8 minutes from that point on.  </li>
            <li> My skin burns when this on, and it has taken about two months for me to be able to keep it on for the full 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that it clears blemishes fast!  </li>
            <li> Upon my first used, I liked it.</li>
            <li> so i started to put cool water on my face, as i suspected the acid was not coming off and was, in fact, burning even more.   </li>
            <li> So BE AWARE that you will get one if you are prone to them or carry the virus (not the std kind).</li>
            <li> I bought this item to use as a  mild chemical peel, but happily discovered that it works well in controlling new acne breakout.</li>
            <li> This peel has yielded the best results, hands down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also getting fine lines.</li>
            <li> Then I use an AHA cream around my eyes for my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Overall, even though it&#x27;s my first day on this product, I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> and I would be fine.  </li>
            <li> A huge warning in advance is if you can&#x27;t take the pain of a strong burning or tingling sensation then this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> That would have been fine if it weren&#x27;t for my obsession with picking every pimple that I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m beginning to develop fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Considering the price and the result, this is a fine product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels wonderful - amazingly clean and soft, and it looks clearer, brighter and much smoother.</li>
            <li> I am fine with, but this also makes me prone to UV exposure</li>
            <li> We never bought the neutralizer and it works fine without it.</li>
            <li> my fine lines are prominent&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> So once a week is fine for me.  </li>
            <li> my skin quickly got used to this, because i would leave it on for up to 10 mins or more</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong and is not to be taken lightly.  </li>
            <li> Helps zap blemishes quickly!</li>
            <li> this gets results quickly!  </li>
            <li> I luckily had a neutralizer product on hand and was able to save my skin.</li>
            <li> Luckily I have some Obagi Hydroquinone cream!  </li>
            <li> But when used consistently, this is a great product to increase cellular turnover, which will keep your pores more clear and will reduce inflammation.  </li>
            <li> By giving your skin time to heal, and  a little patience, you can get almost perfect skin.</li>
            <li> (I will take Ibuprofin first to help the stinging) to help myself work up to the TCA, which is supposed to sting like a mother! :)  </li>
            <li> I might get a pink flush after I put it on, but I am very fair and have some roscea on my cheeks and</li>
            <li> : I ran out of the stuff and have ordered another bottle, but i have not been getting acne after i stopped, so i think it played a huge role in it.</li>
            <li> my goodness are my pores huge again\\&quot; --</li>
            <li> When I woke up this morning, one of my pimples had a huge whitehead on it but some of the others were minimized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking huge, pus-filled cysts building up along my face like houses lining up beach-front property.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference even after the 1st use.</li>
            <li> I immediately saw a huge difference in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> Huge, cystic pimples that I would try to pop and nothing would come out.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t feel oily at all - a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li> I already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I am light brown by complexion.</li>
            <li> I followed up with an oil free moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> If anyone has any tips please feel free to respond</li>
            <li> It is also reducing the bumps on my face which is also fantastic.</li>
            <li> This product is really fantastic.</li>
            <li> You may want to go out and buy a light lotion/moisturizer to go with this skin peel.</li>
            <li> Apply product with a cotton ball evenly all over face using a q-tip to get around the nose and lips precisely</li>
            <li> this company is great, the peel always arrives earlier than quoted.</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;i do see my skin is a light tighter..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone for about two weeks and the results have been simply fantastic.</li>
            <li> Yes, I experienced initial redness   3.  </li>
            <li> This is the 4th week and her skin is almost acne free.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;d look in the mirror, I&#x27;d notice smooth or gunked up pieces of skin.  </li>
            <li> Your pores will then smooth out.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel fantastic</li>
            <li> It took me only one application to see results, but about a month to see good results like the others around here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started light, then added time and more liquid to each session.</li>
            <li> and I was acne free for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I tried everything from Proactiv Solutions to every over-the-counter acne medication available on the market.    </li>
            <li> It makes sense that the most potent way to make best use of a topical medication is to attack the skin in a way such as this (i.e. by shedding).  </li>
            <li> This product is only a catalyst and to an extent greatly accelerates this process.      </li>
            <li> My second peel was the salicylic 20% peel by Skin Laboratory and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> After I use it, it takes literally a week for my skin to stop peeling and become smooth.</li>
            <li> Not only will your skin looks great</li>
            <li> Wash your face three times or two times a day, use sun screen, and oh i forgot to mention the day after the peel I use (Acne free 10 percent benzol peroxide lotion    </li>
            <li> The company also sent a free sample of another acid peel.  </li>
            <li> It works great on teenage acne.  </li>
            <li> My son got great results in a very short period of time.  </li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is a great moisturizer that actually penatrates my skin.</li>
            <li> I have a light brown complexion, so i had some discoloration and it has been somewhat cleared.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t another product like this for such a great price.</li>
            <li> I apply lightly to breakouts.</li>
            <li> It burned away all existing pimples and i woke up the next morning with people commenting on how great my skin looked.</li>
            <li> , blackhead free skin.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Then I wash it off after 5 minutes and then put on an oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Just in the nick of time too because I have an important event coming up</li>
            <li> overall happy with this product, would recommend.</li>
            <li> as though my skin looked/felt great the very next day but through-out the week there was nothing.</li>
            <li> I had never done any facial peels before, and was nervous about the burning sensations that some reviewers had experienced.</li>
            <li> I am an experienced peeler and this one hurt from the second I put in on.</li>
            <li> After using this product it is important to use some type of non-comedogenic moisturizer with an SPF of 30.  </li>
            <li> cheap</li>
            <li> but it is also more powerful.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the OTC spot remover with some success but it takes continuous use of 30 or more days.  </li>
            <li> If you just want to do some light peels or use it for spot acne treatment...</li>
            <li> After rinsing with lots of water I apply Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer with SPF 30.  </li>
            <li> I follow up with the Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I purchased the pH Balancer from Cellbone to use after the peel, with the Balancer, Cellbone included a free 35% Gylocolic Lactic Peel -</li>
            <li> I used the neutralizer and my skin was so smooth.</li>
            <li> Wipe this product on lightly, like a toner, with a cotton pad, avoiding my eyes, sides of my nose, and mouth.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I both use it regularly with great results.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth after I rinse.</li>
            <li> I have continued to use this regimen with magnificent results with no acne, much fewer and smaller blackheads, and my skin tone is so smooth and even.</li>

            <li> So far, so good; my ultra-sensitive skin has taken well to treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old with fair, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> I been using this product weekly and so far so good, I am seeing improvement.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started to use this products my skin looks much better and it does not get oily so fast any more.</li>
            <li> My face is now flawless and the red marks are diminishing fast.</li>
            <li> I do the treatment twice a week at night, and it&#x27;s been good so far.  </li>
            <li> This is as good as it gets professional result.</li>
            <li> It is quite good so far and the product met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have fair, sensitive skin and this product has done nothing.</li>
            <li> far so good.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old, I guess it is fair to say I have \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; skin and takes 20% peel with out any problems.</li>
            <li> The only time I had a problem was when I got over-zealous about it and did it 2 or 3 times in one week -- then I aggravated my skin, thinking if once was good, then 2 or 3 times would be even better, which it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you have a very warm and wet washcloth waiting for you in the sink before you start</li>
            <li> Cheap,efficient, and just plain wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I came across this product and with such great reviews, I was so excited to try it</li>
            <li> Thank You so much!!!</li>
            <li> , I tried the baking powder water solution and Man does that really sting!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any huge fading of my brown spot in the first two weeks, but I might have had more luck if I had kept using the product.</li>
            <li> Many of my pimples had become unclogged and were shrinking, many light acne scars had disappeared completely, the stubborn scars had noticeably faded, and my fine lines became even finer.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a strong and effective salicylic acid available!</li>
            <li> I bought this salicylic acid peel to help the mild occasional acne and to just get a good peel and more even tone to my skin.</li>
            <li> The first and most important thing I can express with peels of this nature(glycolic, salicylic, and lactic) is that you need to be PATIENT.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that you try it and try all of the tips that I&#x27;ve provided, because I&#x27;ve had amazing results using them</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen/moisturizer to followup with as it has a little skin tone evening/ brightening effect and it smells so nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> if I pick or they are bright, takes half the time to heal up- nice of Olay to discontinue the line.)  </li>
            <li> I washed it off with plenty of cool water aft 1 minute and my skin feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> I was familiar with peels and how they were supposed to lift off severe acne scarring and associated discolorations in stages through a peeling process.</li>
            <li> - it didn&#x27;t work for me, but it was worth a try!</li>
            <li> I wrote this original review over 6 months ago.  </li>
            <li> Ok I used it for the first time</li>
            <li> It feels more hot than anything else.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product, the amount of time after use before my skin would look better was around 2 days.  </li>
            <li> Using it every 5-7 days (I use it every Sunday) is sufficient for great long term results.  </li>
            <li> So i am excited to see the results after 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this peel, I haven&#x27;t even had to use concealer, as my skin tone is significantly evening</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried everything except accutane.</li>
            <li> and I am excited to move up to the 30%.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this peel for almost 2 weeks now and have seen a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> IT WAS WELL WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li> First, don&#x27;t use it more than every 4 days or so depending on your skin.  </li>
            <li> If you follow the directions you should see a significant improvement in your skin within a month.  </li>
            <li> and this has been the only product in the market I have found that&#x27;s been as successful as it claims.  </li>
            <li> -this is a powerful product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to see what the results would be with along term use.</li>
            <li> My skin tone has improved significantly.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I noticed that my skin already looked more luminous and felt so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many products to clear my skin &amp; nothing has worked as well as this!  </li>
            <li> I need to get more consistent in use</li>
            <li> Darker then it originally was including areas on my nose</li>
            <li> The acne bumps were significantly minimized- not gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I originally got it for my Keratosis Pilaris</li>
            <li> For the first time I am in control of my face - my skin tone looks much better too.</li>
            <li> (it bubbles a lot more with the lactic acid, no worries), face gets really hot for a moment, just keep applying until you do not feel burning.</li>
            <li> (it bubbles a lot more with the lactic acid, no worries), face gets really hot for a moment, just keep applying until you do not feel burning.</li>
            <li> I tried it exactly how instructions showed and even though it  made me break out more i stuck with it for months, in the end</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but I&#x27;ve only done three applications - it does look noticeably better, so I&#x27;m standing by my initial review.</li>
            <li> (apply with a small fan brush works best)</li>
            <li> They are almost completely gone leaving my skin looking very smooth!</li>
            <li> Be warned, this peel burns like a mother, but is so worth it!</li>
            <li> After three peels done weekly, I have seen remarkable improvements in the superficial scarring on my cheeks and a definite evening out of the pigmentation of my skin.</li>
            <li> To my dismay, I woke up in the morning with significant brown patches.</li>
            <li> I was so excited but</li>
            <li> Seriously  worth it!</li>
            <li> It stings just a bit, but for this price and the results, the ending outcome is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I was NOT disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Really excited about the process.  </li>
            <li> If you educate yourself first, you will feel so much better and not freak out</li>
            <li> Clean you area where you are going to apply this using an unscented body wash.</li>
            <li> Gently clean off the water using a cotton cloth (DO NOT RUB).</li>
            <li> Clean with a cotton cloth (DO NOT RUB).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also probably worth mentioning that the only peeling I experienced was on my chin, which was COVERED in super-inflamed pimples.</li>
            <li> but now I have no problem going out with a clean face.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve always liked how salicylic acid makes the overall appearance of my skin look better.</li>
            <li> I researched online for tricks to remove blackheads and was advised to try a salicylic acid mask on my problem areas to clean out the pores.</li>
            <li> I did however splurge and buy 100% natural Argan oil as a recommendation from another reviewer, and since Argan oil has so many more added benefits for your skin</li>
            <li> It is not necessarily a miracle cure, but a HUGE help in fighting the good fight.</li>
            <li> Apply a REALLY GOOD lotion, don&#x27;t skimp on cheap facial lotion here.</li>
            <li> I use it about 2x a week rubbing it on the area with a clean q-tip.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean my pores once in a while</li>
            <li> Clean face with cotton ball damp with rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li> I rinse, clean with Witch Hazel Toner, apply peel...</li>
            <li> Not only did I receive this order SUPER quick, I was eager to use it because of ALL of the GREAT reviews</li>
            <li> You must have Sodium bicarbonate to clean your face after applying it.</li>
            <li> After using the Salicylic Acid (20%) for 3 weeks now, it cleared my mild pimples off my forehead, and my huge pores had tightened up.</li>
            <li> I clean my face in a steamy shower.  </li>
            <li> washed my face with Cetaphil then used Witch Hazel on a cotton ball to start my face with a clean surface.</li>
            <li> I bought it after reading so many positive reviews</li>
            <li> I am glad I thought about it again and all these positive comments confirms my decision.  </li>
            <li> but this works far much better!</li>
            <li> So far I love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trust me, once all of the dead skin is gone, you&#x27;ll love how fresh and beautiful your skin looks.</li>
            <li> For those with some experience with chemical peels, this is nothing special.</li>
            <li> it also liquifies blackheads, so you can biore strip right after to pull out everything!</li>
            <li> My experience with most peels, especially salicylic acid, is that it is VERY easy to get sunburn after use even during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> As long as use this regulary my face is clear and looks great!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked up facial peels before and at the time it seemed like a good idea.</li>
            <li> so I rinsed well with cool water and</li>
            <li> I rinsed with cool water and used a noncomodogenic moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> Despite trying numerous dermatologists, I never got what I considered good results - just a three minute visit and a couple of scripts.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about it.</li>
            <li> Anyway overall this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could say enough good things about this peel.</li>
            <li> I use a hair dryer on my face, on the cool setting, while I am waiting the 8 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I then rinse my face with lukewarm to cool water for about 2 or 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> and I recommend it to everyone that wants better skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will probably increase the time to the full 8 minutes and frequency as others have to see faster results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just bought a stronger concentration from Skin Obsession because I would like more intense results.</li>
            <li> I think this is better for spot treatment rather than the whole face.  </li>
            <li> After seeing such good reviews for this product, I gave it a try today.</li>
            <li> I got this last week and have used it twice already, it burns a fair bit but leaves my skin feeling and looking amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even if it doesn&#x27;t cure my acne completely the oil elimination is so nice I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to using this peel again and leaving it on full face for longer.  </li>
            <li> The acid will sting more and won&#x27;t provide much help.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> I figured leave good enough alone.</li>
            <li> I believe when I use all of glycolic acid, my facial condition will be good.</li>
            <li> I go back &amp; forth) which is really good for your skin as well.</li>
            <li> It will take awhile to get the full benefit from the peel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone from a full coverage</li>
            <li> we as consumers can buy a product such as this at a fair price.</li>
            <li> To aid in this while the product is on your face fan your face with some paper or put your hair dryer on cool while the Peel is on your face.</li>
            <li> With that said, I&#x27;ve found that the peel is not painful for me</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, it is not cystic acne and is not painful.)</li>
            <li> I tried OTC acne products,not much difference, heck I tried so many things</li>
            <li> Sure I&#x27;d get some peeling but nothing really changed.</li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed the results and</li>
            <li> My hyper pigmentation hasn&#x27;t showed much improvement, but I just need to give it more time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hyper pigmentation hasn&#x27;t showed much improvement, but I just need to give it more time.  </li>
            <li> gone!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2-3 weeks, using it  every week as a full peel, but in between peels i use it as a miracle spot treatment and to get rid of a gnarly sunspot i have.</li>
            <li> so I could leave it on the full 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> Maybe a more aggressive dermatologist would have done some sort of treatments to fade my redness, but my doctor was very nonchalant about my skin, told me that I was basically stuck with the redness.  </li>
            <li> In my own experience i recommend applying some castor oil after to leave your skin soft and help neutralize the acid.    </li>
            <li> I am a red head with medium to fair skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I really do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked my way up to the full eight minutes, and the burning isn&#x27;t to terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any good advice for this problem, not from derms nor various estheticians.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I&#x27;m even giving bottles away as Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> I love it really works greats</li>
            <li> but it got such good reviews that I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I leave this on for five minutes, then I rinse with cool water and baking soda to neutralize the acid.</li>
            <li> it has kept my facial blemishes to a minimum, lightened up sun spots and people tell me my skin looks good after I use it.  </li>
            <li> just use cool to lukewarm water and rinse, rinse, rinse and rinse some more&lt;</li>
            <li> She also said it is a good idea to get a facial done with extractions when using this product.  </li>
            <li> but it was not bad at sll&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The healing process was not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I tan very easy and am very sensitive to the sun (hyperpigmentation),</li>
            <li> found the cost of this product to be VERY reasonable when you consider how easy it is to go to any drugstore, makeup counter or makeup/skincare store.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Surprisingly it has not dried out my face however the first time I used it, I did break out, but it cleared up quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product I have just used it once but can feel the difference my face feels smooth and less oily</li>
            <li> The peel is effective, easy to apply, and it doesn&#x27;t run when applied properly.</li>
            <li> After i used all my salicylic acid, my right side of face was acne free</li>
            <li> The face did not react as strong as the first time.</li>
            <li> And my face reacted as strong as I first time used it.</li>
            <li> but I have high hopes that my skin will be much smoother and more appealing.</li>
            <li> used to suffer from acne and used accutaine for 10 months and my skin was clear and felt great for about 5 months, but after that, I started breaking out again (to a smaller degree, but my skin was supposed to be clear for good).</li>
            <li> My skin is visibly clearer, lighter due to the fact that the hyperpigmentation is fading, i just look great</li>
            <li> I will be excited to write a review that would be worth 10 stars to me.</li>
            <li> I have great results with this acid in other products but have never tried this strength until now.  </li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian, 20 year old female with very fair and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small but the product applies easily and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be able to get much more than the 15 applications</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously the best thing I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist &amp; have received esthetics training, but those willing to READ, follow instructions &amp; be patient should do fine applying this product &amp; receiving its benefits.</li>
            <li> It keeps that fresh clean look on your face all the time.</li>
            <li> I first got a glycolic acid and started to use it and it worked pretty well, my skin was much more even and healthier.</li>
            <li> but i think it clogged my pores and cause mild acne.    </li>
            <li> I bought this product to help even out some redness and solve mild acne.</li>
            <li> I have mild papular acne</li>
            <li> This peel will slowly clear your pores and leave your skin more even and acne free.</li>
            <li> My tolerance to the stinging sensation grew quickly, and I did not go through any peeling.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is for people with oily skin, or severe acne, or mild acne, or something that I don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> But even after leaving it on for such a short time I have had great results!  </li>
            <li> I am now able to leave it on for several minutes and am seeing more noticable improvement.</li>
            <li> If anything, I might apply this on a larger zit, but beyond that, I don&#x27;t think this is the best thing for my entire face.  </li>
            <li> I had a mild breakout on my chin and forehead after this peel in areas</li>
            <li> After about two days, I noticed mild peeling.  </li>
            <li> However, when I saw mild inflammation from acne, I would use both.  </li>
            <li> In conclusion, I&#x27;ve listened to many stories and tried many different products to make my nose not look like Rudolf the Reindeer.  </li>
            <li> Best part is, I don&#x27;t even need a expensive cleanser and moisturizer to have healthy skin now.</li>
            <li> I have never seen results with a product this quickly.</li>
            <li> Since A.Americans have more pigment in their skin, this is more likely to happen to them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for acne-prone skin, and gentle enough that you could use it on a teenager.</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild acne</li>
            <li> but it quickly disappeared the day after.</li>
            <li> It just became super unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Mild stinging.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne and some clogged pores and the winter season</li>
            <li> My skin has quickly and drastically improved-</li>
            <li> I have been using the peel very 5 days or so, and my friends have noticed how clear and bright my face looks.</li>
            <li> 20% Gel Peel save for pregnant women??&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has helped me with acne scars and mild pigmentation that was visible on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mild peeling.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the mild salicylic acid products that do nothing for acne.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> that background, this salicyclic peel is rather mild for me.</li>
            <li> Luckily my face was not scared</li>
            <li> , I understood that other reviewers said you&#x27;ll break out before it gets better, well, I broke out but never got better!</li>
            <li> I am so happy because I was always asked about my scars and I was very self-conscious, but now I don&#x27;t think they are noticeable enough to attract anyone&#x27;s attention.</li>
            <li> Some quick FYI:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I am making progress, and it does not evaporate so quickly as to cause application problems.</li>
            <li> My skin is also really sensitive, it gets irritated very easily.</li>
            <li> product worked great, wasn&#x27;t too strong and I only peeled slightly or not at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so when I first applied it - the burning sensation was a huge surprise.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference my very first time.  </li>
            <li> Although I experienced a bit of irritation for about 1hr afterwards, the next morning my skin looked better than ever and my pores were visibly smaller.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and am very pleased by the results after only one use.</li>
            <li> Using the copper along with it (peel in the morning, copper 2x at night), the scar has become much more like the normal surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very responsible company !    </li>
            <li> Thank you very much !</li>
            <li> I think someone with the same skin situation as me would really benefit from this product and for the really great price, its worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li> this gives you very fast results!</li>
            <li> Generally you must neutralize any acid then remove it with a warm cloth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from pretty severe acne problems for about four or five years now, and my face hasn&#x27;t been free of a breakout since before my teens.</li>
            <li> brushes are pretty cheap and they are fan brushes</li>
            <li> glad I read other reviews because I created my own ph balancer for after I rinse the peel.  </li>
            <li> This product is good but definitely not professional quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a slave for skincare, so I&#x27;ve tried many different peels over the last 16 years,  this one by far gave me the best result for an at home treatment.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Then I follow with a good moisturizer like Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Beauty Facial Cream or Curel&#x27;s Ultra Healing (both are great on sensitive skin and even open skin).</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product after reading all of the great reviews on it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this product more that once a week since skin needs time for new skin cells.</li>
            <li> love my new skin peel</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t try this before, I was contemplating getting laser done, but this seams to be an easy fast and inexpensive way to solve my problem.</li>
            <li> (which by the way don&#x27;t help much unless its very mild acne).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Had acne, acne scarring, large pores, oily skin, and two fine lines on my forehead when I bought product.&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> I had suffered from hyperpigmentation, acne, fine lines and large pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though I had been using VERY high SPF and very water/sweat proof, on my face for many years...and was wearing it FULL TIME on this trip...</li>
            <li> This is very very important as this layering causes a deeper peel and consequently more sensitive new skin.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so a great success for one person may not mean everyone will benefit from this peel.  </li>
            <li> I will say that the first time I used it, there was significant discomfort.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so terrified of burning my skin off, that I literally put it on for 10 seconds the first time!</li>
            <li> I think the acid in this is even higher than the wart remover Compund W!</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with this peel!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, it did sting!</li>
            <li> VERY next morning, my skin was NOTICEABLY better!</li>
            <li> : THIS WILL STING/BURN AT FIRST!</li>
            <li> This product works exactly how it says it will!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I feel that Professional Laboratories has done a splendid job by doing an exhaustive research and then presenting this product to the public for cosmetological use.</li>
            <li> so glad I can use it on the white heads and just wipe it off so easily without having to pop it.</li>
            <li> My background: I am very light skinned and in my early thirties.</li>
            <li> Felt my skin looks very smooth and soft for weeks after I used it.</li>
            <li> My skin is very smooth and clear now.  </li>
            <li> But the consecutive times i first clean my skin of all dirt and oils by swiping it with rubbing alcohol and then apply the peel.</li>
            <li> I clean my chest with alcohol first and then dab it all over my chest.</li>
            <li> I think this product can really bring great results if you are super careful about using it and don&#x27;t give up.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about using this at home, but I followed the directions to the tee and am so happy with my results.  </li>
            <li> The fine lines on my forehead are virtually undetectable unless if my face gets oily, which only happens if I go without showering for more than 3 days</li>
            <li> But for people with delicate skin this is probably very good.</li>
            <li> I have seen the most improvements in my acne, but not so much with any large pores or scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin but find this to be very tolerable, perhaps because my face has “hardened” from of all the harsh things I’ve tried for acne and rosacea throughout my life.</li>
            <li> - Make sure you use a good and light moisturizer after the peels, otherwise your skin will likely get very dry.</li>
            <li> But some advice, if you are using this stuff frequently make sure to put some sunscreen on, because your skin will be much more sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> I have been using this peel for a few weeks now hoping for great results like I read in the reviews.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen a huge reduction in acne, however, but am hopeful that it will do that in time.</li>
            <li> Now that it is the third week, most of my huge pores that I got before has either shrunk, or disappeared.</li>
            <li> Amazing results - I am going to try the 30% next.  </li>
            <li> The overall pigmentation is just amazing.</li>
            <li> However, paying for the peel to be administered was not as fun.</li>
            <li> But so far I am quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Applied thrice, no change but skin thickening seemed to be becoming normal.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice much change until maybe 2 weeks ago, and each day it keeps getting better.</li>
            <li> totally worth the 18 bucks.</li>
            <li> For me, it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> : I would say to give it a try and see for yourself since its much more cost efficient then going to spas as I have in the past!It does make ur skin feel nice and smooth but the peeling part sucks.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to use lots of moisturizer and try to use something all natural.</li>
            <li> I was peeling around the edge of my nose &amp; it was kind of gross</li>
            <li> I had kind of given up hope for any topical treatments!</li>
            <li> Worth</li>
            <li> I am only on level one, but if I am seeing this kind of results I can&#x27;t wait to work my way</li>
            <li> Definitely worth what you pay.</li>
            <li> If nothing else, the salicylic for spot treatments alone is worth it.  </li>
            <li> , I thought I would be a part of the 90% success story I found on Amazon .  </li>
            <li> Your skin will be sensitive and red immediately after use and will then become flaky (using a moisturizer helps greatly but will not prevent this).  </li>
            <li> Ok I just just this on Monday March 23, and belive me this product so far what it did</li>
            <li> This was kind of my last test on trying to correct my face.</li>
            <li> It might seem like I have a lot of qualifires, but I do believe this product to be worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> So in desperation, I&#x27;ve decided I need to start my skin over fresh.</li>
            <li> As the directions instructed, the first time I tried the full face peel, I kept it on for one minute</li>
            <li> Ever since then, I haven&#x27;t been able to completely control my acne.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try if you suffer from acne.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better and been so clear.  </li>
            <li> Still, worth a shot.</li>
            <li> but I think the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> , i have rarely acne</li>
            <li> so definitely  it worth to try it.    </li>
            <li> I have had breakouts for most of my adult life.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s seriously powerful stuff.  </li>
            <li> but I believe it&#x27;s worth it for the end result.</li>
            <li> The feeling I had around my nostrils (the most sensitive part of my face) caused me to remove it.</li>
            <li> I KNOW that the peel was effective even in that short of a dose.  </li>
            <li> However, it worked better for me when I just applied it directly on my skin.    </li>
            <li> and my face is clear for the most part.</li>
            <li> a treatment so simple could be so effective (for periodic cystic acne on cheeks).  </li>
            <li> I gave up on any kind of help from the medical professionals and started reading up on what alleviates acne.  </li>
            <li> I honestly cant imagine my life without these peels now, i&#x27;m totally smitten.</li>
            <li> My son and I both have used this peel many times, and it really didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference for either of us.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the peels purchased and used by Skin Obsession, this just wasn&#x27;t worth the time or money.</li>
            <li> My face was much more sensitive</li>
            <li> I Liked the effects from the initial couple of peels.</li>
            <li> I felt it wasn&#x27;t worth the side effects to continue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using a brush, cotton pads, cotton balls, and finally decided that my own fingers work best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, my skin looks the same.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve implemented Zinc Supplements &amp; Flaxseed (fresh ground or oil</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 months now and my skin feels so soft and looks more radiant.</li>
            <li> If you can handle the tingling/burning sensation, it really is worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already noticing that my acne scars are fading and my skin appears more clear and toned.</li>
            <li> But for the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth the try.  </li>
            <li> after reading the reviews on this product i felt as if it was worth a buy.</li>
            <li> The peeling stays close to skin and is never flaky, it kind of reminds me of the texture of a peel off mask, but to a lesser degree.  </li>
            <li> laugh lines were yellowish brown and my chin and the area around my lips and nose were brown.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have found that as long as I followed a lengthy routine of exfoliating, stridex pads, and then benzoyl peroxide it help me pretty good</li>
            <li> I have happy, clear, refined skin, FINALLY!</li>
            <li> so I dont have wrinkles just lines from my smile</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am so pleased I found an economical option to the spa-grade treatments.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I used it because my face is soooooooo oily, but no breakouts except rare cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> WOW EVEN BETTER.</li>
            <li> A some burn is good because it&#x27;s actually removing your dead skin which of course doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li> I rarely make it through 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> , this product is absolutely worth the $$.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s RARE for me to get cystic acne</li>
            <li> Yes, it does sting, but its worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Ive gotton a peel done for $50 at a place</li>
            <li> It worked very quickly(a week or so), and should work great for anyone with any rough skin/callus/wart type issues.</li>
            <li> Given its price, it’s certainly worth a shot for those who have tried everything else without success.</li>
            <li> Your skin will be far more sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The moisturizer with SPF 30 is worth using even if you don&#x27;t think that it is needed.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the effort.</li>
            <li> IF I DIDN&#x27;T HAVE DONE SO MANY OF THEM OVER THE YEARS, DONE BY PROFESSIONAL.</li>
            <li> (I rarely go over that amount of time because of what&#x27;s happened when I do).</li>
            <li> Its definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> $16 is a worth try.</li>
            <li> I smile</li>
            <li> I can tell everyone from my own experience with acne that the only products that work for me are the prescription ones with sulfur in them</li>
            <li> So, buy it, its so worth it</li>
            <li> in photoshoots, i have perfect skin and don&#x27;t have to wear a bunch of makeup to cover up and make the acne worse.</li>
            <li> This is definatly worth a buy.</li>
            <li> I think if I keep using it twice a week, I will see more results and the bumps will completely clear.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Ok for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t look oily after it has been absorbed).</li>
            <li> I have had to use this product more frequently than the instructions in order to achieve desired effect.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> is worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but had to for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Try this, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gotten more sensitive.</li>
            <li> Have tried a popular \\&quot;by mail\\&quot; acne treatment that includes several steps that did not help a bit.</li>
            <li> and obviously no results.&lt;br /&gt;I am kind of in shock about how this product, if anything, isn&#x27;t for beginners, but for me is like putting water on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> did talk to my esthetician about this product and she highly recommends it but stresses the importance of going easy.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt/feels and looks very smooth, clean, brighter and tighter than prior to using (experience after using both peels).</li>
            <li> At first, it stung so much but now, I can handle the max amount of time easily.</li>
            <li> It works better than most other acne products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> first time you use this product if you can manage 2 minutes you are a super hero.  </li>
            <li> I am 32 and have had consistent mild acne since I was 11</li>
            <li> used it 3 times with Neutralizer skin pH balancer and Iam pregnant in  the first month, now I am freaking out</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit strong for normal skin..</li>
            <li> really helped clean my pores and gave my face a nice overall glow.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough to do the job, but not so strong that it leaves me in pain or with rashes.  </li>
            <li> This chemical peel is a remarkable product that is worth the time, money and a little pain.</li>
            <li> I due recommend using a good moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> Great product, my breakouts have really diminished and i&#x27;m only on my second application, comes with full instructions and works greeeeat!</li>
            <li> Before buying this product, I read the reviews and the impression I got was that it was really good but can be risky due to its potency.</li>
            <li> Well first time is definitely that the most comfortable.</li>
            <li> After I would apply it, my whole face would start rapidly heating up and it is a bit to endure, but the results are well worth it!</li>
            <li> You will turn heads again--but for the right reasons.</li>
            <li> My sister is trying it right now.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my face right away.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see or feel any results right away</li>
            <li> but it did bring some yuckiness to the surface right away....</li>
            <li> Right away I could see the difference.  </li>
            <li> I still have persistent acne on my right cheek</li>
            <li> right now all the breakouts are drying and clearing away.   </li>
            <li> i ordered it and began using it right away.</li>
            <li> Acne and blackheads were greatly diminished with the first use, fine lines were less noticeable, sun spots faded, and skin texture was more smooth and firm.</li>
            <li> But, right away i saw my skin getting firmer and clearer.</li>
            <li> I noticed results right away.</li>
            <li> If you apply this on the right schedule your skin will look fab.</li>
            <li> The scar area is about to fall off right now.</li>
            <li> right -</li>
            <li> You can get the jojoba oil right here on Amazon too.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t include the right directions to remove it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it right after you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> you can tell it&#x27;s working right away.  </li>
            <li> If I have a pimple coming on, this will either immediately reduce the size and redness or bring the infection right to the surface so that I may extract it.  </li>
            <li> tried this as a way to even out my tone, but right before I received the product I got an episode of cysts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> problem I&#x27;m trying to solve with this peel is scarring on the sides of my face and these bumps on my right jawline that I think are dormant cystic acne lesions.</li>
            <li> However, I continued to apply onto my nose and then to my right chin.  </li>
            <li> I use neutrogena wrinkle repair, it is not greasy and leaves just the right amount of moisturizer without leaving my oily skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> and they answered me right away.  </li>
            <li> and I must say I have seen positive changes!</li>
            <li> My mother and friend have bought this product and are seeing the positive change in their skin too!</li>
            <li> No matter how long you leave it on, immediately, your skin feels softer and more smooth and it just appears tighter.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m cheap, I buy a lot of things but don&#x27;t spend much ;-))</li>
            <li> I have used Salicylic Acid peels in the past with great success.  </li>
            <li> :P All the review kinda made me think there was going to be some instant action.</li>
            <li> and I noticed considerable stinging in the exact locations where my pores were largest and most clogged - nose, cheeks, chin and part of my forehead.</li>
            <li> Since my skin had never had a peel applied to it before the salicylic acid kind of stung and made my face red at first.  </li>
            <li> For those who know what they&#x27;re doing and have used active treatments before, this is a great weekly peel to keep major acne outbreaks at bay and smooth out the skin&#x27;s surface.     </li>
            <li> I never had a lot of acne, but I have a lot of white heads just under the skin that got infected very easy.</li>
            <li> Its very strong so you may want to start out only using once a week and then gradually work your way to 2 to 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> However, this is very strong, and I could put it on my face only for 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> After only 30 seconds on my face, I knew it was a VERY strong acid.</li>
            <li> She also explained that salicylic acid is highly effective in a high enough concentration to actually clean out the lining of the pores.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you add a little vaseline to your moisturizer, your skin will be amazing in the morning (no dryness and no pimples)!</li>
            <li> I now have about one breakout a month and the majority of my face now has very large, clogged pores.</li>
            <li> and I have what most people would consider mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li> I just make sure I use a heavier moisturizer on that day and night, and I exfoliate with a facial sponge and that takes care of it quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have ever used with success.      </li>
            <li> Rinse very well with cool water and apply the lotion they suggest.</li>
            <li> Before I applied the peel, I washed my face with a gentle cleanser using warm/hot water and rinse in cool water.</li>
            <li> The great results outweigh this one small downside.</li>
            <li> I make sure to start with the forehead, then to my chin, upper lip, then my checks as that is the most sensitive for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any excessive dryness or redness.  </li>
            <li> It is a normal looking nose as smooth as you would expect for someone my age if not smoother.</li>
            <li> My scars from years from the acne are lighter and I see my pores in a better shape and in general my face has been behaving like never.</li>
            <li> For any skin issue, removing a top layer, or exfoliating is generally the procedure.  </li>
            <li> I think it was great for me to start out with a small concentration.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it isn&#x27;t white colored (like the kind you buy in the local drugstore!)</li>
            <li> I now use this once or twice a week for just a few mins at a time and then follow with a benzoyl peroxide cream at night, which I use most nights and a light oil free moisturiser.  </li>
            <li> and i saw my large pores shrunk tremendously</li>
            <li> and I seem to be doing fine so far!      </li>
            <li> However, at the first try, I felt a burning sensation right after application.  </li>
            <li> A great overall facial skin problem solver.</li>
            <li> It is dries out easily and is naturally oily.  </li>
            <li> However, if you used this product and liked it lotsbut was then plagued by redness and dry skin</li>
            <li> I use a brush to put it on as a cottonball soaked up to much into itself and didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting an adequate amount on my face.</li>
            <li> What did work- sticking with a gentle routine of cleaning with a mild ph cleaner and applying an oilfree lotion with 2% salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li> even more exciting knowing that that same peel would cost me upwards of $150 if I were to go to a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This is a far better value and really works, no frills.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the direction that come with the bottle, which I do not find effective enough, I experimented and it worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> After peeling, I have soft, smooth and fresh looking skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they charged me about 100 bucks for a peel and eventually they charged me less because the ladies there loved me.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I read around a lot before purchasing, so I had a mixture of baking soda and water ready.</li>
            <li> I had finally resigned myself to Acutane - this was my last attempt before going to the dermatologist to get started and it works GREAT.</li>
            <li> I did my 3rd peel last night and this time i tried to brave it out and applied it for 2.5 mins</li>
            <li> I USE St. Ives Facial Moisturizer, Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin on my face and neck - layering more under my eyes and on my laugh</li>
            <li> skin is very sensitive to sunscreen, and it&#x27;s important to apply sunscreen after using this peel.  </li>
            <li> kind of wish I started with a stronger concentration as funds are limited</li>
            <li> Enjoy your clear skin!</li>
            <li> It does burn the first few times but you tolerate it more and more.</li>
            <li> Generally the more melanin in your skin the more likely you are to scar.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve notice that as long as I get regular facials with someone who is Good with extractions and follow up with a light peel, my skin clears up.</li>
            <li> The seller ships very fast.  </li>
            <li> let you know in couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Sunday april 8, its about 3 weeks using the product need to tell you my skin feel much smoother than before, it help me with my breakouts still got some of them but not like before, it also help me with some dark spots, so far happy and cant wait to see full results.</li>
            <li> I have had very fast results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am beginning to doubt this product very much.</li>
            <li> do recommend this product and think the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Immediately I had glowing skin - it definitely faded some very light scarring on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> what i order ty and was very fast and shipped was what i wanted  ty</li>
            <li> These are personal details but very important when using this product.</li>
            <li> Normally, doing this to your skin would result in waking up with a break out, but since your pores are so clean after the peel, I&#x27;ve found that they do not get clogged even when I rub oil into them.</li>
            <li> Be sure to put on sunscreen and moisturister to protect the young skin, especially under strong sun.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about trying this product (I&#x27;m in my mid twenties and am starting to notice early signs of aging skin, despite taking good care of my face and staying out of the sun).</li>
            <li> I use retin-a and still get acne though not nearly as bad as when I was in high</li>
            <li> Most of the clogging is gone, I don&#x27;t feel the little bumps under my skin any more and my skin is much smoother.</li>
            <li> Once the toner had absorbed, I took a cotton ball and quickly applied the salicylic acid (don&#x27;t get too close to the sensitive areas underneath your eyes!)</li>
            <li> It has helped tremendously with new acne outbreaks!</li>
            <li> It is amazing what this stuff can do just be careful.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> I applied the first treatment for 2 minutes, it had started to sting a bit at about the 2 minute mark</li>
            <li> but i was sceptical at first because i understand that Salicylic Acid is not for everyone</li>
            <li> Apply a moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 30 or higher.   </li>
            <li> , I mosturize, I tried many different exfoliants...</li>
            <li> :) My skin is back to how it once was, pre-mid-twenties.</li>
            <li> Noticeable improvement with first use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wear make up anymore to feel pretty,</li>
            <li> I really hope you try this product!</li>
            <li> I have used so many products to try to control my acne (moderate) but nothing until this has come</li>
            <li> exactly_ like this product.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast too!</li>
            <li> When I saw the Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel on Amazon.com, I was reluctant at first.</li>
            <li> I guarantee you the results will be evident almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t advise anyone to stay away from the product as it obviously worked for many people.</li>
            <li> If you are considering one of those acne programs like Proactive or Murad, please try this first.</li>
            <li> I tried this salicylic acid peel for the first time, and noticed almost immediate results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone, then I&#x27;ll probably try the Glycolic or maybe a combo-peel once I feel confident enough to do</li>
            <li> I am amazed this addressed so many different problem areas on my face.  </li>
            <li> But i suggest follow their instructions first before adjusting it.</li>
            <li> I started first using this product with a moisturizer</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to first time chem peel users.</li>
            <li> For the first time, acne is resolved (I have used the peel once a week for about six weeks).  </li>
            <li> Acne will worsen after the first treatment - wait it out - it will improve Dramatically.</li>
            <li> Forehead &amp; Chin first before i proceed.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m really optimistic!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I literally felt like the skin was burning off my face.  </li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t stand the pain and can only tolerate a minute or two the first couple times you use this product you will still see outstanding results.  </li>
            <li> I found it thanks to this peel!</li>
            <li> The first time, I used a gel (Neutrogen Grapefruit \\&quot;something\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> The first time I used this peel, I felt my face was burnt.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly, and used witch hazel as my toner as recommended.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time.  </li>
            <li> I had lost hope of having pretty skin and was just depending on make-up to cover the acne.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I followed the instructions to the letter, I washed my face with Cetaphil soap, used a toner, and then the peel.  </li>
            <li> After the third or fourth peel, I finally saw a glimpse of the beautiful skin I once had!</li>
            <li> The product does state that it will not always get immediate results and that it make take up to 8th or 9th peels before real results are shown!      </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a peeling the way I used to peel when I first started using Retin-A.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to magically eliminate all of the spots that the acnes have left on my face, but I expect a gradual change.</li>
            <li> will absolutely continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> Considering this is the first time I have ever had an chemical peel on my face professional/unprofessional I decided to pick one of the lowest chemicals, being this 20% peel.</li>
            <li> So the first day I applied the peel was a Sunday.</li>
            <li> I guess my pores have gotten smaller, skin softer, and it is a bit more \\&quot;glowy\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Proactiv was the best treatment I used, but for a college student, it was expensive to keep up with.</li>
            <li> and I need a better facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> the first time I used it on myself, but that also diminished with every use.  </li>
            <li> The first time I applied it with a brush</li>
            <li> Overall, I will follow instructions more closely and not try to rush the re-growth.  </li>
            <li> , I know exactly how you feel.</li>
            <li> The first day I got it, I used it for two consecutive days.  </li>
            <li> There was quite a bit of peeling on my nose after the first couple uses</li>
            <li> I prefer this over higher strength peels.</li>
            <li> Overall seems like a safe adjuvant to home acne treatment.</li>
            <li> I have pretty oily skin</li>
            <li> I used the Salicylic first because it was a Saturday</li>
            <li> Today when I applied the combo peel I applied all over my face without putting it around my nostrils and left the peel on for 3 times longer than I was able to leave it on around my nose.  </li>
            <li> so just try it out the first time and wash it all off as soon as one area has been stinging for a couple of seconds.  </li>
            <li> had it not been my first use of it.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t pair it up with the glycolic nor the BP.  </li>
            <li> The first 2 days i can see my face getting ready to peel and the 3-5th day its peeling a lot and its worth it...</li>
            <li> will definitely continue to buy more of this supplier&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once a week for three weeks, and it definitely helps my skin, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it more than once in a week.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> Honestly, it does peel some skin off the scar, but the scar never really goes away.  </li>
            <li> At first I tried to follow the instruction to apply the acid on cosmetic pad</li>
            <li> This works really well for breakouts!</li>
            <li> and I recomend it if its your first time undergoing a glycolic acid treatment.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> However, I read some reviews and they stated that the reason it broke out was because it was bringing my future breakouts up top.</li>
            <li> At first it peeled and flaked my skin.  </li>
            <li> The first application had a burning sensation on my face.  </li>
            <li> It has been a real life saver for me!</li>
            <li> The first time I put it on 8 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have some raised scarring that is fading also for the first time from these peels.  </li>
            <li> You can only use this product at MOST every 5 days, I would recommend once per week.  </li>
            <li> I am a caramel complexion (like Tyra Banks), my first peel ever was the Skin</li>
            <li> The first peel stayed on for 1 minute</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a relief to have finally found a product that can really penetrate pores and deliver a great result.</li>
            <li> This item did not cause the skin to peel, and we followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> I had a pretty oily skin, thus i used once every two days.</li>
            <li> thanks mom!)</li>
            <li> Just be aware.</li>
            <li> I have to buy more actually.</li>
            <li> I used this product exactly as instructed when it came.</li>
            <li> On top of the acne, my skin was red around my nose and my mouth.  </li>
            <li> advice is to use this if you have used a peel in the past and are looking to step up to a more potent peel.</li>
            <li> made simple and the Microdelivery Exfoliating wash my skin looks better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> did NOT see results the first time I used this though.</li>
            <li> Product works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I broke out at first</li>
            <li> After meeting with an esthetician who suggested I spend $980 on Obagi &amp; an additional $500 on chemical peels, I thought I&#x27;d try this peel first.</li>
            <li> And if it&#x27;s ok to use the facial wash brush like Clairsnic  mia the day after using the Salicylic peel?</li>
            <li> Thanks for sharing!</li>
            <li> Even till this day, it stings for the first 5 minutes and my skin has not gotten used to the harshness, but I continue to apply it.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions closely, 1 minute for the first time and gradually increasing until 8 minutes every application.</li>
            <li> I saw results after the first use.</li>
            <li> Moderate to servere acne getting better.</li>
            <li> My acne is better and my pores are smaller.</li>
            <li> First, I have to tell you about my skin.</li>
            <li> The first treatment was 5 minutes</li>
            <li> Yes, it burns like hell at first, but I think it&#x27;s not unbearable</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week and the first bottle I used got me 15 uses (</li>
            <li> &amp; then I apply my skin lotion on top of my entire face.  </li>
            <li> it hurts so much!  </li>
            <li> I forgot all about it until recently many years later, I am getting age spots.  </li>
            <li> My skin is clear and acne free.  </li>
            <li> I was nervous when I first applied this peel, I thought I was going to burn my face off.</li>
            <li> So for my first time I set the timer for one minute after I applied the peel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly how to describe it.</li>
            <li> My acne has not diminished entirely, but I would say it has gotten better.</li>
            <li> My face is smoother, my scaring is DEFINITELY smaller, and most of my acne is going away.</li>
            <li> but the skin is beginning to look tighter and more youthful with smaller pores.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the a Neutralizer skin pH balancer as it most definitely helps with calming the skin post</li>
            <li> I was only able to tolerate the salicylic for about 2.5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I figured the improvements I saw the first day would be the extent of it&#x27;s power.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a first.  </li>
            <li> It burns for the first 5 min &amp; then subsides after.</li>
            <li> My first time, I could only bear it for around 5 minutes, but I feel like that was mostly hype built up from knowing that it was going to sting.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wind up peeling any more than I would have if I left it on for 5 minutes, but that is just my experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes me look younger for sure..</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue the application, but with the stronger dose next time.</li>
            <li> (I did try keeping it on for 10mins for the first time and nothing happened).</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just the first time</li>
            <li> first time, it was burning after 30-seconds</li>
            <li> after the first use, we saw a difference.</li>
            <li> This was the first strength peel I started started out with.  </li>
            <li> Rather than go to a stronger solution, I think regular, consistent use of a milder solution is better long-term.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have a reasonably healthy diet and daily exercise.</li>
            <li> and I can get rid of/prevent more acne with the solution if I feel a problem area starting.  </li>
            <li> So, I ordered this and Glycolic Acid and got them the first of August.</li>
            <li> First the results on the nose.</li>
            <li> Here is exactly what I did.</li>
            <li> It works, and it works pretty well, but it&#x27;s not a miracle product.</li>
            <li> I might move up to a higher acid concentration and see how that works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it works better next time.</li>
            <li> burns.works pretty well.using it as spot treatment instead of a mask</li>
            <li> The tattoo is getting lighter but you need to be consistent.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does reduce pore size if used consistently.</li>
            <li> and she says NEVER use higher then 2%.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user, you can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll tell you why: BHAs are different in the fact that they go DEEPER into your pores than AHAs, because they dissolve oil (they LOVE that stuff).  </li>
            <li> Although this product scared me at first and can be quite drying, it still deserves all 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> After my first time using it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first peel and have been using it for a couple months.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve bought tons of items on amazon and this is my first review.  </li>
            <li> ;)    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I finally found something that works!!</li>
            <li> So while it felt hot while it was on, it didn&#x27;t result in any peeling.</li>
            <li> Finally, although many reviewers seemed to be concerned that it doesn&#x27;t come with a PH neutralizer, according to my doctor PH neutralizer (like baking soda) is optional.</li>
            <li> I saw drastic results after the first treatment.</li>
            <li> and I stay away from the sun as much as possible, my face can take more.</li>
            <li> I started noticing more visible sunspots on my cheek in the last 6 months albeit the fact that I do have a beauty regimen and moisturize with spf 30</li>
            <li> followed the instructions exactly as recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I left the product on for more then 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> If you leave it on for more than 60 seconds or you don&#x27;t fully wash off the peel, your face will become red and irritated.  </li>
            <li> (large recurring zits right before my monthly cycle).</li>
            <li> If you have some spare cash then definitely try this :)</li>
            <li> My face is always oily and feels hot.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Years of Accutane and prescription medication obviously did nothing, so what&#x27;s one more try?</li>
            <li> It seemed to be working better as a spot treatment than an overall mask.</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;ve only used this product for two days</li>
            <li> or so I noticed the top layer of my skin was starting to peel.</li>
            <li> the most they&#x27;ll give me are antibiotics that only upset my stomach.</li>
            <li> I first got it I was using the peel once a week for fear</li>
            <li> I caution everyone because this product should be used EXACTLY as directed, and everyone should try a test spot first.  </li>
            <li> have been consistently using once a week for about two months now</li>
            <li> skin definitely looks way brighter and clearer with this though :)</li>
            <li> and my face does not get irritated (unlike the first week).   </li>
            <li> The first day you try it for the first time, try focusing on that one pimple on your face (day-by-day for 5 days)...</li>
            <li> They seem to work at first</li>
            <li> HAVE A FAN CLOSE BY AND WATCH YOUR SKIN TO BE SURE IS NOT ACTUALLY BURNING.</li>
            <li> Be sure to do it well in advance of a big day.</li>
            <li> I put it on my forehead first, then wait 2-3 minutes to apply to the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li> I saw reslults after the first use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely way, way more than just 10 peels.</li>
            <li> The first time I saw my face brighten and lighten up.</li>
            <li> I just got done using this peel, following top commenter Elane&#x27;s steps 1 - 8.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> If you like pain and love looking red for a day then this is for you</li>
            <li> First let me say I just did my first peel about 20 minutes ago</li>
            <li> I will update more later.</li>
            <li> So, decided to take my chances with extraction again and was able to squeeze a bit out and use a pair of tweezers to pull the entire comodone out.</li>
            <li> My crater scars are much better and my skintone is brightened and air brushed.</li>
            <li> A lot of people recommended a neutralizer to use after the peel, but I think, start off with the peel and see how your skin reacts to it first.</li>
            <li> As i continued using this product and my tolerance level became longer, i noticed that i was not peeling as i did with first application and my cheeks are the problem areas with spots scattered about.</li>
            <li> and while I noticed some frosting on her back - she still has not peeled and she started breaking out more.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> Maybe I was just living in a cave for too long, but I didn&#x27;t know how effective these peels really are.</li>
            <li> This is potent enough.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had tried salicylic acid sooner!</li>
            <li> started breaking out in pimples for first time since I was 14&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am applying that first, then Polysporin then Cetaphyl.  </li>
            <li> First, let me say, that I have acne (pink/red) marks on my skin from pimples.</li>
            <li> My face (except for maybe my cheeck-bones) feels ok with this product on, especially my forehead and neck.</li>
            <li> I purchased some witch hazel and cotton balls and always  use that first.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought a salicylc acid</li>
            <li> I will submit more information of the effect of this product later.</li>
            <li> so it only looks marginally better immediately after the peel.</li>
            <li> Since the first day i applied it with cotton swabs</li>
            <li> I read another review that stated to use a baking soda and water paste to neutralize, which works really well!  </li>
            <li> The next time I just did it on the spots where the acne scars were and that seemed to work a lot better for me.  </li>
            <li> never before written a review on Amazon, but was so satisfied with product that I simply HAD to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> sure that you read the directions of the peel and use a toner beforehand to help open up your pores so the peel can dig deeper.</li>
            <li> Salicylic has many benefits described above.</li>
            <li> The problems went away and the texture of the sking is still getting better (pores are smaller).</li>
            <li> Wash your face first then follow with toner to remove excess oil which helps the peel to penetrate your pores.</li>
            <li> For up to 2 weeks after using the peel, there are no visible blackheads on my nose and my face is extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with moderate acne for many, many years starting when I was 13 or 14.  </li>
            <li> She is a chemist that actually designed products for many well known business out there.  </li>
            <li> It needs to be 2% or higher.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d spend a lot more in a med spa or a dermatologists office for the exact same product to use 1 to 3 times.</li>
            <li> The combination of these products are working wonders for my skin and would be my first recommendation for anyone with skin problems.</li>
            <li> i am wondering if i need the higher %...</li>
            <li> This product comes with clear and detailed instructions on how to use the same safely and efficaciously.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I saw a dermatologist, had microdermabrasion, and tried many different products,  Nothing truly worked.  </li>
            <li> And I think it actually makes me break out more than make my face</li>
            <li> Slow peel which is great to keep from irritation.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a chemical peel.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a chemical peel at home on myself.</li>
            <li> , i was immediately interested to try out this peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (The Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay is a clay mask and is best used with Apple Cider Vinegar, it helps extract all the impurities deep within the pores and it leaves your skin radiant and pore free.</li>
            <li> You have to follow the instructions and use it for a minute the first time then increase the time with each use.  </li>
            <li> *nothing* clears up my occasional breakouts better - or faster - than this product.</li>
            <li> Well, I really felt the sting on my face this time!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend seeking a dermatologist first before buying this product.</li>
            <li> Have a fan ready to reduce the sting - it is not unbearable, but it&#x27;s nice to cool the face down while waiting for it to work.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with the results but definitely test this product first to make sure it is safe for your skin and only use it on problem areas at the recommended every 3 days because I was using it over my entire face and noted some spots were getting dry.</li>
            <li> I am a black male, very fair skinned/light skinned.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t write reviews, but this product is totally worth it, first the shipping was super fast, I ordered it on April 29th  got it in the mail day before yesterday</li>
            <li> The sensation is pretty intense, however beauty hurts right?</li>
            <li> 2-3 months of derma roller plus copper at night, and a gentle peel every other morning, can literally remodel the scar and allow you to rebuild more normal, healthy skin in place of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve kept it on for the maximum 7 minutes every single time I&#x27;ve used it, even the first time, and that&#x27;s probably why I&#x27;ve had such great results</li>
            <li> The first time I let it sit on my face for a minute, then 2 minutes the next time, then became brave and left it on the full 8 minutes, which did seem to make me peel a little more.</li>
            <li> , that really dry part under nostril, around lips and chin, smile lines----dead skin peeled off to reveal healthy</li>
            <li> At first I tried the recommended of one application per week but apparently the solution is not as strong as some reviewers made it out to be.</li>
            <li> Does that mean using it once a week won&#x27;t give you great results?</li>
            <li> have been following the peel with Kiehl&#x27;s Midnight Recovery Concentrate (100% natural btw), followed by 100% pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum (also an AMAZING find on amazon that is powerfully hydrating).</li>
            <li> I saw improvements right away in how much smoother my skin looks.</li>
            <li> If I see any positive results after continuous use of this product, I will be sure to update my review to a proper rating.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the reduction in stress in my life, getting more adequate sleep, not being a teenager anymore, eating more fruit, or just the soap and always using clean cloths to wash, but I only get spot breakouts that are small and go away quickly, which I can live with.</li>
            <li> After all the dead skin fell off my face, I looked refreshing and the fine lines gone, however the brown spots from acne and sun were still there.</li>
            <li> The peeling is barely noticeable, and my skin looks so vibrant and healthy after each peel.</li>
            <li> I have been using every other night vs once ever week, and it is just amazing.</li>
            <li> when i first starting using it i couldn&#x27;t stand it for more than 1 min, now I can handle the whole 8 min.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT buy this product, it is not worth the chance of getting a chemical burn like so many reviewers have had!</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t even notice much peeling, but I realized that it was because I wasn&#x27;t putting very much on.</li>
            <li> Two days ago, I finally made it up to eight minutes, and my skin is peeling significantly today!</li>
            <li> I also have only experienced minimal flaking.</li>
            <li> , After 4 minutes I RAN to the sink and as I passed a mirror I was horrified to see a bright red \\&quot;goatee,&#x27; after a total face application.  </li>
            <li> Epiduo, Murad, Proactive, Clean and Clear, Neutrogena, Clearisil, EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel 10</li>
            <li> Perhaps the people giving this 5 stars are putting it on more frequently and for longer, but they have extraordinary tolerance (or fried facial nerves.)  </li>
            <li> BUT a majority of Salicylic acid peel users including my twin went through the same phase as i did before seeing great results, so i&#x27;m not disheartened by a few breakouts as it has shown a tremendous improvement on the size of my pores</li>
            <li> ahhhh...after the pain subsides your face will feel soft and soOo clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acne, I have a different skin condition, Keratosis pilaris, so I decided to give this a try, because as many have mentioned, for the price you really have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this will work long term or not, but, for now, it&#x27;s pretty fantastic!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve skipped this product for one two respective occasions and my skin simply did not look as good those weeks.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely a process to figure out what your sensitivity levels are, but I think it is certainly wise to start on the low end of peel intensity and work up from there.</li>
            <li> With more intense peels, you can only do them once every three weeks to a month, but with this peel you can do it weekly.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for several months and while I really wanted to love this product, It just doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if anything, this seemed to completely confuse my skin, throwing it completely out of wack and triggering more breakouts.  </li>
            <li> All in all, nothing to get scared of with the word &#x27;acid&#x27;; its pretty safe for use at home - just dont leave it on your face for too long.</li>
            <li> and it was more irritating than effective.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m trying to get back into the habit of using it regularly while trying to decide what a good frequency is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING too, and I was about to pay a lot of $$ to get a professional facial or see a dermatologist for some kind of help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To my surprise, I was able to handle it very well: ten minutes, twice a day.</li>
            <li> The larger and more defined scars, however are still visible and hasn&#x27;t changed much at all.</li>
            <li> I also have pretty oily skin, resulting in blackheads and large pores across my \\&quot;T zone\\&quot; area.</li>
            <li> I moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;After moisturizing obsessively for 3 days---it&#x27;s starting to patch and peel nicely to reveal fresh, smooth, even skin without dark blackheads and enlarged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It simply felt squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> i have 2 acne forming, acne free on my right face and two acne on my left face.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely the right fit for me.</li>
            <li> I got married last summer and my dermatologist gave me a VERY strong antibiotic to ensure that my face would be clear for my wedding.</li>
            <li> About a month and a half ago, I received this product by mail and relieved that I would get the beautiful skin I used to have when I was  back in my teens.  </li>
            <li> However, in the past I&#x27;ve found that a strong benzoyl peroxide, even though it burns, was better at treating my skin problems.)</li>
            <li> Some people have \\&quot;thiner\\&quot; skin layers and 20% may be too strong, especially if this is your First.</li>
            <li> I hope I continue to see positive results</li>
            <li> None positively impacted my skin and, in fact, the ointments irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this product so decided to try it.</li>
            <li> By the fifth day, I saw positive results.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the positive reviews about this product.  </li>
            <li> So far i can say that this really leaves your skin smooth and REALLY does shrink pores.</li>
            <li> but the description did say that the solution neutralizes on your face after 8 mins, so that explains why i was able to have it on for so long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39 &amp; have been suffering w/adult acne for way too long and have tried so many products.  </li>
            <li> When you first put it on you will feel an intense itching and/or burning.</li>
            <li> I was definitely very scared when I first did the peel.</li>
            <li> After 4 days whatever issues you had are pretty much gone.  </li>
            <li> These bumps would go from inflamed to non-inflamed, but pretty much never healed or went away; they are gone.</li>
            <li> Also, the processing was pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I was willing to spend so much money on it</li>
            <li> For the first two weeks, I wasn&#x27;t really hopeful.</li>
            <li> have to say, it REALLY does hurt/ burn the first time.</li>
            <li> really burns like hell when you first apply it; but</li>
            <li> The burning sensation while using the peel was more intense than from the day before, so only used it once and will most likely skip a treatment for day 3 and just use my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am used to the tingling, but those sensitive to the burn may find relief using a tabletop fan to cool the face.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I was a little weary at first, but the 20% solution has worked great for me so far!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in fine lines, but I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles anyway, and I don&#x27;t think it penetrated enough to help reduce acne redness, but since I&#x27;m not breaking out anymore that will help overall reduce acne redness.</li>
            <li> Note that I use to have super oily skin, plus i live in Singapore (a VERY HUMID country/environment)</li>
            <li> I am excited because I see amazing new skin emerging underneath, and at this point since I only have acne scars left, I am hoping to see them fade over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also starting to see my first fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> If you manage that much without crying you have exceptional tear ducts and/or pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I stuck with it, because the first few times, I just got some mild exfoliation from it.</li>
            <li> Throughout high school, I had problematic skin but most of my pimples were tiny pimples spread out on my forehead, temples, side of cheeks, and chin.  </li>
            <li> The problem with most products is that they don&#x27;t have a high enough concentration of salicylic acid to do this.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to use moisturizer because it will leave your skin feeling dry and flaky for about a week.</li>
            <li> I have a combo skin type but more on the dry side</li>
            <li> Acne shrunks quickly and old scars diminished.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t peel my skin, or clear my spots, luckily I didn&#x27;t get any redness or irritation.</li>
            <li> But all of this is better than the red bumpy scabby normal stuff that I lived with on a day to day basis.  </li>
            <li> This only lasted for a day and was very mild.  </li>
            <li> This chemical which is extracted from a plant hormone does tend to dry out most skin types.  </li>
            <li> after a months use the tone of my complexion is around 95% improved, it&#x27;s smooth with no redness, no itchiness and no dry scaly patches (from rosacea).</li>
            <li> It can make the peel sting a bit more if your face is really dry, so use discretion when choosing to apply a toner.</li>
            <li> Then i wondered if I could get those kind of results for less</li>
            <li> I rinsed for a minute or two, making sure to be 100% thorough, then followed the directions by patting dry with a cotton pad and applying Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> so much so that i&#x27;ve pretty much stopped using anything else.</li>
            <li> and I get big scars easily.</li>
            <li> have had mild adult acne for about a year now.  </li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive too.</li>
            <li> , however, I see no dramatic long-term improvement.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is as strong as the SA peels you get with a facial.  </li>
            <li> Every single day my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> so it certainly doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> unless you have an exceptionally large face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus the large pores I am plagued with are looking tighter/smaller already.</li>
            <li> I also have large pores on my  cheeks close to my nose.</li>
            <li> but i have large pores</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using large amounts for up to 7 minutes</li>
            <li> After a couple hours I put on Eucerin redness relief night cream, which is also a miracle worker if you have redness in certain areas of your face.  </li>
            <li> I have been blessed with large pores (</li>
            <li> I have large pores on my nose, chin and between eyebrows.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t do it all the time, just when a large blemish appears.  </li>
            <li> B004Z209HS Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil 4 fl.</li>
            <li> well, it&#x27;s pure oil (it feels like olive oil), so its like returning the oil to your face that you had stripped away (</li>
            <li> I had a blackhead above my eyebrow and after using this peel, it came right to the surface and came right out!</li>
            <li> When I was ready to remove the peel I rinsed my face with copious amounts of cool water and then patted my face dry with a clean towel.</li>
            <li> i cant wait for the full results :) finally something for aging skin that has teenage acne!</li>
            <li> have been using this for a few weeks now and LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I have so many scars from the acne and new acne continue to appear daily.</li>
            <li> Afterward, I enjoy smooth clearer skin and much less oil production.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my face, thus far have not exceeded 1 minute, once a week due to the intense \\&quot;tingle\\&quot;, &amp; it works for minimizing pores &amp; getting the top layer of dead skin off the surface (a nice, smooth feeling &amp; appearing result).  </li>
            <li> After 2 applications of the salicylic peel, I can completely see a difference - my face looks and feels smoother, I have no new acne and the acne scars are fading quite nicely.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no visible change in my skin, but it feels so much more soft and clean than with any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Some people might see the frosting right at the first time while others like me will see in few applications, that is because it is doing its job from top to bottom.</li>
            <li> I am starting to see the wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> My experience with this peel has been consistent with many of the other customer reviews.  </li>
            <li> It has also erased fine lines, extra plus.</li>
            <li> but it was fine the next week</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to use it until gone and then make a final decision on whether it has helped pore size, sun spots, fine wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin clear and smooth, and is mild enough to not need rinsing off.</li>
            <li> I probably wont purchase this particular peel again unless I go for a higher level.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with very high hopes.</li>
            <li> Overall I am impressed with this product because it helps clear my dead skin and regenerate new skin.   </li>
            <li> and I get dark spots very easily.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that the peel burns A LOT more when your skin is very dry when applying it.</li>
            <li> My routine starts with a double-cleanse; the first one to get rid of my make up, and the second to clean as if from scratch.</li>
            <li> Of course, before applying, you aren&#x27;t supposed to use micro-dermabrasion products and you&#x27;re supposed to have a very clean, dry face.</li>
            <li> I had pretty high hopes for this item</li>
            <li> If you have never done a peel at home, I highly recommend you start with the 20% and as your skin get use to it then move on to the higher concentration.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but this stuff was killer on my skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t very good at keeping up with these routines</li>
            <li> The only time I had any peeling was when I got a little peel happy and applied Alpha Hydroxy on off days.   </li>
            <li> The only thing I experienced was a little bit of stingy...</li>
            <li> If you want better results than last time (resulting in more peeling) you leave it one a little longer.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve got acne to loose! :)</li>
            <li> Like many of you, I&#x27;ve spent so much time, emotion, energy and money looking for something ...</li>
            <li> Not only has it cleared my skin and minimized my huge pores it also cleared up hyper-pigmentation from acne.</li>
            <li> Yes, I experienced peeling a few days later  4.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because they need to provide more instructions with how to use the product and if you aren&#x27;t careful, you can really burn yourself.</li>
            <li> so i called it then not knowing when to really stop</li>
            <li> I know it seems very enticing to buy a face peel, and use it at home without having to go to the derm.</li>
            <li> And for that I was already very grateful for.</li>
            <li> I did a couple times, I didn&#x27;t like the result too much.  </li>
            <li> THANKS FOR READING.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much clearer, smoother, and</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t break out that much...</li>
            <li> , I ordered the cellbone pH neutralizer along with it and they actually give a free 15ml sample of the glycolic 35% peel.</li>
            <li> and I finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.</li>
            <li> The peel itself made my skin smoother and diminished the size of my pores; I saw these results immediately, and received several compliments on how smooth my face looked.</li>
            <li> While I would recommend this to someone who wants smoother skin, I would not recommend it for clearing acne, as it seemed to aggravate my spots rather than soothe and exfoliate them.  </li>
            <li> it really didn&#x27;t burn at all</li>
            <li> it was more of a tingling  feeling it did crystalize some but not much in my opinion</li>
            <li> I followed directions and though it did sting for the 8 minutes you&#x27;re supposed to leave it on, I didn&#x27;t see much peeling after nor did I see any difference in my skin</li>
            <li> This stuff does tingle a bit, but very bearable.</li>
            <li> May buy this (in the 100 mL bottle) after i get rid of my red spots to maintain an acne free face.        </li>
            <li> and I really notice a difference in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> thats why i don&#x27;t know if this product is really working yet.</li>
            <li> it hurt so much.</li>
            <li> Ive tried a lot of products and this one didnt really work for me...</li>
            <li> I have zero blemishes thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> that was very drying &amp; the peel just aggravated that dryness.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really know what yo expect</li>
            <li> I had very oily skin and acne issues.  </li>
            <li> I have never seen results that work so fast in treatments.</li>
            <li> any suggestions would be much appreciated.</li>
            <li> The treatments really work, but if you haven&#x27;t built up your skin&#x27;s \\&quot;readiness\\&quot; with some home treatments, even over-the-counter acne washes with 2% salicylic, the burning this peel will produce will be too much for you.</li>
            <li> After just one use my acne scars were much lighter, and my skin felt like a babies.</li>
            <li> It really did work for me.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have used antibiotics a couple of times and that really seemed to help with the acne.  </li>
            <li> Skin really burned-</li>
            <li> Wash your face with a gentle cleanser, do not exfoliate.</li>
            <li> This stuff works fast.</li>
            <li> it worked really well.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> The itching/burning wasn&#x27;t as intense as I may make it seem.</li>
            <li> Pores don&#x27;t seem to have changed much.  </li>
            <li> Wash face really well, either with my SkinSonic or just in the shower</li>
            <li> then gently rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use Acne.org Treatment (a really gentle 2.5% benzoyl peroxide cream) every night as well.  </li>
            <li> This time I applied it with my fingertips and it didn&#x27;t sting much at all.</li>
            <li> and I could tolerate it for much longer than that,</li>
            <li> Shipping was also very timely.</li>
            <li> I do have lots of severe blackheads on my nose and chin, which is really why I bought this peel.</li>
            <li> In that case, I didn&#x27;t really want to leave the house for days.</li>
            <li> It works best on \\&quot;mild\\&quot; pimples, which is disappointing because I bought this hoping to reduce the appearance of what I like to call my monster pimples (cystic pimples).</li>
            <li> It was very embarrassing.</li>
            <li> By doing that I was able to keep the product on the rest of my face for a couple minutes with minimal discomfort.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t seem to have much effect on skin discoloratiom, I plan on purchasing the glyco/lax peel to take care of that.   </li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t really seen any difference..</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> This product is very helpful in both acne and acne scars.</li>
            <li> I have acne scars from years and years ago, and it&#x27;s really helped them fade away.</li>
            <li> product works really well</li>
            <li> so i can&#x27;t tell too much about this concern</li>
            <li> This way you will have a gauge for what areas to be most careful with.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of scarring and this helped so much.</li>
            <li> but once I apply the peel it starts to dissapear fast.</li>
            <li> I had gone to many different dermatologists and have done everything from being on birth control, taking antibiotics (which killed all the \\&quot;good bacteria\\&quot; in my body and left me with severe yeast infections), and even having a laser peel on my face.  </li>
            <li> My acne was very persistent, I felt hopeless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hoping the pimples will be gone soon...</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really shrink my pores</li>
            <li> it is intense.</li>
            <li> I know they are there because I analyze my skin too much</li>
            <li> , shipping was fast, I got it 3 days after I place my order.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had much of a need for a while.  </li>
            <li> Also, at this concentration, I don&#x27;t see the need to leave it on much longer.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> (you can also go to your local craft store and buy a cheap art brush in a size 10 or so or a fan brush.)</li>
            <li> Although I have very oily skin-I have needed both these things to combat the harshness of this</li>
            <li> If you really have an acne problem give this time be patient</li>
            <li> Not everyone will experience peeling all the time, and not that I really wanted that.  </li>
            <li> Burned a whole helluva lot though.</li>
            <li> have tried absolutely every skin product known to man (I am in my 30s and have had problem skin since I was in the 4th grade).</li>
            <li> and I was really looking forward to have my skin dramatically improved....</li>
            <li> so it did not bother me too much since i thought it&#x27;ll stop eventually</li>
            <li> I still have acne scars, which have not decreased AT ALL.</li>
            <li> and I cannot really determine its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> but I was very encouraged by all results so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition, this stuff can be very painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it has really, really helped.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use this as a peel.</li>
            <li> It has really made an improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> i really wish i had never used this product.</li>
            <li> I do so gently, and I dab the towel on my face</li>
            <li> and I really see a difference.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product to whom ever is reading this as well as my friends.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s something I really can&#x27;t control, but I had a 50$ gift card to Amazon and was determined to find SOMETHING to help.</li>
            <li> It does nothing, really.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 4 weeks now and waited to post my review as I wanted to see if it would really work/help.</li>
            <li> this is where I don&#x27;t so much like the product, I have been using it for 4 weeks</li>
            <li> The next morning my skin looked radiant and smooth.  </li>
            <li> used on my oldest daughter acne it works very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I have used another one much stronger than this</li>
            <li> and I was using this product as directed once every week, but it wasn&#x27;t doing much</li>
            <li> I read up on salicylic acid and for some it can make the skin shed so much</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, you can layer this on and it gets very intense.&lt;br</li>
            <li> someone with acne scars, I can say this has worked in a reasonable manner.</li>
            <li> It works but you need so much on your skin to work</li>
            <li> around the nose and mouth) stand with your face in front of a fan that helps, wash really well with water and then immediately use moisturizer and the burn goes away.</li>
            <li> I hopeI haven&#x27;t grossed you out too much</li>
            <li> This area improved so much that one day I went to apply the Salicylic</li>
            <li> THAT was very gratifying.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say how much it helped because I just got out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use on whole face.</li>
            <li> and it really works.  </li>
            <li> After a lot of research I started trying the lactic acid peels, which are very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> With Murad, no matter how much moisturizer I used, I still felt \\&quot;creaky.\\</li>
            <li> This chemical peel really is the real deal.</li>
            <li> so I have been subjected to \\&quot;the real</li>
            <li> Face feels so much smoother.</li>
            <li> I like that feeling; let&#x27;s me know its doing its job, haha.</li>
            <li> The results have been really satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I just got the bottle today and used it straight away.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really burn (but you could feel something).</li>
            <li> The one drawback: it is an extremely intense pain.</li>
            <li> Try use it like 2 days before going out so there isnt as much flaky skin.</li>
            <li> My 70 y/o skin does very well with this product</li>
            <li> I just wanted to let people know that if they don&#x27;t make it the whole 7 minutes, they do still get benefit.</li>
            <li> After much research online and deliberation I bought this product.</li>
            <li> - it is not as gentle as everyone states</li>
            <li> Work your way into this product, as it is very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel much stinging</li>
            <li> My skin is reacting very well to this medication.</li>
            <li> During this time i had gotten around 3 chemical peels through my dermatologist, which really didnt seem to do much for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually comfortable to go outside without any makeup</li>
            <li> This stuff really burns.</li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t give it 5 stars as of yet.</li>
            <li> but no worse then putting a liquid bandaid on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say how often you use it really depends on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I found it wasn&#x27;t a very controlled application-not something you want when dealing with acid.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> I used this product for 5 weeks, once a week, and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It is important to have control over where the gel is applied, and letting using your hands will likely lead to skin irritation and drying on your hands.  </li>
            <li> This product is really great.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I have also tried every brand of acne abrasive soap, gentle soap, scrub, toners, lifters, tighteners, clay masks, rubbery peel masks, over the counter pills...ect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a chemical peel at a spa and this peel burned much....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried blue light therapy, which is costly and results are not permanent.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, its really does work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on my whole face very often; I like to use it as a spot treatment.  </li>
            <li> so very</li>
            <li> Now, if you don&#x27;t get this stuff off fast it will start to burn.</li>
            <li> This stuff is intense.</li>
            <li> the reviews and figured I&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for 3 weeks before realizing that I shouldn&#x27;t really be putting myself through this.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work as a peel.</li>
            <li> (much safer)  </li>
            <li> , so I take some CeraVe lotion on a damp washcloth and gently rub in a circular motion all over my face.  </li>
            <li> light facial</li>
            <li> do NOT let the percentages deceive as to how much of a wallop these products pack when it comes to the \\&quot;tingling sensation\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Furthermore in order to sooth my skin every night after doing this I would slather it in Jojoba Oil and really rub it in like a gentle massage.</li>
            <li> I know however it takes about two weeks for your skin to purge itself when you start a skin regime that is as intense as this.</li>
            <li> Much of this is now gone.</li>
            <li> It really ruined my skin.</li>
            <li> very good)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sleep much</li>
            <li> will look much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will absolutely self-neutralize after anywhere from 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Considering how expensive most products are with salicylic acid, I think this is a great deal and can totally work for you.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice any difference except my skin feels \\&quot;tighter\\&quot; after I wash it off.  </li>
            <li> The skin around my nose is much thinner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s most noticeable in my forehead where the skin there is smoother and has minimal spots to begin</li>
            <li> and it really helps.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
            <li> but I felt very tightness and dryness around my nose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too much of a puss to handle the pain</li>
            <li> This really minimized that.  </li>
            <li> Talk about fast results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I stayed home for two weekends feeling like I got the plague, which made me very depressed.</li>
            <li> I find that products with Salicylic acid work very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I used this for 6 months weekly</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> It has really improved my skin.</li>
            <li> I am now ready to increase to the 30% solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really do recommend reading and adhering to the instructions that come with the bottle.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> This peel can be very drying</li>
            <li> The reviews on here really encouraged me to give this a try</li>
            <li> but it is much easier to extract after this peel.</li>
            <li> If you absolutely feel like you need a chemical peel, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This was really what I have been looking for it did the job...</li>
            <li> use a gentle cleanser with cucumber extract for my face wash &amp;#34;BRAND:</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> my son&#x27;s acne is a real problem.</li>
            <li> and I was very happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hurt a bit for the 1st time but was very tolerable afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my whole life</li>
            <li> The product is gentle on the skin if used according to the directions..</li>
            <li> My pores are nearly non-visible, my face is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> The first time, I left it on for 3 minutes and rinsed it off with cool water.</li>
            <li> I had some redness and peeling only on my most sensitive areas of my face about 36-48 hours after using the peel.</li>
            <li> In addition to this product, I washed my face with warm water to open up my pores and then I used Neutrogena&#x27;s pore refining toner to reduce the size of my pores and to clear old skin.  </li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on many products including proactive</li>
            <li> My face is almost completely clear most of the time, but recently I&#x27;ve been getting some pimples hear</li>
            <li> I sure appreciated that because I was curious about it.  </li>
            <li> After the first week i noticed i was breaking out with more than average acne in my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> Here is my own direction: I place a few drops of gel into my palm.</li>
            <li> In reviews people spoke of heavy peeling and nice skin tone after a while.</li>
            <li> I stopped going to the dermatologist a few years ago and have been trying to treat my skin problems on my own.  </li>
            <li> You will build resistance slowly and dont forget to wear good sunblock lotion.</li>
            <li> I have and my face felt like sand paper, get some good thick face cream.</li>
            <li> It had a mild tingle(after about 2 minutes when I&#x27;d rinse with cool water) and left my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this product, my forehead is clear!!!</li>
            <li> Make sure to apply a heavy moisturizer right after.</li>
            <li> And i do hope to see some improvement with preventing new acne or might have try a higher strength.</li>
            <li> FOR NEW PEELERS: If you are thinking that you might try a peel for the first time, I would like to encourage you to spend some time getting to understand how chemical peels work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see the long term effects of this product and as of right now, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read several that said the title of \\&quot;Peel\\&quot; was facetious as most people don&#x27;t actually notice any skin peeling; others said that the skin would peel the first 48 hours and then look so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got way more results than I expected!</li>
            <li> I am not saying it made my acne vanished, but it helped me way more that any other product that I have tried before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the first time in years, my face is clear and I am starting to enjoy not wearing make-up.  </li>
            <li> (This instant gratification alone makes it worth the price!)</li>
            <li> First, the bottle will last you much longer than you think, so the price is worth it.</li>
            <li> I did some research and believe I had a Copper/Zinc imbalance now for many years due to my Copper IUD.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go into details because you can find out more about it on other sites.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 6 times now, and I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement of my overall complexion.</li>
            <li> The first time, I left the product on for only a couple of minutes, as I was feeling a burning sensation mostly around my nose.</li>
            <li> My struggle with acne is much the same as everyone else&#x27;s-persistent acne that refuses to quit despite medication and special washes and creams like Proactiv and skin</li>
            <li> Pores are so much smaller, face is clean and radiant.</li>
            <li> My complexion is so many different shades that I could never leave the house bare faced.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m 26 and STILL have problems, mainly with clogged pores and what seems like too much oil production.  </li>
            <li> peculiar.&lt;br /&gt;i do my peel at night, starting with a clean face</li>
            <li> I use it in conjuction with herbal pills that support liver function &amp; help to clean the blood such as Murad clarifying pills.</li>
            <li> If your looking for the real deal this isn&#x27;t it, but it does a decent job if used correctly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product that will literally clean out your pores.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to try this along with switching to a more natural face wash and facial lotion and also using a very soft bristle</li>
            <li> was delightfully surprised that it is very gentle</li>
            <li> One VIPeel treatment cost me $375 and that was on special, 6 weeks later I did another VIP treatment, I saw no improvement in my skin</li>
            <li> So definitely don&#x27;t do this before a date or a special event!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So definitely don&#x27;t do this before a date or a special event!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For 2 days my face was severely red in those areas it looked like I got a black eye or a good beating.</li>
            <li> This peel, the Salicylic 20% is not as strong as the professional, but I have been getting similar results.  </li>
            <li> Initially, I saw no changes in the clearness of my skin and it actually made my skin very dry at first, then very oily even when using a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Red marks and scars on my cheeks with significantly lighter, skin looked even MORE radiant and all active blemishes were GONE!  </li>
            <li> As of today I have around a week and a half using the product and besides been excited from the prior reviews I am in love with it and the reaction of my face.</li>
            <li> Very clear instructions, cheap enough that even though it didn&#x27;t work for me, I don&#x27;t feel like I got ripped off!    </li>
            <li> As many other reviewers have mentioned, it normally worsens the breakout before it clears it up</li>
            <li> In the first month, I did not see clear changes.</li>
            <li> Even though my face is completely clear of blemishes, I still have to wear makeup because I just don&#x27;t have pretty skin.</li>
            <li> Even when my skin is pretty clear (for me)</li>
            <li> So I first purchased this product nearly a year ago.</li>
            <li> It burned and tingled with the first use, but I quickly developed a tolerance, so that I could leave it on way over 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Used the full 8 mins the next day, started to see improvements.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll check back in 6 weeks when I&#x27;ve had a series of mini peels for a full review.</li>
            <li> Okay so i have acne holes and dark brown spots from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> face first, then sensitive areas for reduced time.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have guessed properly exactly where my sensitive areas were before using the peel all over</li>
            <li> Proactiv and other topical medications are only programmed to be dissolved into the the epidermal tissue of the skin, so to me it makes more sense that by causing the outer skin layer to shed and be renovated, it will do a lot more (in terms of clearing skin and reducing pore size).  </li>
            <li> I then used cool water and nothing else and scrubbed my face using only my hands and within 30 seconds I found relief from the burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I look like a snake for the first 3-4 days after using the product.</li>
            <li> Even if a product took away many of the actual pimples i was still left with very bumpy skin.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on for only about 4 - 5 minutes before rinsing with copious amounts of cool water in the shower.</li>
            <li> works nicely for me and helps diminish small lines and crepe type wrinkles in my aging skin.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the results were pretty much the same as the first two weeks.</li>
            <li> I will change my rating to a 5 if I&#x27;m able to use Amby on my dark spots without reoccuring break outs.</li>
            <li> The next day, the true extent of the effects was seen (I think skin continued sloughing off throughout the night).</li>
            <li> First, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is not overly sensitive and if I left this product on for more than three or four minutes I was nearly in tears at the stinging and burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Definitely follow the instructions when they say to build up to the full amount of time this sits on your face.</li>
            <li> The neck, chest, hands and arms didn&#x27;t hurt a bit; left them on for the full eight min.  </li>
            <li> I had some frosting and moderate tingling, but not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> Its more like the itching you get in your feet while you&#x27;re driving, and you just can&#x27;t reach down to itch it</li>
            <li> It has definitely decreased the redness that comes with this, which is awesome because I&#x27;m not particularly fond of looking like I&#x27;m blushing all the time.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product and advise that you take it slow at first and DO NOT GIVE up on it, be consistent and safe.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to read the instructions carefully!!  </li>
            <li> If you only have slight acne or the occasional breakout this strength should work beautifully.</li>
            <li> (your skin will be a little red afterwards) and use a good moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> Color wise my skin tends to be a little reddish but overall</li>
            <li> With only 30 seconds, you cant expect much; my skin was a bit tight; when I woke up, it had a very even tone and looked lovely, which is a word I would rarely use to describe my skin</li>
            <li> After reading all these amazing reviews on this product and having no luck with getting rid of my past acne scars I went ahead and bought this with high hopes.</li>
            <li> Cannot tell if it will be effective on dark spots, not enough time, but I will use in future since I could feel the difference in how smooth my face feels.</li>
            <li> skin has gone from being rather unremarkable--you know, not bad enough to notice, but not good enough to notice either--to beautiful.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to see how it will be after a few more treatments, especially for my son.</li>
            <li> Really burns and you need to follow directions, but it does make your face shiny and new.</li>
            <li> My skin has a whole new look and feel after decades of severe acne.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes that this product will continue working and that I will be able to wear something other than turtlenecks all winter!</li>
            <li> question is, for the first time yesterday, I applied this under my eyes with a Q-tip on my fine lines and had to remove it immediately (about or less than a minute).</li>
            <li> This method also makes you use less solution so you will have more than the 15 applications that are in each bottle.</li>
            <li> tried antibacterial soap, more moisturizer, less moisturizer, sulphur soap, no soap, every facewash on the shelf.</li>
            <li> But it made my skin look better, less hyper-pigmented from all the sun-filled activities this summer.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to do it more often, on a routine basis to see it get less oily over time.</li>
            <li> Make sure your skin is hydrated before putting on the peel because it hurts much less then.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying this mainly for the discolorations and acne.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t leave the product on for more than 4 minutes yet the last and final time I did, the skin on my chin burned off leaving bruises.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from mild to moderate acne since my teens.  </li>
            <li> Where I was only having mild breakouts before, my face now resembles that of my acne scarred adolescence.</li>
            <li> My problem is the nose and chin, mainly the bottom portion of the nose.     </li>
            <li> I used to have a mild occasional acne problem</li>
            <li> I am pleased to say that after only one use, my acne is starting to fade.</li>
            <li> suddenly this year may be because I always stay up late and have great pressure(I have never had acne before).</li>
            <li> At first, I noticed that I did have more small pimples showing up on my nose within about 24 hours of using the acid.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, the bumps I mentioned earlier were now turning into pimples which were going away just as quickly as it would come.  </li>
            <li> For me this is much too frequent and I don&#x27;t feel that there is much benefit to using it this often.  </li>
            <li> After doing massive research, I decide to use a derma-roller, super cop 2x, and salicylic acid peels on the scar.</li>
            <li> I definately would recommend this if you have mild to moderate acne.  </li>
            <li> but this particular company is 100%.  </li>
            <li> but I decided it would be ok if I left it on my skin for ten minutes</li>
            <li> Better to be safe than sorry.</li>
            <li> I also get the classic outbreaks around my chin/mouth area and temples.</li>
            <li> but I mainly use the salicylic for spot treatments once a week</li>
            <li> It definitely burns when you put it on, so I&#x27;ve only been able to tolerate it for about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li> just make sure you remove the mask the second your face turns red and frosting begins.</li>
            <li> Works decently well, but takes a while.</li>
            <li> makes my face flakey red, and more prone to breakouts, especially not being in the sun, pool and tanned all the time.</li>
            <li> There are MANY treatments in one tiny bottle, so don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re \\&quot;wasting it\\&quot; with only one or two minute treatments.</li>
            <li> Think I got an older one.</li>
            <li> I currently only have 3-5 pimples on my face, all of which I&#x27;m confident will disappear in the next week or so.</li>
            <li> Now I feel like I got rip off all these years by paying a professional to do something as simple as a Light Peel.  </li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY, I&#x27;D NOT DARE TO DO THIS</li>
            <li> Would recommend because let&#x27;s face it, if you&#x27;re interested in a product like this, you will do anything to get rid of acne, including taking on some facial stinging ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping that it would help fade my sun spots and melasma, which is mainly on my forehead and under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was only able to tolerate it for a minute total.  </li>
            <li> This is the main ingredient in wart removers.</li>
            <li> Pores are getting smaller, skin overall looks better.</li>
            <li> know this is a long review, but I just had so much to say about this true miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> She knows what actually works and doesn&#x27;t work for many different skin types.  </li>
            <li> , overall I&#x27;m quiet satisfied with this peel.</li>
            <li> A lot of blackheads around nose and chin area is my main problem.  </li>
            <li> Your skin may peel a little bit after the first couple of times using it, but for the most part there will not be visible peeling (unless you have incredibly sensitive skin and/or have never used an exfoliant.</li>
            <li> Every single pore was clogged and I had huge pimples and marks galore.</li>
            <li> After the shower, I gently pat my face dry and apply Shikai Borage Oil Facial Moisturizer, which is very light, all-natural, and unscented.</li>
            <li> I will say that I&#x27;m glad I had a few professionally done first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest following the guidelines as suggested in the directions:  not leave on for more than 8 minutes although I think that would be much too long a time.  </li>
            <li> Finally, if it burns too much then rinse right away.</li>
            <li> My t-zone is more normal and less oily.</li>
            <li> Go easy on the first few applications.</li>
            <li> During this time, I felt such a strong sensation on my nose that I couldn&#x27;t bare.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got high expectation on this</li>
            <li> (one can of course buy a neutralizer if one is so inclined, but I highly recommend this step.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sheesh, this is long and I am aware my Process (if reading this out loud make sure to properly emphasize the P)</li>
            <li> I have a high pain tolerance (four kids...natural childbirth) but it does burn.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, just try it for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> and I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, but suggest you do a patch test and follow directions to avoid pain and embarrassment.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend both the product and the company.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend a Neutralizer if you are going to use this peel-</li>
            <li> , I still need a fan on high during application.</li>
            <li> If this works when I was in high school</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the jojoba oil in conjunction with this.</li>
            <li> In high school I used Retin-A and that was when the hyperpigmentation started.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have a high tolerance for pain</li>
            <li> highly suggest instead of buying a PH stabilizer, use baking soda.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> you are looking for noticable results and a stronger peel I highly recommend the TCA peel by Skin Laboratory.</li>
            <li> so my skin was not used to such a high concentration of salicylic acid, or any other kind of acid for that matter.  </li>
            <li> I still have some discoloring from past acne, but it covers easily with a light dusting of the Bare Minerals foundation I have been using for years.  </li>
            <li> My skin under my eyes were slightly pink and my fine lines now look like wrinkles!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was out in the sun for a little, and I could literally feel the sun beaming on my skin much more in the areas where I had applied the salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> For anyone out there who is considering having a iron mask forged to hide their adult acne, DON&#x27;T!!</li>
            <li> The skin around my pimples seemed to look a little bit better.</li>
            <li> many people pointed out, it did make my skin peel a little.</li>
            <li> but I do get MANY little clogged pores of both blackheads and whiteheads.  </li>
            <li> This product is extremely strong and extremely concentrated and thus must be used with high caution.  </li>
            <li> In addition to acne gel, I&#x27;ve tried facial cleaning product from Clean and Clear and the Walmart brand benzoyl peroxide cleaning pads.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple uses, I find my skin more firm and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Overall highly recommended and worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, so this was unexpected.</li>
            <li> I am a 43 year old Caucasian woman and have had acne my whole life.  </li>
            <li> My face has really started to clear up.</li>
            <li> This shocked me in a wonderful way, because this peel isn&#x27;t supposed to improve these things specifically.</li>
            <li> His skin looked rough before, but now it looks smooth.  </li>
            <li> One last thing I have to say is that this product is cheaper and more effective than the $500 laser treatment I paid for and all those doctor visits and useless prescriptions</li>
            <li> My skin in these areas was a light shade of pink after rinsing.     </li>
            <li> My skin is no longer the light shade of pink</li>
            <li> and my skin look so much smoother and clear.</li>
            <li> It has really helped to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to order this product after spending way too much money on professional chemical peels.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t turn very red at all when using this mask, and I really don&#x27;t feel irritation on my face; however, I decided the second time that I used the product to do my upper neck (under my chin) and that area of skin turned bright red for about a day.  </li>
            <li> I developed melasma about 5 years ago and tried TriLuma cream for a year or so, but it never did much for me.  </li>
            <li> , my skin looks much improved - clear with shrunken pores.  </li>
            <li> I have had problem skin for years, very oily and frequent break outs.</li>
            <li> The next day it was scabbed up, so I continued to use it and it peeled after about 2-3 days, and now I&#x27;m left with more natural looking skin.</li>
            <li> Most of my blemishes are starting to peel, which will leave behind newer, much better looking skin.</li>
            <li> My acne has been there for many years, so maybe it takes long to disappear entirely.</li>
            <li> At fist I thought it was just normal breakout.</li>
            <li> I am going to stick with this therapy for few more days till my skin becomes in tone with my neck.    </li>
            <li> I am going to order few more for my friends too.</li>
            <li> and I dont leave it on past 3 mins cuz the burn is more intense.</li>
            <li> After using the product a few more times, I can tolerate the stinging for longer now, I&#x27;m up to 3-4 minutes now.</li>
            <li> After this passes your skin will look and feel significantly better in every way for a few days until you use it again and the process repeats itself.  </li>
            <li> So I will be using this in conjuction with the peel until my skin returns to normal.</li>
            <li> Acne didn&#x27;t subside, it just carried on its normal routine.</li>
            <li> (tried this with just alcohol a few times and that adds more redness recovery time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did this one first, my skin is pretty tolerant to medications since I&#x27;ve had acne for so long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping after a few more treatments, they&#x27;ll be all gone.  </li>
            <li> I have a few tiny dent-type scars that blend into my smile lines mostly.</li>
            <li> It not only shortens the length of time I have acne, but keeps me from getting scarring and makes the overall condition of my skin far better.</li>
            <li> I applied the gel peel on top of the dried skin toner.    </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I followed the directions of keeping it on for only one minute (and building it a minute at a time each use) and I used it on my whole face.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin anyway, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised that this burned rather ferociously the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know for sure.  </li>
            <li> Around 21, my skin cleared up for the most part, though I&#x27;d get a few break outs around the week of menstruation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> time, along with the frosting, there were varying shades --the more dead skin you have, the browner</li>
            <li> On first use it can burn quite a bit, but after several uses you don&#x27;t notice it so much.</li>
            <li> You are pretty much making your skin naked to the atmosphere and the sun</li>
            <li> first time I used the salicylic acid peel, I followed the instructions and left it on only for a minute on only the areas with most breakouts.</li>
            <li> Stick with AHA and BHA at the most and heavily use sunscreen after that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One week I apply the salicylic acid peel and smear my face with Egyptian Magic for a few days while my skin recovers.</li>
            <li> At the moment I am doing a salicylic acid peel and use Egyptian magic for a few days until the peeling is over.</li>
            <li> Apply Egyptian Magic or coconut oil heavily.  </li>
            <li> Neutragena and Aveeno can burn my skin, so I normally use Vanicream sunscreen after this peel.  </li>
            <li> you save a lot of money and pretty much the same results.</li>
            <li> I ended up using an eye droppers to make sure I don&#x27;t waste any.</li>
            <li> off.&lt;br /&gt;- peeled off skin with my fingers, washed my face, and scrubbed more dead skin off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking at my skin this morning and almost cried because I never thought my skin would look so normal.</li>
            <li> think the reason that so many people on here have had unsatisfying results with this product is because they do not allow the peel to work on their skin long enough.</li>
            <li> Although this isn&#x27;t a very deep peel, it is a powerful product so use with caution and follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But too many years of using the Retin A started to create the problem of rosacea and was too harsh to use every night.  </li>
            <li> It is good, just a little makes skin dry.  </li>
            <li> Followed the process with a high SPF to protect the new me.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from acne since 8th grade, and am now about to graduate high school and made my New Year&#x27;s Resolution to get rid of my acne for college.</li>
            <li> BUT as I was watching it in action, I could see really old \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; zits coming to the surface!!!</li>
            <li> the dead skin started peeling off and there was new smooth pretty skin.</li>
            <li> The vitamins and minerals or whatevers in these pills makes my skin more even looking, and I haven&#x27;t even had any new zits in the past couple weeks which is unusual for me unfortantely.    </li>
            <li> It is not hard to use.  </li>
            <li> And the product shouldn&#x27;t be left on for more than 8-10 minutes, MUCH less at first.  </li>
            <li> I am a biracial (african american/korean) with oily, mild adult acne skin.  </li>
            <li> Washed my face with a mild cleanser (Cetaphil), dabbed my face with alcohol to remove excess oil, and then took vaseline and lined my mouth eyes, and near my nose to protect from potential chemical burns.</li>
            <li> I use step 8 to eliminate dry, flakey skin after a peel, but I have SUPER combination skin that is, at times in the same places, super oily and super dry</li>
            <li> However, these were small pimples and went away quickly and were not painful like cystic ones.  </li>
            <li> so it is easy to control the application and get the peel on evenly and fast to avoid an uneven result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it is easy to control the application and get the peel on evenly and fast to avoid an uneven result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time on my face, I did not do much, and I purged for two days with acne -- about a week later my skin was clear and a little more oily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many other products that have me applying and reapplying for 3 to 4 days with way worse results, so I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with this.</li>
            <li> I bought a Groupon recently for a salycilic peel (right before I bought this product).  </li>
            <li> I did another treatment right before bed to help with the peeling, and used a regular cream moisturizer afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I noticed some peeling on the left cheek and a lot of peeling on the right.</li>
            <li> The texture also appeared different right away, I will use this once a week for a month</li>
            <li> I had no problem applying it to my entire face right from the start.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t use it long because became pregnant and opted to stop for safety.</li>
            <li> I saw a dry piece of skin ready to fall off and it peeled right off along with the scar.  </li>
            <li> It really zaps blackheads like no other!</li>
            <li> and she told me to clean my face daily and just use the general acne treatment products</li>
            <li> It keeps in the fridge just fine and its nice and cold on my face after the peel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I read other peoples reviews and was excited but didnt clear up much</li>
            <li> I would suggest using it for only a few minutes at first to make sure your skin can handle it  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this product due to the high reviews.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad itch, it&#x27;s mild and wont last past the first day.</li>
            <li> If they did, new ones took their place.</li>
            <li> and I broke out with three new pimples.</li>
            <li> you WILL get new ones if you do.</li>
            <li> I notice spots on my face where my skin is peeling; bringing out new skin.  </li>
            <li> has helped keep my acne to about 1 eruption a week, where before I was getting one or two new pimple a day.</li>
            <li> Because I was new to the \\&quot;peel\\&quot; world, I let it sit for 3 minutes</li>
            <li> So I gave up and tried to embrace my new marks all over my face...</li>
            <li> If you suffer from hyperpigmentation, the shedding of the skin will eventually even out the spots as new layers of skin are generated.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this peel in a search for a new skincare product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what the new skin looks like</li>
            <li> Those are just my warnings to new users.</li>
            <li> I DID go to the dermatologist to help prevent new acne, which I learned I have cystic acne, plus OCD on picking at it.</li>
            <li> I remember some of the reviews describing the occurrence of the new pimples</li>
            <li> leave it on for the suggested five minutes if you are completely new to at home</li>
            <li> I cut out everything new I could think of that I&#x27;d added to my regime, anywhere from skin products, to vitamins to food.</li>
            <li> I help my skin heal by using hydrocortisone cream 2-3 times a day and this helps the skin peel itself to reveal your new, baby-soft skin underneath.  </li>
            <li> I use it often times when noticing a new pimple or cyst forming, applying a dab with a q-tip.</li>
            <li> I have realistic expectations and hope for a little more glow in my skin and slightly cleaner looking/easier to clean pores.  </li>
            <li> Had to stop when I moved because the new place has almost 0 humidity &amp; this peel made my skin super dry.</li>
            <li> I am a huge believe in facial oils for daily use.  </li>
            <li> If you are like me however, once you stop using this, if you have a bad habit like picking your skin then you will need to continuously use this or get better habits :) only thing that I don&#x27;t enjoy about this is that because it is literally getting rid of you old skin cells, you can feel a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> The problem with black skin is that it hyperpigments easy and by the time</li>
            <li> I then apply the mixture very carefully to my clean face and neck without rubbing, being extremely careful not to get any product into my eyes.</li>
            <li> Instructions are so easy, and the product works in less than 8 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, I hope this review has shined some light on people who are experienceing the same thing as me :0)</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;rough patch\\&quot; on my chin has nearly disappeared with three light treatments since day 1.</li>
            <li> If you have the extra money and a weekend to stay home and hide out, the benefits of a deeper peel done by a professional is definitely worth the time.</li>
            <li> This came in really handy with my recent outbreak of acne, I wash my face with a regular cleanser and pat my face dry.</li>
            <li> My skin tolerates spot treatments as needed but be careful and make sure your skin can tolerate the extra treatments.  </li>
            <li> Newer scars are completely gone, older one faded just a bit.</li>
            <li> It will neutralize after several minutes and doesn&#x27;t sting as much as the whole face</li>
            <li> my skin is as soft, pink, moist and wrinkle free as a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> seriously, anyone with skin issues of any kind would benefit from this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After you remove the peel, your skin will get super dry.</li>
            <li> Warning, you can&#x27;t use this if you have sensitive skin, it definitely burns, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> The first day I started this product, I had a very large pimple on my cheek...and by the second week, &#x27;that pimple&#x27; shrunk, the third week</li>
            <li> Something I saw no other reviewers really put.</li>
            <li> I have oily combination, very sensitive, skin and decided to try this peel.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> For someone who has Never had one, I would highly recomend going to a professional to see what % they&#x27;d use on you</li>
            <li> I will continue using this treatment, and highly recommend it so far.</li>
            <li> I kept it on for a little over 3 minutes and it was hot, very hot.</li>
            <li> Because my right shoulder is nearly clear and that stopped breaking out about a year before my left stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because my right shoulder is nearly clear and that stopped breaking out about a year before my left stopped.  </li>
            <li> I definitely prefer more frequent but less intense peels because I don&#x27;t like having to drop out of my life while I&#x27;m doing them.</li>
            <li> Feels like it&#x27;s sucking and killing all the bacteria and after three-four weeks of using it now my chins is completely CLEAR!</li>
            <li> (my derm explained it essentially removes the first layer of skin to allow the breakout to be exposed to the medication), but after that the healing process is speedy.</li>
            <li> acne was \\&quot;zapped\\&quot; immediately and fine lines were less.</li>
            <li> My skin peeled with the first use only.   </li>
            <li> Used first for 2 mins, and had no effect, upped it to 4, same result.</li>
            <li> As far as the peel on your face, yes it does sting but its managable!  </li>
            <li> I definitely felt the stinging/burning sensation the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> The first time is recommended at only 1 minute</li>
            <li> I have brown skin, so I&#x27;m aware that my skin can react differently to it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I only did a spot treatment and had it on my skin for 4-5 mins.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion would be to do the first application when you have no plans to be anywhere just in case you break out like I did.</li>
            <li> I left it on for 6 minutes the first time.  </li>
            <li> I only had the product for a minute the first time</li>
            <li> ,  the product is producing more pimples than I have ever seen in a lifetime, that is not to say the the peel itself is damaging my face (i.e. chemical burn, spots,  excessive drying, etc.).   </li>
            <li> I recently ordered this product and after the first use my skin was glowing and cleared the acne within 24 hrs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always better to be safe than sorry!  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t try and leave it on for ten minutes the first time or you might burn yourself.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;Im tan; hispanic not dark at all and not light just tan &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Then, I slough off the dead skin to reveal a fresh layer of unblemished and fresh looking baby skin.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I could only leave it on for about 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Now, the first time I put this on, there was a definite burning pain.</li>
            <li> I am 41 years old and wondering when all this was going to stop!  </li>
            <li> Back to the peel:  first time around, burn city.  </li>
            <li> Well, this worked wonders for my old acne scars, my oily skin and as for break-outs, almost non-existent!</li>
            <li> First off, Im 18 with combination/oily skin that occasionally gets gets inflamed pores.</li>
            <li> All of my persistent acne has disappeared (completely!).  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I had my first breakout at the age of ten</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 2 days but on the first day I noticed results the morning after I had used it.</li>
            <li> other reviewer had given a link to a different brand which was quite a bit more pricier</li>
            <li> did the peel for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> The first 2 applications, I didn&#x27;t see much of a result, but by the third, WOW WOW WOW.  </li>
            <li> product also evens out my skin tone which had suffered scars from past acne :)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine starting out with a higher concentration.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product for anyone who has acne, acne scars, and redness and wants results!</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time last night, and im not going to lie, it burned like hell.</li>
            <li> Now, I can say that only because my skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive and I have also screwed around with a lot of different products and chemicals on it before (microdermabrasion, light peels from the drugstore, glycolic acid face wash, benzoyl peroxide, atralin, etc)</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I left it on my skin for four minutes, then put on toner.  </li>
            <li> my face looks brighter(vibrant) and the acne is completely gone!</li>
            <li> First I would do my back and then my face.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re still pretty red.</li>
            <li> At first it was just some redness that was no big deal.</li>
            <li> If you have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; bathroom lighting it actually masks a lot of the first stages.</li>
            <li> Fewer blackheads, pores appear smaller (actually just cleaner :), skin is smoother, fewer blemishes after several uses.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t cure your acne completely but it helps to control breakouts!</li>
            <li> Usually with peels your skin gets better day by day.    </li>
            <li> Absolutely less scars, my fine lines are GONE, FIRMER skin, evening out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Pretty basic.  </li>
            <li> Think will use a higher percentage next time.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, do not even touch this stuff!</li>
            <li> No biggie, it was only the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I followed the directions and left it on for exactly 60 seconds.  </li>
            <li> tried this product the first time and left it on for one minute.  </li>
            <li> After the first two times using this product there is a very big difference in the appearance of my face.  </li>
            <li> so I could get a feel for what was normal as far as redness and burning</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the whitening, rash, and melting seemed to \\&quot;clear up\\&quot; and my skin seemed normal again after about one or two hours.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Length of Time:I have used it twice, the first time the instructions said of 1 minute, and the 2nd time approx.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait for my next peel as it looks like the results are going to be stellar.  </li>
            <li> but when I did this the first time, it definitely bothered me a lot.</li>
            <li> The deep texture on my left lower cheek is still there, but significantly improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On first application she felt no stinging and did not peel (left it on for 7 minutes).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to use a facial peel for so long to combat sun damage, MANY acne scars,current acne, and general dullness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the first second it will burn like fire while its neutralizing, however after that all the burning will be gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are usually not inflamed but they are bumpy, as if there&#x27;s something underneath each one.</li>
            <li> First let me say that Im a big skin laboratory</li>
            <li> I took a before and after photo from when I first started to last night</li>
            <li> I have tried various regimens that worked to some degree but never always or consistently until now.</li>
            <li> or so I have also been using a acne medication supplement for overall skin health and its been working pretty darn well;    </li>
            <li> Within the first application after waiting only one week (I recommend 5-7 days between applications), the results showed!  </li>
            <li> left on for 2 minutes the first time.  </li>
            <li> Wow, zits be gone!</li>
            <li> I take meticulous care of my skin, use a good moisturizer daily, get regular facials, and even a few med spa chemical peels this year.  </li>
            <li> My old scars are lighter, and the pimples that occasionally pop up dry out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This is not to say that you have to be super careful forever but just until the new skin has been exposed for a while.  </li>
            <li> is it ok for me to use tis pruduct at the same time with pro active?</li>
            <li> This acid doesn&#x27;t dry up after two weeks in the container and is strong enough to kill skin abberations.</li>
            <li> After all, even though we may not notice to a daily basis, new skin cells are consistently in rejuvenation and our skin cells are multiplying to replace old skin cells.  </li>
            <li> so clumsy people like me can&#x27;t break it so easily!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using minocycline (anti-boitic --- part of the tetracycline family and is the most powerful anti-biotic they have) and only used Prascion (a sulfur based topically applied wash) a few times.</li>
            <li> Like most of you, I&#x27;m just desperate to get clear complexion, spending thousands of dollars over the years, trying different kind of treatments.</li>
            <li> I find it helps a lot with keeping my skin clear of acne and new blackheads as well as help keep my make up in place if I put it on the night before and then don&#x27;t wash my face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very conflicted with this product, I wanted to try an over the counter product before i go to a professional for a chemical peel, and after doing research and reading reviews i decided to go with this one, but it doesnt do much good or bad for my skin, right after i use it</li>
            <li> Over the last 2 weeks, my skin has been pretty clear.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I have a light brown, age spot on the side of my face that is about an inch by a half an inch.</li>
            <li> It was pretty clear, but I could only take it for about a week.</li>
            <li> I started using regular Dove soap and Cetaphil wash, and salicylic acid twice a week at first, and it&#x27;s all that&#x27;s need to clear the face.</li>
            <li> Like the pamphlet said, my skin did feel a bit dry after using, but the dry sensation went away on its own without needing a second product.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for some kind of miracle to clear up old acne scars on my back and to even out skin tone, reduce pores on my tzone, and clear up a few acne marks on my face</li>
            <li> Maybe it would have worked if she did it more often or had a higher % acid, but she didn&#x27;t want to keep making it worse.  </li>
            <li> I did learn to only wash my face by hand before I apply the peel; when I use a Clarisonic first, it makes my face too sensitive</li>
            <li> and my acne mostly consists of blackheads all around and small whiteheads around my cheeks/mouth/jaw and occasional large cyst like zits that never pop &gt;:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 17 years old and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> have only had a professional AHA peel once, but I can honestly say it felt very similar to the one in the bottle-though the results are not as extreme as those from a asthetician.</li>
            <li> I am careful not to use any other sloughing products, scrubs etc unless I have been working in the garden and am really grubby, since I think it&#x27;s important to be gentle with one&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> While I had the typical set of pimples in high school, once I reached college and in the throes of my 20&#x27;s, the acne came full force.  </li>
            <li> I have tried trips to the dermatologist, spa treatments, OTC products all with limited success.</li>
            <li> A week later, when i felt that it&#x27;s safe to applythe peel again, I increased my application time by 30 seconds, the following day i found 2 new breakouts on my forehead and chin which did dry out soon after.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s usually some mild scabbing and peeling on the third day of using the acid, but the skin comes off cleanly.</li>
            <li> I used every other day for the full 8 mins every time.</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t experience major peeling right away, the next day my sensitive areas did peel quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I just want to report that I am able to use the product much less often with the same result.  </li>
            <li> However, after I used the peel last night, I noticed this morning that those two spots looked MUCH better - less inflamed and well on their way to healing.</li>
            <li> (I was more or less convinced that I will simply never get rid of my acne).</li>
            <li> Some frosting during the peel and moderate dry skin with light brown patches for about 3-4 days after.  </li>
            <li> My once super deep, big blackheads are almost gone.</li>
            <li> I got BIG acne and pimples on my face and my face just did not bounce back quickly.  </li>
            <li> I happen to have exceptionally large pores pretty much all over my face, asian american, but regular use of this product</li>
            <li> Below is other products that i use in conjunction to this peel and my current skin regime, hope this helps those of you who are looking to soften your indented acne scars and combat active acne&#x27;s (GOOD LUCK EVERYONE!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I thought the first time was bad, I then became acquainted with what I&#x27;m sure is similar to the sensation of 50 bees stinging your face over and over.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the first time I applied it, I applied very little and barely rubbed my face with a cotton-pad, so honestly I didn&#x27;t see much results in those few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 yr old female who has struggled with mild acne since middle school.  </li>
            <li> I had tried numerous products with certain percentages of salicylic acid in it, but I took note that this product was a GEL PEEL with 20% salicyclic acid.</li>
            <li> Also, please note that as other reviewers have said, you will SEEM to break out more when using this for the first few times.</li>
            <li> it!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this stuff with a little bit of trepidation, but after reading many reviews and deciding to give it a go as my last resort before heading to the dermatologist I couldn&#x27;t be any happier!</li>
            <li> EXCEPT where the creases are in my nose (beware for that area) -- washed it off after one minute and the next day my skin seemed a little better.  </li>
            <li> For those who have read the book, many of the products recommended are either hard to find or not around anymore.  </li>
            <li> After reading other reviews and how mild the product was I decided to use the product anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started by wiping down the area with rubbing alcohol, then I used an old clean concealer brush</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work for my skin- combination skin with tiny pimples in the TZone plus occasional large zits.  </li>
            <li> The skin is very dry as expected, but the brown patches were much more noticeable than my professional peel.  </li>
            <li> a little pink in the morning, but very even toned :)  could probably use a stronger % for those areas, but not too worried about</li>
            <li> week one: After the initial use, I started breaking out a little more with a lot of whiteheads and sensitive under the skin bumps.</li>
            <li> Have only used 2 times, but so far not seeing any difference in the aging brown spots, which is the reason for my purchase per the ad....will give it a little more time to see if its going to make a difference...</li>
            <li> When using Renova or other retinoids, my skin would have dry, flaking patches which were more unsightly.</li>
            <li> peel can also be used for reasons other than your face, but you should avoid using it in large quantities, over large areas of skin, or too frequently.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed an improvement and less breakouts since i&#x27;ve been exercising 30 min a day several days a week, drinking more water and adding more raw fruits and vegetables to my diet, also taking low doses of vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) supplements which is supposed to help balance hormones during that time of the month.</li>
            <li> my skin looks awesome, the only bad thing is they sent me</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from acne from 8th grade and now I am a senior who suffers from  great stress from college and school work.</li>
            <li> I decided to discontinue using it and my face started to clear.</li>
            <li> I am not a nurse, but frosting is what seems to clear up the skin, so if it does not frost, chances are you are not getting rid of your problems.</li>
            <li> my skin was almost always perfectly clear.</li>
            <li> Nothing would make them clear up.</li>
            <li> Will clear up your skin like it states.</li>
            <li> BURNS when you rinse it off, causes some redness, and DIDN&#x27;T clear my acne.    </li>
            <li> Not enough where someone could really notice, unless they stood directly in front of me.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been this clear.</li>
            <li> I always wash my face and then use alcohol all over to clear and prep my skin for the acid.  </li>
            <li> and there wasn&#x27;t a product out in the market that could give me the clear skin I have longed for.  </li>
            <li> They told me that all the toxins in my skin will rise up to the surface but in about three months, I will see visibly clear skin.  </li>
            <li> You may do permanent damage to your skin if you don&#x27;t wash it off when your body clearly knows that it&#x27;s time.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin clear and even.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing I&#x27;ve tried that has helped me clear up so much.</li>
            <li> I can still see it clearly.      </li>
            <li> Instead of using acne gel, I used Neutrogena&#x27;s Rapid Clear Oil-Eliminating Foaming Cleanser to keep my skin dryer.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so clear that I have gotten compliments from people at work.</li>
            <li> I have found that I do not have to use the peel as often anymore, but I do still need to use it for maintaining my clear skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping to clear my acne.</li>
            <li> but i just wanted to have clear skin.</li>
            <li> The insert clearly states no longer than 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to muscle through this period reading that this will clear up eventually</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t had a professional facial in about 4 months, and I really didn&#x27;t want to drop $100 on another, so</li>
            <li> My face is 99% clear</li>
            <li> THIS HELPS KEEP COMPEXTION CLEAR AND TIGHTENS PORES.</li>
            <li> Even my girlfriend said \\&quot;your skin is looking really clear</li>
            <li> It did take about two weeks of twice-a-week use to totally clear up.</li>
            <li> had all of given up at ever having clear skin at the ripe ol&#x27; age of 25.</li>
            <li> i give this five stars because it kept my face clear when i have hormonal breakouts....</li>

            <li> I swear, I&#x27;m just an all around happier person because I&#x27;m not always feeling self conscious about my skin.</li>
            <li> , i have used it 3 times so far.</li>
            <li> I started having severe adult acne breakouts in 2004.</li>
            <li> Since that time, I have tried every conceivable product on the market.</li>
            <li> The price seems reasonable enough, too.</li>
            <li> I have seen marked</li>
            <li> The results i got were:  -Pores got smaller noticeably on the nose, but not as much on the cheeks.  </li>
            <li> To get my skin used to it initially (be warned, I don&#x27;t really know the correct usage of this stuff</li>
            <li> I started having problems with adult onset acne at about age 25 - am now 40.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 years old</li>
            <li> and I have really sensitive, semi-dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and I can last the whole 10 minutes.      </li>
            <li> The second time I could stand it much easier.  </li>
            <li> It really depends on the cleanser you use prior to.  </li>
            <li> &quot; but i have seen more breakouts lately with the use of this peel.</li>
            <li> I would classify my skin as combination sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I anticipate that they will eventually peel completely off.</li>
            <li> Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)]])</li>
            <li> That succes was short lived, the week after, I broke out (still breaking out) with volcanic-like pimples that are ready to erupted.  </li>
            <li> The pimples are coming back so fast before the scars would disappear.  </li>
            <li> After much searching, I have finally found the solution and instead of being embarrassed by the way my skin looks, I often receive complements.  </li>
            <li> I have used three applications so far and i am amazed at the results.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> do not buy if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This peel got such fabulous reviews (and was such a low price) that I decided to give it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just really surprised I don&#x27;t have peeling even though everybody does.  </li>
            <li> Following the same exact steps as my first application except I left the peel on for about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li> Used it 3x so far.</li>
            <li> Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)]]</li>
            <li> and I was in absolute agony the entire minute.</li>
            <li> I realize these are sensitive areas; however, these are the areas I get white/black heads and I as hoping this peel would help reduce these, since it wasn&#x27;t working on my cystic pimples.</li>
            <li> After years of dealing with scrubs and acne products I already know where my sensitive spots are, so I kept the acid away from the area surrounding my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 years old</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a whole lot of difference in my pore size/black heads, but I have been using this peel for several months now</li>
            <li> my skin prob isn&#x27;t sensitive</li>

            <li> I have suffered from frequent break-outs for 20 years now.</li>
            <li> My old acne scars have diminished as well.    </li>
            <li> I use Nivea Soft moisturizing cream afterwards because it has the vitamin E and jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li> I have adult acne</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old daughter who has suffered from acne for about 4 years now.</li>
            <li> The second week of using this her skin was clearing up very well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Retin-A since I was 16 years old.</li>
            <li> I also developed \\&quot;melasma\\&quot; 3 years ago...</li>
            <li> Ever since I developed the melasma 3 years ago I have been searching for a cure that I could afford</li>
            <li> but that left me feeling woozy sometimes and didn&#x27;t really \\&quot;hold\\</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like Drano for your skin&#x27;s pipes, clearing out all the gunk and allowing the natural process of your skin to take over.  </li>
            <li> Glycolic Acid 35% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)]], paired with either this BP, [</li>
            <li> After years of trying different brands of items, going to doctors, nothing really works for me.  </li>
            <li> I had very oily skin, especially my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 years old</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m 18 years old</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve never had any peeling around the pimple area</li>
            <li> i use an artists brush to apply and once the peel is rinsed off i follow up with Oil of Olay 15 spf for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I predict all the marks on my shoulders will be completely gone within 1 year.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cheers!!!or that to clear up completely scars and all.  </li>
            <li> I predict all the marks on my shoulders will be completely gone within 1 year.  </li>
            <li> I started getting acne young, when i was about 10</li>
            <li> For professional results, I think that you just need to go to the professionals.</li>
            <li> I do not use the product on my forehead or near my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the peel I added the argan oil all over my face and back and rubbed it in real well.</li>
            <li> My skin felt extremely soft and relaxed after this.</li>
            <li> years, I suffered from adult onset acne.  </li>
            <li> My acne has lessened, and so has the greasy quality my skin naturally has.</li>
            <li> The gel immediately causes areas of blemishing to abate and controls areas of more complex, vexing blemishing.</li>
            <li> My scars are primarily on my cheeks &amp; a few on my forehead.</li>
            <li> My skin was a complete wreck because I tried out the Oil Cleansing Method.</li>
            <li> 4 minutes with this product on left my arm feeling much smoother.</li>
            <li> PLEASE- if you have a darker skin tone, are prone to scarring or hyperpigmentation, consult a professional before putting this product on your skin.</li>
            <li> I needed to get all that old damaged skin off.</li>
            <li> and I have adult acne,</li>
            <li> I surprised.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this stuff as I am 27 years old</li>
            <li> Week three: Still breaking out but not as much with the pimples disappearing at a faster rate and smaller pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if you do have this product give it at least 6 weeks before you decide that it does not work, after all you have had acne most of your life and 6 weeks is a blip on the radar.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve read enough about chemical peels to know that you really should rinse with a neutralizer.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> For me to take the time out of my ridiculously busy life to leave a review for this product speaks for itself.  </li>
            <li> One time, I decided to take the risk and just left it on my face for the whole day.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s with olive</li>
            <li> but I used it directly as described and it didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> It is even fading my old acne scars.</li>
            <li> I looked in the mirror this morning and nearly cried at how blotchy, bumpy and spotted my skin is.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had PMS-related cystic acne along with some blackheads and whiteheads since my early thirties.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m young</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve kept my skin under control using proactiv everyday(all 3 steps), trying out sulfur mud masks which I really like as well as a lactic acid peel by this same company.</li>
            <li> you dont want to leave it on long in the beginning if this is your first time trying it at home.</li>
            <li> And wow, what an improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I developed Rosacea as an adult, about 40 or so, I&#x27;m 58/male.</li>
            <li> an old batch expires in 4 months.</li>
            <li> I noticed a much improved appearance (red acne marks faded, bumps diminished, etc.).  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin and after having a baby, my face exploded in volcanoes.</li>
            <li> If you decide to purchase this product please also purchase a pH neutralizing product and have it ready so that you can properly remove this acid.</li>
            <li> So far my regimen has been improving my skin texture, smoothing it out and controlling my acne.</li>
            <li> and I do not have sensitive skin as I&#x27;d never had a problem with any glycolic peels.</li>
            <li> DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT NEAR YOUR EYES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried using this because i was getting adult acne on my chin</li>
            <li> am a 30 year old woman and of COURSE during</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does it help with acne, but also with my whole complexion.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> For those with sensitive skin, it will make you feel like your skin is on fire!!&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> like one reviewer noted yes it doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of a scar</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and had no problem tolerating the product, but I didn&#x27;t see any difference with my acne.  </li>
            <li> Took about 2 weeks for my skin to clear up completely</li>
            <li> This peel is very much professional grade and burns like ....</li>
            <li> One of those things that happens when you get old.</li>
            <li> Tried this three times so far, it looks like it will take a week or two but will work.</li>
            <li> I would give this five, except it did not meet my (perhaps wild) expectations.</li>
            <li> It can leave your skin reddish and sensitive but you can see immediate results.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with some excema on my face.</li>
            <li> Going to step away from chemicals now and try all natural.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin or anything.</li>
            <li> Old scars</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has severe adult acne break outs and he loves this product too.</li>
            <li> My acne has almost completely disappeared as a result of these peels as well.</li>
            <li> Maybe i&#x27;m just too sensitive</li>
            <li> I had an 18% salicylic peel done by a professional.  </li>
            <li> For all those acne sufferers, go get your peels done by a professional.  </li>
            <li> Completely.</li>
            <li> I am a 34 year old hispanic woman with a tn or mediterranean complexion.</li>
            <li> But if I get busy with something else and get distracted, it is tolerable.  </li>
            <li> Now, I can leave it on for 15 minutes until it is completely soaked in and don&#x27;t even notice it.  </li>
            <li> Baking Soda is a natural acid neutralizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one TCA peel done professionally a couple years ago</li>
            <li> The next morning, my skin looks much smoother and even.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s no where near 20%.</li>
            <li> I must say i bought this in hopes that i will burn my skin tags on some sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very itchy even though i left it on them for 5 minutes every time.</li>
            <li> but now i feel alive again when i have clear skin.</li>
            <li> it really has been the only solution to my acne.</li>
            <li> In my early 40s, medium complexion.  </li>
            <li> I think my skin is clearing up too (adult cystic acne).</li>
            <li> My face is a bit sensitive sometimes but not overly sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I do NOT have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> If you know you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting professional peels for years, and my skin is used to the process.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li> The scars aren&#x27;t even there anymore, and my skin is overall much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read online that chemical peels are used to professionally remove scars</li>
            <li> This is coming from a girl who has bought countless scar-removal creams and has never seen much improvement.</li>
            <li> and I seem to have far fewer skin breakouts.</li>
            <li> Almost completely gone in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> , I have milia around my nose and on my chin which it hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of completely</li>
            <li> I am a 44 year old mom and grandmother who still had to deal with acne...</li>
            <li> 50% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)]].</li>
            <li> Save up the cash and see a professional.</li>
            <li> I was getting peels professionally every month.  </li>
            <li> While it hasn&#x27;t completely eliminated the scars, it does peel some skin off the scar, and has made them almost invisible.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews on wow, this is making my skin clear up</li>
            <li> My hormones completely changed after having my daughter.  </li>
            <li> I tried naturally getting rid of my acne using lemon juice every night for a couple weeks with no improvement.  </li>
            <li> it does whats its supposed to; burns outer layer of skin to removie old damaged cells.&lt;br /&gt;extremely</li>
            <li> See a professional skin Doc.</li>
            <li> a week I use this peel and wow...</li>
            <li> Just started up the Retin-A again this week, so my skin is a bit sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I was completely sold.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> I figured my skin may be used to Salicylic Acid since I have been using cleaners containing salicyclic acid since my early teens.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also purchased the Glycolic peel which I&#x27;ve only used a few times and Kiss My Face Pore Shrink which I&#x27;ve tried and love.</li>
            <li> I expected some purging but it seemed to bring out 30 years worth of gunk onto my face.</li>
            <li> People with moderate to sever acne need a good product that actually contains probably at least 4-20%.  </li>
            <li> The pimples on my forehead haven&#x27;t completely gone away yet, but they&#x27;re getting better slowly over time.</li>
            <li> (slowly increase the time you leave it on your face, don&#x27;t leave it on the full 8 minutes the first time as you don&#x27;t know how sensitive your skin will be to this</li>
            <li> i tried it and it still burned i think its slowly getting better</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t be shy, go ahead and order this product because you can&#x27;t afford not to be good looking.</li>
            <li> it has had good effects, it has randomly burnt my skin every now and then.</li>
            <li> AND...... it works, slowly but surely.  </li>
            <li> My skin is thick and oily and has tolerated many peels.  </li>
            <li> I dab a little bit from a Qtip right onto an emerging pimple and it disappears so fast.</li>
            <li> One caveat: I have  normal to dry skin, so I found it better to use it twice monthly rather than once a week, as it can be a little drying.</li>
            <li> I was only able to leave it on for probably less than 30 seconds the first time, the second time putting it on, I could only handle a minute</li>
            <li> Both of these products have limited ingredients, and I&#x27;ve found them to be gentle and highly restorative for after the peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve become pretty good at covering my pimples, but Acne products definitely dry my skin out and make it really difficult to use makeup.</li>
            <li> The 20% helped me with the black heads: they fell right off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars only because I think I might find a better technique to use it in the near future but other than that this product is a 1.</li>
            <li> I still have to use moisturizing lotions and other products each month, but when I use this peel I am only spending about $10 per month for face wash and lotion, and I have found that this size bottle of peel is good for a few months.  </li>

            <li> It was not immediate but my face got a little better after each treatment - Then after the first complete round of treatment (6 weeks)</li>
            <li> This is the only thing i have used that has had a major effect on the large pore festival i used to have on my face.</li>
            <li> I wanted to combat the dry flakey skin first.</li>
            <li> At first, I just used lotion because that was what was recommended, but when I did so my face stayed dry for days (even when I applied it generously).</li>
            <li> Six weeks later, under the care of a dermatoligist specializing in people of color, my skin has mainly returned to the pre-peel state as far as the breakouts are concerned.</li>
            <li> You get acne the first few times you do this---the more toxicity your skin has to purge once the dead layers come off--</li>
            <li> After nearly a month of use, I can say that many small scars have disappeared and the big ones look flatter and softer.</li>
            <li> I was excited as i thought that It would peel the rest of the dead skin from my face.</li>
            <li> I alternate between full face application and spot application to specific areas only, because I&#x27;m not an aesthetician and don&#x27;t want to overdo it.  </li>
            <li> I have oily and sensitive skin with facial acne since high school</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on the same spot more than a few nights in a row otherwise it can dry out the skin too much and cause it to...</li>
            <li> When I discovered this on Amazon and read the other reviews, I decided to give it a try since so many others seemed to have success with their serious acne and skin issues.</li>
            <li> This does NOT mean every 40 year old Skin will have the same reaction!</li>
            <li> Not only did it clear up my acne, but it made my skin feel soft and new.</li>
            <li> (there are still pimples, but there are less), the texture is smoother, and the large pores on my nose have shrunken!!  </li>
            <li> If your skin is extremely dry from all the harsh product use it will naturally make tons more oil and clog the pores.</li>
            <li> Fine lines around my eyes have lessened, as well as furrow lines seem less deep.  </li>
            <li> But be careful to follow direct exactly, so you dont damage your skin.</li>
            <li> I continued to use this peel for a month, once/week, the acne was kept in a stable situation, which was not totally removed, but not serious as before.</li>
            <li> I have 7 larger pimples, 3 small pimples, and many bumps on my face.  </li>
            <li> and I did it about once a week and then steadily upgraded to multiple times a week.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> main issues -- congested skin, big pores.</li>
            <li> overall , a decent product for acne prone skin,</li>
            <li> The first several times I barely last a minute.</li>
            <li> it works particularly well for the whitehead and cystic types (especially the swelling).  </li>
            <li> white (pale)&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: normal / combination&lt;br /&gt;Use: attempted to clear skin of acne &amp; acne scarring</li>
            <li> Those fine wrinkles are gone and the deep wrinkle is much less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first application I only left on for two minutes.</li>
            <li> I first apply to the thicker areas of my face that coincidentally need the extra peeling -- sides of face, jawline -- then I do the T-zone starting with the forehead them</li>
            <li> also found that fanning my face with something heavy-duty, like a plate, takes away the burning sensation and makes it much easier to get through those first few minutes.</li>
            <li> The real improvements this peel provides don&#x27;t show immediately but come after using the product consistently for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about once or twice a week for the past three weeks now and my scarring has tremendously gone down and my skin feels extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think that it stings other than, maybe, the first minute you put it on, but definitely nothing one can&#x27;t take.</li>
            <li> but if 3 does little or nothing i may have to go for a full 8 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As of right now, using the product only SIX times (once every 5 days) there is not a single zit, red mark, bump, or pimple ANYWHERE on my face! :</li>
            <li> When I had finally removed enough layers of dead skin then an amazing amount of fluid came out.</li>
            <li> I had such high hope for this product.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest you get a cotton swab for this, put over bottle, tip for a second or two</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I think a previous reviewer mentioned being Tyra Banks&#x27; complexion--which is the same skin tone as I am, so I did see some redness on my cheeks, but I&#x27;m 90% sure it was because of the wash cloth I used (it was a bit rough, but I didn&#x27;t have any other clean ones).  </li>
            <li> my acne is starting to clear up as well as fading the newly formed scars on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The way I think of it, when you use this, you speed up the exfoliating/healing process by constantly burning away old skin and bringing in new skin.  </li>

            <li> I know they recommend the BHA as best for acne, but it seems to dry my skin out so badly</li>
            <li> I MAY have some less acne, but I definitely do not see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> No down time here, and no redness like some people mentioned,</li>
            <li> Great for a home facial and taking off some dead dull skin .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple products, either online or in store with such positive reviews, but never worked for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Aftercare is also important, every day I put sunblockand after using the acid I put some oil, usually argan or tamanu.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I only gave it 4 because this really should be a medical grade product to be applied by a professional.</li>
            <li> It did not frost it just felt tighter, and my pores looked remarkably small and smooth.</li>
            <li> For a  long time I was using a product that was 15% from another company that cost twice as much.  </li>
            <li> I do not have to use any other kind of concealer or spot coverage, which I have in the past.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I followed the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li> For 2-3 days afterwards, the skin begin to exfolidate and peel, revealing fresh pink skin underneath, just like the result of the $70 facial professional job.</li>
            <li> I would use this once a week, alternating with this and the gly/lac peel, for about 4 weeks, then the last 2 weeks of my first cycle I would put this one on first, leave it for a couple of minutes, then apply the gly/lac over the salicylic and leave on for another few minutes.</li>
            <li> that where not dark.</li>
            <li> i have seen a dermatoligist and am now using a product to try to reverse the affect and bring my orginal pigmentation back to normal.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve stopped using it, things are getting back to normal.</li>
            <li> The people claiming you put it on and next day your skin looks normal are exaggerating.</li>
            <li> I went back to the review and people said it was normal.</li>
            <li> * encourage washing off this peel with normal BAKING SODA mixed with water.</li>
            <li> This salicylic acid was exactly what I needed to get rid of pesky closed comedones along my chin.  </li>
            <li> Will have to see later down the road if it will cause a significant change or not.</li>
            <li> 56, fair skinned, freckled with oily skin, large pores on my nose and at least 5 small hypertrophic sebaceous bumps, left side of my face.  </li>
            <li> (The stinging was a little more than I had expected.)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back on it again to clear out the leftover pink spots and to try to get all the pores open to get the full beard in.    </li>
            <li> Then, I ordered Palmer&#x27;s Skin Lightening cream, it seemed like my skin was getting better at one time but would return to black when I looked in the mirror other times.</li>
            <li> the only thing it didn&#x27;t do for me is to prevent new acne from forming.</li>
            <li> Its work well on new white heads, but does not do anything for cystic pimples.</li>
            <li> no directions with it not very happy about that dont know how to use it , dont know if it would order again but was very fast and exact</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve finally found the secret to amazing skin</li>
            <li> Both times I cleansed my skin with a gentle cleanser, patted my face dry and used an alcohol prep on my face to remove any excess surface oil on the skin.</li>
            <li> I decided not to buy the toner or witch hazel, seemed like a waste of money when it clearly states that you can just use water to neutralize the peel and rubbing alcohol to clean the area prior to the peel.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old, with oily skin, moderate breakouts, mild acne scarring, forehead wrinkles, and slight jawline sagging.</li>
            <li> While waiting, I clean my dish and make a mixture with baking soda and cold water (does not need to be a paste, just make sure you have enough baking soda).  </li>
            <li> It does dry your face out, but that&#x27;s the whole point.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I pat dry gently.</li>
            <li> After 2 treatments my old acne scars are even fading, and old blackheads that have been embedded forever suddenly \\&quot;popped\\&quot; out!!</li>
            <li> Take your time and see some videos about the salicylic acid peel you would see its complete normal&lt;br /&gt;After two day as expected I did got breakouts but not that much.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much healthier, which is a blessing for someone who has lived her entire life with multiple skin problems.</li>
            <li> For shoulders though, the skin is much thicker and traditional creams and methods just don&#x27;t penetrate well enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since I was in grade school and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve tried that actually seemed like it really works.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t notice any changes in my back so far, but I&#x27;m hopping for it to clear too.    </li>
            <li> I may have left it on too long too in my zealous first time attempt.  </li>
            <li> the results I&#x27;ve gotten so far are the complete opposite of my goals!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews that state that skin will get worse and may develop acne before it gets better, but I need to ask for a professional opinion.</li>
            <li> I was hesitatant to try something else since nothing ever worked - but for less than $20 it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> I read from a medical journal that you can actually become poisoned from using this too much.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you have sensitive skin because this does sting a bit and will cause your face to peel and flake if you use too much too often.  </li>
            <li> so there is more exposure to the thin and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have received a few messages suggesting that this scarring make actually be rosacea, but a dermatologist ruled that out and confirmed that these types of peels can cause permanent hyper-pigmentation or scarring.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the peel arrived, I decided to wait after my third application to write a review on this peel as I thought it should be more than sufficient time to at least see what it does to my skin.</li>
            <li> Whenever I break out this clears my face up quickly and is not too harsh.</li>
            <li> About two months ago, I purchased Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel( I wanted to start with least strong product).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and you just start off slow.  </li>
            <li> When I was young, I remember getting a dark skin pigmentation that just kept getting bigger on my forehead and two more in other areas of my face.  </li>
            <li> I kept ATLEAST 6-13 pimples every single day for 3months straight using this product&amp; I&#x27;m not exaggerating.</li>
            <li> It said your skin will gradually peel but mines was just tight red dry and itchy and felt like I was clogging my skin even more because it did not eventually peel off.</li>
            <li> My skin is now *extremely* dry, flakey and old, and I&#x27;ve developed acne!!</li>
            <li> the major ones thought)  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many thousands of dollars I&#x27;ve spent on beauty products at your usual beauty store claiming to get rid of adult acne.</li>
            <li> I have only used it 4 times and WOW!</li>
            <li> No regrets!</li>
            <li> I barely needed to wear makeup!</li>
            <li> For the first couple weeks, as other reviewers have said, the acid brings out impurities from under the surface and will result in some breakouts but BE PATIENT.</li>
            <li> Nothing major.  </li>
            <li> The larger pimples have not necessarily stopped, however, when I first feel one under my skin, I dab the peel onto that one specific site and leave it on.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, this does exactly what it says it will do, although I don&#x27;t think it does it quite as well as other reviews have said.</li>
            <li> and I assumed it was because I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough and my face is naturally oily so the peel didn&#x27;t affect it too much.</li>
            <li> no other creams, masks, etc... were helping with either of these things&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No other product has worked this well.</li>
            <li> and I felt a major difference.</li>
            <li> My other higher potency glycol acid/lactic acid peels don&#x27;t make me this flakey.</li>
            <li> as other reviewers already noticed i did not have any effect for the first time</li>
            <li> I was hoping to soon see a decrease in dark spots, however I became pregnant and had to discontinue my entire regime.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin apparently and after just 1 application of this my skin dried out tremendously.</li>
            <li> After a recent breakout (of the kind I had not seen since my early teens), I was left with little pimples and some dark blemishes.</li>
            <li> These types of pimples are very hard to treat with benzoyl peroxide and do not respond well to many types of treatments.</li>
            <li> Then I apply a thin layer of peel with a fan brush, moving quickly and evenly across the face, taking special care not to let the brush rest on any part of my face for too long.</li>
            <li> It diminished the size of my pores, completely gained my natural skin tone back, and almost completely got rid of the zits only after 4 weeks of use.    </li>
            <li> I also have had very dark circles under my eyes for many years due to my olive skin complexion.</li>
            <li> Be patient, consistent and very very careful and you will be rewarded.</li>
            <li> I used it steadily for 10 months, maybe every other week, before I realized THIS was the source of my new problem.</li>
            <li> and I am doing a few more touch up peels to target a few new blemishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and have had occasional blemishes in the chin area since my early 20&#x27;s, usually hormonal and very rarely maybe a big cystic one.</li>
            <li> I have also had large pores for a long time especially on my nose and chin...</li>
            <li> It stung a little but was totally bearable and not bad at all.</li>
            <li> The day after peel I am a little red (not bad at all).  </li>
            <li> (stay away from benzoyl peroxide while using peels).&lt;br /&gt;Apply salicylic acid/Lactic acid peel with fan brush (I use only a droplet from pouring).&lt;br /&gt;While waiting, I clean my dish and make a mixture with baking soda and cold water (does not need to be a paste, just make sure you have enough baking</li>
            <li> Do be sure to rinse with cold water for a minute and then use a baking soda/water paste to VERY GENTLY wash your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, especially to people who have a lot of white heads.</li>
            <li> Other times, I use Aveeno Positively Radiant since it has SPF.</li>
            <li> I continue to use this product with the hopes that i will be blemish free or at least close to it.</li>
            <li> I believe my problem is probably internal but this peel helped clear me up some regardless.  </li>
            <li> I started using this in the midst of a breakout and it has definitely helped clear me up.</li>
            <li> My old scars are still dark and very visible.</li>
            <li> I even persisted with the cleansing hoping it would clear up but no such luck.</li>
            <li> Try it out and see your skin condition clear up and improve overall.</li>
            <li> It is also the ONLY thing that will clear up my face with record</li>
            <li> i posted an unretouched pic from my last shoot to show how clear my skin was.</li>
            <li> I may try it again whenever I visit friends &amp; family in humid areas just to see if it&#x27;ll work later, or just to maintain my skin when it&#x27;s finally clear.</li>
            <li> This helps clear my pores, takes off access makeup which my facial wash miss out, it has helped decrease my pores and has helped tighten and smooths the texture of my skin.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have noticed over the years my skin was looking old, with open pores and crows feet.</li>
            <li> I use bare minerals.</li>
            <li> and my skin was so soft and my healing acne scars were turning white.</li>
            <li> Scars did not really change much.</li>
            <li> It turned one of my already dark spots darker, I really hope this is not permanent!</li>
            <li> and I have barely had any breakouts at all, maybe one pimple every five days.</li>
            <li> I am 35 year old Hispanic female.</li>
            <li> My face was red but it completely stopped hurting.</li>
            <li> As soon as I&#x27;m done using it, my skin it much softer and there is usually minimal visible peeling.  </li>
            <li> I only wish that there were a natural alternative that produced these results.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks my skin got scaly so 1 day I steamed some water and let my face just sit near the steam &amp; suddenly</li>
            <li> and I barely get pimples.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from meds,prescribed topical solutions, 100s of face washes, homopathic natural approach etc etc.</li>
            <li> Alot of \\&quot;frosting\\&quot; occured on the sensitive parts of my face such as cheek bones just under the eyes, my nose and around my mouth.</li>
            <li> i couldnt bare to look at myself in the mirror</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t bare the burning</li>
            <li> I am African American with very oil skin and hyperpigmentation left from using Proactive serveral years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid $250.00 for a professional peel &amp; have seen the same results.</li>
            <li> The first time I left it for 15 minutes, the second and third times I left it on for about 30.</li>
            <li> -- it just barely stings -- but</li>
            <li> It was much milder than I expected during and after application.</li>
            <li> : I am now 53 years old, and have been using this product as a weekly peel and daily spot treatment for about 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> next time i will have a professional do it</li>
            <li> I have done a couple of peels so far, but my only issue is the scarring that this stuff has done.</li>
            <li> I suffered from adult acne for the last 8 years.</li>
            <li> I am 24 years old and still have acne problems especially around menstruation.</li>
            <li> Much to my relief, the product did not burn like I expected it to.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product so far that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> and it can burn your skin if you are not careful or do not do your research before you use this product.</li>
            <li> I am a 21 year old female (using my boyfriends&#x27;s Amazon account, of course) with stress-induced acne and plugged pores on the nose and chin, as well as unevenness under nostrils and acne scarring on either side of my chin.</li>
            <li> and I barely need any foundation coverage at all.</li>
            <li> I have only used this one and the Glycolic acid peel thus far but let me tell you,</li>
            <li> /&gt;- 30 year old female with tan skin</li>
            <li> &amp; I used this product 3-4x/week starting the 3rd week &amp; used it regularly for almost 6 weeks &amp; didn&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
            <li> I have only done one treatment and so far I have had fewer  breakouts.</li>
            <li> If you are used to getting regular peels by a professional, you will like the results of this product.</li>
            <li> Stats about me:&lt;br /&gt;19 year old Caucasian female.&lt;br /&gt;Struggled with severe acne during puberty and moderate acne</li>
            <li> I also think the constant cell turn over and stripping started to cause sebaceous hyperplasia because the skin could not get enough moisture to the surface fast enough.  </li>
            <li> Not quite gone, but barely noticeable anymore.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 17 year old male</li>
            <li> But I will keep it as a professional product as part if my back bar..</li>
            <li> First application, I had it on for 8 minutes with minimal to moderate stinging and redness.</li>
            <li> But by the next day my skin was back to normal.  </li>
            <li> When I woke up in the morning, many of the blackheads had decreased in size or disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Most treatments helped the acne, but made my eczema worse.</li>
            <li> It slowly absorbs into the skin no need to rub too much (is FANTASTIC for oily skin)</li>
            <li> few times my eyes have watered from the burning (obvioulsy I don&#x27;t apply to my eyes), but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Start small, rinse off well with lots of cool water, and moisturize immediately.  </li>
            <li> Even using good lotion I still peel like crazy.</li>
            <li> far as results, this stuff practically eliminates my pores for the first few days</li>
            <li> I have large pores on my cheeks, black heads, old pigmentation scars.</li>
            <li> Based on my experience ~ (I have combination skin, typically oily throughout the day with drier patches in certain areas of thinner skin, frequent breakouts, some acne</li>
            <li> I noticed right away that my skin felt a little tighter.</li>
            <li> Recently, some of the cysts, if left alone, would kind of dry out but leave hard bumps underneath.</li>
            <li> The first week, the redness in my face went down and my bumps lessened.</li>
            <li> and i mean RARELY breakout nowadays and that her skin is so clean and less oily than mine</li>
            <li> Also, start where skin is the thickest or less sensitive, I made the mistake of starting in my nose and the liquid pooled on the side of my nsoe and really hurt!</li>
            <li> because i need something that i could use as daily maintenance or use several times a week to reduce oil and prevent new acne from forming but where there is no downtime as i need to work.</li>
            <li> Several days later, you start to see new, softer skin appear.</li>
            <li> but the white heads dried up really quick.</li>
            <li> and then I washed it off, and used the neutralizer (VERY IMPORTANT STEP), after I dried my face, I dabbed on a little Tree Tea Oil.</li>
            <li> Even using Finacea twice a day I&#x27;d have flare ups occasionally, was very surprised that it stopped entirely with this peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Immediately after the first treatment my face got brighter and my pores had gotten less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll feel tingles and slight burning, so read the directions first.  </li>
            <li> It just feels hot and slightly stings.</li>
            <li> I have used other peels in the past with better results.</li>
            <li> Also i had small stinging in certain spots nothing that I really noticed because that skin is way different from my face</li>
            <li> I am a 25 year old female, and throughout the last 3 years I have had major on and off problems with acne.</li>
            <li> This product has shown positive signs clearing the dark spots on my face too.</li>
            <li> My chest is still not perfect by it certainly has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> and i can say that it really works for large pores (at least their appearance,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried other brands of acne gel with benzoyl peroxide, but they didn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li> I have been prescribed hormonal birth control to deal with it, Retin - A, have used 10% benzyol peroxide cream, and EVERY other product out there (Acne Free, among all the other big brands, some of which provided some temporary relief).</li>
            <li> (that is a whole other topic)...</li>
            <li> I also recommend stopping the usage of other intense skin care regimens (retinol, Retin A, microderms, laser, etc.)</li>
            <li> But then again, other products haven&#x27;t really worked either, so I think it may be a hormonal issue</li>
            <li> but I may not have used it long enough to effect much of a change (only about once a week for three weeks.)</li>
            <li> First you should know that I have been struggling with acne since I was 12 and have been on everything you can think of and have spent countless dollars on solutions, concoctions, pills that ultimately did not work.</li>
            <li> After several uses, I did start to peel and my face was dry in certain parts (especially my chin, around my nose, and at my temples).</li>
            <li> This product does what it says but be very careful and be very cautious with the amount you use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything until a few days later when dry areas started peeling---blackhead and huge pores on sebum clogged nostril</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only been applying it to the pimple areas and not my entire face since its already clear...</li>
            <li> It stings like crazy, but is mild enough that I don&#x27;t need any downtime, which is important for me as I need to show up for work every day.  </li>
            <li> This morning the area wasn&#x27;t in the least bit red or dry, so I decided it was okay to use on my face.</li>
            <li> I use it without moisturizers because my skin is pretty oily so after a few hours my skin becomes normal and dry but then gets oily again.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I was getting some kind of adult onset acne or cysts.</li>
            <li> I had set the timer for 4 minutes because I figured I&#x27;ve done a few professional peels which was much stronger than 20%, I could tolerate it</li>
            <li> For some background, I am a 25 year old Asian female with combo-oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I eventually started covering bigger areas for 3-5 minutes, and my breakouts are almost completely gone now only after 2 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know I will be going out to some social event or any prolonged outdoor activity</li>
            <li> If I know I will be going out to some social event or any prolonged outdoor activity, I take a break from the peels until after the activity(ies).</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, I am a 28 year old Asian female.</li>
            <li> 35yr old white female.</li>
            <li> My mild to moderate acne began clearing up within days and the treatment seemed to last a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I actually find putting my face in front of a fan more irritating than without.</li>
            <li> On a side note my acne actually got worse on my forehead before it got better.</li>
            <li> My derm also said there&#x27;s no such thing as things getting worse before they get better.....</li>
            <li> 5% and more is very serious to your skin..  </li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s better to beat the dead horse than assume it is dead)</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s better to beat the dead horse than assume it is dead)</li>
            <li> The results definitely make the stinging for a few minutes worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 4 weeks now (applying it once a week ), and haven&#x27;t had a single new breakout.</li>
            <li> It is less noticeable when I haven&#x27;t been in the sun for a very long time (winter time), but even with high SPF it still appears MUCH DARKER as soon as the sun hits my face and doesn&#x27;t go away at all during summer months.</li>
            <li> salicylic acid is generally not that strong in terms of peeling so get a higher % if your skin isn&#x27;t crazy sensitive</li>
            <li> forehead started to get little frosted bumps that turned into pimples the first time---</li>
            <li> It does sting a little when first applied.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Skin type: 20-something, very oily, acne-prone, sensitive, semi-pigmented, pale</li>
            <li> if you catch it early on and apply this to it the next two days after it will simply flake off instead of having to be popped (which nobody wants to do-gross, and which also causes dark spots, also unsightly).</li>
            <li> I have done 2 peels so far and have seen a large reduction in the red scars, and the deep pock marks have a less cavernous appearance.</li>
            <li> but they leave red scar for a long time while the new ones keep popping out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a product nowadays that receives such high reviews, especially when the product is inexpensive and deals with a sensitive issue (appearance).&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews here on Amazon and researching Salicyclic Acid 20% on the internet, the believeable consensus is that this peel works very well.</li>
            <li> The first time i left it on for 5 mins with slight burning on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> (I left the peel on for less than a minute for my first use).</li>
            <li> The first time I could only leave it on about a minute and a half, and now I&#x27;m about to five minutes.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product because after the dry skin went back to normal</li>
            <li> It will also make your face blotchy and uneven, if you do too long too quickly.  </li>
            <li> Your face may be a bit red (like a sunburn) but it doesn&#x27;t last long, I HIGHLY suggest doing this at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Alba Deep Sea Facial Mask left on for 5-30 minutes (it doesn&#x27;t really dry out and is VERY moisturizing mud</li>
            <li> 20% strength is powerful enough to notice an overall change in my skin clarity and texture in about 2 weeks, but gentle enough that I didn&#x27;t experience excessive discomfort during application or dry skin patches after.</li>
            <li> dark patches are now much lighter, pimples still there but smaller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion</li>
            <li> Although it takes time this product really worked and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to rid their face of acne or other irritations.</li>
            <li> leave it on my face for 5-6 minutes and don&#x27;t feel much of a burning sensation, but my skin has probably become resilient from the numerous other products I&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products out there including biocutis, which doesn&#x27;t do anything, and Proactiv Solution, which actually works but it leaves my skin very oily/greasy.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really change my skin other than to make white blotches</li>
            <li> My face looked the exact same (still acne present and dark spots galore)</li>
            <li> I would not recommend for people who are young or minor pimples.</li>
            <li> I havent had it for long, although I&#x27;m already highly sensitive to almost everything.</li>
            <li> First week: I applied twice that week giving a few days in between applications.</li>
            <li> the first few times I used it.  </li>
            <li> for at least one week before and after the full peel process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I decided to try this salicylic acid gel peel because although I mostly have scarring from old pimples all over my forehead, I also have occasional breakouts of two or three in random places on my face.</li>
            <li> For the first few times it burns alot.</li>
            <li> Lotion, firming masks, rubbery peel masks, hot showers followed by rubbing the dead skin on your face, immediately followed by lotion.</li>
            <li> first few times I used this peel</li>
            <li> The first week I used this product once a day everyday for about a minute, yes it does burn</li>
            <li> and I so I looked around for something a little easier on the pocketbook and still natural oil with high reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no new pimples developed (Its been a week I only have old deep ones left).</li>
            <li> My super large, clogged pores appear smaller with less gunk and the small pimples I had last night are now gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had consistent little white plugs I could see burrowing under the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li> (On the up side, if you had a HUGE pimple you needed to take care of stat you could dab this stuff on it as a spot treatment and seriously overnight it sucks it dry, a HUGE upside to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used salicylic acid in my other products, but I needed something stronger for my cluster and quarter sized dark spot of blackheads on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning to those with sensitive skin and are prone to infectious outbreaks, those of you know what I am talking about, well, this product warns that it may cause an outbreak and in my first use, it did.</li>
            <li> The first time I looked in the mirror after a treatment I was literally shocked because my pores were so smooth they were practically invisible!</li>
            <li> so I have dry spots and oily spots and frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li> Let face completely air dry and then apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After I use it, any blemishes that I have heal much quicker and leave less scarring.  </li>
            <li> But, ever since i used this peel my skin is half as oily and my skin doesn&#x27;t break out as much.</li>
            <li> I have acne and dark marks, olive complexion, and real oily skin especially in the summer months.</li>
            <li> The first 3 times I used this product, I was in total shock because it took off dead skin that was still just sitting there in the crevices of my nose.    </li>
            <li> First bottle is almost done and lasted a few months; WILL order a second soon.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and it has been impossible for me to find a good product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Asian-Indian in my late 20s with tan/oily skin and mild acne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this seems like a decent product if you have active, inflammatory acne</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s very imflamed pimples die down after the very next day of usage.</li>
            <li> To try to help this, I&#x27;ve began to monitor my diet (limited fried foods, dairy, citrus, fats) and increase my amount of water intake in hopes that my skin will notice and clear up.</li>
            <li> I have very large pores on my nose and chin and damage from past and ongoing cystic pimples in those areas.  </li>
            <li> Because I didn&#x27;t know how my skin would react, I left the Peel on for only 2 minutes (this is plenty for the first few times).     </li>
            <li> The first few times I only left it on for maybe 2 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> face with gentle face wash or african black</li>
            <li> Cleanse face with gentle face wash or african black soap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 4 times in the last week and a half for the whole 8 mins.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After doing the layering 2 times, I finally peeled and was very careful to wear high sun block, hat, sunglasses and no rides in convertibles or sun-roofed vehicles.  </li>
            <li> Ill keep you guys updated with what happens in the next 2 months or whatever because its only been 1 month, and full results may take much longer.</li>
            <li> Also, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel super tight or dry after I use it as long as I apply a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that this formulation is right for my African American skin.</li>
            <li> After researching some at home alternatives for peels, and less expensive options, I decided to try this since it seems more gentle.</li>
            <li> The back of my neck, just below the hair, I had signs of aging (wrinkles, big ones) and the whole area was BLACK.</li>
            <li> Used it on a large blemish I had and literally was gone within a few days.</li>
            <li> but they are mostly small and dry up quickly.  </li>
            <li> I never had much acne growing up, but it would seem that each little pimple left a mark on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sensitive on my cheecks and definitely near my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4/5 stars, simply because I feel that the burning sensation when it is on my face is a little too much.</li>
            <li> I learned that the hard way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really worth trying.  </li>
            <li> It died down a lot now that I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s but my main problem is every pore on my face is big and clogged.</li>
            <li> The first time I used a cotton ball and it was very little burning</li>
            <li> I tried Neutrogena Skin ID and used it exactly as directed for about a month or so with very little to no results.  </li>
            <li> My brother had really bad acne,  like his whole face was covered with huge zits, after using this once a week for a month, his acne has cleared up completely.  </li>
            <li> I guess you have to take the good with the bad here.</li>
            <li> But I feel like if it&#x27;s hurting so badly, it&#x27;s gotta be doing something good to the skin</li>
            <li> I am patient because I used to have acne on the face and it took a few years for that to clear up completely scars and all.  </li>
            <li> I have so far used it every few days just for spot treatment and my skin has been clear.</li>
            <li> For the first minute or 2, after direct application on my nose, I felt a slightly burning sensation and my skin turned a little red.  </li>
            <li> I mean it was truly unbearable but after that first application; a few days later, 3 days to be exact i noticed some peeling around my chin area.</li>
            <li> My chin is usually clear, but after an allergic reaction to a new makeup, I had these small pimply bumps on my skin</li>
            <li> right on the second time, because it was honestly not doing anything otherwise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not leave this on for very long the first few times you use it, it will burn your skin.</li>
            <li> All these three things combined have really helped the oil control, my skin is nowhere near as greasy, I&#x27;ve less black heads and my pores are definitely smaller.</li>
            <li> I am still breaking out and changes right now seems slow</li>
            <li> You will experience slight stinging after application and that&#x27;s entirely normal.  </li>
            <li> I have never gotten completely rid of blackheads or acheived a lasting smoothness like this with ANY other method</li>
            <li> After the first few treatments I felt a little sensitive to the sun</li>
            <li> noticed that the first few days, my skin feels a little irritated and sensitive.</li>
            <li> No makeup, no special soap, just bare natural.</li>
            <li> I even got carded ordering a drink for the first time in at least TWO YEARS, so obviously other people are noticing my new youthful looking skin.</li>
            <li> I am 25 years old and in the past year or so after never really having severe acne all my life, I developed severe cystic adult acne.</li>
            <li> So basically this product turns the big pimples into dark more scattered pimples that look worse than starting.</li>
            <li> I have had bad acne since I was in elementary school, a decade and a half later I finally cleared most of it up with proactive.</li>
            <li> , it has dried out my acne&#x27;s/pimples quickly (there is no acne marks or scars after the acne healed) and my face is now less oily.</li>
            <li> I should have bought the 30% because it doesn&#x27;t burn how other people have reported, but it does make my complexion clear for a while.</li>
            <li> yeah, the dark spots left from pimples are lightening and I am definitely shedding old skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do use other acne products and retinoids, so assume my skin is fairly sensitive to the product.  </li>
            <li> It does get a bit sensitive around my nose but other</li>
            <li> The pimples were initially small, much like my teen years, but a month later, I began forming cystic pimples.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it bi-weekly for the past two months in conjunction with my regular acne regimen (gentle cleanser + moisturizing BHA treatment, daily).</li>
            <li> The 2nd time, I literally could feel the blackheads above the normal level of skin, and even saw a few patches of darkening going away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Eventually, I developed a DARK, DARK, DARK blemish on the right side of my nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far the burning has increased with each application, but I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s because my skin isn&#x27;t as tough as it was the first time.</li>
            <li> The dark spots are definitely lighter and the contrast between the light and dark areas in considerably less noticeable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was really hurt when I put them, in the next day my skin was start feeling a little bit also I had a dry skin</li>
            <li> After using this product, my face feels tight and dry no matter how much moisturizer I</li>
            <li> This product completely burnt my skin and left me with 4 different black scars here and there.  </li>
            <li> It can be quite uncomfortable at first, but, it really seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> it began to \\&quot;pull\\&quot; out hidden acne; small bumps under my face, that were targeted with a mild red mark were getting bigger.  </li>
            <li> It may have burned like crazy after the first uses but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Just after first use, there are dark patches and dark spots on my nose and forehead.</li>
            <li> and I bought this product to use to clear up minor bumps and rough skin.</li>
            <li> I was really just hoping this would help me with my past scarring and overall appearence of my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering the glycolac for my next purchase to get rid of the old dark</li>
            <li> My face does not stay red (for long) after use, I just apply Cetaphil spf moisturizer following immediately after.   </li>
            <li> Dermatologists were no help, the pills and creams are useless if you dont have a good skin care regimen which is something the doctors dont usually tell you.    </li>
            <li> I had to slowly increase the time to the full amount -(careful</li>
            <li> I have large pores on on my cheeks--on either side of my nose and my forehead, small blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> but when I do get a spot its usually followed with a large whitehead.</li>
            <li> but this really helped to dry them off a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed as I read such other great reviews.</li>
            <li> Never really noticed any major changes in my skin though.</li>
            <li> Because of the high concentration of Salicylic Acid, you can feel it working immediately, and see the dead skin removal  as you apply with a cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> I can still see the large damaged pores over my nose, but they are flat and do not appear to have the darker appearance of gunk sitting in them (pre-blackhead) as they usually do.  </li>
            <li> not knowing what concentration had been used on me, I figured better to go a little too weak than to risk a chemical burn.</li>
            <li> I just use a round cotton pad (not the same one I apply the toner with, I get a new one out).</li>
            <li> I know that this product can&#x27;t really be as expensive, since my mom used to buy a pure salicylic acid for so much (!) cheaper.</li>
            <li> I modified the instructions a bit because my skin is used to exfoliations by 10% benzoil peroxide which only made pimples smaller and face a bit dry.    </li>
            <li> -Face got lighter (can be seen in my pictures), and red spots from old acne lightened up slightly.  </li>
            <li> What typically takes 12-18 months to get rid of, is nearly gone after only 3 days!</li>
            <li> What I did notice though, was that the acne that was present was beginning to dry up and become smaller in size.</li>
            <li> There are many less irritating things to use.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY pale and the acne has left scarring which is very traumatizing in itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but this peel REALLY dries out my skin - just on the bottom have (jaw, lower cheek).</li>
            <li> I wasnt expecting much, but the results are unbelievable</li>
            <li> I know that I am not an ordinary case though because my skin is really tolerant to peels.  </li>
            <li> (do not apply to much of this one or leave on to long..nearly burned a small part of my skin on my chin applying too much/my skin has</li>
            <li> Just start out with the least amount of time, if it is your first peel to see how your skin will react.  </li>
            <li> After three treatments, old dark acne scores which had been around forever were practically ERASED.</li>
            <li> I’ve experimented with just about everything over the past 15 years and this has been really helpful.</li>
            <li> In the past I had noticed headaches and upset stomachs when I used too much salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li> After that experience i started to put a small dab on the pimples instead of my whole face.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used salicylic in the past and it didn&#x27;t work for you, it probably won&#x27;t now, What really cleared my acne up to this day</li>
            <li> I became so self-conscious that I found every excuse not to leave the house unless absolutely necessary.</li>
            <li> this product has dried out all my acne, COMPLETELY with in such a short period!</li>
            <li> It does burn/itch, but let it stay on for as long as possible (try to make it to the maximum of 8 minutes).</li>
            <li> I ended up changing it to 5 days and now I am actually seeing a minor difference.</li>
            <li> Long story short been trying everything under the sun.</li>
            <li> I am now 21 and although some may argue it&#x27;s a teenager thing I feel like I have had it quite long enough.</li>
            <li> will repurchase this when I run out, but it does last a long time and does wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But subsequent times I kept it on for long er with no problems.</li>
            <li> (I know that seems like a long time, but the peeling isn&#x27;t really obvious).  </li>
            <li> Got it in four days flat.  </li>
            <li> That only lasted as long as I kept going to his office for the treatments.</li>
            <li> Now I apply for longer times ( t &amp;#62; 20 min) and while it still stings at the beginning, the sensation doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> so this bottle will last a LONG time.</li>
            <li> So I thought I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough -</li>
            <li> I honestly had only one or two pimples that were getting irritating and forced me to use this product.</li>
            <li> First, for reference, I am a Black woman with a very dark skin tone who has suffered from moderate to severe acne since my teens.   </li>
            <li> For some reason, the first few times I used this product it didn&#x27;t sting as bad, but maybe that&#x27;s because when you have a breakout it stings more or maybe even with your skin during different seasons...</li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t burn off, my face didn&#x27;t remain red for long, I had no peeling!</li>
            <li> The next day i saw new breakouts on my forehead and jawline, it&#x27;s nothing major and the acne calmed down and dried out within 3 days.</li>
            <li> I still have a few bumps here and there, but I haven&#x27;t had any new break outs in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> (many blackheads due to oil &amp; large pores, random small bumps all over my face and infrequent cysts).</li>
            <li> I will admit, I did spot treat the next couple of days, which caused my T-zone to become dry and start peeling, but it&#x27;s a gel</li>
            <li> Simply apply it with a Q-tip 2-5 times a day to the molluscum areas &amp; they miraculously begin to dry up &amp; go away.</li>
            <li> with regular use, the dry skin that it causes will go away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There was definitely some redness and dry skin</li>
            <li> It seems to me like the most common complaint is that nothing happens with this product.</li>
            <li> The ane scars dissapeared and the acne breakouts were much less frequent.</li>
            <li> Sounds gross, but NOW they&#x27;ll dry up, pop, and go away, rather than sitting under my skin like glorified goosebumps.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m desperate to fade the scars, it would only make sense to eliminate the breakouts to prevent more scarring.</li>
            <li> I only do it once a week for about 4 minutes, but it has helped after 3 weeks with excema and dry patches.</li>
            <li> It felt like it burned, it forsted and the next day it was completely dry and scabbed.</li>
            <li> Product says use it once a week for 8 minutes, so far I&#x27;ve used it three times in five days for about half an hour each because I don&#x27;t see it doing anything.</li>
            <li> but this left my face dry even though I had acne and oily skin.</li>
            <li> SO start at the are where your skin is the thickest or less sensitive.</li>
            <li> BUT I do this only after careful patch tests, starting with one minute on the inside of my elbow and working up, minute by minute, on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure when this discoloration will get back to normal, but it&#x27;s been 2 months</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the scars and discoloration usually left over from acne are almost unnoticeable within a few days of a breakout and are completely gone about 2 weeks after that breakout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of acne treatments with poor to moderate success, including prescription acne medication.</li>
            <li> I never experienced acne until I turned 30 years old and when it came, it really came.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The next few times were more bearable, its the first 3-4 minutes that are a little uncomfortable as expected.</li>
            <li> I think it did help to make my pores appear smaller, if for no other reason that that less oil is being produced.</li>
            <li> It just had no effect at all, positive or negative.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight increase in zits (and I mean slight as in one or two zits every two or three weeks), but many reviews say this will subside, and I believe them.</li>
            <li> As for what the peel does for the acne, sore bumps under my skin that will begin to raise in a couple days totally disappear, ones that are closer to \\&quot;zit\\&quot; have the process speeded up and they reach zit that day, gone the following day, and just a little red the 3rd day.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I could only keep it on maybe a minute as it was really uncomfortable, and I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> There is usually no redness after unless I had any frosty areas which then turn brown and peel after a few days with no residual scarring beneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For creams I usually just hold the bottle neck firmly against the palm of my hand, quickly tip-blot the gel into my hand, and using my finger, mix it with a a bit of whatever.....  </li>
            <li> Anyways, long story short, my twin sister and i were discussing about skin issue&#x27;s and she recommended that i use this peel as it saved her skin when she was going through a bad phase with acne after her first pregnancy, seeing that she rarely</li>
            <li> Other than accutane (which only worked for the months I was on it), this product is the ONLY thing in over 25 years that has worked!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I can apply it at night to a developing pimple and the next day it will be gone, but other times, I will apply it at night and the pimple will still develop the next day.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few weeks ago and was extremely hopeful yet very apprehensive.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft to the touch now, I use far less makeup, and just need to exfoliate in the mornings to get rid of the dead skin.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, at first blemishes seemed to emerge immediately after doing a peel, but then also went away faster than usual.</li>
            <li> After using this peel 3 times (once every other day), I suddenly have white heads on that side!</li>
            <li> And, salicylic is the only acid that can be used, rather is encouraged to be used prior to other, stronger peels.  </li>
            <li> tried this again mulitple times (used once a week for about 8 weeks) and increased the time I left on every time, finally leaving it on for a half hour the last time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from adult-onset acne off and on for the past 3 years - which mainly has been along my jawline.  </li>
            <li> It dries everything out and you will have very dry, flaky, gross skin that will make you want to hide in your house for 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 18 years old and had some acne in my chin area and a little bit in my forehead.</li>
            <li> My cheeks are a little sensitive</li>
            <li> I see on my skin, as far as the sun spots go, just a little bit of improvement.  </li>
            <li> I think its very important to emphasize that initially your very likely to get a bad break out.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but have not had any bad reactions to this product besides the normal peeling which is not very bad.</li>
            <li> I was very worried because eczema has made it hard to put any product on my skin.</li>
            <li> And other would not dry out no matter what.</li>
            <li> Week and a half of using it every other day and my skin has peeled twice and returned to normal.       </li>
            <li> After the time is up, I wash my face with water and use some baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;After 12 applications, while I still have some scattered spots, the improvement is amazing, considering how bad my skin was.</li>
            <li> but it honestly wasn&#x27;t that bad.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea and the really bad kind.</li>
            <li> &amp; I thought that&#x27;d be no prob since I&#x27;ve put myself through such torture in the past to get clear skin.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t start seeing real results until I kept the peel on my skin for at least 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> After I couldn&#x27;t stand it any more, I rinsed off with cold water.</li>
            <li> Sure, it burns like crazy</li>
            <li> I tend to exfoliate my face like crazy, either with a face scrub or with a washcloth, but the peel exfoliates your skin so any more will result in irritation.  </li>
            <li> I used this peel two nights ago - the burning was intense, duh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products on the market for scar removal but always end up with disappointment.</li>
            <li> Ok so I got the product mailed in today, tested it under my chin, inner forearm, and on this ugly white cyst pimple on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I am dumbfounded, the product did absolutely nothing for me, not even negative things.&lt;br /&gt;Who</li>
            <li> It works well to clear up acne breakouts for a few days, but it has not stopped the breakout cycle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with a Medium to Dark Brown complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Renova in the past and this acid doesn&#x27;t give me the same sensitive feeling I have on the skin.</li>
            <li> Hmmm.. Is this thing supposed to clear my skin of dead cells and zits?</li>
            <li> i am African American with a dark skin tone, and this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> The next day I get dark spots that are as big as a quarter and</li>
            <li> It has only left dark spots all over my face.</li>
            <li> Professional quality for an amateur price- same effect as the spa/dermatologist!</li>
            <li> Keep the product on for as long as you can up to the 8 minutes recommend max for prime results.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions carefully, using it about once a week and starting with just one minute of time on my skin, and gradually working my way up to about 7 minutes.      </li>
            <li> My skin is not sensitive, so i will be looking for a stronger solution, maybe 30% salicylic, or 35% glycolic.</li>
            <li> so, it has to work in the long run.</li>
            <li> dots\\&quot; are fading &amp; I have hopes that this will take care of some minor sun damage as well.  </li>
            <li> Scaley, rough patches on my cheeks have almost entirely disappeared.</li>
            <li> I wish I had tried this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> For how long you cannot expose your face to the sun after applying this product?</li>
            <li> Days later no real results.</li>
            <li> so you can get away with leaving it on for a long time)</li>
            <li> and I could stand up to 6 minutes with this peel on my face; however, keeping this on my  face for so long resulted in my skin peeling between my eyes and around my nose and mouth.</li>
            <li> My face is not nearly as oily as it was before.  </li>
            <li> Not very noticeable, I went to work the next day with no issues.  </li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me in the long term.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a professional peel a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the girl with the long brown hair and bangs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No real results from that in the last 2 months</li>
            <li> Granted, I only spent $18.95.  </li>
            <li> I leave the peel on all night long.</li>
            <li> do get some minor visible peeling.</li>
            <li> What I do, based on some of the reviews I read here, is apply it on my face with a cotton pad avoiding the eyes and corners of the mouth and leave it on for as long as I feel like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a few months, I changed my facial cleansers, laundry detergent, tried several facial masks, Mario Badescu skin care, argan oil, and Tretinoin Gel (as prescribed from a dermatologist).  </li>
            <li> I am stoked and wish I would have researched and purchased this product a long time ago.. would have saved myself the frustration and time of going to the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> On the second application I had it on for 10 minutes with minimal stinging.</li>
            <li> it worked so well, it got rid of this strange bulging mark between my eyes that looked like  a wart or pimple that wouldnt go away.</li>
            <li> No,not for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> never really cared about my facial features until I met my husband</li>
            <li> also am a long time acne medication user.</li>
            <li> I wasted so much money going to the dermatologist over the last few years.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t ever probably leave on long at all</li>
            <li> I used this once a week for a few weeks and noticed that my rosacea outbreaks stopped completely.  </li>
            <li> My bottle is almost empty and I will definitely buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> How long you leave it on depends on your skin type.</li>
            <li> overall, I think this is money well spent.</li>
            <li> Burns if you leave it on too long</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s too long that it kinda bends when you dip and brush it on your face</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long I could stand to keep it</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews I was worried to leave it on too long, so I rinsed it off my face in about 5min.  </li>
            <li> Just after these few applications alot of my scaring has lightened considerably.</li>
            <li> Even my visits to dermotoligists, and taking prescription Retin-A did not clear my skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is bcos i am still in the \\&quot;it would get worse before it gets better</li>
            <li> I think that it may have even made my acne worse because I noticed that I would always get fresh pimples the day or two after using it.</li>
            <li> In addition to icing it, i also push the zit down while icing it, repeating that 3 times daily, but you have to start doing that before the zit has time to get bigger.</li>
            <li> But as soon as i stopped using it my acne slowed down tremendously, I&#x27;m starting to think it was the reason my acne never left those months</li>
            <li> In that break time though, my skin has stayed clear, with very few blemishes, and the oiliness in my t-zone has been definitely reduced.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I peel a lot, other times I peel very little, depending how much damage I have and how long I have waited in between peels.</li>
            <li> Use a high SPF, moisturize with a very small amount of emu oil and you are on your way to looking 10 years younger</li>
            <li> The second time I tried it, I left it on my face for less than 4 minutes.</li>
            <li> I patted my face with a towel and allowed my face to further dry for roughly 5 min.</li>
            <li> Not only does it help with my previous sun damage but also monthly breakouts and overall texture.  </li>
            <li> I am mixed with black, white, and Austrian, and I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I started using this as a mini-peel 2 days a week leaving only until it starts to tingle only slightly.  </li>
            <li> receving the product I tried it for the recommended time with nothing during, nor days after, the application.&lt;br /&gt;Frustrated, I left the peel on my skin the next application for over half an hour with no response.</li>
            <li> As a single consumer, I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on facial products that produce no results.</li>
            <li> two seasons later, when summer shifted into autumn, my skin was so dull and dry that nothing worked--masks, light scrubs, pore extractions----the nose was just dull and coated in dark enlarged pores with freckle-like blackheads from an entire summer of sebum clogged skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;- dark patches of skin near mouth and cheek due to mineral deficiency and hormonal imbalance</li>
            <li> I had stopped using anything on my face for such a long time, and it has left dark spots on my cheeks, rough patches on my chin, and pimples on my forehead and along my hairline.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money and, ironically, this product (which is by far the least expensive) has done the most to improve my skin&#x27;s appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Back to the results, the peel destroyed all the existing pimples a lot quicker than any other acne product on the market.  </li>
            <li> I would caution not leaving it on too long; the longest I&#x27;ve left it on is 5 mins, was trying to go for longer, max 8 mins and it irritated and left a scar when I inadvertently rubbed off the dead skin from not listening to my skin &amp; not rinsing when it was burning.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, it only felt like I had and while a little red, my face was not drastically damaged.</li>
            <li> Due to my recent cystic acne break-out I have been experimenting with every product out there which can provide some relief.</li>
            <li> Currently it feels like I spread a thin layer of Icy Hot on my face.  </li>
            <li> , rather it was extreme and left me scars (i didnt even poke the acne).</li>
            <li> When I apply other things on my face such as sunblock, my skin doesn&#x27;t sting compared to using the retinoid.</li>
            <li> I need a higher % of a peel this is so weak of a peel</li>
            <li> if you are going to use a peel for the first time, this might be the one for you, but it was way too weak for me</li>
            <li> The little white heads are gone and pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> only will I be purchasing this, I&#x27;ll probably experiment with their other varieties of peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you have to have the other tools to use it properly.</li>
            <li> There was one deep wrinkle and the other finer wrinkles.</li>
            <li> But I can definitely notice it as well as a lot of other reviewers on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I followed the directions explicitly, and only left it on for a little over a minute.</li>
            <li> This product does NOT make me bruise, incredibly red or make my skin turn brown like other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I am mad at myself for using glycolic before, because all glycolic acid does is burn the top layer of the skin and thins it out.</li>
            <li> I used it on my chin and forehead as I only have some small whiteheads  - nothing major.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and left it on for less than a minute each time, but still ended up w/ several brown patches of very dry, scabby skin.</li>
            <li> Also, when I feel one of those hard bump pimples starting to rise, I use a cotton swab to apply the peel to the pimple, and it is reduced almost completely overnight.  </li>
            <li> I have not used this for very long</li>
            <li> The amount you get lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I have had some bad breakouts on my chin for the last month or two, a couple of which would NOT go away or get better.</li>
            <li> it would actually instantly dry it up</li>
            <li> People told me that it was genetics, and nothing could ever change the way my skin was, and it really freaked me out because my skin was the source of a serious lack of confidence.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does dry my skin somewhat.</li>
            <li> and it seems to dry out pimples so you can flake off the skin faster</li>
            <li> This does dry up/heal stuff you may have messed with (like I do).  </li>
            <li> Pat dry.</li>
            <li> Pat dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li> It could just be dry</li>
            <li> After I finished with the water I then patted my face dry.</li>
            <li> Your face will peel but its like really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The oil cleanser should not be used twice, it would really dry up my skin and irritated it.    </li>
            <li> Afterwards when I dry the water out, the pimples become darkish.</li>
            <li> my face got really dry)</li>
            <li> My face gets really dry, but I want to get the maximum benefit from the peel</li>
            <li> When I dry my face</li>
            <li> I filled my sink with cold water and mixed in a couple tablespoons of baking soda and used that to rinse.  </li>
            <li> I have combination oily/ dry skin of my t-zone.</li>
            <li> Patted it dry with a towel and then used jojoba oil immediately after.</li>
            <li> I avoid this peel during winter ( dry season) and during peak summer.</li>
            <li> face dry,</li>
            <li> Pat face dry, no rubbing.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so dry</li>
            <li> All this product has done is severely dry out my skin rather than prevent or treat acne.</li>
            <li> I used Trader Joe&#x27;s coconut oil on spots that felt and looked dry</li>
            <li> My skin got extremely dry between applications.</li>
            <li> Powders will just magnify the dry</li>
            <li> I then applied a lavender witch hazel toner generously and waited for that to dry.</li>
            <li> For me the dry patches were my forehead, chin, and around my nose area-interestingly the oiliest parts of my face.</li>
            <li> This product WILL dry your skin out-</li>
            <li> I have combination oily &amp; dry skin</li>
            <li> Blot dry and immediately moisturize.  </li>
            <li> I know that sounds crazy, especially when you&#x27;ve been use to keeping your skin free of anything like that.</li>
            <li> At the age of 65, my skin is already severely dry and this product helps me remove that dryness and generate a softer skin.</li>
            <li> The blackheads just seem to dry out...and  DISAPPEAR.  </li>
            <li> I had just recently came back to it a few days ago because I had one bit of acne that was swelling up under my eye.</li>
            <li> To date I have probably wasted around $15,000 on peels, laser treatments, creams, and derm abrasions, only to have the acne flare back up and have scars return.     </li>
            <li> first used it in a few spots on my face (nose, cheek) where I was having small mini breakouts.</li>
            <li> but i realy want to get rid of some scars left om my face, for now im using pro active 3 step  and seems working alittle</li>
            <li> its really have left me very self conscious, and disappointed about how dark my scar looks after using this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that worked and after the third treatment you would never know I had trouble with acne.</li>
            <li> used this peel once a week for about six weeks, then cut back and only applied it every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> In the two weeks I have been using it, there has been no new pimples.  </li>
            <li> existing bumps reduced, no new bumps to speak of, oiliness solved, etc.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a few remaining on my right cheek, but they&#x27;re hardly visible.</li>
            <li> I cant find a single blackhead on my face.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have a single peel or anything resembling it.</li>
            <li> Being allergic to benzoyl peroxide, my options were limited to salcylic acid (I used to use OTC, 2%), antibiotics and retinol gels (tretinoin).</li>
            <li> Judging from my current state, should I tough it out and continue the use of this peel or stop now while my skin is still salvageable?&lt;br /&gt;(FYI, the acne developed around the third week of use.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of redness after I apply this product on my face, maybe because my face skin is very sensitive to this type of Acid, and one of my friend who learnt medicine told me that Salicylic Acid is not very good for Acne, since it may cause some dark element sediment deeply in our skin.</li>
            <li> I used a green tinted powder to tone down the redness, but thought that I was going to have to live with it the rest of my life.  </li>
            <li> seriously overnight it sucks it dry, a HUGE upside to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used products in the past that would clear up some of my acne</li>
            <li> I have some hyperpigmentatin from past cystic acne which this hasn&#x27;t done anything to clear up</li>
            <li> My Solution: I do NOT have sensitive skin because I have used almost a lot of stuff on my face in the past</li>
            <li> I am also africam american and will recommend this for dark skin.</li>
            <li> I am biracial and the scars take on a dark brown to red appearance.</li>
            <li> I have no more over 40 year old acne and everyone notices the difference.  </li>
            <li> I came off of accutane last year and still have some lingering scars and dark spots.</li>
            <li> &quot; My only complaints are the peeling skin and the sting factor when applied (although based on other reviews, these were expected).    </li>
            <li> So I finally decided to find something to treat the dark marks from pimple scars and the sunspots, and to manage those issues somehow.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I dropped the bottle while doing one of my peels, so I can&#x27;t say what consistent results past two months really looks like.</li>
            <li> Get a soft fan-shaped brush and dedicate a small glass custard bowl to your acid treatment.</li>
            <li> I get really dark spots left from the acne.</li>
            <li> so I tend to get really dark scars, especially around my mouth, chin, and jaw line.</li>
            <li> I am 28 years old and have battled acne for the past 10 years.  </li>
            <li> I usally start on the forehead, cheeks, then temple, side of my face and last one on my nose area, not freshly</li>
            <li> First time using this product my acne became worse then improved.</li>
            <li> My pores, acne scars, and blemishes are significantly decreased with consistent use of this product once a week.</li>
            <li> but they have decreased drastically, the skin on my cheeks looks a LOT smoother, its pretty fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I have a full bottle of useless product</li>
            <li> I always had pimples since 8th grade, and it got worse after my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Be careful though if you misuse it or leave it on too long</li>
            <li> I first started using this, my acne (which didn&#x27;t even develop until I turned 35) got worse</li>
            <li> My chin tends to get clogged pores resulting in either blackheads or large, painful zits and this is the only remedy I&#x27;ve tried that actually keeps the pores clear and even shrinks them.</li>
            <li> but I have had no adverse effects such as peeling, redness, irritation, etc., and I can say my skin is a little better than it used to be on a daily basis, though it was never that bad to begin with.  </li>
            <li> but I think the key is to really follow the instructions that come with it; take not exposing yourself to the sun and not using any skin products the day before as well very seriously.</li>
            <li> I measured about 1.5 mL of solution and administered the product using 4x4 gauze and gloves, starting with the forehead and working my way down my face.</li>
            <li> Applied SA with q-tips and left it on for 5 mins, although it stings and burns but calms down within a minute.</li>
            <li> only two down falls with this product is the burn, and the peeling, you may not peel at all, but know that it may be a possibility.ou needed to take care of stat you could dab this stuff on it as a spot treatment and</li>
            <li> My only two down falls with this product is the burn, and the peeling, you may not peel at all, but know that it may be a possibility.</li>
            <li> but the next I noticed the bumps had gone down just a bit in size.</li>
            <li> so after the peel i use a tiny amount to keep the skin moisturized ( a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> but i kept applying little by little first few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is good or bad?</li>
            <li> I was a bit afraid of home peels, but I find this easy to use.</li>
            <li> Im hoping with continued use my crows feet will be less noticeable and my pores get smaller.</li>
            <li> All of a sudden, one day I noticed that it was black.</li>
            <li> After about 6 weeks of use, I have less acne breakouts and my pores look much smaller.  </li>
            <li> -Face is less oily after application as well as for the next 24 hours or so.</li>
            <li> btw, i still have half the bottle left after 1 month use.    </li>
            <li> Much less red spots compared to 3 months ago.</li>
            <li> I usually use Queen Helen mint julip facial to help with my \\&quot;enlarged pores\\&quot; and it seemed to be only an immediate fix--</li>
            <li> I paid no attention to the pimples when I first started the peel because there was a stage that reviewers mentioned that it would get worst before it got better.   </li>
            <li> Copper is crucial because it helps prevent the skin from re-forming the type of abnormal scar tissue that is typical in hypertrophic scars.</li>
            <li> has made my pores appear less sunken in and smaller.  </li>
            <li> I put it on for a minute and peeled ever so slightly for the next day or so.</li>
            <li> My skin peeled, but the white and black heads remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I just said, my skin is dry, but I expected that from this product.</li>
            <li> My Ice Pick scarring looked slightly less deep after 1 peel too.     </li>
            <li> I did it on my face with less burning methods and my shoulders are following.  </li>
            <li> I did it on my face with less burning methods and my shoulders are following.  </li>
            <li> I continued to use proactive and only had a small amount of actual peeling.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the slight skin bleaching effect.</li>
            <li> and I only noticed slight tingling on part of my forehead.</li>
            <li> and I started with a slight itchy tingly feel and progressed to a moderate burn.</li>
            <li> This morning the redness from recent acne is almost gone, the acne scars has been slightly minimized</li>
            <li> My pores are noticeably smaller and I now use less foundation because I no longer have problems hiding blemish marks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find it sooner, that I accidentally knocked the bottle over and spilled like half of it out, and that I didn&#x27;t take pictures to document my progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin is much less oily and my pores much smaller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month, but I see slight improvement.</li>
            <li> I still get pimples but its a lot less and they are smaller.</li>
            <li> However, this product cost less and provides the same effect as the $150.00 chemical peels I receive at the dermatologist office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the skin medica foam wash at night followed by the acne stop by skin obsession and Aveeno Mosturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a black female.</li>
            <li> there are variations of color (red, brown, yellow)  on your face though it is still awkward--sometimes you will have dead skin in your hair or falling on your jacket!</li>
            <li> there are variations of color (red, brown, yellow)  on your face though it is still awkward--sometimes you will have dead skin in your hair or falling on your jacket!</li>
            <li> For over three months I have had a small patch of bumps on the left side of my face that were definitely pimples but never came to a head.</li>
            <li> I had some peeling around my nose, and on my cheeks a couple of days later, and my T-zone-oily skin was less shiny.</li>
            <li> I suggest testing on a small patch of your skin prior to testing your entire face.  </li>
            <li> , what have you been doing?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are still a COUPLE of tiny black heads on my forehead</li>
            <li> For literally a year and a half I had this stubborn pimple on my left cheek that just would not go away.</li>
            <li> My face is somewhat resistant to Salicylic Acid because of regular extra strength face washes and creams every day for the past 10 years</li>
            <li> Use only a small amount in the effected area only!</li>
            <li> I also noticed that I only had a shinny nose where my entire face is usually oily.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed that my skin is smoother and is less likely to break out!  </li>
            <li> so I never leave it on for longer than a minute and a half, but I&#x27;m definitely not blown away by the results.</li>
            <li> I also have 4-5 milia (tiny white hard pimple things that never go away) that have formed around my eyes in the last year or so, probably due to the anti-aging gunk</li>
            <li> Since I started using this I have not gotten a single cystic acne flare-up and have probably only had about 5 or so little pimples here</li>
            <li> My skin is very pale and sensitive</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why it only picks ONE spot out of the 20 that are on my face to mess with.   </li>
            <li> and I noticed that these spots seem to be &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; than other unaffected areas of my face.</li>
            <li> and I use the salicylic acid to fight against them and also to regenerate new skin cells on the affected parts of my body so that I have no stains that are left behind after</li>
            <li> Just as effective as dermabrasion surgery - but less painful in your pocket - in smoothing out lines and wrinkles and in even-toning your skin.</li>
            <li> My face was a bit of a disaster for a few days - some pimples mixed with dry skin</li>
            <li> when i recieved the product i placed the solution on a scar on my nose for a few minutes, within seconds after i washed it off the scar has turned complete black.</li>
            <li> It stings every single time!</li>
            <li> The next morning my felt tight.  </li>
            <li> I managed to cover my entire face but only left it on for a minute and then quickly washed it off with lots of very cold water.</li>
            <li> There were probably 3 small dry patches but you couldn&#x27;t see them through my makeup and after the second day I used a dry washcloth and wiped the dry skin off.  </li>
            <li> But this is something I&#x27;m willing to add to my weekly skin care regimen because the results have been so dramatic.  </li>
            <li> After the first application, I noticed a dramatic change.</li>
            <li> You can see pretty dramatic results from just one peel.</li>
            <li> The other areas I mentioned are another problem area that also had an old acne scar that looked like a small punch hole.</li>
            <li> Rinse with lots of cold water and be sure you moisturize afterwards or your face will feel really tight and start flaking.</li>
            <li> It said to leave it on for only a little time and then increase the time.</li>
            <li> Even a little white head would leave a scar.</li>
            <li> The next morning, i saw that my face peeled a little at the side of my mouth ( probably missed the moisturizer there )</li>
            <li> This little bottle also seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to be working, and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little under 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Initially it did little.</li>
            <li> Says it will be a little red, maybe peel, burn..</li>
            <li> and i saw a little frosting on my forehead, chin and above my lips</li>
            <li> While that is pleasing in and of itself, the main reason I bought this item was for my acne scars (merely a few small hardly-noticeable bumps) that I have had for around 5 years now.</li>
            <li> I never see any peeling or effect other than dry skin.</li>
            <li> It did not leave any dry and flaky skin as other products did.</li>
            <li> In about three days post use, my skin will have some dry patches or other bumps.  </li>
            <li> Firstly, I&#x27;d like to make it clear that while I have a few small zits consistently, my acne is not that bad compared to some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> My skin got incredibly dry, which is to be expected, but no difference other than that.  </li>
            <li> but today (2nd day after peel) they still are minimal!!!  </li>
            <li> I applied the acid with a cotton ball all over my face and more generously on bad acne spot areas (I also rubbed alittle harder on these spots).</li>
            <li> and it is one of the most painful experiences I have ever put my face through.</li>
            <li> but the scars stays and make my face real dry.</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve been using it weekly and my skin remains clear.</li>
            <li> But, the size and redness did not last as long in the past.  </li>
            <li> Like I said above my only complaint was not getting 100 mL.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that a dark patch of skin has developed over my past acne</li>
            <li> (Perhaps that is why I am not thrilled with my results thus far)</li>
            <li> Left it on for a few minutes, and took a shower.</li>
            <li> Then two days later I start to peel severely and this lasts a few days.</li>
            <li> This made a noticible difference after only a few days.  </li>
            <li> The skin feels same before and after application, but results can been seen a few hours after the application as well as increased results over 24-48 hours.</li>
            <li> I NEVER had a chemical peel in my life, so i was really careful with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product back in August of 2010 and used a few times.</li>
            <li> The item was carefully packed and got here before the scheduled arrival date.  </li>
            <li> Plus I had to rub my skin to get the dead skin off 5 days later.</li>
            <li> Supprisingly, the next two days, the acne became dead.</li>
            <li> Word of warning:  If you are applying close to your eyelashes and they get wet with it</li>
            <li> As expected, I saw no results from this product.</li>
            <li> The reported \\&quot;burning and tingling\\&quot; was minimal and no visible changes in my skin were seen.</li>
            <li> Skin felt cleaner and the rough patch on my chin had improved.  </li>
            <li> The rough patch on my chin has no visible change as well.</li>
            <li> To still dripping wet face rub in oil.  </li>
            <li> Soon (about 30 sec.</li>
            <li> I expected this and had a fan nearby.</li>
            <li> They are currently fading with each use (weekly), the really numerous small ones that weren&#x27;t so dark have already disappeared.</li>
            <li> Seems to work as expected</li>
            <li> Yes, it stings but that should be expected.</li>
            <li> They are not very absorbent</li>
            <li> Careful if you have whiteheads that are in the process of bursting.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions, expected to experience some level of peeling and nothing happened.</li>
            <li> The redness disappears within a few hours and the peeling occurs the next couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your face should NOT be wet with the product-</li>
            <li> Used over 2 mos, and no real change.</li>
            <li> Even if you have done a few peels please start at a low % aha peel.  </li>
            <li> so I put it on them a last and a few minutes after the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll report back in a few weeks to report my results</li>
            <li> I went into the sun a few days after a peel for only about 10 mins without sun block.</li>
            <li> I only have the red marks left behind now, which I hope will go away soon.</li>
            <li> but it did not work as well as i had expected.  </li>
            <li> I decided I spent money on it</li>
            <li> I have minimal underthe surface pimples.</li>
            <li> (It usually only takes me a few seconds to apply all over)</li>
            <li> I then stopped using for a few weeks, and went back to just using a clay mask once a week to give my skin a break.</li>
            <li> Redness afterwards was minimal and went away within about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> so be careful it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Money well spent in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I always keep a wet towel around to ease the burning.</li>
            <li> BTW I&#x27;ve been to dermatologists in the past, ALL of them told me that it would cost thousands of dollars to apparently do what I&#x27;ve done for under $20.     </li>
            <li> Carefully consider to use..</li>
            <li> But the darkening is simply just the scarred tissue that is burning off, so after a few days, it will peel off and skin underneath will be lighter.</li>
            <li> So optimistically, I waited for the next few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AND I have been having flare ups on my forehead and chin for the last few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but be careful not to burn your skin</li>
            <li> Not much yet though.</li>
            <li> Be cautions and extremely careful if you choose to use this product.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks I noticed that the pimple had turned into a white head.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL</li>
            <li> Besides, I have spent 100s of dollars over the years on products that didn&#x27;t work, so what is another $18?</li>
            <li> I expected this to remove my scars, instead it madde my skin look super-clean.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use sunscreen because it makes my face oily, so I am careful with how often I use this product.</li>
            <li> This product burned my skin, which was expected.</li>
            <li> I have had one for over a year and after using this twice in a week, I noticed after the second time that the blackhead seemed to be dried up.</li>
            <li> It burns and itches, but it&#x27;s only for a few minutes weekly.  </li>
            <li> But like I said, I&#x27;ve only used it a few times</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s expected with a product this concentrated.</li>
            <li> It definitely takes a few times to build up a tolerance to this product.  </li>
            <li> You have to used it everyday, especially when you&#x27;re using a chemical peel.  </li>
            <li> If you are inexperienced, you will burn your skin.  </li>
            <li> But be careful....</li>
            <li> I have a few different acids I rotate through throughout the year, glycolic and lactic, and a combo of the two.</li>
            <li> But be careful, you are really NOT supposed to rub it into your skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after using the product a second time, I developed red, bumpy skin around my chin that still has not gone away</li>
            <li> Be careful to use this type of Acid.</li>
            <li> I would be careful if you are not a licensed esthetician.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it would be harsh and potentially burn my skin...</li>
            <li> Be careful, it will burn and sting...</li>
            <li> Roughly 2 years ago I slowly started to make the switch to natural cleansers and treatments.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still not an intolerable burn though, as long as you use the baking soda and keep up on applying the cetaphil whenever your face feels even a little bit dry the day you use the peel.</li>
            <li> I also noticed other large pores shrinking into small pores, AND my small pores disappearing.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, and did have some redness and dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with dry skin or excessive peeling outside of sun damage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect it to be 100% effective, but wow, no more ugly skin!</li>
            <li> The only break I got was if I stopped eating anything with a significant amount of sugar in it, I might not break out so bad.  </li>
            <li> There is no improvement in skin condition, I get twice as much acne AFTER using it - this is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> But my main complaint is that unfortunately for me, it didn&#x27;t seem to have made much of a  difference after 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> product is NOT too harsh at all and doesn&#x27;t burn my face (leaving it red for days) like other products have.</li>
            <li> Not easy to face the public, but the night is darkest just before the dawn!     </li>
            <li> Also, the salicylic acid peel really burned, much worse than the other peels I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I will start using it on other parts of my face in the next few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> recently underwent a series of laser treatments for my face, hoping that if I had less or no hair, I would have less clogged pores that would become acne.</li>
            <li> 20% solution is too weak to do a decent job of erasing age spots and other blemishes.</li>
            <li> I used to have rosacea outbreaks at least a few times a week, which consisted mainly of redness and flushing.  </li>
            <li> However, encouraged by the positive reviews, I stuck with it and the amount of time these negative results lasted has gone down considerably (less than a day and during that time it&#x27;s less noticeable now).    </li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne since the age of 11 and have done all the usual to help clear up my skin condition with little result.  </li>
            <li> I have some minor acne, and a problem with clogged pores, but unfortunately this product did not seem to clear my skin at all, even after several months of use.      </li>
            <li> Every few day, a layer would peel off, and the scar is almost totally flat now.</li>
            <li> I searched for the last two years and nobody had a real answer for what African Americans can do for this type of scar beside laser treatment, which is very expensive.</li>
            <li> Months later the horror of bad back acne started to resurface and began creating new scars, so I don&#x27;t know what the progress could have potentially been.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this item, but unfortunately it has not worked for me.</li>
            <li> SO these mini-breakouts I&#x27;ve been getting, mainly appear on my forehead, in clusters of very small little zits.</li>
            <li> I also use and ultrasonic cleansing tool on a daily basis and no my skin is not irritated or raw.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd because my skin is dry and it breaks out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i left it on four minutes the first time before rinsing with cold water.</li>
            <li> I suggest applying this peel to your forehead and jaw 1st because those areas can withstand a longer burn, wash off, THEN apply this stuff to your sensitive areas 1 at a time ( below the eyes,nose,around mouth) or you&#x27;ll seriously burn yourself like I did.     </li>
            <li> , my pores have shrunk drastically, I have no more bumps or uneven skin, the skin tone has evened out, and my skin is baby soft.</li>
            <li> If you peeled too much last time, then leave it on a little shorter (resulting in less peeling).  </li>
            <li> A little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Skin looked slightly firmer after one treatment, and every single one of my blemishes had shrank.</li>
            <li> I would not call my skin sensitive, I&#x27;ve used retinoids before, I&#x27;ve used harsh acne treatments, but this stuff is very harsh.</li>
            <li> I had VERY LITTLE peeling the following day</li>
            <li> The day after use, your skin feels like a sunburn, a little tight and red.  </li>
            <li> I have experienced worst breakouts than I did previous to using.  </li>
            <li> However, the more you use the treatment, the less painful it gets.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin especially in the T-Zone and previous problems with uneven skin tone and enlarged pores.&lt;br /&gt;Since getting on a skincare regimen of Philosophy&#x27;s Purity</li>
            <li> Saturday when I woke up my skin felt dry but tight.</li>
            <li> time, my skin started to feel dry, achy, and tight like I was wearing a mask that was tightening my face---</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this now for over 2 weeks using it every other day</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to put gel on every day I will put on every other day for 8 mins</li>
            <li> At first i was skeptical of this acid peel, but changed my mind soon after.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I see the difference, but my co-worker said my face looked different.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4 starts out of 5 due to the pain.  </li>
            <li> I had no idea other than my nose</li>
            <li> I also alternate with TCA 10% peel so not sure if that could be it as well.</li>
            <li> Instead of a spot treatment I used a small brush to cover larger areas.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m not really sure about this product.</li>
            <li> but i think it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re closer to the surface due to the peeling of my nose.</li>
            <li> Not many products actually work</li>
            <li> There are two other points I&#x27;d like to bring to attention.  </li>
            <li> I have triedmany other products including Proactive.  </li>
            <li> One disappeared but the other came up.</li>
            <li> Having read other reviews, I assume it would happen.</li>
            <li> Splash face with really cold water for a full minute&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several chemical peels in the past from dermatologist but being a graduate student, I don&#x27;t have the funds to afford them now.</li>
            <li> I also decided that I would use the peel every other day (3x/week)for 6 weeks before stopping and giving my skin a break.</li>
            <li> I have not gone outside yet or slept yet, so I will give this a few weeks and update!</li>
            <li> Also, I have never been to a dermatologist for prescription treatment and have never had a chemical peel mainly due to the costs involved.     </li>
            <li> My skin looks quite a bit clearer with a few minor cystic blemishes here and there.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day until peeling takes place.</li>
            <li> Works well in conjunction with other products for acne/aging skin.  </li>
            <li> for customer service, i bought item from Switzerland, and one bottle (other bottle was lactic acid) and</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to try Accutane or any other prescription medication.  </li>
            <li> It looked like dried up plastic peeling from being in the sun too long.  </li>
            <li> The truth is pimples stay present for a small period of time on a person&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t happen due to the expanse.    </li>
            <li> Usually those last about a year for me, now they are all gone in about a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recomend buying the small bottle to see if it works for you, then moving up to the larger bottle afterward.</li>
            <li> I also use the other acid peels on this website.  </li>
            <li> Before you apply this product I will recommend testing it on a small section of the skin prior to use on face.  </li>
            <li> been searching for a product that would shrink my dime sized pores without aggravating the rosacea (like other products do).</li>
            <li> They were completely closed!     </li>
            <li> It was a mixture of three acids left on the face for no more than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I had a pimple on my neck the other day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a long time and have used it few times.</li>
            <li> I also have questions about whether or not I should use mask (from other brands) or acne cream in between the usage of the Salicylic peel.  </li>
            <li> I also used a fan to blow my face because other reviewers suggested it and it does seem to help.</li>
            <li> At the beginning, it was a bit alarming because I had dark brown patches but after the \\&quot;burnt\\&quot; bits came off, the skin underneath was smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Follow directions carefully as warned!  </li>
            <li> and I am extremely please with results.</li>
            <li> I saw other people who also got this.</li>
            <li> I was told that it worked for other people.  </li>
            <li> However, I did not end up burning my skin at all, and I did not have any other adverse reaction (skin peeling/flaking, irritation, etc).</li>
            <li> Mostly due to my period and the fact that the salicylic acid brings out pimples to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> Rinse with cool water, not too cold, and NOT hot.</li>
            <li> He told me of this product and his regiment (don&#x27;t all acne sufferers have one)he suggested that I give it a try as there was nothing to lose other than some money.</li>
            <li> it stings which is scary at first, but after it goes away, it does not return.  </li>
            <li> I did note the information packet references more on acne concerns, than eliminating the brown spots associated with aging.. :-(</li>
            <li> goals for the peel were to speed the fading of past acne scars on my cheeks, reduce the size of the pores in my T-zone and improve overall complexion.</li>
            <li> After 5 minutes of application, I just add my other skin-care products.</li>
            <li> keep this on for 10 minutes at the longest, and usually for spot treatment on specific acne scars.</li>
            <li> I have used it almost exclusively on the nose, along with a couple other problem areas.</li>
            <li> (I use it every other day unless my skin gets too peely)  </li>
            <li> I use this in conjuntion with other homeopathic products because I tried everything under the sun and nothing has worked.  </li>
            <li> I then started taking tetracyline for my acne for over 6 months and then learned about antibiotic resistance, so I stopped since there was no change and did not want to try other antibiotics to target the bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just a small red bump of what it was!</li>
            <li> I left the product on for 10 mins, felt a little stinging and had a little redness using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every other day or leaving 2 days apart</li>
            <li> If you know your skin&#x27;s trends, you should apply this following the directions on the insert before you usually have breakouts as well as any time you have a breakout because this treats mine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike other acne products</li>
            <li> but it also had some other</li>
            <li> and I am not aware because I do notice that the spots are fading a bit</li>
            <li> but I like other types of acids as well.</li>
            <li> I heeded the other reviewers caution regarding time.  </li>
            <li> The past two times I&#x27;ve left it on for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m not one of those other reviewers saying \\&quot;boohoo</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers I created a baking soda paste (just add water)</li>
            <li> I actually mixed the baking soda and water and put it in a small plastic container and keep it in my fridge</li>
            <li> So the next few times I&#x27;d used this, I used a small fan blowing on my side, not directly in front of me.</li>
            <li> I noticed the marks got extremely lighter but the process of putting this on your skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;After washing off, there was some small areas that &#x27;frosted&#x27;, meaning that it was still WHITE.</li>
            <li> I do have to admit that it is uncomfortable to use at first.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed but the price was ok</li>
            <li> It is oily and I get small acne on my forehead with larger blemishes on my cheeks and jawline.  </li>
            <li> Please be careful with this product!</li>
            <li> So please be careful and apply with caution!</li>
            <li> I was using this in congestion with other exfoliating face wash.</li>
            <li> a little dry make</li>
            <li> , I still see a few small pimples every day, and there&#x27;s the occasional larger breakout of 10-20 little pimples.  </li>
            <li> , I spent thousands of dollars, that went down the drain.</li>
            <li> I initially started with 2 minute application on certain spots on my face followed  by ample washing with cold water and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have to make sure I never run out because I noticed after not using for a while then starting up again that my skin starts peeling really bad instead of consistently using and after a while the peeling isn&#x27;t as bad using every week.</li>
            <li> I was very careful in the beginning.</li>
            <li> I would be very very careful.</li>
            <li> I noticed very minimal peeling, but my skin improved drastically, even not being at the eight minute mark.</li>
            <li> At the end,  I get a Q-tip and apply it very carefully to the milia closer to my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Even the fumes off of the stuff will cause your eyes to tear up, so be very very careful if youare working close to your eyes.  </li>
            <li> You have to be very careful to keep it away from eyes, nostrils and mouth.  </li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s time to rinse your face, very carefully rinse over and over and over again for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> I use a q-tip to apply very carefully</li>
            <li> Very few deep blackheads now.</li>
            <li> All and all, it does work just be VERY careful with it.</li>
            <li> I was having acne issues along with chapped cheeks and dry itchy skin from the harsh winter winds at my high-altitude (endlessly winter seeming) college.  </li>
            <li> so i sent email to customer service and wrote them that bottle was broken and they agreed to sent me a new bottle.</li>
            <li> do the peel no more than once a week and as other reviews have stated do it on a few days/nights before, if you will be going out as it does make your skin a little sensitive.</li>
            <li> YOU CANNOT USE ON ACTIVE BREAKOUTS.</li>
            <li> And I started noticing pits in my face where active acne was.</li>
            <li> It did lighten the scars and in some cases when i had an active zit</li>
            <li> so hopefully this peel will help with the red marks left behind.   </li>
            <li> Although the peel is painful it has definitely been worth it.  </li>
            <li> Also, the active acne on my nose and chin, when it is drying up, flakes quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> I washed it off quickly with some cold water as per the instructions.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just a waste and could possibly dry out your skin.)    </li>
            <li> def helped to fade some acne scars i have plus heal active acne.  </li>
            <li> It only left me with darker spots and unhealthy burned/tanned</li>
            <li> I cleanse with African Black Soap &amp; add a few drops of Jojoba Oil to my face while cleansing w/the black soap.</li>
            <li> It KILLS active acne in its tracks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It KILLS active acne in its tracks)  </li>
            <li> regiment now consists of Aveeno Active Naturals Ultra Calming Foaming Cleanser, along with Acnefree salicyclic foam that you leave on the faceand</li>
            <li> It can be heavy otherwise, but my skin is dry after the peel and the Vanicream works well for me.</li>
            <li> I have active acne, acne scars, sun damage, and the beginning of some not-so-fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Once in a while they will get inflamed and swell up as active cysts.</li>
            <li> I have been researching for a peel that could help reduce my pores and help soften the appearance of my indented acne scars (boxcar &amp; rolling) which my cystic acne left behind during my teenage years for a period of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just put this on it for 5 minutes then rinse it off with cold water and by the end of the day it will be gone; occasionally I&#x27;ve had to do that twice (5 min each time) in one day but really and truly the zit is gone after that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very bright, so against the instructions, I used it again the next night.  </li>
            <li> At first i followed the directions and put a very thin coat on my face and let it sit for 4 or so minutes.  </li>
            <li> I had my acne down to just minimal dark spots.</li>
            <li> I had pretty much the worst breakout of my entire life, and this stopped it in its tracks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The dark mask around my mouth is lightening up, but that could be in combination with other products I&#x27;ve been using on days I don&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> Miraculously, the pimples dried up almost overnight and the dark spots have begun to shrink, dry up and flake away.</li>
            <li> my skin becomes extremely dry and after i use a moisturizer it feels a little softer than usual but this only lasts for a few hours.</li>
            <li> problem: extremely oily skin with huge pores and a bad case of rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;d</li>
            <li> I have spent several hundreds of dollars on professional peels, and I finally got sick of it.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin peel and burns a little bit while applied to my face, but that is to be expected with a \\&quot;peel\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My cheeks were a little pink after using it but it went away after 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have done a lot of research and found out that the skin was asking me to take care of it since it was black and thickening due to sun damage and improper care.    </li>
            <li> course, as other reviews say, the product does slightly burn.</li>
            <li> After three uses at once a week for less than two minutes on my face due to a burning feeling, I&#x27;m tossing it.  </li>
            <li> My pores may be smaller now, but it&#x27;s hard to tell.  </li>
            <li> My chin has blackheads &amp; these hard bumps with a deep rooted &amp;#34;bulb&amp;#34; on the inside.</li>
            <li> I have also used it to spot treat some of the acne, the area gets little dry, then becomes darker and little browner and then flakes off.</li>
            <li> so my first application I left on for 4-5 minutes, bad choice.</li>
            <li> first day I kept it on for 5 minutes and the next day I had a really bad pimple I did not have the day before</li>
            <li> the first time i used this it burned so bad i could only handle seconds to a minute</li>
            <li> My jaw line and neck was filled with painful cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I am a 46 year old male who has had bad acne from my 20&#x27;s until present.</li>
            <li> It also helps to minimize dark acne scars.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with blocked pores and dark marks all over my face from acne.</li>
            <li> but I do not want to take them anymore for possible negative side</li>
            <li> but she had dark skin patches on her cheeks.</li>
            <li> Now I have 3 visits from spots, all of them dark and kinda hurt.</li>
            <li> To me, this wasn&#x27;t worth the possibility of cold sores, so I stopped using the product.  </li>
            <li> and there isn&#x27;t a long list of ingredients which could potentially interact poorly with the acid that just ate at my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any person of color who is trying to get rid of dark scars faster.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to work my way up to the HQ+ since that is the one that is for \\&quot;dark marks\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Also, I have dark skin</li>
            <li> I Still have dark spots but since using this peel, they have continue to lighten.</li>
            <li> Processes such as this one are common in nature.  </li>
            <li> It cleaned up a lot the acne on my face including the dark spots and the pimples.</li>
            <li> My dark spots got lighter.  </li>
            <li> Please hope the dark spots and dark patches will go</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please help me with treatment for the dark spots.</li>
            <li> no success in clearer skin.</li>
            <li> usually use this two days before a long weekend</li>
            <li> usually use this two days before a long weekend</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in hopes of getting rid of my acne scars and this junk made the dark marks on my face even darker.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product caused skin discoloration as well as dark bumps that bled.</li>
            <li> 35% on the dark spots as a spot treatment as well.</li>
            <li> , you have to be very constant and wait at least 3 weeks or so to see how it works.</li>
            <li> I average at home peels bi-monthly with peel types ranging from lactic acid (40%), glycolic (10%), and now this salicyclic acid peel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Hispanic and have medium to dark skin</li>
            <li> I like this for spot acne and dark spot treatment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly, truly not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> Just go see a doctor, not worth it.</li>
            <li> recommend this product for those who want to get rid of dark spots on their face.</li>
            <li> I bought a product at Walgreens, but the vehicle evaporated so fast that the product was useless after about 60%.  </li>
            <li> Rubbing causes a burn and it seemed to make the dark spots darker.</li>
            <li> This stuff has, at least, improved his condition and lightened some of the redness left by the acne.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even make direct eye contact with anyone for fear that they were looking at my horribly broken out face caked with makeup and powder to hide the volcanous ruptures underneath.</li>
            <li> There was one tiny place that a thick piece of skin came</li>
            <li> The embeaded white heads have slowly sufaced and exfoliated too.</li>
            <li> i currently have 5 pimples that are in the process of diminishing slowly.</li>
            <li> The acne got worse and i developed dark scarring.</li>
            <li> I have been repeating it and have not had harsh results, just the expected peeling.</li>
            <li> When I woke up the next morning, I had thick brown scabs all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I’m always checking the mirror to see how much dead skin is visible and trying to find ways to remove it without prematurely peeling off the skin that’s not ready to come off yet.</li>
            <li> Egyptian goddess&#x27; bathed in sour goat milk to \\&quot;glow\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I also want to try different brands once I am done--not because I am unhappy but because I am new and also want to try others to compare.</li>
            <li> In the morning it will look nice, but then after lunch the makeup looks dry and disgusting.</li>
            <li> I have accomplished in less than 2 weeks what I was unable to accomplish in years seeing a dermatoligist.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about using this peel and you&#x27;ve never used anything but hand soap on your skin, I would say put the credit card down and do some research before you buy.</li>
            <li> I apply to my forehead, down my nose, and then to my chin, and then do cheeks and the skin around my nose.  </li>
            <li> Down to the neck line.</li>
            <li> I applied the peel using a Q-tip and started with my forehead working my way down my face and then to my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I started with my forehead and worked my way down.</li>
            <li> Well, I was not let down.  </li>
            <li> This will take the intensity of the burn down.</li>
            <li> The stinging sensation will die down after 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> After 3 uses I noticed my acne had gone down noticeably.</li>
            <li> I had quite a lot of spots on my shoulders and down my neck</li>
            <li> since even though it brings down my flare-ups, the skin shedding can be embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Rinsing with a shower head is quicker, as well as calming down your skin faster so the burning sensation will go away faster too.</li>
            <li> was all just cash down the drain in comparison to this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading the instructions, I wiped down with alcohol and used a gauze pad to apply the peel all over my face for a minute.</li>
            <li> I hope to use this peel to wear down the bumps and purge the cysts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could ask for a change - bring down the price.</li>
            <li> once I rinsed I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in my skin, nor could I after 2 weeks of using this product every other day!</li>
            <li> I get the same, if not better, results from this product!</li>
            <li> And as other people have said, you want to wash it off your face with the coldest water you can find!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no pain aside from the initial burn of the peel and my hyperpigmentation is almost a thing of the past!  </li>
            <li> It is also causing my dark patches from previous pimples to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dark spots on my cheeks have lightened slightly.</li>
            <li> I have dark marks where previous acne has been.</li>
            <li> Also, once you rinse off with very cold water, it will continue to burn for a few more minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  been using it for well  over 6 months now and this little bottle lasts a long time, considering you need very little of it.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, my acne is hormonal, and I get painful large red cysts.</li>
            <li> It looked like a severe sunburn, I guess (never really experienced a sunburn that bad), but it looked like the peel was pretty intense</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and leave it on for a few minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> I used q-tips and with a small tip not very much was getting on my skin.</li>
            <li> It will make you break out with small little pimples the first few times, but that is just getting the old bad stuff out of your skin.</li>
            <li> but after two months, the new ones still come out near the area where the old ones are and it is ANNOYING!  </li>
            <li> I also want to try different brands once I am done--not because I am unhappy but because I am new and also want to try others to compare.r skin has to purge once the dead layers come off--</li>
            <li> It burned so badly that my eyes teared up, and after I washed my face, my skin was left very flushed.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight peeling in places my skin can be</li>
            <li> By day two, my skin had broke out slightly again</li>
            <li> I have/had bumpy skin but with each peel I can see a lot of progress and it looks like my skin is smoother and less bumpy.</li>
            <li> My skin is much less oily.</li>
            <li> My breakouts are fewer and Scars are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I bought this along with Dudu Osun black soap.</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t apply again in less than 5 days.  </li>
            <li> but it was much less uncomfy &amp; I could leave it on longer.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser I used that time was a Cuticura bar soap (drugstore.com) &amp; that&#x27;s a lot less drying.  </li>
            <li> I am a black woman, with caramel skin tone---</li>
            <li> and I guarantee you&#x27;ll have smoother skin in less than a month.  </li>
            <li> Afterwards, my skin started peeling slightly around the chin.</li>
            <li> But at the begining of the third week, my acne sudenly tended to serious as a month ago.</li>
            <li> I usually have small pimples every morning, and larger cysts maybe once a week.  </li>
            <li> My wrinkles are much less noticeable and my skin looks a lot healthier.</li>
            <li> The results are the same as paying for an expensive facial.  </li>
            <li> I have brown skin that breaks out monthly and leaves black heads.  </li>
            <li> directions that come with it are less than desirable and look rather unprofessional.</li>
            <li> I typically use it on Fridays and leave it on for the maximum 8 minutes</li>
            <li> Skin is slightly flaking, applying lotion often.</li>
            <li> Breaking out slightly</li>
            <li> , I started to see a reduction in redness, less oiliness, and hair follicles surfacing where there hadn&#x27;t been any, since they were clogged with dirt and oil.  </li>
            <li> Skin less oily too.  </li>
            <li> I had previous scars.</li>
            <li> In 2001 called around and was told by everyone on Harley Street that dermabrasion and skin peels were not for black skin tones</li>
            <li> I could feel my face started to produce less oil  </li>
            <li> When i was half way through Salicylic Acid, I bought Glycolic 35 gel peel because website says that if used together it will give deeper peel.</li>
            <li> I am almost half way through glycolic and on my face</li>
            <li> can now confirm this has given me lot of black spots on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Additionally, some of my synerisis redness is less over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Previously I had raised bumps (that hurt when inflamed) on both my cheeks.</li>
            <li> But thats why i gave it 4 starts because the acne it created was not MILD</li>
            <li> The directions say it may tingle slightly when applied...</li>
            <li> After application there is a slight tingling sensation, which lets you know its working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a previous salicylic acid 20% n</li>
            <li> Hopefully it starts to lighten the spots from previous breakouts.</li>
            <li> I had no noticable peeling or redness afterward, and a slight improvement in the texture of my skin (smoother).</li>
            <li> As advertised, the strength is about 20% (I have had 30% peels before and this is slightly weaker).</li>
            <li> Holy COW!</li>
            <li> but I saw a lot less peeling on areas of my face besides my nose.</li>
            <li> Wish it works with less peeling.</li>
            <li> One peel a week, or sometimes less</li>
            <li> It also hurt less to put on the peel.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and found it odd that the recommendation for removing the acid was by using water.</li>
            <li> I am a Black woman.</li>
            <li> Also, the price is half what I paid just over 1 month ago.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s less severe.</li>
            <li> My nose is less populated and my chins is clearer.</li>
            <li> ,  after one minute or less you can feel the burn so proceed with caution.  </li>
            <li> From past experience, when I have a growing pimple, and if the product I applied burns, the pimple usually disappears the next day...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is peeling slightly</li>
            <li> I have about 2 and a half weeks with this...</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t even used half the bottle yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman and this product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman with tan/brown skin.</li>
            <li> It stings and burns slightly while on, and while rinsing off, all the way until the moisturizer goes on, and then it stops.  </li>
            <li> the longer you keep it on, the less it burns.</li>
            <li> start out less than a minute and let your skin get used to it.</li>
            <li> I thought after I built up a tolerance, (I started at one minute as suggested and worked upward with the time), that the stinging would become less bothersome</li>
            <li> I  applied this product for less than a minute and my face was burning severely, even after rinsing it still burned.</li>
            <li> I also noticed my skin slightly peeled on my cheeks</li>
            <li> I typically leave my face under a stream of running water for about a minute to get it all off.</li>
            <li> My skin does get flaky still because the product is designed to get rid of that dead surface skin, but HOLY COW.</li>
            <li> it was burning so badly i found myself running around my house trying to cool my face down</li>
            <li> (very classy!) &amp; even worse!...</li>
            <li> It also did fade dark spot just a little bit</li>
            <li> I get periodic breakouts and the major problem is the scarring some of the breakouts leave behind.</li>
            <li> They were unfortunately too high.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I put it all over my face, and the sides of my nose were raw and peeling really bad by the next day.  </li>
            <li> I tried other products for skin tags over-hyped by the ads here on Amazon and on the TV, and they never even worked a little bit, they were just a waste of money...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever taken the drug, you know what I mean - dry, a little itchy, flaky and a little pink.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily in the summer, dry in the winter, and has some uneven redness that I usually cover with foundation.  </li>
            <li> Dont get discouraged by bad reviews on here, just keep using it regularly with daily facial wash  </li>
            <li> first time users, I&#x27;d recommend rinsing with a shower head in cold water.</li>
            <li> When i first started with this product, it burned like crazy.</li>
            <li> II&#x27;d spent on past acne products</li>
            <li> Her face was a mess.  </li>
            <li> I used a Q tip to apply it,  no special tool needed.</li>
            <li> Now, due to my high stress levels I got two measly little pimples</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes this would finally be the ticket but was a bit disappointed that this didn&#x27;t work on my scars.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any results from the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve used it, but that could just mean I didn&#x27;t use it long</li>
            <li> And it burns hella bad, requiring super rinse immediately.  </li>
            <li> Slight burning after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> so I usually do this at least two hours before I have to be anywhere so that I&#x27;m not glowing red.</li>
            <li> After using almost half the bottle, I diluted it with witch hazel and added a few drops of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I have a few ice pick type scars that make my skin texture less than desirable.</li>
            <li> If your skin is very oily it might work for you, but any other skin types should be wary of using this product!</li>
            <li> the skin is completely white and makes my dark spots look worse.  </li>
            <li> There was very little burning/sensitivity, perhaps because I have thicker skin and used to other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I have used this 3 times now over the week and it has done little to help my acne or peel.</li>
            <li> Like the instruction said it would, it stings a little.</li>
            <li> I had a little bit of itching in that area (probably, skin irritation).</li>
            <li> a little worked so well</li>
            <li> It freaked me out a little but because after one use, my face looked like a child&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> while taking of the gel I did feel a little burn</li>
            <li> it burned a little after being on for 15 minutes, but</li>
            <li> After 5 uses, no significant sign of improvment.</li>
            <li> I got a little bit of redness, a little puffiness, but no peeling.  </li>
            <li> This time I did notice a little peel, but nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> Also just a little worried about skin cancer.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a little over a month</li>
            <li> It seems to have little to no effect on these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing worked, not even a little.</li>
            <li> and I therefore knew I would have a little healing time, if needed.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t get the 100mL version!  </li>
            <li> This product costs little in terms of time, money, and effort.  </li>
            <li> Sunday I had a little flakes, but after Iwash and use a toner it wasn&#x27;t noticeable.</li>
            <li> Yes it does burn little in the beginning but the burning goes away after a while.</li>
            <li> Crush up an aspirin and add a little water to make an aspirin mask.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to have gotten a little lighter, I think the sun damage has begun to fade a bit.   </li>
            <li> It stings but it&#x27;s tolerable and fanning it helps a little bit, too, but do not wash it off.</li>
            <li> I had a little peeling on my chin</li>
            <li> I used a wide-tip paint brush, poured a little of this acid in a glass container, and painted it on.</li>
            <li> It stung a little.</li>
            <li> My mistake was purchasing something from a company i am not familiar with.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that this little bottle is all it took to help my acne.</li>
            <li> Only downside is this sucker STINGS!</li>
            <li> it stung a little and i peeled for  a couple of days</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help with the acne, but it did help a little with the acne scarring (in combination with Mederma Scar Gel).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, if you have had several salicylic peels, this is probably too weak for you.</li>
            <li> , was a little overpriced, and i had to stop using it because it irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;itching\\&quot; is a little bothersome.  </li>
            <li> Then I can start feeling a little tingling in my nose from the acid fumes, so I started breathing and hyperventilating thru my mouth</li>
            <li> I just tilt the bottle and spread it a little on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even peal a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Was a little nervous about having to use baking soda to neutralize it.</li>
            <li> Dealing with warts is a little like viewing to &amp;#34;dark arts&amp;#34;, there is lots of mystery and hundreds of opinions about what works.  </li>
            <li> This made my face tingle a little bit when on, but it did not burn like I read about.  </li>
            <li> My skin is weird because it gets really dry, especially during the winter months.</li>
            <li> It may look bad at first, but keep going!</li>
            <li> It hit me REALLY hard, and it was hard for me to fight back.</li>
            <li> The burning was tough to handle, so I would only leave it on for about 2 minutes each time.</li>
            <li> , also I think it&#x27;s a little too wide and thick,</li>
            <li> After that I rinse it out really well with cold water.</li>
            <li> My face really went crazy when I started college.</li>
            <li> I have gone from the occasional hormonal issue to congested unhappy pores since I began using this last February...</li>
            <li> I used a cotton bud to apply it after a few seconds</li>
            <li> If not maybe after a few days I will try for a longer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it arrived in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Please, save yourself some trouble and DO NOT buy this product.</li>
            <li> If you suffer form acne like me let me recommend Green Tea.</li>
            <li> Overdoes on Green Tea and you will not have anymore acne.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started drinking green tea</li>
            <li> Use this every week, use olive oil, and drink green tea and you won&#x27;t have acne if you suffer from oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing this treatment for a few weeks now, once a week.</li>
            <li> Just the soap everyday in the shower.</li>
            <li> Recently it has become worse.</li>
            <li> This product has dramatically decreased breakouts, cleaned and shrunk my pores, and helped my overall skin tone.    </li>
            <li> I ordered this product a few weeks ago from amazon.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I feel the pain of a pre-zit, I apply this stuff on the spot for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just impatient, he he.</li>
            <li> Expect your skin to peel over the course of a few days.</li>
            <li> I accidentally got some on my fingers, and my hand dried up like a sponge in the desert.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the peel everyday.</li>
            <li> but that just seemed like a waste of time</li>
            <li> I also work out so maybe my sweating has something to do with the breakout although I did the peel post workout because it says not to sweat for a few hours after.  </li>
            <li> and then my skin, wait for a few minutes and wash it off.  </li>
            <li> I put it on then try to distract myself by sitting at the computer a few minutes while watching my stopwatch.</li>
            <li> You will notice the peeling within a few days or even hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for just a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Product was packaged well and arrived at my home in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I needed to get rid of the built up oil and dead skin cells to help get rid of the gunk in my skin.    </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t look like a walking dead person before anyone would ever view the picture.</li>
            <li> I had horribly uneven skin tone to boot!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was just one of the unlucky few who couldn&#x27;t get it to work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I peeled a few times in September and then took a break</li>
            <li> I decided to give thsi product a try and did use it once or twice, but got impatient with it, so it sat in my drawer for like another month.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a few weeks ago and can already tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> my face with green tea cleanser</li>
            <li> -I apply witch hazel toner to my face with a round cotton pad.</li>
            <li> the witch hazel has fully dried, I begin applying the peel.</li>
            <li> Then the second week, my acne was way worse.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine at work who also had acne started clearing up a few months ago</li>
            <li> The 3 or 4 chin and jawline pimples were dried up</li>
            <li> But I had to share this with anyone struggling with acne, scarring or uneven skin tones.  </li>
            <li> A waste of time.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to go so far as Accutane because I already have a history of depression without it being egged on by yet another medication.</li>
            <li> within a few days, you might notice flaking in the areas that it was used.</li>
            <li> The excess gray (dead) skin is 95-99% gone at this point.</li>
            <li> There was so much dead skin that it didn&#x27;t make a dent.</li>
            <li> Buy it, buy it, buy it if you have been looking to a solution to uneven tone and acne scarring.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months now , about once or twice a week, for 8 min each time.</li>
            <li> So i think it was a waste of money and</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t zap over night, but within 3-4 nights pimples are dried out.  </li>
            <li> Then I follow up with amlactin (a lactic acid moisturizer) with a few drops of hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> YES it is harsh and YES it will make you peel.  </li>
            <li> I started having trouble with acne about 4 years ago and during that time I tried everything I could think of.</li>
            <li> picking, the heavy moisturizing should help the peeling be safer.</li>
            <li> No picking, the heavy moisturizing should help the peeling be safer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will use it again in a few days to see if it clears up the remaining blackheads on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give it another round, but this time using it once every four days.</li>
            <li> , I have a few pointers.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for a few weeks, now.</li>
            <li> So have something to do to distract yourself for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have some acne scars so my skin is uneven, and the product seems to work like a sand paper because my skin appears to be resurfaced.</li>
            <li> It works because it gets inbetween the dead skin cells and burns off the superficial layer of skin.</li>
            <li> Just use a cotton ball or round</li>
            <li> It works and its not too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> it is comparable to just speeding up the rate at which dead skin sloughs off.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but you have to use it twice a day everyday.</li>
            <li> I do not wash my face with any harsh cleansers the day I do the \\&quot;peel\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I wait a day after the treatment to put anything harsh on my face.</li>
            <li> (my acne actually got worse now in my 20s).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for about a 2 weeks, almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Not as harsh as some peels I have tried.</li>
            <li> I will just give you a few things that I&#x27;ve learned though.</li>
            <li> Also, I work every day and cannot be in hiding for a few days while my face heals.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> but my biggest problem was always the deep scarring and the damaged/irritated skin that my breakouts would leave behind.</li>
            <li> This one, despite being a lower level salicylic peel, gives me the flakiest skin a few days after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much money I will have to lose before finding something that actually works for me. :(</li>
            <li> The scars are no longer raised or bumpy, but the redness around my chin is still prevalent and requires a green concealer and a heavy-coverage foundation to hide.</li>
            <li> it does peel the dead skin away and brightens the skin.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> My skin used to tolerate all kinds of harsh chemicals, however I guess with age</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks with noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> Your skin needs a few days between to heal.</li>
            <li> Will update in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> say TRY this product at $20 a pop -- it&#x27;s not a huge loss if it doesn&#x27;t give you the results</li>
            <li> As far as the burning goes, it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I had expected based on the other reviews I&#x27;d read here.</li>
            <li> Works, after use everything comes back, have to use regular, dangerous if not careful, would never want to spill or be careless with, got on mouth once, put cold water on fast.</li>
            <li> So frustrated right now.</li>
            <li> and my whole face burned so bad, but as I have read other reviews it does go away in about a minute</li>
            <li> I usually just deal with a few large zits that drive me crazy.  </li>
            <li> I got this to slough off blackheads that won&#x27;t go away from steam pore extractions---and to remove dead, dry, dull skin!</li>
            <li> but after reading some other user reviews, I noticed it was a common thing.</li>
            <li> So that way i can get rid of acne plus there is no major scar remaining behind.</li>
            <li> it burns REALLY bad for the first few mins</li>
            <li> I am convinced using this initially every week and moving to every two weeks, has made a dramatic difference in his skin and confidence.</li>
            <li> Had a few small round brown spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Instructions are not easy to follow.</li>
            <li> My nose is my worst area, biggest pores, most skin damage due to the past acne.  </li>
            <li> I added this to my regime of items that had seemed to help a little in the past and saw some results after every treatment.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, it burned very badly and I left it on for a minute.  </li>
            <li> The sensation is still slightly uncomfortable but it&#x27;s obvious that the longer you use it, the less it stings.  </li>
            <li> I waited about 3 minutes and washed it off with cold water, then used a wet cotton ball to wipe it off, then used a dry cotton ball, and to my amazement the WHOLE white nasty cyst came off with it!!, and there wasn&#x27;t any left inside the pimple.</li>
            <li> My face was/is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> It also stings pretty bad whenever I wash it off with water; I don&#x27;t stop rinsing until all the stinging goes away.</li>
            <li> A few minutes later the burning subsided and my skin suddenly didn&#x27;t feel oily anymore, but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff at least three times with no success- no peeling and each time</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed so far and feel absolutely deceived.</li>
            <li> I have the worlds largest pores, it makes my skin look uneven and makeup doesnt glide on well :-/</li>
            <li> these past few years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had to use it very slowly, which gave me limited effect.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m typing this comment, I have on a raw honey/coconut oil mask (1/2 teaspoon of each) which I plan to leave on for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> One cyst next to my eye and eyebrow left a bad scar.    </li>
            <li> I get really bad flare-ups from rosacea that only seem to get worse as I get older.</li>
            <li> Applied for 3-4 days, no change, the skin was still thick and black.</li>
            <li> Definatelly saw an improvement and my forehead wrinkle is less visible/at least a day after the peeling/.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Im 20, male, white, with slightly oily skin, and acne that sometimes turns horrible on me and makes cysts only on cheeks though.</li>
            <li> but I googled this) on the really dry parts (just a thin layer).</li>
            <li> When I previously went with the dermatologist, it took honestly at least a year to see the SLIGHTEST improvement in my skin with my arms being the toughest spots.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t cut too close to the plastic, made it less thick and cut it shorter.</li>
            <li> I think I could pass for Frankinstein&#x27;s little sister, twice removed!   </li>
            <li> Little did I know!  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to dumb it down a little.     </li>
            <li> It is somewhat hard to apply and burns a little</li>
            <li> There is little you can do during this time to hide these temporarily negative results.  </li>
            <li> As for any stinging or burning sensations, there was very, very little (almost negligible) that I experienced--and I had become used to some products causing me severe reactions with no improvement whatsoever.    </li>
            <li> There is very ,very little discomfort if you can even call it that.</li>
            <li> You use a very little of the liquid</li>
            <li> I have used a number of products of all price ranges in the past to minimize the hyperpigmentation and nothing ever worked.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about long-term effects yet.</li>
            <li> I still get small pimples on my nose and chin about 2-3 mornings a week.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what combo/concentration she had</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with cystic acne for the past few years!</li>
            <li> I use it for no more than 8 minutes on a small area.  </li>
            <li> For some reason I&#x27;m really not sure if it&#x27;s working or not.</li>
            <li> Used the peel twice for no more than five minutes--once in the morning and once at night after my shower.</li>
            <li> My skin did build a small tolerance over time</li>
            <li> I usually go for about five minutes then wash it off.</li>
            <li> I also have had redness around my nostrils and on my chin for the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> After researching I knew that the only fixes would be expensive salon or derm procedures.</li>
            <li> but these pimples are in a small inflamed area.</li>
            <li> I was 2 minutes in on my forehead but only 1 minute in on my cheeks which made it difficult to time and to have it work evenly.</li>
            <li> After rinsing with cold water and moisturizing my face well, my skin was ridiculously soft.</li>
            <li> and I would even say no more than twice per month.</li>
            <li> My exiting pimples are gone faster then usual</li>
            <li> You can get the cotton rounds at walgreens or any drug store, usually in the beauty section.   </li>
            <li> If so, big time fail.</li>
            <li> Usually because it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about two months since I began using the peel, and I&#x27;d say 90% of my small acne is gone.  </li>
            <li> So i am not sure.</li>
            <li> It literally makes your pores so small that they dont even seem visable after a month.</li>
            <li> I used it to spot treat some pimples and within a couple of days, they were all dried up and gone!</li>
            <li> I have used glycolic peels in the past and have used up to a 50% strength with no problems.  </li>
            <li> Although they are small, they are STILL noticeable.</li>
            <li> and I still don&#x27;t use it past a minute and 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Rinse with A LOT OF WATER</li>
            <li> But Today, not many of us can afford peels at $85-$150 a</li>
            <li> I put a small spot of this stuff on each one and it burns.</li>
            <li> - the dead skin just falls off!</li>
            <li> The acid does sting and burn like crazy and seems to get worse when you first start washing it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product one star because after two uses my face was covered with small zits.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure which solution to use, always go with the weakest (and shortest time on your skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually do it before I get in the shower.</li>
            <li> it weren&#x27;t for the freezer and baking soda cheats, I&#x27;m not sure how I would have gotten through this treatment.</li>
            <li> After rinsing off, I plan to apply a mix of my usual moisturizers which include lavender oil, argan oil, and olive oil (one drop of each).</li>
            <li> Once I wash it off, I see red angry splotches of what the hell</li>
            <li> Im not really sure if its helped with how often I have breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on and off for the past two years.</li>
            <li> and apply a small amount to it to help form a protecting, moisturizing and healing layer.</li>
            <li> (it tastes nasty by the way, but better than tums).</li>
            <li> Not sure why,  maybe because I&#x27;ve used salicylic products before.</li>
            <li> I have gotten proffessional peels in the past and they cost 45$ each.</li>
            <li> After trying everything that I knew that worked for acne in the past, I decided to try the salicylic acid peel.</li>
            <li> I saturate a small piece of cotton ball, and apply to my face as directed for about five minutes.  </li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s more painful getting it off then having it on!!</li>
            <li> The results were way above my expectations; all of the fainter scars have faded into being practically nonexistent and the not-so-faint ones have become faint.</li>
            <li> The alternative was to go to the doctor and have them cut the planters wart out of my foot which would&#x27;ve been my last resort if this failed.</li>
            <li> I have always had awful acne scars on my face, and I have tried many ways to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> I have used this product once a week for the past three months.</li>
            <li> For past 3 weeks</li>
            <li> SAFI&amp;#34; *unfortunately this cleanser is only sold in Singapore and Malaysia* (helps to decrease pores)&lt;br</li>
            <li> This felt like a weird cross between burning, tingling, and tickling on my face.</li>
            <li> I received the instructions and followed them to the tee (cleaned her back, wiped down with alcohol, applied the peel, rinsed with cold water and applied a liquid skin neutralizer, moisturizer and sun screen).</li>
            <li> I want so very badly to feel comfortable leaving the house with no makeup.</li>
            <li> I lasted a little over a minute and then starting cupping cold water and patting it on my face for probably close to a minute.</li>
            <li> After a minute, I rinsed with cold water and you could actually see little flakes of skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Vi Peel professionally done a few times to help get rid of acne marks that were leftover after a bad cystic acne breakout.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I used this a few months ago, left it on for about 3-4 minutes and then washed off with copious amounts of cold water just like the instructions indicated.</li>
            <li> I started getting random bouts of acne this past summer in little clusters on my cheeks, something i never experienced before, especially not in my mid-twenties.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this about three weeks, and I did not expect some dramatic miracle, but seeing nothing positive happen is just a disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have used Accutane whilst in high school and my acne (not as bad as it was) is still here and a bother.</li>
            <li> My face remained a little red for a few minutes but wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> normally if i went without foundation on my face people would comment on my sunburned, that&#x27;s how bad it was.</li>
            <li> It is not that bad and is quite normal with any chemical peels out there.</li>
            <li> As far as effectiveness is concerned it deserves 5 stars but the stinging is really unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Unpleasant, but nowhere near intolerable.</li>
            <li> Then, after a few weeks of use once a week or so, after the many layers of my cruddy skin had broken down--I was cured!</li>
            <li> I did 8 minutes with my head in the freezer and am starting to feel silly and ridiculous.</li>
            <li> My acne has never been bad enough to require Accutane or constant dermatology visits, but it is annoyingly persistent and has worsened into my early 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> felt weird &amp; dry.  </li>
            <li> All that&#x27;s happened is that my nose has gotten flaky and i got two random dry patches on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> For me, I can typically expect to peel approximately 3 to 4 days after a 3 minute application.  </li>
            <li> I started to get \\&quot;adult acne\\&quot; and it seemed impossible to get off my face.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this weekly for the past month on my daughter who suffers from back acne with sevre scaring.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want to see the total amount of money I&#x27;ve spent trying to find something to combat this annoying skin ailment during the past two years.    </li>
            <li> Apply and play a few games of BubblePopp on Facebook or something less lame.  </li>
            <li> I learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave a hard bump.</li>
            <li> My skin had a really hard time dealing with the humidity and the pollution - not something I&#x27;d had to deal with before.  </li>
            <li> Makeup wasn&#x27;t covering the scars but now they are hardly noticeable without makeup.</li>
            <li> , SO not worth it after buying this!!!</li>
            <li> I had tons of little pimples all over my face worse than before.</li>
            <li> The milia seem to disappear for a few days immediately after the treatment, then peel a little, then faintly re-appear.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from really bad acne, and have since 13 years old.</li>
            <li> But DUH.</li>
            <li> But I use a fan brush to apply the peel, leave it on for ten minutes and wash it off with really cold water.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I get an occasional cold sore.</li>
            <li> My chin hasn&#x27;t had a pimple in days, but the skin is still a bit rough to the touch, but just by looking at it, you can&#x27;t tell that anything&#x27;s wrong with it.</li>
            <li> 20 at least...</li>
            <li> and it really stung - was afraid I had done something wrong</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t seen negative reactions to being in the sun.</li>
            <li> something i noticed is that once i splash cold water on my face the heat intensifies for about a minute then stops all of a sudden.</li>
            <li> When you use it according to the protocol, it does work, at least for me it does.</li>
            <li> One caveat: this product makes the skin extremely delicate and prone to tearing if you apply pressure with fingernails.</li>
            <li> I definitely suggest filling the sink with cold water and baking soda to neutralize the acid.</li>
            <li> and I was at least going to finish it.</li>
            <li> as a precaution, I&#x27;m clumsy so there is always a chance I could accidently get the peel in my eye or on my lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and after going off birth control permanently last year I&#x27;ve started getting horrible breakouts along my chin and jawline.  </li>
            <li> I am a biracial woman in her late 20s</li>
            <li> In 2006, I went all out and spent money on a plastic surgeon to remove some scars and then underwent expensive acne treatments in his office.  </li>
            <li> I waited the ten minutes then used COLD water to remove it.</li>
            <li> The peeling (in my case at least) happened two days after use, and lasted for two to three days.  </li>
            <li> I lasted 2 minutes in front of an open window with cold air blowing in.</li>
            <li> I would suggest anyone suffering from acne to at least try it, but do so with caution (i.e: avoid eyes, avoid leaving it on for longer than directed).</li>
            <li> Simply run your face under cold water for 60-90 seconds after you are done and follow with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not only that I have what I call \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; on my chest and inbetween the girls, it is flesh colored raised bumps which I&#x27;m guessing is also</li>
            <li> So, for the NEGATIVE reviews that I read before trying it; maybe you didn&#x27;t apply it the correct way to your face or read the directions thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I am so naive and had NO Idea</li>
            <li> (duh).</li>
            <li> I happened to have a fan brush with which to apply this, and wish that it came in a different type of dispenser as it is awkward to pour it onto the brush without spilling.</li>
            <li> Its a bit inconvenient to go out in public with flaky skin</li>
            <li> If you have acne, that is what a dermatologist is for (and they can give you Accutane, which despite the negative publicity is the one-and-only 100% miracle cure)</li>
            <li> I started using it 2-3 weeks ago, at least twice a week.  </li>
            <li> I was so afraid of scaring my face that I couldn&#x27;t go to work the next day.  </li>
            <li> Splash off with cold water for several minutes.  </li>
            <li> and it even helped clear up and bring to a head those nasty pimples on my back.  </li>
            <li> I thought this product would help clear out my congested pores but it gave me a horrible bumpy red rash instead.</li>
            <li> Build up your tolerance slowly.</li>
            <li> If using around mouth, I apply thick coat of chapstick to avoid lips...</li>
            <li> My shoulders are still slowly fading.  </li>
            <li> Although, I did take it slow</li>
            <li> I have thick, oily aging skin, though, and needed something stronger that 20% to deal with my problems.  </li>
            <li> It starts slowly</li>
            <li> Start slow because this stuff is no joke.</li>
            <li> The scars are visibly lighter and slowly fading away.</li>
            <li> Start slow and be cautious.</li>
            <li> I use thick coco butter.</li>
            <li> You should gradually ease into the product by slowly increasing the amount of time you leave it on every peel you do.  </li>
            <li> These results are slow</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this product everyday, because it will make your condition worse.</li>
            <li> The Nonprescription Plan That Shows Dramatic Results in as Little as 24 Hours]]</li>
            <li> I mean, why not?</li>
            <li> It Can burn, as in leave white patches that peel like mad for days.  </li>
            <li> What does that mean?</li>
            <li> I mean ZERO change.</li>
            <li> I mean EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, my skin is very tough.      </li>
            <li> After washing my face for a long while using cold water, I also applied a thick moisturizing mask on my face for over 45 min.  </li>
            <li> A minute or two with it on, I was shocked to look into the mirror and see all kinds of major GUNK coming out of my pores.</li>
            <li> At 29, acne should be a thing of the past, however it has become worse.</li>
            <li> Tried everything else on market including expensive brands to no success.  </li>
            <li> Also, the pimples that do show up are very small and almost invisible when I put makeup over it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I should continue it or the spots will get worse...  </li>
            <li> My skin is not sensitive at all due to years of worthless Acne treatments.</li>
            <li> Now, 6 or 7 weeks later, my skin has never been in such terrible condition.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I would have a lot of dry skin on my face which would show through my makeup since I have semi-dry skin already</li>
            <li> My face is seriously peeling and now</li>
            <li> The acne is quite serious.</li>
            <li> One negative though, it is extremely painful to use on my skin even when I only leave it on for a minute or two.</li>
            <li> Nothing serious</li>
            <li> After rinsing it off with cold water I dabbed the Neutralizer skin pH balancer by Cellbone and rinsed that off...then pat dry face.</li>
            <li> in this as it is serious for serious results.  </li>
            <li> then I rinsed with cold water, pat dry, then put on moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: After I wrote this initial review, I went back to some terrible breakouts.</li>
            <li> The peeling is subtle, but none of my blemishes are visible anymore.    </li>
            <li> If you have serious skin problems then you should not play with this stuff at home.</li>
            <li> Throughout the day you can see subtle patches of skin peeling off.</li>
            <li> (sorry I&#x27;m stingy and want to use as less as I can)</li>
            <li> The peeling that occurred around 4 days later made it impossible to wear make-up; foundation on-top of flaking skin is not a good look.</li>
            <li> This product can otherwise be very dangerous, even if left on for a few minutes!</li>
            <li> Use a little bit of vaseline (yes sounds weird</li>
            <li> Also packaging is a little difficult to pour the liquid from.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re use to spa facial treatments, then the tingling isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> If I were to review this product after using it for a month I would definitely give it a bad rating.</li>
            <li> To my relief, the bad acne did not come back.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled with bad skin for several years.  </li>
            <li> Within the last 6 months, my acne had gotten really bad.</li>
            <li> Only reason I gave it two stars is because it didn&#x27;t damage my face or produce any bad side effects.</li>
            <li> and I have a bad habit of popping and picking at my skin, which has left me with a lot of scars.</li>
            <li> The 1st time I applied this stuff on my entire face which was a bad idea.</li>
            <li> I get a bad reaction and don&#x27;t go sleepless from the irritation on my back.  </li>
            <li> During the peel my face use to burn badly, hours after the peel my face was still be red.</li>
            <li> Today is Monday and my skin is peeling, it is somewhat similar to the peeling that I got from the peels at the spa except not as bad.</li>
            <li> even though I know it&#x27;s bad) and just red sores all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I have really bad acne scarring from this that will last for months, and will never use again.</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I did not want to go outside.  </li>
            <li> Second day I did my face, I lasted about 5 minutes and it started burning but not too bad</li>
            <li> I took a break from using it and when my acne was starting to get really bad again</li>
            <li> I recently got a bad breakout and after nothing was working, i decided to try this product.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally a whitehead or two will pop up during the treatment, which tells me that the acid is doing its job of bringing the bad stuff to surface.  </li>
            <li> (my hair is always pulle back when I&#x27;m doint this), stick my head in and use the handheld shower head anduse lukewarm water, defintely doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad as the baking soda solution and gets the stinging away faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product was not a good choice for me.</li>
            <li> I was shocked after starting with this peel.  </li>
            <li> Prior to using the peel, my skin was so damaged with blemishes and painful zits, to the point where makeup no longer covered them, and my skin was so patchy it was embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Then like others I broke out with painful cystic acne after the 3rd peel.</li>
            <li> I was weary of purchasing this, but I knew that salicylic acid was in a lot of drug store acne treatments and the company advertises this as a \\&quot;level 1\\&quot; peel, meaning the least irritating.</li>
            <li> I have tried it on blackheads, whiteheads, and those deep painful cystic feeling nodules...</li>
            <li> It was not a good feeling.</li>
            <li> &quot; I thought was going to happen, instead i just have 3months worth of horrible acne pics of my face!</li>
            <li> 12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have scars on my arm from selfmutilating when I was young and stupid.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive products.</li>
            <li> Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5% has worked, sorta, but it makes my skin dry, dull and ugly.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide if I should give this product one star or two stars, because each time I&#x27;ve used this, my skin has had such an odd and/or downright horrifying reaction that I think I&#x27;ll stop using it.</li>
            <li> My cystic acne was so bad and inflamed during my teenage years that they left indents on my skin, i tried everything, i consulted with a dermatologist who gave me some antibiotics and 2% Salicylic acid cream to apply on my face, i even tried to change my diet but all to no avail, alas when the acne&#x27;s healed, they healed badly resulting to my scarring.</li>
            <li> it did get a bit uncomfortable, I left it on for a minuite then used a neutriliser and splashed my face with lots of cold water</li>
            <li> I broke out worse than ever with deep painful acne.</li>
            <li> No really, everything over the counter, and everything prescription short of accutane as I refuse to take that horrific drug.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I developed the worst hormonal breakouts along  my jawline.</li>
            <li> but I know it&#x27;s bad in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn bad until I decided to rinse it off and I blasted the cold shower on my face and the combination of the cold shower and my face burning was so intense I could barely breathe.</li>
            <li> i used the peel exactly as directed and from the begining my skin has reacted horribly.</li>
            <li> It just stung so terribly, I don&#x27;t know how anyone is capable of coping with the burn otherwise!</li>
            <li> After a horrible breakout in September due to hormonal imbalances--my entire face was covered, I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> It was very hard to not scratch it off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to rinse it off over the sink.</li>
            <li> The spot faded slightly, but at the end of these two weeks, the inside of my mouth had a rash, and when I stopped the Valtrex, I felt another cold sore coming on.</li>
            <li> I had terrible back acne as a teenager, I no longer have it, but I had/have the dark spots to prove it.</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin still slightly stinging and tightening for another two minutes or so after I had rinsed with the cold water.</li>
            <li> Then something happened at age 28 (adult acne) and the past 3 years have been horrible for the skin on my face.</li>
            <li> I was so afraid to put this on due to the other people saying how painful it was.</li>
            <li> At 20 dollars, this peel is half as expensive as mederma and has given me the results in 1 use that 3 tubes of mederma have been unable to.</li>
            <li> knows, maybe I have skin as tough as nails.</li>
            <li> It has faded the darkness on my forehead and the splotchiness on my cheeks, but very slowly.  </li>
            <li> if salicylic acid based products didn&#x27;t work for u in the past don&#x27;t buy this!!</li>
            <li> I washed it off with cold water and a little bit of baking soda to neutralize</li>
            <li> Sometimes if my skin gets a little dirty feeling I&#x27;ll swab some witch hazel on my face.</li>
            <li> It does sting a little but some cold water fixes that.</li>
            <li> my skin became so oily it was disgusting and lots of tiny little spots started forming across my forehead.  </li>
            <li> my face was slightly pink but not as bad as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn too bad so no real problems there.</li>
            <li> I have really bad sun damage on my chest which was made worse by my dermatologist freezing off rough spots.  </li>
            <li> Every anti aging cream has made me break out and every acne medication has made my wrinkles worse.</li>
            <li> Then in a couple of days, it got worse, the skin got thicker.</li>
            <li> -Acne breakout decreased alot.</li>
            <li> and I was tired of it.</li>
            <li> and she told me her secret.</li>
            <li> but alas my scars have not faded.</li>
            <li> And if I used a product for eczema, it would clog up my face and make the acne worse.</li>
            <li> bottle was broken</li>
            <li> And the number of pimples has also dramatically decreased.  </li>
            <li> but they have decreased in severity.</li>
            <li> It sucks that they are expensive and the results are negligible at best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it on chin one night and it burns like crazy after a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> It peeled my skin, and as another reviewer mentioned, it made my skin a bit worse before it started to improve.  </li>
            <li> I also notice that when I sit and think about it, it&#x27;s worse, so I recommend doing something to take your mind off of it.  </li>
            <li> Before I would break out with 8-11 pimples on my face and now they have decreased dramatically.</li>
            <li> , I am using the product every night and leaving a thin layer on overnight.</li>
            <li> I notice that I peel two days later - which is annoying, but what gets the results.</li>
            <li> My face had begun to develop that tired damaged look.</li>
            <li> I used this product for approximately 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Neutrogena 2% salicylic products for three years with no great results.</li>
            <li> my skin overproduces oil and makes it worse.</li>
            <li> I was also using microdermabrasion in between peels to encourage sloughing, but was worried that was an overload and didn&#x27;t want to make anything worse.</li>
            <li> Sadly, by the time I noticed, it&#x27;s too late to return it.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t sting any worse than the one minute mark.</li>
            <li> Rinsed it off and that made the burning worse.</li>
            <li> I stopped and immediately wash my face using cold water continually for quite a few minutes because the sensation could not go away.  </li>
            <li> and I have never experienced irritations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i use Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay in between my Salicylic acid peel cycle.</li>
            <li> The secret is to use a Q-tip to dap on pimples and scars.</li>
            <li> Are you guys serious?!</li>
            <li> My face is just getting worst with pimples and multiple scars from those pimples and I am not sure if I&#x27;ve weathered the storm or should I just quit.      </li>
            <li> It is very unpleasant to get sunburn/extra irritation to a recently treated area of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the last year of my twenties, and over the past year my skin has been at its worst-- acne, old acne scars, congestion, wrinkles, unevenness, and the worst of all... HUMONGOUS pores.</li>
            <li> Feels like it works because it burns, but didn&#x27;t see dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why my derm did not suggest this after all the years of failed treatment!</li>
            <li> No more expensive facials or dermatologist appointments for me!</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel tight and it will peel (literally) but it will not be painful</li>
            <li> The bad thing was my face was a little irritated (since I did it twice</li>
            <li> My skin has never been terrible but I do get considerable breakouts every now and then.</li>
            <li> Nothing to bad, or anything to worry about, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> Becareful cause it does sting uncomfortably but</li>
            <li> I told her my secret!</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> With all the glowing commendations for this product, I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong by purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Wrong, wrong, wrong.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the peels or maybe it&#x27;s the investment in expensive (ish) face products, but</li>
            <li> (sorry for sounding like an infomercial).</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t know what went wrong.</li>
            <li> I needed a product that would deliver the same results without the outrageous price.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t use this stuff as the molluscum was on her eyelid.</li>
            <li> I used an herbal product that worked, but was quite expensive and took about 6 months to see results.</li>
            <li> or if I&#x27;m using it wrong.</li>
            <li> And once again, it turned a random spot darker.</li>
            <li> I want to use it because i have random blotchy darker spots all over my face and a lot of acne scarring and blackheads and whiteheads galore.</li>
            <li> Man was I wrong...    </li>
            <li> and it was a bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i have used it 3 times but ill keep trying&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all types of inexpensive to expensive facials, creams, and gels.</li>
            <li> It is uncomfortable, but it has worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> NOT happy!</li>
            <li> As you know, these treatments/ pills are either harmful to your body if prolong usage, or they are just too expensive to up keep.    </li>
            <li> I might have the wrong skin type</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> , I was wrong...</li>
            <li> and I would have pushed through this period, however, I ended up having a disturbing side effect from this peel.</li>
            <li> Silly me purchased another peel form this company and it was like dabbing water on my face.</li>
            <li> (i know it sounds weird) and put that on my face.</li>
            <li> It sounds kinda scary but isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It is not for the faint of heart.</li>
            <li> Not perfect</li>
            <li> I have horrible scars because I&#x27;m OCD with picking my white heads (</li>
            <li> ever\\&quot;, I&#x27;m skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;ve discontinued using them.    </li>
            <li> my skin looked terrible again and the scar came back just a bit.</li>
            <li> I had terrible acne that decided to come back when I was 25.</li>
            <li> Sounds like a lot of stuff, but its still cheaper than paying to see a dermatologist who writes out expensive prescriptions that do not work.  </li>
            <li> Now he is no longer insecure about how he looks hope</li>
            <li> wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from Pro-Active to expensive products like Obagi.</li>
            <li> Its not perfect</li>
            <li> The sad thing is, it seems to be working ...</li>
            <li> After a while that got expensive.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I had some vitamin E oil in a drawer (a failed scar removal attempt) that I got from walgreens for probably 7 bucks.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not help me with acne or hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li> and I have had a weird acne thing on my chest</li>
            <li> Now I wear less makeup because my freckles aren&#x27;t so bad anymore!</li>
            <li> I stopped using the product after about a week because it burned and made my skin so dry and crusty that I didn&#x27;t want horrible looking skin.  </li>
            <li> It will take time and patience for some of you who has the worse break-outs, or bad acne.</li>
            <li> This product gave me horrible, cystic, swollen painful deep acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s too late to return it. :(</li>
            <li> By blemishes, I mean dark awful scars that come from frustrated nights of picking and popping!</li>
            <li> (At least I am!!!)</li>
            <li> Since then I gave it to my friend, who has the worst acne I have ever witnessed (cystic, infected, blackheads, you name it), in hopes it will do a little something for him.</li>
            <li> Wash if off with cold water (DO NOT RUB).</li>
            <li> then I took off the gel with cold water&lt;br /&gt;now</li>
            <li> if you get cold sores, do not apply this stuff on the areas you&#x27;ve gotten cold sores..</li>
            <li> Well, i put it on for 1 min and washed it off with cold water.</li>
            <li> then add cold water for a mintue.  </li>
            <li> I was desperate to find something to help me get rid of my acne</li>
            <li> and I immediately rinsed with cold water.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Salicylic Acid and read the directions, which state that people who use this product and have the cold sore virus, might get cold sores.</li>
            <li> I used the Salicylic Acid on the spot on my face and within minutes felt a cold sore coming on.</li>
            <li> Splash face again with cold water till stinging subsides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided I didn&#x27;t want to put my body through the stress of Accutane again and deal with the dangerous side effects.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I wash it off with a ton of cold water.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to everyone I know that suffers from acne.</li>
            <li> The spa chemical peels were HARSH and actually terrible for my skin.  </li>
            <li> so I rinsed with cold water, then I used a neutralizer which stopped the burning immediately.</li>
            <li> Then wash my face with plenty of cold water and apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I had to cold water it after a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li> but I was desperate</li>
            <li> Once the timer goes off I rinse my face with tons of cold water.</li>
            <li> I began rinsing my face off with lots of cold water.</li>
            <li> Then after rinsing in cold water and using a neutralizer, I coated my face in vitamin E.</li>
            <li> burns like crazy annd</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how afraid I was.</li>
            <li> Stuff seems to dangerous to use without professionals.</li>
            <li> that is dangerous.</li>
            <li> LIKE CRAZY.</li>
            <li> but it does burn like crazy some times.</li>
            <li> when I rinsed the product (with cold water, no neutralizing solution), I was amazed at how my skin looked.</li>
            <li> Rinse face with cold water, a lot of cold water.</li>
            <li> Rinse face with cold water, a lot of cold water.</li>
            <li> In the instructions it says that chemical peels will give you cold sores if you are prone to them, I thought well it&#x27;s not on my face</li>
            <li> product is a bit pricy for purchasing on a whim, but I was desperate.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for 8 minutes (per the instructions), and rinse it with cold water.</li>
            <li> COPIOUS amounts of COLD water are needed.</li>
            <li> BUT nothing too crazy.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m trying birth control pills to see if they will help control my crazy hormone imbalance</li>
            <li> Felt kinda dangerous.</li>
            <li> but I was desperate.</li>
            <li> Yes...it burns like crazy.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for about 10 minutes and then rinse it off with cold water.</li>
            <li> But I got a really bad breakout due to stress(2nd worst I have ever had,</li>
            <li> the product will continue to dissolve the small bumps as well and keep away any nasty cysts.</li>
            <li> wtf!?</li>
            <li> but I can see where people could go wrong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad</li>
            <li> Nothing painful -not burning , please don&#x27;t be afraid of this.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be very uncomfortable without some on hand.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about using something so drastic and abrasive, but the customer reviews were raving about the product, so I decided to do a bit of research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean horrible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of things, and surprisingly as bad as my acne got I never scarred.</li>
            <li> But, it wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I started having fairly bad acne and needed something to help it out.</li>
            <li> After using the salicylic acid three times I got a really bad break out.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;flaking\\&quot; of my skin has not been too bad, either.  </li>
            <li> but I need it for my bad skin.</li>
            <li> so it wasn&#x27;t AS bad as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Peeling so badly that I could moisturize in the morning and half-way through the day, I could touch my chin and find flakes on my fingers.</li>
            <li> It burned so bad.</li>
            <li> I still get bad acne the couple of days before my period</li>
            <li> My acne before was so bad that I was breaking out even along my jawline.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> and I also started using Jojoba oil as a moisturizer, which you would think is a bad idea for acne prone skin, but it&#x27;s another miracle</li>
            <li> dont have that bad acne</li>
            <li> , I have really bad acne scars , I have a hormonal problem and even thought my acne is gone</li>
            <li> the  scars were really bad.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch of this stuff or</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a myth perpetuated by the industry to explain away bad reactions.</li>
            <li> And since some people have a bad reaction, there is no reason not to start with one or two minutes.</li>
            <li> a week just on bad spots</li>
            <li> At 40 I started getting bad break-outs on my forehead (around the temples).</li>
            <li> 1.5 minutes on my face, and 2 minutes on my chest (bad acne scaring)</li>
            <li> And my boyfriend has bad break outs occassionally</li>
            <li> , on my chin I had a bad breakout and the sulfur drying cream was drying my skin but not the cyst.</li>
            <li> Yes it burns badly</li>
            <li> It makes my face sting really bad when I use it.</li>
            <li> I am 28 and still get bad, bad acne all over my chin and sometimes on my forehead.</li>
            <li> But none of the cystic stuff that is so painful and scarring.  </li>
            <li> There was a stinging sensation but nothing too painful or unbearable.</li>
            <li> So if you dont have a PH neutralizer I&#x27;d suggest washing this stuff off BEFORE you reach the painful point.    </li>
            <li> not as painful as some suggest, wish i got the stronger one.</li>
            <li> and it was painful to talk or make expressions.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from cystic acne that is terribly painful but not disfiguring, thank God.</li>
            <li> If you still plan on buying this I will say if you applying it and having it on your face is a painful bitch wait till you splash water on your face</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t remember how I came across this product on amazon, but once I did, I decided to give it a shot (20 bucks isn&#x27;t that painful to spend on an experiment).</li>
            <li> my pre-mensa My skin gets oilier, but I am SICK of breaking out.  </li>
            <li> I was fairly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> If you suffer from acne (like I do :( )</li>
            <li> and I think it will be here to stay :(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered the salicylic 20% peel by accident (I thought I was ordering the glycolic) and was disappointed at my mistake when I received the product.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, the stuff that came out of it was disgusting, but it went away!</li>
            <li> give this product a shot because you will no be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I need to get a stronger peel for results :(</li>
            <li> It just creates like a real thin layer, then i applied moisturizer and went to bed!</li>
            <li> This is a starter peel, meaning an idiot can apply it, your face won&#x27;t burn off.</li>
            <li> (I HATE that feeling...).  </li>
            <li> I have issues with eczema on my arms and face and after paying LOADS of money to a worthless dermatologist and equally worthless prescriptions, I found this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I hate when people tell you that some skin product is a miracle worker after just one use.  </li>
            <li> People, whoever has these unpleasant tags this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I thought I had it bad, but now its worst than ever.    </li>
            <li> It was brutal.  </li>
            <li> you get ugly welts from being burnt!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for the hate part - When using this product be mindful that your skin is going to look horrible for about a week after using it.</li>
            <li> Brings mini tears to my eyes and makes me want to scream bloody murder (I would rather be tattooed on the worst parts of my body).</li>
            <li> On my skin it burns very badly</li>
            <li> I am very frustrated.</li>
            <li> YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...</li>

            <li> it was an burning and stinging sensation, it was horrible</li>
            <li> And being a woman of color, the discoloration of the post acne marks leaves your skin looking horrible.</li>
            <li> I just checked my makeup and it looks terrible on my pimples.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible.</li>

            <li> I was embarrassed to go out as my face would peel and it looked disgusting, people would stare at me.</li>
            <li> But basically, I have awful acne that does not go away even with my stringent cleaning and grooming</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how awful and worn out my skin had started to look!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Im 30 with fair skin and I have noticed over the years my skin was looking old, with open pores and crows feet. I thought i&#x27;d give this a go as i&#x27;ve heard good reviews about it. I used a cotton bud to apply it after a few seconds I felt a tingling sensation i&#x27;ll be honest it did get a bit uncomfortable, I left it on for a minuite then used a neutriliser and splashed my face with lots of cold water my face was slightly pink but not as bad as I thought it would be.I&#x27;ve used this now for over 2 weeks using it every other day I have noticed a slight peeling in places my skin can be a little dry make sure you use a good moisturiser id recommend cetaphil. I have noticed an improvement I have a healthy glow to my skin and if like me you wear make up I moisturise, use a primer and then put my makeup on I use bare minerals. Im hoping with continued use my crows feet will be less noticeable and my pores get smaller. So far so good!!! :-)</li>
            <li> So I first purchased this product nearly a year ago. I tried it, applied it to my entire face. Left it on for a few minutes, and took a shower. Didn&#x27;t work. So it got thrown in the cabinet. I had just recently came back to it a few days ago because I had one bit of acne that was swelling up under my eye. So I decided to give it another try... I got way more results than I expected! It turned the blemish a whitish color, and I slept it off. The next day it was scabbed up, so I continued to use it and it peeled after about 2-3 days, and now I&#x27;m left with more natural looking skin. The way I&#x27;m using it now it to dip a Q-Tip into the bottle and spread it around problem areas. Every day before bed. Now almost all of my acne is gone, I just need to get rid of the scars, which this is also doing a great job of. Most of my blemishes are starting to peel, which will leave behind newer, much better looking skin. But some advice, if you are using this stuff frequently make sure to put some sunscreen on, because your skin will be much more sensitive to the sun. I was out in the sun for a little, and I could literally feel the sun beaming on my skin much more in the areas where I had applied the salicylic acid. Besides that, this is a great product, and its really made my face look much better!!</li>
            <li> this works great, just what i wanted. sure it burns with application and gets some getting used to but it does its job well! great purchase!</li>
            <li> My face has acne and acne scares and skin discolorations. I&#x27;m trying this mainly for the discolorations and acne. The scars are too ice pick to fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well as of today on 5/30/2013. I have tried the peel and I must say I was expecting more. :P All the review kinda made me think there was going to be some instant action. The instructions said after test patch, when you apply to face to apply for 1 minute. So I begin with the forehead and about 1 minute I felt some tingling pain. 3 minute later it was about the same level just more tingling so i called it then not knowing when to really stop and I did 3 times the recommended time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washed face, used a neutralizer and then added some none scented face lotion. All and all reviews make me think there was going to be something to see. I guess I&#x27;ll wait and see if tomorrow produces anything. If not maybe after a few days I will try for a longer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says don&#x27;t go beyond 8 minutes but if 3 does little or nothing i may have to go for a full 8 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have used this 3 times now over the week and it has done little to help my acne or peel. It just drys my skin which I can do with a simple face wash without pain. I never see any peeling or effect other than dry skin. I figured a peel would actually do a peel that&#x27;s...noticable.</li>
            <li> I had a salicylic peel at my dermatologist&#x27;s office and loved the results. My mild to moderate acne began clearing up within days and the treatment seemed to last a few weeks. However, paying for the peel to be administered was not as fun. I found this 20% gel on Amazon and the results are identical. Make sure to purchase the neutralizer with this though, it does tend to burn. If I don&#x27;t want to apply to my entire face, I also use it for a high-powered spot treatment. As many other reviewers have mentioned, it normally worsens the breakout before it clears it up (my derm explained it essentially removes the first layer of skin to allow the breakout to be exposed to the medication), but after that the healing process is speedy.</li>
            <li> Now, I have used this product for over a month now. I use it when I feel like a pimple is emerging. It works wonders on those pimples. It makes them shrink and fade red bumpy appearance of upcoming pimple. I don&#x27;t know if it acts well as gel peel, just because I don&#x27;t use it on larger areas for peeling purpose. It also helps to minimize dark acne scars.</li>
            <li> My acne has been there for many years, so maybe it takes long to disappear entirely. But so far I am quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I will say these peels are hit and miss. I bought a TCA peel from the same company and it did cause peeling although did not lighten my skin. No peeling with this one and no noticeable effect on lightening either.</li>
            <li> I know it seems very enticing to buy a face peel, and use it at home without having to go to the derm. I bought this and used it and insanely regret my decision. I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 13. I&#x27;ve used tons of things, and surprisingly as bad as my acne got I never scarred. Sure I got hyperpigmentation but I never had dents and pits left in my face from them. And for that I was already very grateful for. I am always searching for way to get rid of hyperpigmentation. I&#x27;ve looked up facial peels before and at the time it seemed like a good idea. Lots of people have done it, it seems to help, so I decided to try it. If i never scarred before, I was scarring now. This stuff is no joke. YOU CANNOT USE ON ACTIVE BREAKOUTS. I was very careful in the beginning. It said to leave it on for only a little time and then increase the time. I followed this to the t. And I started noticing pits in my face where active acne was. Even a little white head would leave a scar. I would sincerely recommend everyone to steer of this product. I would not call my skin sensitive, I&#x27;ve used retinoids before, I&#x27;ve used harsh acne treatments, but this stuff is very harsh. I would be very very careful.</li>
            <li> This really works! It takes time to show and also takes time getting used to. I have acne marks that i was trying to get rid of and decided to give this product a try. Becareful cause it does sting uncomfortably but thats just something you have to endure if you want to see result. my skin quickly got used to this, because i would leave it on for up to 10 mins or more and it didn&#x27;t burn my face. I&#x27;m not sure if this is good or bad? but the description did say that the solution neutralizes on your face after 8 mins, so that explains why i was able to have it on for so long. It did lighten the scars and in some cases when i had an active zit it would actually instantly dry it up which was great. I am taking a break from this product and will restart. Definitely give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have been using this peel for a few weeks now hoping for great results like I read in the reviews. I&#x27;m not sure why, but this peel REALLY dries out my skin - just on the bottom have (jaw, lower cheek). I have very oily skin, so this was unexpected. I followed the directions and left it on for less than a minute each time, but still ended up w/ several brown patches of very dry, scabby skin. Then two days later I start to peel severely and this lasts a few days. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product, I just haven&#x27;t had good results. It did, however, reduce oil and blackheads. I&#x27;m going to try it in combination w/ the Lactic Acid 50% peel as recommended and see how that goes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything to get rid of my adult acne. My skin is combination so I have dry spots and oily spots and frequent breakouts. I&#x27;m also getting fine lines. Every anti aging cream has made me break out and every acne medication has made my wrinkles worse. I thought I was a lost cause...until i stumbled on this! Wonderful stuff. I applied the first treatment for 2 minutes, it had started to sting a bit at about the 2 minute mark so I rinsed well with cool water and the stinging stopped. Immediately my pores were tightened, NO redness what so ever. Skin looked slightly firmer after one treatment, and every single one of my blemishes had shrank. The redness on my zits was reduced also. By day two, my skin had broke out slightly again but I reapplied the peel on day 3 for another 2 minutes and the results were even better! skin is so baby smooth! acne was \\&quot;zapped\\&quot; immediately and fine lines were less. Didnt have another post treatment breakout after that. Every single day my skin looks better. I cant even imagine what it will do for me after the recommended 6 treatments for full results!! I&#x27;m so excited about this! After 2 treatments my old acne scars are even fading, and old blackheads that have been embedded forever suddenly \\&quot;popped\\&quot; out!! I cant find a single blackhead on my face. amazing! I&#x27;m recommending to all my friends. My neighbor commented on how great my face looked on day 3. I told her my secret! after 3 days I look like I did 3-5 years ago (wrinkle wise) i cant wait for the full results :) finally something for aging skin that has teenage acne! It is drying, so put on lots of a non clogging cream. I&#x27;m using a vit e cream that has no pore clogging mineral oil in it. seems to work well with the peel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this all over my face.  I did a couple times, I didn&#x27;t like the result too much.  I dab a little bit from a Qtip right onto an emerging pimple and it disappears so fast. I love it.</li>
            <li> My friend were raving abt how their skin become smoother and clearer after using the peel but i was sceptical at first because i understand that Salicylic Acid is not for everyone but i decided to brave it anyway. Am so please with the result. Like the instruction said it would, it stings a little. I washed it off with plenty of cool water aft 1 minute and my skin feels so smooth. I applied moisturizer as adviced. The next morning, i saw that my face peeled a little at the side of my mouth ( probably missed the moisturizer there ) but the white heads dried up really quick. Plus, my skin looks baby smooth! Will be purchasing another for my mum to try!</li>
            <li> It would have work if it didn&#x27;t cause me to breakout all over my face. At fist I thought it was just normal breakout. A couple here and there then by the second week I had pimples all over my face which I never had. I decided to discontinue using it and my face started to clear. I had such high hope for this product.</li>
            <li> My Problem: I am 28 years old and from south exposed to a lot of UV rays from Sun. The back of my neck, just below the hair, I had signs of aging (wrinkles, big ones) and the whole area was BLACK. I am light brown by complexion. I had a little bit of itching in that area (probably, skin irritation). All of a sudden, one day I noticed that it was black. Then in a couple of days, it got worse, the skin got thicker. I have done a lot of research and found out that the skin was asking me to take care of it since it was black and thickening due to sun damage and improper care.    Ideas: After a lot of research, I bought a sunscreen with SPF of 50. Applied for 3-4 days, no change, the skin was still thick and black. Then, I ordered Palmer&#x27;s Skin Lightening cream, it seemed like my skin was getting better at one time but would return to black when I looked in the mirror other times. Basically, it did not solve the problem.    My Solution: I do NOT have sensitive skin because I have used almost a lot of stuff on my face in the past but Chemical peel is not something I had ever used. Instead of spending 100s of dollars just to get the diagnosis, I thought I would give this a shot. If I do not see a difference, I might be visiting a dermatologist anyway. Ordered from Amazon, came on time. Applied once, no change. Applied twice, no change. Applied thrice, no change but skin thickening seemed to be becoming normal. Applied the fourth time, I saw the WHITE FROSTING on my skin, Viola. In the next two days, my skin is medium brown and the thickening that shows the sign of aging is TOTALLY GONE. I am going to stick with this therapy for few more days till my skin becomes in tone with my neck.    Procedure: If you are going to try this, PLEASE HAVE PATIENCE. THERE IS NO MIRACLE DRUG OUT THERE. PLEASE TEST IT ON YOUR ARMS BEFORE YOU USE THIS ON ANY PART OF YOUR BODY TO SEE IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ANY CONTENTS.  DO NOT SHAVE OR EXFOLIATE THE AREA 24 HOURS BEFORE OR AFTER APPLYING THISACID.  DAY 1: Clean you area where you are going to apply this using an unscented body wash. Gently clean off the water using a cotton cloth (DO NOT RUB). Use a Gauze pad or cotton ball to apply this onto your skin. Use only one coating, don&#x27;t apply over and over on the same area. Wait for 2 minutes. Wash if off with cold water (DO NOT RUB). Clean with a cotton cloth (DO NOT RUB). Apply a moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 30 or higher.   DAY 3: Repeat the same process but leave it on for 4 minutes.  DAY 5: Repeat the same process but leave it on for 8 minutes.  DAY 7 and On: Repeat the same process and leave it on for 8 minutes.    DIFFERENCE: Some people might see the frosting right at the first time while others like me will see in few applications, that is because it is doing its job from top to bottom. So be patient. I am not a nurse, but frosting is what seems to clear up the skin, so if it does not frost, chances are you are not getting rid of your problems. You just need patience till it does.    RATING: I give it a 5 star because this has saved me ton of money. I am going to order few more for my friends too. If you need more education, research on youtube for a channel called \\&quot;DermTV\\&quot;. This doctor gives great tips on skin.    THANKS FOR READING.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing short of amazing. I am a 25 year old female, and throughout the last 3 years I have had major on and off problems with acne. I don&#x27;t know why, and it has severely bothered me seeing as before the age of 22 my skin was almost always perfectly clear. It was something I was regularly complimented on. SO these mini-breakouts I&#x27;ve been getting, mainly appear on my forehead, in clusters of very small little zits. Nothing would make them clear up. If they did, new ones took their place. I wash my face every morning and night, I mosturize, I tried many different exfoliants...Even my visits to dermotoligists, and taking prescription Retin-A did not clear my skin. Nothing. Has. Ever. Worked. Then, somehow I stumbled upon this product. It has changed my life. :) My skin is back to how it once was, pre-mid-twenties. I am simply amazed. Now, I can walk out of the house and I don&#x27;t even need a speck of makeup. As of right now, using the product only SIX times (once every 5 days) there is not a single zit, red mark, bump, or pimple ANYWHERE on my face! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, as other reviews say, the product does slightly burn. But DUH. you&#x27;re putting an ACID peel on your face. I also have only experienced minimal flaking. I just be sure to moisturize after using...as the directions state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!  Use as directed.  You can easily burn your skin.  Noticeable improvement with first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 6 weeks, once a week, and without the slightest exaggeration, this product has CHANGED my skin.     I&#x27;m 17 years old and have very sensitive skin. When I was younger I suffered from SEVERE sun damage in Florida that has plagued my skin ever since. My biggest complaints about my skin (before this product) were : BLACKHEADS, enlarged pores, blotchiness (resembling rosacea, but not), lost elasticity, oily shine, and tons of underground bumps on my forehead.  It&#x27;s not that I had a face full of acne, I just have never been happy with the quality of my skin. People told me that it was genetics, and nothing could ever change the way my skin was, and it really freaked me out because my skin was the source of a serious lack of confidence. But THEN, I read great reviews for this product, so I decided to try it out.     I didn&#x27;t really notice much change until maybe 2 weeks ago, and each day it keeps getting better. The first 3 times I used this product, I was in total shock because it took off dead skin that was still just sitting there in the crevices of my nose.    Now, my blackheads are virtually gone.....I thought I would never be able to say that. I don&#x27;t have to wear make up anymore to feel pretty, in fact, I feel better without it. I swear, I&#x27;m just an all around happier person because I&#x27;m not always feeling self conscious about my skin. People have come up to me and asked if I underwent some laser treatments or something because it looked like I had a different person&#x27;s skin.    I really hope you try this product! You will not regret the purchase. I cannot believe that it is only 18 dollars. EIGHTEEN dollars. Man, if only I found this product years ago so I could have saved hundreds.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I wasnt expecting much, but the results are unbelievable, i have used it 3 times so far. My skin is so much clearer, smoother, and pores are so much smaller... totally worth the 18 bucks. The first time i left it on for 5 mins with slight burning on my cheeks. But the consecutive times i first clean my skin of all dirt and oils by swiping it with rubbing alcohol and then apply the peel. It works so much better and I dont leave it on past 3 mins cuz the burn is more intense. I have used so many products to try to control my acne (moderate) but nothing until this has come close!!!I actually purchase this along with some emu oil so after the peel i use a tiny amount to keep the skin moisturized ( a little goes a long way). Awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> I must admit I was sceptical about the product&#x27;s claims - but it has definitely helped decrease my acne breakouts and has helped to get rid of some bumpy clogged pores, especially on my forehead.  I bought a Groupon recently for a salycilic peel (right before I bought this product).  Well, I went to the skin care clinic, and their peel felt and acted _exactly_ like this product.  For $20 this is a great deal,  now I am excited about trying the glycolic peel too!  Oh and great shipping, it arrived in just a few days.</li>
            <li> This product completely burnt my skin and left me with 4 different black scars here and there.  Now, I might have to go for a laser treatment to recover my skin color.    Worst product ever used.[...]</li>
            <li> I first got a glycolic acid and started to use it and it worked pretty well, my skin was much more even and healthier.Definatelly saw an improvement and my forehead wrinkle is less visible/at least a day after the peeling/.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I needed another bottle and realized that the salicylic acid is more specialized for acne so I ordered Salicylic Acid 20%. Every time I use it my skin looks so nice, even,and what is the most important, I don&#x27;t break out that much...I used to break out every day and now it is maybe once a week, but it is getting better....I have/had bumpy skin but with each peel I can see a lot of progress and it looks like my skin is smoother and less bumpy. Well, I love this product and it definatelly help me have a better skin. I am not saying it made my acne vanished, but it helped me way more that any other product that I have tried before.&lt;br /&gt;Ps. Build up your tolerance slowly.</li>
            <li> Great product I have just used it once but can feel the difference my face feels smooth and less oily, I ordered the cellbone pH neutralizer along with it and they actually give a free 15ml sample of the glycolic 35% peel. The shipping was really fast too!</li>
            <li> Great Product. Will clear up your skin like it states. Make sure to use moisturizer because it will leave your skin feeling dry and flaky for about a week. Keep the product on for as long as you can up to the 8 minutes recommend max for prime results. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I used this twice a week for 6 weeks and didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my acne at all.  My skin got incredibly dry, which is to be expected, but no difference other than that.  I&#x27;m disappointed as I read such other great reviews.</li>
            <li> Have tried everything including antibiotics, lazer treatments, acutane, peels.  Finally this product controls my skin by using it initially only twice a week and now once every 2 weeks or when break out starting.  I can use this treatment, wash my face, apply make up and go to work. No problems.  If using around mouth, I apply thick coat of chapstick to avoid lips... I use for 8 minutes. I am not sure why my derm did not suggest this after all the years of failed treatment!</li>
            <li> I started having severe adult acne breakouts in 2004. Since that time, I have tried every conceivable product on the market. When the OTC products had no effect, I consulted a dermatologist. Talk about adding insult to injury, the treatment(s) I received through the dermatologist aggravated my situation even further. I felt like a walking nightmare. I became so self-conscious that I found every excuse not to leave the house unless absolutely necessary. I couldn&#x27;t even make direct eye contact with anyone for fear that they were looking at my horribly broken out face caked with makeup and powder to hide the volcanous ruptures underneath. I know, I know, the makeup and powder was only clogging my pores further and exacerbating my situation. Denial is a horrible master.    When I saw the Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel on Amazon.com, I was reluctant at first. I had tried numerous products with certain percentages of salicylic acid in it, but I took note that this product was a GEL PEEL with 20% salicyclic acid. I was familiar with peels and how they were supposed to lift off severe acne scarring and associated discolorations in stages through a peeling process. I didn&#x27;t know much more than that about the science of peeling, but 20% of salicyclic acid seemed more like a percentage a dermatologist would prescribe. I ordered this product on a wing and a prayer, and I have never been happier.    For anyone out there who is considering having a iron mask forged to hide their adult acne, DON&#x27;T!! Buy this product and use it as directed. DO NOT exceed the amount or timing-this is a chemical peel. You will do damage to yourself by thinking, \\&quot;If a little worked so well, a lot more will work even better.\\&quot; WRONG. Be patient. I guarantee you the results will be evident almost immediately. As for any stinging or burning sensations, there was very, very little (almost negligible) that I experienced--and I had become used to some products causing me severe reactions with no improvement whatsoever.    Not only does this product rid you of your current acne situation, it will help recondition your skin to prevent further breakouts--it actually firms your skin as well! REMEMBER: Apply moisturizer after washing off this product, and you will look and feel great! If you&#x27;re feeling hopeless, I implore you to give this product a try. Friends and family have not stopped complimenting me about my new, beautiful skin--they say not only do I look great but I look younger, too!! Makeup will become your friend again. You will turn heads again--but for the right reasons. Three great results for the price of one! BUY THIS PRODUCT AND START LIVING AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product. In fact, before I purchased it I told everyone I&#x27;d found this amazing peel on Amazon but I take that back.    I won&#x27;t advise anyone to stay away from the product as it obviously worked for many people. I&#x27;m african american with a medium complexion. I have combination skin with blocked pores and dark marks all over my face from acne. I used this product for 4 weeks, once every 5 days and the only outcome was incredibly dry/old looking skin even if I used a good moisturizer. All of the marks on my skin are now darker than they were prior to using the product and it did nothing to combat acne. I didn&#x27;t leave the product on for more than 4 minutes yet the last and final time I did, the skin on my chin burned off leaving bruises.    For me, it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the peel as often as directed for about a year now and my skin is noticeably softer and smoother whenever I use it, however, I see no dramatic long-term improvement.  It works well to clear up acne breakouts for a few days, but it has not stopped the breakout cycle.  I have battled mild acne for years--the kind where no matter how well I wash my face and no matter what product I use, I still see a few small pimples every day, and there&#x27;s the occasional larger breakout of 10-20 little pimples.  The results from this peel are not miraculous (maybe I could use something stronger?) but I have had no adverse effects such as peeling, redness, irritation, etc., and I can say my skin is a little better than it used to be on a daily basis, though it was never that bad to begin with.  For me, the best product to clear acne and soothe my skin is still Queen Helene&#x27;s Mint Julep Mask: the next day after using that I always see all my pimples have shrunk and/or disappeared, and my skin is softer.</li>
            <li> After reading all kinds of glowing reviews for this product, I was eager to try it!  I followed the instructions carefully, using it about once a week and starting with just one minute of time on my skin, and gradually working my way up to about 7 minutes.      I have some minor acne, and a problem with clogged pores, but unfortunately this product did not seem to clear my skin at all, even after several months of use.      PROS:  Very clear instructions, cheap enough that even though it didn&#x27;t work for me, I don&#x27;t feel like I got ripped off!    CONS: BURNS when you rinse it off, causes some redness, and DIDN&#x27;T clear my acne.    Bottom line - it didn&#x27;t work for me, but it was worth a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from mild to moderate acne since my teens.  I am 40 now  and I finally see a light at the end of the tunnel. Like many of you, I&#x27;ve spent so much time, emotion, energy and money looking for something ... anything ... that would help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face three times a day with salicylic acid acne cleanser and I&#x27;ve been using this product for four minutes once a week. Then I use an AHA cream around my eyes for my fine lines. Blackheads gone, pores smaller and no pimples. My skin is much less oily. It is also causing my dark patches from previous pimples to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My partner was so impressed that he asked me to give him a peel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really impressed. I noticed the difference my very first time.  If you are considering one of those acne programs like Proactive or Murad, please try this first. My skin has never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:  I wrote this original review over 6 months ago.  I just want to report that I am able to use the product much less often with the same result.  I am using the peel about once a month for about three minutes.  My skin is still the clearest it&#x27;s been in years.  Still happy.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived promptly in one layer of bubble wrap and a box; I was concerned about the glass bottle breaking but it arrived intact. The peel itself made my skin smoother and diminished the size of my pores; I saw these results immediately, and received several compliments on how smooth my face looked. It burned and tingled with the first use, but I quickly developed a tolerance, so that I could leave it on way over 20 minutes. My skin peeled with the first use only.   While I would recommend this to someone who wants smoother skin, I would not recommend it for clearing acne, as it seemed to aggravate my spots rather than soothe and exfoliate them.  I also have been using it persistently on a wart on my finger. The wart is the same size, just smoother on the surface...  It&#x27;s also probably worth mentioning that the only peeling I experienced was on my chin, which was COVERED in super-inflamed pimples. The peeling that occurred around 4 days later made it impossible to wear make-up; foundation on-top of flaking skin is not a good look.</li>
            <li> I tried this salicylic acid peel for the first time, and noticed almost immediate results.  Although I experienced a bit of irritation for about 1hr afterwards, the next morning my skin looked better than ever and my pores were visibly smaller.</li>
            <li> With all the glowing commendations for this product, I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong by purchasing it. Wrong, wrong, wrong. I followed the directions; I didn&#x27;t leave it on longer than 8 minutes, and I didn&#x27;t use it more than once a week. I rinsed with cool water and used a noncomodogenic moisturizer afterwards. I didn&#x27;t lay out in the sun. Now, 6 or 7 weeks later, my skin has never been in such terrible condition. Where I was only having mild breakouts before, my face now resembles that of my acne scarred adolescence. I cringe when I look in the mirror. Please, save yourself some trouble and DO NOT buy this product.</li>
            <li> I got this peel because I had never used a peel before and I was looking to curb acne. This is a starter peel, meaning an idiot can apply it, your face won&#x27;t burn off. I was terrified I&#x27;d have peeling, horrible burning, etc. But, it wasn&#x27;t too bad. Slight burning after a few minutes. The price seems reasonable enough, too. I don&#x27;t know if this is appropriate or not...But I use a fan brush to apply the peel, leave it on for ten minutes and wash it off with really cold water. Of course, before applying, you aren&#x27;t supposed to use micro-dermabrasion products and you&#x27;re supposed to have a very clean, dry face. I bought cellbone technology&#x27;s Prep Toner to use before applying the peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does dry my skin somewhat. But honestly, it&#x27;s really easy to use. It will tighten your skin, no matter your age. It&#x27;s helped with acne somewhat as well. I think in combination with good face products, anyone will probably see some good results. It freaked me out a little but because after one use, my face looked like a child&#x27;s. I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone, then I&#x27;ll probably try the Glycolic or maybe a combo-peel once I feel confident enough to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this helps but I am 25 years old, very fair skin, also mild-moderate acne. Maybe it&#x27;s the peels or maybe it&#x27;s the investment in expensive (ish) face products, but I have seen marked improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and don&#x27;t pick at your skin after using this.</li>
            <li> Ok I used it for the first time last night I cleansed my face I also used which hazel to get access oils off my face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I put the gel on my face it really didn&#x27;t burn at all it was more of a tingling  feeling it did crystalize some but not much in my opinion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left it on for 8 mins then I took off the gel with cold water&lt;br /&gt;now while taking of the gel I did feel a little burn but it was not bad at sll&lt;br /&gt;I then put on some moisturizer this morning I also put on some SPF sunblock even though the sun was not shining I was not taking any chances LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to put gel on every day I will put on every other day for 8 mins&lt;br /&gt;what I also was thinking about is taking pics on a daily basis to see my progress&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to update for changes</li>
            <li> Well I deiced to try this peel, and it was absolutely amazing. I applied it to my face for probity 12 minutes (don&#x27;t do that) and my skin was so soft and my healing acne scars were turning white. Two days later my acne scars were literally peeling off. It did wonders for my acne scars and stunned acne growth for a short time. I moisturized my skin with virgin olive oil and I think that added to the healing and peeling. If you suffer form acne like me let me recommend Green Tea. Overdoes on Green Tea and you will not have anymore acne. Ever since I started drinking green tea no new pimples developed (Its been a week I only have old deep ones left). I stopped drinking the tea for one day and I broke out with three new pimples. Use this every week, use olive oil, and drink green tea and you won&#x27;t have acne if you suffer from oily skin.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about using this at home, but I followed the directions to the tee and am so happy with my results.  After about 6 weeks of use, I have less acne breakouts and my pores look much smaller.  Fine lines around my eyes have lessened, as well as furrow lines seem less deep.  My t-zone is more normal and less oily. I am amazed this addressed so many different problem areas on my face.  A great overall facial skin problem solver. Love it!</li>
            <li> After researching some at home alternatives for peels, and less expensive options, I decided to try this since it seems more gentle. I followed directions and though it did sting for the 8 minutes you&#x27;re supposed to leave it on, I didn&#x27;t see much peeling after nor did I see any difference in my skin... I only tried this 3 times, once a week and gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do use it as a spot treatment and dabon pimples overnight and it seems to dry out pimples so you can flake off the skin faster and it starts to heal. That alone is a great reason to get this. Now I have a giant bottle of this that will last years!</li>
            <li> At 29, acne should be a thing of the past, however it has become worse. I have oily combination, very sensitive, skin and decided to try this peel. I followed the directions and am very pleased by the results after only one use. I will admit, I did spot treat the next couple of days, which caused my T-zone to become dry and start peeling, but it&#x27;s a gel \\&quot;peel\\&quot; so it&#x27;s doing what is is supposed to!  I seem to be allergic to the world, but it has been a week and this product has not bothered my skin one bit.  Very happy with it so far!</li>
            <li> I got this for my son age 13.  Tried everything else on market including expensive brands to no success.  This made a noticible difference after only a few days.  And noticible lifting the severe scars after a month or so.  Now he only uses it for spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I love it,  it works.</li>
            <li> At first i was skeptical of this acid peel, but changed my mind soon after.  I took before photos to see the change the peel would have on my face, and its only been about 4 weeks, but i will take pics soon of the after results after 6 weeks.    Im 20, male, white, with slightly oily skin, and acne that sometimes turns horrible on me and makes cysts only on cheeks though. One cyst next to my eye and eyebrow left a bad scar.    This stuff does tingle a bit, but very bearable. Used first for 2 mins, and had no effect, upped it to 4, same result. Used the full 8 mins the next day, started to see improvements. I modified the instructions a bit because my skin is used to exfoliations by 10% benzoil peroxide which only made pimples smaller and face a bit dry.    I used every other day for the full 8 mins every time. But i suggest follow their instructions first before adjusting it. No down time here, and no redness like some people mentioned, and i dont apply moisturizer. The skin feels same before and after application, but results can been seen a few hours after the application as well as increased results over 24-48 hours. The company suggests using a moisturizer, so dont take my word for it that you may not need it, so start with that. I started first using this product with a moisturizer but i think it clogged my pores and cause mild acne.    The results i got were:  -Pores got smaller noticeably on the nose, but not as much on the cheeks.  -Face became much more smoother, the scars got blended in(not the major ones thought)  -Face is less oily after application as well as for the next 24 hours or so. No moisturizer was needed for me, as the amount of oil on my skin after use of the peel stayed at a perfect level.  -Face got lighter (can be seen in my pictures), and red spots from old acne lightened up slightly.  -Acne breakout decreased alot. I no longer get acne on my cheeks and forehead. My problem is the nose and chin, mainly the bottom portion of the nose.     Final Comment: I would recommend this product to first time chem peel users. My sister is trying it right now. My skin is not sensitive, so i will be looking for a stronger solution, maybe 30% salicylic, or 35% glycolic. May buy this (in the 100 mL bottle) after i get rid of my red spots to maintain an acne free face.        Ill keep you guys updated with what happens in the next 2 months or whatever because its only been 1 month, and full results may take much longer. btw, i still have half the bottle left after 1 month use.    Update (aug 16, 2009): I ran out of the stuff and have ordered another bottle, but i have not been getting acne after i stopped, so i think it played a huge role in it. Much less red spots compared to 3 months ago. Scars did not really change much. Skin also feels much more smooth without any pimples appearing all the time.</li>
            <li> I have never been so pleased with a product in my life. I feel like I&#x27;ve finally found the secret to amazing skin (sorry for sounding like an infomercial). I am 25 years old and in the past year or so after never really having severe acne all my life, I developed severe cystic adult acne. No matter what I did it would not go away. I can&#x27;t tell you how many thousands of dollars I&#x27;ve spent on beauty products at your usual beauty store claiming to get rid of adult acne. Tried various medications, everything. THIS STUFF IS ONLY $18 and it&#x27;s been AMAZING. To get my skin used to it initially (be warned, I don&#x27;t really know the correct usage of this stuff but this is how I did it), I applied it every three days starting at a minute and increasing by one minute every three days it was applied, working my way up to eight minutes. I noticed very minimal peeling, but my skin improved drastically, even not being at the eight minute mark. Two days ago, I finally made it up to eight minutes, and my skin is peeling significantly today! Not enough where someone could really notice, unless they stood directly in front of me. I am excited because I see amazing new skin emerging underneath, and at this point since I only have acne scars left, I am hoping to see them fade over time. I will continue to do eight minute peels once a week and see what happens. As far as the burning goes, it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I had expected based on the other reviews I&#x27;d read here. It feels more hot than anything else. I actually find putting my face in front of a fan more irritating than without. But maybe I&#x27;m just the exception. I will warn you though.. if you get cold sores, do not apply this stuff on the areas you&#x27;ve gotten cold sores.. you WILL get new ones if you do. I learned the hard way. But I&#x27;ve since avoided the area and I seem to be doing fine so far!      I&#x27;ve never reviewed anything on Amazon before, but this stuff was just too good not to say something about it. BUY THIS! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> I started having problems with adult onset acne at about age 25 - am now 40.  Have tried everything - oral antibiotics, topical antibiotics, retin-a, etc. etc.  Despite trying numerous dermatologists, I never got what I considered good results - just a three minute visit and a couple of scripts.  Decided to try this - at the price, nothing to lose.  Man am I pleased.  For the first time, acne is resolved (I have used the peel once a week for about six weeks).  My scarring is improved and my skin tone is becoming much more even.  Even improving my melasma.  I would highly recommend this product.  Word of caution.  Acne will worsen after the first treatment - wait it out - it will improve Dramatically.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help even out some redness and solve mild acne. NOTHING...it burned a little after being on for 15 minutes, but once I rinsed I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in my skin, nor could I after 2 weeks of using this product every other day! What a scam!</li>
            <li> I was getting good results with this peel until I knocked it off a shelf and broke the bottle! Oops! It definitely stings so I had to move around the house while I waited or sit in front of a fan (the cold helps) but seemed to help make my skin much more smooth when I was using it weekly, slowly increasing the time I kept it on. I just wish it was in a plastic container so clumsy people like me can&#x27;t break it so easily!</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times already and I really notice a difference in the texture of my skin.  My breakouts are fewer and Scars are less noticeable.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So, i just purchased this product and arrived yesterday. I NEVER had a chemical peel in my life, so i was really careful with the product. I didn&#x27;t put the peel on my cheek, i wanted to try the acne prone area: Forehead &amp; Chin first before i proceed. Well, i put it on for 1 min and washed it off with cold water. it feels really cool and refreshing when the product is on my face. No pain or sting at all. After that I rinse it out really well with cold water. Amazingly, the product doesn&#x27;t try up your skin right away. It just creates like a real thin layer, then i applied moisturizer and went to bed! This morning i woke up, no peel... feels the same. thats why i don&#x27;t know if this product is really working yet. I need more time to tell. But it does feel really good when its placed on your skin. Think about it! Most acne clearing gels have 2 % salicylic acid ingredients, this has 20% ... so, it has to work in the long run. i&#x27;m really optimistic! Will update soon!  _______________________________________________________    After 5 uses, no significant sign of improvment. I love the refreshing feeling of the peel after its washed off. Should i be using this product every 2-3 days ? I&#x27;m also using the Glycolic Acid Peel 35% which i feel does create an overnight smoother skin texture.</li>
            <li> It was working great, I use it about once to twice a week.  My scars are just too deep. It does burn a bit, but make sure you read the directions. My brother wanted to try it. I warned him do Not rub when removing it. This includes dragging your hands across your face when rinsing. I just poured water several, several times over my face and patted with a towel. He almost peed himself it hurt so much.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this product due to the high reviews.  So far so good but to be honest ive used it maybe 4-5 times and I cant see a big difference. I have mild papular acne and I think this product would benefit those who have pustule acne alot better since that lays on the surface as opposed to underneath the skin like mine.  I am taking Minocycline and just started so hopefully this peel will help with the red marks left behind.   As far as the peel on your face, yes it does sting but its managable!  I leave it on for 2 mins max. then add cold water for a mintue.  I have a combo skin type but more on the dry side so I do experience flaking of the skin.  Use an spf most definitley!  Overall: I would say to give it a try and see for yourself since its much more cost efficient then going to spas as I have in the past!It does make ur skin feel nice and smooth but the peeling part sucks.  Hope I can see some results soon!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product. I am starting to see the wrinkles and fine lines. I definitely felt the stinging/burning sensation the first time I tried it. I could only keep it on for 1 minute. I&#x27;ve been doing this treatment for a few weeks now, once a week. I&#x27;m not sure if I see the difference, but my co-worker said my face looked different. After using the product a few more times, I can tolerate the stinging for longer now, I&#x27;m up to 3-4 minutes now. I haven&#x27;t had any recent acne break-outs so I am assuming this is a contributing factor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 years old and I have really sensitive, semi-dry skin.  I have some hyperpigmentation from sun damage and monthly blemishes.  I have maybe had 2 facials in my life so my skin was not used to such a high concentration of salicylic acid, or any other kind of acid for that matter.  I have used the product about 4 times now.  The first time I used it I literally felt like the skin was burning off my face.  After the fourth use it&#x27;s at the point where it still burns but it&#x27;s not unbearable and I can last the whole 10 minutes.      Although the peel is painful it has definitely been worth it.  I was afraid I would have a lot of dry skin on my face which would show through my makeup since I have semi-dry skin already but it honestly wasn&#x27;t that bad.  There were probably 3 small dry patches but you couldn&#x27;t see them through my makeup and after the second day I used a dry washcloth and wiped the dry skin off.  My skin is very smooth now and the hyperpigmentation is almost gone.  Before I would never go out in public without makeup on because I felt like people could see my age in the condition of my skin but now I have no problem going out with a clean face.  I have used a number of products of all price ranges in the past to minimize the hyperpigmentation and nothing ever worked.  This is the first product I have ever used with success.      If you can&#x27;t stand the pain and can only tolerate a minute or two the first couple times you use this product you will still see outstanding results.  Also, it says to use lotion after using the peel but I have been putting on toner and that has really been a more effective way of moisturizing my skin immediately after using the peel.    I gave this product 4 starts out of 5 due to the pain.  As far as effectiveness is concerned it deserves 5 stars but the stinging is really unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I bought this product back in August of 2010 and used a few times. I started having fairly bad acne and needed something to help it out. I bought this along with Dudu Osun black soap. I used the peel a couple days a week for about a month then just once a month. I haven&#x27;t needed to use it for the last 2 months. Since then I gave it to my friend, who has the worst acne I have ever witnessed (cystic, infected, blackheads, you name it), in hopes it will do a little something for him. (I&#x27;ll see how it works for him and update in a couple months)  I don&#x27;t know if it was the reduction in stress in my life, getting more adequate sleep, not being a teenager anymore, eating more fruit, or just the soap and always using clean cloths to wash, but I only get spot breakouts that are small and go away quickly, which I can live with. My skin seems to always be improving with just using the soap, literally only the soap. I don&#x27;t moisturize, use the salicylic peel, face masks, nose strips, or any acne wash or cream at all anymore. Just the soap everyday in the shower. I do think the salicylic acid helped give my skin a jump-start though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since age of 13. Now 44. Recently it has become worse. First time using this product my acne became worse then improved. I use this on Monday and use the TCA peel on Wednesday. My acne has improved alot, my skin is getting better every week I use this. I have been using the TCA peel 4 months before. TCA peel seems to work better with the Salicylic acid peel. I wished that I have known this along time ago.</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast and the peel arrived early (in perfect condition). I&#x27;ve used the feel for 6 - 7 times already. I noticed my pores are smaller than they used to be. Acne shrunks quickly and old scars diminished. The colour of my skin becomes even which makes it easier for me to apply make up. However, acne problem worsens after the third peel. I thought maybe it&#x27;s got to do with the fact I was using a day cream that contains Lactic Acid. So I stopped using it. Yet my acne problem doesn&#x27;t improve at all. I used to have a mild occasional acne problem but now it looks as if I&#x27;m going through puberty again! So, I don&#x27;t know what went wrong. I&#x27;m still going to use this peel though for I&#x27;m hoping my condition will improve eventually.</li>
            <li> Ive tried a lot of products and this one didnt really work for me... I read other peoples reviews and was excited but didnt clear up much and I stop using it</li>
            <li> Cleared up my face right away. Pores are so much smaller, face is clean and radiant. I use prescription Retin A as well and this works so much better. Make sure to use lots of moisturizer and try to use something all natural.</li>
            <li> The item was carefully packed and got here before the scheduled arrival date.  Kudos to the seller!  Anyway, I never had problems with acne when I was a teenager; however, I turned about 25 and bam, I suddenly have blackheads and pimples.  The blackheads are most bothersome because they&#x27;re exceptionally noticeable on my nose and chin.  I have tried every scrub out there to no avail.      Then I purchased this peel.  I&#x27;ve never tried one before in my life so it was a novel experience.  I will say that the first time I used it, there was significant discomfort.  IE, it felt like someone was holding a blow torch to my face.  The mask stayed on for only a minute.  I got a little bit of redness, a little puffiness, but no peeling.  I followed up with an oil free moisturizer.  When I woke up in the morning, many of the blackheads had decreased in size or disappeared.  Per the instructions, I waited 7 days and went back at it.  This time, I was able to leave it on for about 3 minutes.  My face is seriously peeling and now, there&#x27;s not a blemish on my face.  I&#x27;ve been cleansing, toning, and moisturizing the same as I always do.      I would say that this product has been miraculous for me.  I know the results aren&#x27;t permanent; nothing is.  But this is something I&#x27;m willing to add to my weekly skin care regimen because the results have been so dramatic.  Even the women I work with have been complimenting me on my skin.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! I have paid hundreds of dollars for peels at local spas and I was tired of it. I needed a product that would deliver the same results without the outrageous price. I found it thanks to this peel! I get the same, if not better, results from this product! Just make sure to follow the instructions step-by-step and you will be good to go. I use it once a week and it has saved me time, money, and hours trying to cover up blemishes. I have zero blemishes thanks to this product. I will definitely be re-ordering!</li>
            <li> Been using it for 3 weeks, 1-2 times per week. Makes my skin smooth. Not sure about long-term effects yet. If you&#x27;re use to spa facial treatments, then the tingling isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff for my sons molluscum contagiosum. What typically takes 12-18 months to get rid of, is nearly gone after only 3 days! I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about it. Simply apply it with a Q-tip 2-5 times a day to the molluscum areas &amp; they miraculously begin to dry up &amp; go away. This is our second bout w/ this molluscum stuff as my kids are both on the swim team &amp; my daughter got it last year. Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t use this stuff as the molluscum was on her eyelid. I used an herbal product that worked, but was quite expensive and took about 6 months to see results. I highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff is not a joke.  But I like it.  I&#x27;m 39 &amp; have been suffering w/adult acne for way too long and have tried so many products.  I believe my problem is probably internal but this peel helped clear me up some regardless.  The first time is recommended at only 1 minute &amp; I thought that&#x27;d be no prob since I&#x27;ve put myself through such torture in the past to get clear skin.  OMG it was more than uncomfortable &amp; I couldn&#x27;t wait for a minute to be up.  I didn&#x27;t see or feel any results right away but it did bring some yuckiness to the surface right away....a bump under my nose (ouch).  You shouldn&#x27;t apply again in less than 5 days.  Three days after I saw results.  I was peeling around the edge of my nose &amp; it was kind of gross &amp; I was in public...in a restaurant (very classy!) &amp; even worse!...I had no idea other than my nose felt weird &amp; dry.  The second time I could stand it much easier.  It really depends on the cleanser you use prior to.  The first time, I used a gel (Neutrogen Grapefruit \\&quot;something\\&quot;) that was very drying &amp; the peel just aggravated that dryness.  The second time - I&#x27;m not gonna tell you I forgot it was on! - but it was much less uncomfy &amp; I could leave it on longer.  The cleanser I used that time was a Cuticura bar soap (drugstore.com) &amp; that&#x27;s a lot less drying.  The third application was no problem.  This does dry up/heal stuff you may have messed with (like I do).  My \\&quot;polka dots\\&quot; are fading &amp; I have hopes that this will take care of some minor sun damage as well.  This is not a miracle end-all be-all cure but I&#x27;m glad this stuff exists...I had kind of given up hope for any topical treatments!</li>
            <li> If there was such a thing as a \\&quot;magic\\&quot; acne solution, this would be it. I&#x27;m a 26 y/o male and I&#x27;ve been having these outbreaks for awhile now. I&#x27;ve tried Proactive, Natures Cure, everything in the face washing section and nothing has worked until this peel. This product has dramatically decreased breakouts, cleaned and shrunk my pores, and helped my overall skin tone.    If you are a beginner, start off with the 20% solution and buy a skin Neutralized/pH balance. I use cotton balls to apply both the Peel and the Neutralizer.    First week: I applied twice that week giving a few days in between applications. Because I didn&#x27;t know how my skin would react, I left the Peel on for only 2 minutes (this is plenty for the first few times).     Second week and On: I began increasing the time by 2 minutes every so often. Now I&#x27;m at 8 minutes per peel and still only using it twice per week.      This chemical peel is a remarkable product that is worth the time, money and a little pain.</li>
            <li> Other than accutane (which only worked for the months I was on it), this product is the ONLY thing in over 25 years that has worked! Highly recommended. Worth it&#x27;s weight in gold.</li>
            <li> I told a friend I was going for a peel and she told me her secret. Buy the peel from the Amazon website and follow the simple directions to a \\&quot;T.\\&quot; I love the results, I peel once a week and will taper off to once a month soon. My pores are nearly non-visible, my face is so smooth and soft. There is very ,very little discomfort if you can even call it that. Rinse very well with cool water and apply the lotion they suggest. I love this product and will continue to use it forever!!! Amazing results!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the salicylic acid about three months ago. If I were to review this product after using it for a month I would definitely give it a bad rating. After using the salicylic acid three times I got a really bad break out. It was probably my fault for leaving it on for about 5 minutes. My skin was all red and there were cystic pimples everywhere on my face. Especially the forehead and around the nose. It took about 3 weeks for these to subside, while I did not use the product. After these three weeks reluctantly I used the peel again, but only left it on for about 2 minutes, every 4 days. Then i increased to about 4 minutes also every 4 days or so. This seems to work perfectly. My skin has never been this clear. I never had a lot of acne, but I have a lot of white heads just under the skin that got infected very easy. This peel will slowly clear your pores and leave your skin more even and acne free. It needs time to work.          I think its very important to emphasize that initially your very likely to get a bad break out. By giving your skin time to heal, and  a little patience, you can get almost perfect skin. I highly recommend this product, especially to people who have a lot of white heads. Will definitely purchase again.    Ps. - Make sure you use a good and light moisturizer after the peels, otherwise your skin will likely get very dry. I am using Cetaphil and it works great.</li>
            <li> I have used this peel about 5 or 6 times and use about tiwce a week. So far i can say that this really leaves your skin smooth and REALLY does shrink pores. This is the only thing i have used that has had a major effect on the large pore festival i used to have on my face. It also did fade dark spot just a little bit the only thing it didn&#x27;t do for me is to prevent new acne from forming. Not sure if that is bcos i am still in the \\&quot;it would get worse before it gets better stage\\&quot; but i have seen more breakouts lately with the use of this peel. I also alternate with TCA 10% peel so not sure if that could be it as well. Anyway overall this is a good product. And i do hope to see some improvement with preventing new acne or might have try a higher strength. I am also africam american and will recommend this for dark skin.</li>
            <li> I am a black woman, with caramel skin tone--- and I do believe this will be part of my routine skin care regimine!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed immediate improvement, though not drastic. I have large pores on on my cheeks--on either side of my nose and my forehead, small blackheads on my nose. I usually use Queen Helen mint julip facial to help with my \\&quot;enlarged pores\\&quot; and it seemed to be only an immediate fix-- a day later they looked like craters again.  However, after this peel I noticed a change in pore depth and size. I woke up thinking \\&quot;Oh my goodness are my pores huge again\\&quot; -- but today (2nd day after peel) they still are minimal!!!  I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything under the sun from prescription to over the counter and nothing has worked on my acne. I started using this as a last resort to try and combat my acne and acne scars. I have never used a peel before so I didn&#x27;t really know what yo expect but I gave it a try and I haven&#x27;t looked back. When you first put it on you will feel an intense itching and/or burning. You may experience white spots on your skin after you wash it off but it is temporary and will vanish after you moisturize. I started seeing results after two weeks and my acne scars are finally starting to disappear. I am biracial and the scars take on a dark brown to red appearance. I am only on level one, but if I am seeing this kind of results I can&#x27;t wait to work my way up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have one piece of advice. The directions say to use a brush or cotton ball but that technique didn&#x27;t work for me. I went and got a medicine dropper and use it to put the solution in the palm of my hands then I spread it with my fingers. I am able to apply the solution faster and spread it more evenly. This method also makes you use less solution so you will have more than the 15 applications that are in each bottle. Just make sure that you wash your hands with soap and water after the solution has been applied to your face. Read all the instructions, and most importantly listen to your face. If it is peeling or irritated allow more days in between uses.</li>
            <li> After three uses my skin looks so much younger. My once super deep, big blackheads are almost gone. This is a miracle worker. Definitely worth what you pay. It says to leave on for one to eight minutes, but i could only leave it on ten to fifteen seconds. Buy this and you wont regret it. But be careful to follow direct exactly, so you dont damage your skin.</li>
            <li> Use this once a week and I guarantee you&#x27;ll have smoother skin in less than a month.  However, do not give in to the idea that keeping this gel peel on your skin for more than the recommended high of 8 minutes will get better results -- this stuff is potent, so start out keeping it on for one or two minutes at most, then work your way up to the longer treatment.  You will experience slight stinging after application and that&#x27;s entirely normal.  I will be using this product on a weekly basis from now on. Scaley, rough patches on my cheeks have almost entirely disappeared.</li>
            <li> Incredible Results!!! I&#x27;m buying one for each one of my close friends. Cheap,efficient, and just plain wonderful!! I recommend buying a ph skin neutralizer to kill the burn after the peel.  The seller ships very fast.  This is a must for people who want to diminish their acne, pore size, acne marks and oily skin.  I&#x27;ll be using it for life and giving it as birthdays and christmas presents for a whiiiile...Great!    Here is the ph skin neutralizer to kill the burn post-peel:    [[ASIN:B000VEN3RW Neutralizer skin pH balancer helps balance the pH of your skin for the safe and effective neutralization after peeling.]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about salicylic acid, but I don&#x27;t know if it just isn&#x27;t right for my skin or if I&#x27;m using it wrong. I have brown skin, so I&#x27;m aware that my skin can react differently to it. The first time I used it, I only did a spot treatment and had it on my skin for 4-5 mins. It turned one of my already dark spots darker, I really hope this is not permanent! Afterwards I didn&#x27;t notice any peel whatsoever.  The second time I tried it, I left it on my face for less than 4 minutes. Instead of a spot treatment I used a small brush to cover larger areas. This time I did notice a little peel, but nothing to write home about. Plus I had to rub my skin to get the dead skin off 5 days later. And once again, it turned a random spot darker. I don&#x27;t understand why it only picks ONE spot out of the 20 that are on my face to mess with.   Overall I&#x27;m not really sure about this product. It didn&#x27;t peel my skin, or clear my spots, luckily I didn&#x27;t get any redness or irritation. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars only because I think I might find a better technique to use it in the near future but other than that this product is a 1. If anyone has any tips please feel free to respond</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a few weeks ago from amazon.  After 3-4 times of use (second week) I noticed the results. I had very oily skin and acne issues.  this product has dried out all my acne, COMPLETELY with in such a short period! I notice spots on my face where my skin is peeling; bringing out new skin.  I love it!  I look forward to every use with excitement! I have never seen results that work so fast in treatments. For the first time in years, my face is clear and I am starting to enjoy not wearing make-up.  This makes me Love Amazon!</li>
            <li> micro needling is the better way to go, be patient but that works better</li>
            <li> I am 34 and still have breakouts. I have seen multiple dermatologists. I&#x27;ve been on oral medications and topical medications. Nothing was working. I was desperate to find something to help me get rid of my acne and I came across this product. I have only used it 4 times and WOW! What a difference it has made already. My face is clearing up finally. I only wish I had found this sooner. Surprisingly it has not dried out my face however the first time I used it, I did break out, but it cleared up quickly. My only suggestion would be to do the first application when you have no plans to be anywhere just in case you break out like I did. The breakout quickly went away and my skin is looking better every day!    UPDATE: I have been using this now for about 3 weeks. After several uses, I did start to peel and my face was dry in certain parts (especially my chin, around my nose, and at my temples). My face was a bit of a disaster for a few days - some pimples mixed with dry skin but I found an amazing fix and my skin looks! Use a little bit of vaseline (yes sounds weird I know but I googled this) on the really dry parts (just a thin layer). Also, if you add a little vaseline to your moisturizer, your skin will be amazing in the morning (no dryness and no pimples)!</li>
            <li> #1) so this salicylic peel is not like a tca peel where your skin peels and there is a downtime, correct? it just gets rid of oil and just makes your skin a bit red but no peeling?  because i need something that i could use as daily maintenance or use several times a week to reduce oil and prevent new acne from forming but where there is no downtime as i need to work. i&#x27;ve had tca peels where my skin would peel for a week. i would get that once every couple of weeks.  #2) can i use this with retin-A? it would be great where i could use a product that would reduce the oil and i can apply retin-A over it. any suggestions would be much appreciated.</li>
            <li> I have never used a gel peel of this strength before - so when I first applied it - the burning sensation was a huge surprise. Afterwards, my skin started peeling slightly around the chin. I am pleased to say that after only one use, my acne is starting to fade. I wouldn&#x27;t use this product more that once a week since skin needs time for new skin cells. I am very pleased with the results! It is a very strong gel peel.</li>
            <li> This peel works great! I used it on my clients and myself and have seen great results. For those who know what they&#x27;re doing and have used active treatments before, this is a great weekly peel to keep major acne outbreaks at bay and smooth out the skin&#x27;s surface.     If you&#x27;re thinking about using this peel and you&#x27;ve never used anything but hand soap on your skin, I would say put the credit card down and do some research before you buy. The treatments really work, but if you haven&#x27;t built up your skin&#x27;s \\&quot;readiness\\&quot; with some home treatments, even over-the-counter acne washes with 2% salicylic, the burning this peel will produce will be too much for you.</li>
            <li> Since I do not study chemistry, I can not understand how this product worked. I got acne suddenly this year may be because I always stay up late and have great pressure(I have never had acne before). The acne is quite serious. The first time I used this peel, I felt my face was burnt. I only let it stay on my face for 30 seconds. Supprisingly, the next two days, the acne became dead. I continued to use it for about 3days. Then used it again the next week. The face did not react as strong as the first time. I let the peel stay on the face for 5 minutes. I continued to use this peel for a month, once/week, the acne was kept in a stable situation, which was not totally removed, but not serious as before. Later, my friends recommanded me Body Shop acne remove mask. Then I stopped using peel for two weeks. But at the begining of the third week, my acne sudenly tended to serious as a month ago. I began to use peel again. And my face reacted as strong as I first time used it. I guess I can not leave it until my life style become healthy.</li>
            <li> I have used many many facial products, but not one as good at this one.  I would highly recommend this product. After just one use my acne scars were much lighter, and my skin felt like a babies. I was totally amazed that I got the results that this product promised.  I followed the directions exactly, and used witch hazel as my toner as recommended.  I don&#x27;t think I could say enough good things about this peel. If you are having problems with acne, and acne scars you just have to try this.  It really did work for me. I have very fair and sensitive skin, so I was a bit worried about redness, and peeling.  I had none after the frist use, and to this day still don&#x27;t. Great product.</li>
            <li> I am a 43 year old Caucasian woman and have had acne my whole life.  I would classify my skin as combination sensitive.  My acne has never been bad enough to require Accutane or constant dermatology visits, but it is annoyingly persistent and has worsened into my early 40&#x27;s.  I usually have small pimples every morning, and larger cysts maybe once a week.  Visible blackheads on my nose that have never resolved.  I have very large pores on my nose and chin and damage from past and ongoing cystic pimples in those areas.  I also have had regular but not so often acne on my cheeks, maybe once a month.  But the acne in those areas discolors my skin for a longer period of time.  I also have 4-5 milia (tiny white hard pimple things that never go away) that have formed around my eyes in the last year or so, probably due to the anti-aging gunk I have started trying there.  Over the years, I have used antibiotics a couple of times and that really seemed to help with the acne.  However, as soon as I stopped, it returned.  I have never had a facial or experienced any kind of chemical peel.  This was my first time.  :)  I have been using this product for about a month, maybe 2x per week.  I always wash my face and then use alcohol all over to clear and prep my skin for the acid.  I do not use a brush or gauze or anything to apply it, but use my fingers.  I pour about 2 pea-sized drops into my left palm and use that to start with.  I apply to my forehead, down my nose, and then to my chin, and then do cheeks and the skin around my nose.  Sometimes I have to pour a bit more into my hand to get it all done.  At the end,  I get a Q-tip and apply it very carefully to the milia closer to my eyes.  Word of warning:  If you are applying close to your eyelashes and they get wet with it, chances are the stuff will slide into your eyes.  And it burns hella bad, requiring super rinse immediately.  Even the fumes off of the stuff will cause your eyes to tear up, so be very very careful if youare working close to your eyes.  THEN WASH YOUR HANDS!  Don&#x27;t leave the stuff on your hands and fingers.. it will burn.  I left it on for 6 minutes the first time.  It burns all over, yes.  I have been able to leave it on for the full 8 minutes from that point on.  I use a hair dryer on my face, on the cool setting, while I am waiting the 8 minutes.  It still burns, but is tolerable with the air blowing on it.  I then rinse my face with lukewarm to cool water for about 2 or 3 minutes.  A couple of times, my face has stung after rinsing it, but this goes away in about 20 minutes.  I have been using Olay Regenerist micro-sculpting cream after each acid treatment and as a regular moisturizer every day.  At first, I noticed that I did have more small pimples showing up on my nose within about 24 hours of using the acid.  My nose is my worst area, biggest pores, most skin damage due to the past acne.  However, these were small pimples and went away quickly and were not painful like cystic ones.  I have also had two larger pimples try to form on my chin and cheek-but both times, I spot-treated  left it on for 8 minutes, rinsed off) them after washing my face and the cyst virtually collapsed overnight, never progressing to form a pimple.  Amazing.  I can still see the large damaged pores over my nose, but they are flat and do not appear to have the darker appearance of gunk sitting in them (pre-blackhead) as they usually do.  Over the last 2 weeks, my skin has been pretty clear.  I still have some discoloring from past acne, but it covers easily with a light dusting of the Bare Minerals foundation I have been using for years.  I do not have to use any other kind of concealer or spot coverage, which I have in the past.  I do see the discolored areas fading though, especially over the last week.  The milia seem to disappear for a few days immediately after the treatment, then peel a little, then faintly re-appear.  I anticipate that they will eventually peel completely off.They are much smaller and less-noticeable than they were a month ago.  I love this stuff.  After only a month.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how my face looks in another month&#x27;s time.  I have already ordered more, even though I have not even used a quarter of the bottle that I started with.  I also have some of the 35% Glycolic to try at some point, but have been waiting to see how using the Salicylic 20% progressed.  Am very very pleased with this product.  I had lost hope of having pretty skin and was just depending on make-up to cover the acne.  I have used the Biore ice cleanser with a buff puff for years, and it did seem to work at keeping the oil away.  However, the acne persisted.  And I have never been able to use a moisturizer without breaking out-so it is nice to be able to use one now.  The \\&quot;peeling\\&quot; and \\&quot;flaking\\&quot; of my skin has not been too bad, either.  I notice it on my cheeks and under my eyes when I have used it there.  Also, the active acne on my nose and chin, when it is drying up, flakes quite a bit.  But all of this is better than the red bumpy scabby normal stuff that I lived with on a day to day basis.  Hopefully, this review will help and someone else who has given up will give this product a try!  I am so glad I did.  :)  Jan 19, 2012 update:  I cycled off of the weekly treatments (alternating Glycolic and Salicylic for 2 mos) for almost 2 months and gave my skin a chance to just relax.  To my relief, the bad acne did not come back.  I still get small pimples on my nose and chin about 2-3 mornings a week.  But none of the cystic stuff that is so painful and scarring.  Just started up the weekly treatments again.  Skin really burned-so it&#x27;s like starting over.  These products are really amazing.  If nothing else, the salicylic for spot treatments alone is worth it.  As soon as I feel the pain of a pre-zit, I apply this stuff on the spot for a few minutes.  It kills it before it even forms.  Salicylic definitely kills the blackheads too-they just dryup and fall out.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I&#x27;d like to make it clear that while I have a few small zits consistently, my acne is not that bad compared to some of the other reviews. This may be why the acid hasn&#x27;t worked well on my skin yet. I want to use it because i have random blotchy darker spots all over my face and a lot of acne scarring and blackheads and whiteheads galore. I&#x27;ve used this peel four times over the course of a month. All that&#x27;s happened is that my nose has gotten flaky and i got two random dry patches on my cheeks. My blackheads seem to be more pronounced but i think it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re closer to the surface due to the peeling of my nose. Hopefully with continued use, I will see better results. I shall update when i do!</li>
            <li> After years of sun damage and wrinkles forming on my skin, I never thought I could finally find something to help my complexion. Not only did it clear up my acne, but it made my skin feel soft and new. My wrinkles are much less noticeable and my skin looks a lot healthier. Not many products actually work but I&#x27;m glad to say that this one did. I&#x27;m very happy that I decided to use this product and I recommend it to everyone that wants better skin.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this item ([[ASIN:B000PLUZL8 Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)]]), I thought I would be a part of the 90% success story I found on Amazon .  This product is an amazing product, but not for me.  I am a biracial (african american/korean) with oily, mild adult acne skin.  I thought I had it bad, but now its worst than ever.    About a month and a half ago, I received this product by mail and relieved that I would get the beautiful skin I used to have when I was  back in my teens.  Since the tender age of 20, I broke out all over my face and there wasn&#x27;t a product out in the market that could give me the clear skin I have longed for.  I found this product on Amazon and expecting a miracle! Man was I wrong...    The first time I used this product, I followed the instructions to the letter, I washed my face with Cetaphil soap, used a toner, and then the peel.  I only had the product for a minute the first time and I immediately rinsed with cold water.  After,  I mosturized with SPF face lotion and I went on my merry way.  Let me take a moment to add that I used a product called Atralin given to me by the dermatologist.  They told me that all the toxins in my skin will rise up to the surface but in about three months, I will see visibly clear skin.  I stopped using the product after about a week because it burned and made my skin so dry and crusty that I didn&#x27;t want horrible looking skin.  Well, this product created bumps on either side of my jaw.  They were not pimples, just dirt underneath the skin that was in the process of breaking the surface.  I quit the product before these bumps could form into pimples.    Back to the results, the peel destroyed all the existing pimples a lot quicker than any other acne product on the market.  Furthermore, the bumps I mentioned earlier were now turning into pimples which were going away just as quickly as it would come.  The length of time the peel has been on my face has been increased a minute with each use, and the peel is applied every 5-7 days as recommended.  After the third or fourth peel, I finally saw a glimpse of the beautiful skin I once had! That succes was short lived, the week after, I broke out (still breaking out) with volcanic-like pimples that are ready to erupted.  I paid no attention to the pimples when I first started the peel because there was a stage that reviewers mentioned that it would get worst before it got better.   I am going on my seventh peel and I don&#x27;t know if I have graduated from that stage yet ???    I have 7 larger pimples, 3 small pimples, and many bumps on my face.  To add insult to injury, my jaw has been covered with scars  from the pimples that erupted on my jawline. The pimples are coming back so fast before the scars would disappear.  I think I could pass for Frankinstein&#x27;s little sister, twice removed!   By the way, I DID NOT PEEL AT ALL THE ENTIRE TIME USING THE PRODUCT! Which I think was a blessing in disguise or a curse. My face is just getting worst with pimples and multiple scars from those pimples and I am not sure if I&#x27;ve weathered the storm or should I just quit.      If anyone has had similar results like mine and have continued using it  and it eventually got better, please let me know.  I have been avoiding all mirrors as much as possible because I cant stand the sight of my face :0(.  Please NOTE,  the product is producing more pimples than I have ever seen in a lifetime, that is not to say the the peel itself is damaging my face (i.e. chemical burn, spots,  excessive drying, etc.).   Please comment (without insult) of methods or your personal story.  The product does state that it will not always get immediate results and that it make take up to 8th or 9th peels before real results are shown!      Lastly, I hope this review has shined some light on people who are experienceing the same thing as me :0)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acne, I have a different skin condition, Keratosis pilaris, so I decided to give this a try, because as many have mentioned, for the price you really have nothing to lose. It has definitely decreased the redness that comes with this, which is awesome because I&#x27;m not particularly fond of looking like I&#x27;m blushing all the time. It is also reducing the bumps on my face which is also fantastic. I have noticed a slight increase in zits (and I mean slight as in one or two zits every two or three weeks), but many reviews say this will subside, and I believe them. Plus, since this dries out skin, the zits are gone in about four days so it certainly doesn&#x27;t bother me. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and definitely would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been terrible but I do get considerable breakouts every now and then. Once I started taking birth control, my skin went nuts and I break out in places I have never had blemishes on my face. This stuff is seriously the best thing I have ever tried. I still get zits here and there but they are mostly small and dry up quickly.  I recommend not investing in one of the over-priced fan brushes advertised for it and pick up either a fan brush or foundation brush by E.L.F. from Target(or online) for three bucks.  It does burn/itch, but let it stay on for as long as possible (try to make it to the maximum of 8 minutes). My skin is very pale and sensitive so I usually do this at least two hours before I have to be anywhere so that I&#x27;m not glowing red. Make sure to apply a heavy moisturizer right after. I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Night Cream and haven&#x27;t had any peeling issues or flaky skin.</li>
            <li> My experience with this peel has been consistent with many of the other customer reviews.  It will take your skin time to adjust.  Your skin will be sensitive and red immediately after use and will then become flaky (using a moisturizer helps greatly but will not prevent this).  After this passes your skin will look and feel significantly better in every way for a few days until you use it again and the process repeats itself.  When I first started using this product, the amount of time after use before my skin would look better was around 2 days.  There is little you can do during this time to hide these temporarily negative results.  I was fairly disappointed.  However, encouraged by the positive reviews, I stuck with it and the amount of time these negative results lasted has gone down considerably (less than a day and during that time it&#x27;s less noticeable now).    I have also found that if you have acne under your skin that has yet to come to the surface using this will bring them to the surface.  So the next day after you use it you may see some whiteheads that weren&#x27;t there before.  Don&#x27;t be alarmed or discouraged, in the long run this is for the best.  It is a temporary setback that will be gone once and for all if you continue to use the peel.    There are two other points I&#x27;d like to bring to attention.  (1) The instructions recommend using it 2-3 times weekly.  For me this is much too frequent and I don&#x27;t feel that there is much benefit to using it this often.  Using it every 5-7 days (I use it every Sunday) is sufficient for great long term results.  (2) The price is a steal for what you are getting.  I have been on the same bottle for 4 months.  From the looks of it I won&#x27;t have to buy another bottle for another month or so.  So for me it has been much cheaper and much more effective than anything else that I could have used during that time.    I have struggled with bad skin for several years.  It is dries out easily and is naturally oily.  I have triedmany other products including Proactive.  Nothing else comes close to this.  After much searching, I have finally found the solution and instead of being embarrassed by the way my skin looks, I often receive complements.  I hope you have the same experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this peel for a month now, with a total of 4 peels done on my face and back. I have acne and dark marks, olive complexion, and real oily skin especially in the summer months. It hasn&#x27;t helped with the oily skin, but it has diminished the amount of acne, and reduce the pigment on my acne marks. I&#x27;ve used the glycolic peel of the same brand 3 years ago without any luck. This peel stings a lot when I apply it to my face, but not so much on my back. I have built 2 minutes tolerance for my face and that has helped to reduce my acne. I do use benzoyl peroxide and a prescription tretinoin for my acne and the combination of it all has helped keep my acne to about 1 eruption a week, where before I was getting one or two new pimple a day. I hope I continue to get results.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING for women of color!!!! I recently ordered this product and after the first use my skin was glowing and cleared the acne within 24 hrs.  I followed up with the Neutralizer PH Balancer and a 70% Sunblock to further protect my skin.  I have no more over 40 year old acne and everyone notices the difference.  Because of the high concentration of Salicylic Acid, you can feel it working immediately, and see the dead skin removal  as you apply with a cotton ball.  I only left it on for 2 minutes, even though the instructions say 1 - 8 minutes.    I am ordering more!!!!</li>
            <li> I just used this peel (10 minutes) ago. I followed the instructions but left it on for almost 3 minutes instead of the recommended 1 (for initial contact). There was very little burning/sensitivity, perhaps because I have thicker skin and used to other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 30s and get more acne now than I did as a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;Oral contraceptive pills worked for me but I do not want to take them anymore for possible negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably increase the time to the full 8 minutes and frequency as others have to see faster results.&lt;br /&gt;I kind of wish I started with a stronger concentration as funds are limited but I think this will be a good start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**: January 1, 2012 (Happy New Year)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product on a Monday (3 min.), Wednesday (7.5 min.), and Friday (7.75 min.).&lt;br /&gt;Today is Sunday and I am peeling much more but it&#x27;s a peeling the way I used to peel when I first started using Retin-A.&lt;br /&gt;So, yeah, the dark spots left from pimples are lightening and I am definitely shedding old skin.&lt;br /&gt;I just bought a stronger concentration from Skin Obsession because I would like more intense results. I was @ a doctor&#x27;s office where an employee had tried one of their peels. I am not sure what combo/concentration she had but she had dark skin patches on her cheeks. She explained how she has been peeling. It looked like a severe sunburn, I guess (never really experienced a sunburn that bad), but it looked like the peel was pretty intense and there were \\&quot;more\\&quot; layers of skin being sloughed off.&lt;br /&gt;That is what I am looking for.&lt;br /&gt;With this product, for me, I just get \\&quot;light\\&quot; peeling. So, if that&#x27;s what you want which I think anyone who does not have too much \\&quot;skin\\&quot; issues might, this is the perfect product. Maybe I&#x27;m just impatient, he he. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This product is really fantastic. It can be quite uncomfortable at first, but, it really seems to do the trick. I had pretty much the worst breakout of my entire life, and this stopped it in its tracks. I have done this peel three times in about two weeks and I have barely had any breakouts at all, maybe one pimple every five days. Also, the pimples that do show up are very small and almost invisible when I put makeup over it. I don&#x27;t know if this will work long term or not, but, for now, it&#x27;s pretty fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am 35 year old Hispanic female. I have been dealing with cystic acne for the past few years! Within the last 6 months, my acne had gotten really bad. My jaw line and neck was filled with painful cystic acne. I was on a bunch of topicals as well as oral antiobiotics. Nothing seemed to help. A friend mentioned this product and I decided to try it out.  After the first application, I noticed a dramatic change. The cysts began to shrink and within a couple of days from the 1st use, the pain was gone and the cyst were gone. I have used this peel 3 times already. The first time, I left it on for 3 minutes and rinsed it off with cool water. The peeling began the next day.   If you have cystic acne, give this a try! It is not hard to use.  Wash your face with a gentle cleanser, do not exfoliate. Pat dry. Apply the peel starting at the fore head. Down to the neck line. Because I was new to the \\&quot;peel\\&quot; world, I let it sit for 3 minutes and it was a bit uncomfortable. Fan your face and it will help. Rinse with cool (not luke warm) COOL water. Pat dry with paper towels. Let face completely air dry and then apply moisturizer. YOU DONT HAVE ANYTHING TO LOSE!!!!  I am now going to start to alternate between glycolic and salicylic peels!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used three applications so far and i am amazed at the results.  Immediately after the first treatment my face got brighter and my pores had gotten less noticeable.  So i am excited to see the results after 6 weeks.  I would recommend this product, for sure.</li>
            <li> This product works!  Just be sure to follow the instructions to the letter for safety.  I use it for no more than 8 minutes on a small area.  The results are the same as paying for an expensive facial.  Don&#x27;t expect results immediately after you apply it.  Expect your skin to peel over the course of a few days.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. I was worried that it was going to work when I got it but I have noticed the change in my face since I have started to use this. I would recommend this to any and everyone who is having some problems with their skin.</li>
            <li> This product gave me horrible, cystic, swollen painful deep acne breakouts.  In addition to loads of tiny pimples all over.  Don&#x27;t know if its Salicylic acid itself or if its the company&#x27;s formulation.  Either way, will not use this again, and won&#x27;t even take the chance of buying anything from this brand.</li>
            <li> I use this product on my skin about once a week. I am trying to relieve some of my acne scars and this one is nice. I would suggest using it for only a few minutes at first to make sure your skin can handle it  it is very strong but I need it for my bad skin. My skin is sensitive so I peel even though I use it weekly.</li>
            <li> This stuff works fast. I wish I had tried this a long time ago. I am African American and I have been struggling with a hypertrophic on my face for a couple years. After doing massive research, I decide to use a derma-roller, super cop 2x, and salicylic acid peels on the scar. I started out with a 5% salicylic acid cream, then I moved up to this 20% peel. Every few day, a layer would peel off, and the scar is almost totally flat now. Using the copper along with it (peel in the morning, copper 2x at night), the scar has become much more like the normal surrounding skin. I decided to leave this review for anyone out there who is struggling with a hypertrophic scar and doesn&#x27;t know what to do. I searched for the last two years and nobody had a real answer for what African Americans can do for this type of scar beside laser treatment, which is very expensive. 2-3 months of derma roller plus copper at night, and a gentle peel every other morning, can literally remodel the scar and allow you to rebuild more normal, healthy skin in place of it. Copper is crucial because it helps prevent the skin from re-forming the type of abnormal scar tissue that is typical in hypertrophic scars.</li>
            <li> it worked really well. it burns REALLY bad for the first few mins but once you get  use to it you&#x27;re all good. do not buy if you have sensitive skin. with regular use, the dry skin that it causes will go away. and don&#x27;t forget to moisturize!</li>
            <li> I put a lot of hope in this product. I didn&#x27;t expect it to magically eliminate all of the spots that the acnes have left on my face, but I expect a gradual change. In the first month, I did not see clear changes. One disappeared but the other came up. Having read other reviews, I assume it would happen. After 1-2 months, I stopped and started using Origins (serum + moisturizer) and my skin was making much better progress.  Last week, I try to combine the together. I used the peel and then put on the correction serum, then moisturizer. Now I have 3 visits from spots, all of them dark and kinda hurt. Assuming Origins was really effective, I have nothing to blame but the peel. I&#x27;m not sure if I should continue it or the spots will get worse...  Demographics: I&#x27;m Asian. A year ago my skin was PERFECT, unblemished and smooth.</li>
            <li> I started using this a month ago.  My spots were really looking good and fading away.  I think this is better for spot treatment rather than the whole face.  But I got a really bad breakout due to stress(2nd worst I have ever had, if you click on my profile you can see my pics of it) and just recently had to buy stronger stuff(TCA peel).  I know that I am not an ordinary case though because my skin is really tolerant to peels.  So I will be using this in conjuction with the peel until my skin returns to normal.( I never had breakouts when I was a teen, just started in my 30s).  But armed with both of these products, a good skin regimen, and eating healthy,  I am confident more than I was a year ago that I won&#x27;t have to hide under a inch of makeup pretty soon.</li>
            <li> Ok I just just this on Monday March 23, and belive me this product so far what it did it was an burning and stinging sensation, it was horrible I thought my face was in hell, lol. Take your time and see some videos about the salicylic acid peel you would see its complete normal&lt;br /&gt;After two day as expected I did got breakouts but not that much. I got high expectation on this so I hope it works. let you know in couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Sunday april 8, its about 3 weeks using the product need to tell you my skin feel much smoother than before, it help me with my breakouts still got some of them but not like before, it also help me with some dark spots, so far happy and cant wait to see full results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Salicylic Acid peel for a month now and I really like it. I came off of accutane last year and still have some lingering scars and dark spots. I&#x27;m also starting to see my first fine lines and wrinkles. Even though my face is completely clear of blemishes, I still have to wear makeup because I just don&#x27;t have pretty skin. I was about to get a medium depth TCA peel from my dermatologist, but I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to take a week off of work to recover! So I started browsing the internet. This peel got such fabulous reviews (and was such a low price) that I decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so terrified of burning my skin off, that I literally put it on for 10 seconds the first time! That obviously did nothing, so each time, I bumped it up to a minute, then two, and so on. No matter how long you leave it on, immediately, your skin feels softer and more smooth and it just appears tighter. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything anyone else would notice, but my satisfaction is enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t start seeing real results until I kept the peel on my skin for at least 5 minutes. That time, I got noticeable peeling over the next couple of days-it reminded me of what I call \\&quot;accutane skin\\&quot;. If you&#x27;ve ever taken the drug, you know what I mean - dry, a little itchy, flaky and a little pink. Several days later, you start to see new, softer skin appear. Since I&#x27;ve been using this peel, I haven&#x27;t even had to use concealer, as my skin tone is significantly evening out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> For some reason I&#x27;m really not sure if it&#x27;s working or not. I don&#x27;t have what 99% of the people have. I used it for about two months every week and I didn&#x27;t have a single peel or anything resembling it. I use it without moisturizers because my skin is pretty oily so after a few hours my skin becomes normal and dry but then gets oily again. Maybe I should use it more than once a week? Just really surprised I don&#x27;t have peeling even though everybody does.  Also just a little worried about skin cancer. For how long you cannot expose your face to the sun after applying this product?</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve begun to give up hope on any helpful products for my acne. I&#x27;ve been through many 3-step acne product lines including AcneFree, Clinique Acne Solutions, and others that either irritated my skin or just didn&#x27;t help at all. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want to see the total amount of money I&#x27;ve spent trying to find something to combat this annoying skin ailment during the past two years.    This was kind of my last test on trying to correct my face. As expected, I saw no results from this product. I&#x27;ve used this about three weeks, and I did not expect some dramatic miracle, but seeing nothing positive happen is just a disappointing. Only reason I gave it two stars is because it didn&#x27;t damage my face or produce any bad side effects. It just had no effect at all, positive or negative. My tolerance to the stinging sensation grew quickly, and I did not go through any peeling. Acne didn&#x27;t subside, it just carried on its normal routine. My blackheads remained and my pores did not seem smaller after use either.    These products make me consider going into the skincare business. As a single consumer, I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on facial products that produce no results. It&#x27;s a great industry to make money I bet. If I see any positive results after continuous use of this product, I will be sure to update my review to a proper rating.</li>
            <li> This product was not a good choice for me. Let me start by saying that I get an occasional cold sore. I have the medicine, Valtrex, which keeps these at bay. Anyway, I have a light brown, age spot on the side of my face that is about an inch by a half an inch. I bought the Salicylic Acid and read the directions, which state that people who use this product and have the cold sore virus, might get cold sores. I used the Salicylic Acid on the spot on my face and within minutes felt a cold sore coming on. I popped a Valtrex and continued to use Valtrex for the next two weeks while I used the Salicylic Acid. The spot faded slightly, but at the end of these two weeks, the inside of my mouth had a rash, and when I stopped the Valtrex, I felt another cold sore coming on. To me, this wasn&#x27;t worth the possibility of cold sores, so I stopped using the product.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how to rate this product. I didn&#x27;t have any huge fading of my brown spot in the first two weeks, but I might have had more luck if I had kept using the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with very high hopes. I have had acne scars for about 2 years and finally decided that I needed to do something about them. Considering this is the first time I have ever had an chemical peel on my face professional/unprofessional I decided to pick one of the lowest chemicals, being this 20% peel. I was definitely very scared when I first did the peel. I had everything I needed and followed all the directions. Washed my face with a mild cleanser (Cetaphil), dabbed my face with alcohol to remove excess oil, and then took vaseline and lined my mouth eyes, and near my nose to protect from potential chemical burns. I put the peel on with a cotton ball and it stung almost immediately. I managed to cover my entire face but only left it on for a minute and then quickly washed it off with lots of very cold water. I then put on an oil-free moisturizer with 35 SPF Neutrogena brand. My face was red but it completely stopped hurting. The next couple of days I patiently awaited results but saw none. So the first day I applied the peel was a Sunday. On Tuesday I decided to try it again. Following the same exact steps as my first application except I left the peel on for about 4 minutes. Once again it felt about the same. Days later no real results. I guess my pores have gotten smaller, skin softer, and it is a bit more \\&quot;glowy\\&quot; but alas my scars have not faded. I tried the peel one last time Friday for about the same results. I decided my skin needed a deeper, stronger peel. I am glad I tried the product though and know that my face can handle chemical peels. I think this is a good starter peel to really see where you are at regarding chemical peels and your skin. I have purchased the  TCA 15% peel so let&#x27;s see what happens. It arrived in the mail and I have put it on. I will write results on that peel once I know them. Hope this helped!</li>
            <li> Like my title says, I suffer from both eczema and acne. I&#x27;ve had eczema my entire life, but I didn&#x27;t develop acne until last year. It hit me REALLY hard, and it was hard for me to fight back. Most treatments helped the acne, but made my eczema worse. And if I used a product for eczema, it would clog up my face and make the acne worse. Proactiv was the best treatment I used, but for a college student, it was expensive to keep up with. I had stopped using anything on my face for such a long time, and it has left dark spots on my cheeks, rough patches on my chin, and pimples on my forehead and along my hairline.  After seeing such good reviews for this product, I gave it a try today. All I have to say is that I&#x27;m impressed. There&#x27;s no visible change in my skin, but it feels so much more soft and clean than with any other product I&#x27;ve ever used. Like the pamphlet said, my skin did feel a bit dry after using, but the dry sensation went away on its own without needing a second product. I think a previous reviewer mentioned being Tyra Banks&#x27; complexion--which is the same skin tone as I am, so I did see some redness on my cheeks, but I&#x27;m 90% sure it was because of the wash cloth I used (it was a bit rough, but I didn&#x27;t have any other clean ones).  While using the product, my skin did burn and itch while it was on. It was very hard to not scratch it off. so, anyone who reads this: PLEASE do not hesitate to wash it off. I could only keep mine on for about 3 minutes. You may do permanent damage to your skin if you don&#x27;t wash it off when your body clearly knows that it&#x27;s time. The itching/burning wasn&#x27;t as intense as I may make it seem. Its more like the itching you get in your feet while you&#x27;re driving, and you just can&#x27;t reach down to itch it (I HATE that feeling...).  Another thing I will mention is that you may want to speak with your dermatologist before using the product if you don&#x27;t know how your skin will react to it. I went to see my doctor about two weeks ago for a routine check-up before buying this. It&#x27;s always better to be safe than sorry!  Overall, even though it&#x27;s my first day on this product, I&#x27;m very happy with it. My skin feels so much healthier, which is a blessing for someone who has lived her entire life with multiple skin problems. I will try to continue to update with my progress.  P.S. You may want to go out and buy a light lotion/moisturizer to go with this skin peel. Not only for your face, but for your hands as well. I accidentally got some on my fingers, and my hand dried up like a sponge in the desert.  ------------------------------------------------------------------  Day 1:  Used the peel twice for no more than five minutes--once in the morning and once at night after my shower. The reported \\&quot;burning and tingling\\&quot; was minimal and no visible changes in my skin were seen. Skin felt cleaner and the rough patch on my chin had improved.  Day 2:  The \\&quot;rough patch\\&quot; on my chin has nearly disappeared with three light treatments since day 1. The burning sensation while using the peel was more intense than from the day before, so only used it once and will most likely skip a treatment for day 3 and just use my normal moisturizer. Pimples along my hairline and on my forehead haven&#x27;t changed. The dark spots on my cheeks have lightened slightly. Pores don&#x27;t seem to have changed much.  Day 3:  Skipped the treatment for the day.  Day 4:  Skin has started peeling! The peeling that&#x27;s most noticeable is on my cheeks. The acne on both cheeks has improved greatly, however, my forehead hasn&#x27;t changed. It might have to do with my period starting soon, since my acne breaks out during that time of the month anyways. The rough patch on my chin has no visible change as well. I did another treatment right before bed to help with the peeling, and used a regular cream moisturizer afterwards.  Completed Week 1/Into week 2:  Its been over a week and I&#x27;m a couple of days in to week 2 (I&#x27;ve lost track...). So far, so good; my ultra-sensitive skin has taken well to treatments. I&#x27;ve noticed a pattern, though it may differ from person to person. I don&#x27;t use the peel everyday. I use it (for example) once on Monday. By Wednesday, my skin will begin to peel. I&#x27;ll use the treatment and then I&#x27;ll be fine. Then Friday, it starts all over again. My face has really started to clear up. I was very worried because eczema has made it hard to put any product on my skin. Most make up, perfumes, and lotions break my skin out into a rash. The pimples on my forehead haven&#x27;t completely gone away yet, but they&#x27;re getting better slowly over time. The pimples on my cheek are 90% gone. There&#x27;s a few remaining on my right cheek, but they&#x27;re hardly visible. My chin hasn&#x27;t had a pimple in days, but the skin is still a bit rough to the touch, but just by looking at it, you can&#x27;t tell that anything&#x27;s wrong with it. It could just be dry and I need a better facial moisturizer. My hairline has improved dramatically. I used to have pimples all along my brow, but now its like nothing was ever there. I&#x27;m going to start looking for a better moisturizer to use that might help push the treatments along. Otherwise, its still an amazing product!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and did wonders for my skin. I have been using it a little over a month and my skin looks amazing. It is the only product that has done this and I have tried a tone. Not only has it cleared my skin and minimized my huge pores it also cleared up hyper-pigmentation from acne. Its amazing and everyone who has ance should try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over four months, once a week; additionally, both my sisters and one of my brothers have used the product a couple of times.  15 uses? Pshaw. 20 at least...unless you have an exceptionally large face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time you use this product if you can manage 2 minutes you are a super hero.  If you manage that much without crying you have exceptional tear ducts and/or pain tolerance. However, every time afterwards is exponentially easier to handle till 8 minutes is not big deal. Persevere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right from the first use I noticed a radical decrease in pore size (look in a close up mirror 10 minutes after peel and again in the morning to note change), that it was easier to extract goop from my pores and that any cream or treatment worked more effectively proceeding a peel.  I happen to have exceptionally large pores pretty much all over my face, asian american, but regular use of this product has made my pores appear less sunken in and smaller.  Plus, my skin is tighter and smoother, on my forehead especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was definitely some redness and dry skin the first time I used it on myself, but that also diminished with every use.  Though that also could have to do with perfecting MY PROCESS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash face really well, either with my SkinSonic or just in the shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Tone with Witch Hazel (tried this with just alcohol a few times and that adds more redness recovery time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply product with a cotton ball evenly all over face using a q-tip to get around the nose and lips precisely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Sit for 8 minutes (or however long you can stand if you&#x27;re on first few uses) and read something distracting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Splash face with really cold water for a full minute&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Take a pinch of baking soda mixed with water to makes a runny paste and apply all over face (one can of course buy a neutralizer if one is so inclined, but I highly recommend this step.  Yes, it will sting to apply the baking soda; every times you do it, at the same pain level.  However, after a few brief but intense seconds, the pain will fade entirely- which I find it will not do otherwise- and if I do it at night, the next morning, no redness and I&#x27;m good to go for make-up first thing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Splash face again with cold water till stinging subsides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** 8. I then follow with a PH balanced, moisturizing, non-tightening facial mask.  Alba Deep Sea Facial Mask left on for 5-30 minutes (it doesn&#x27;t really dry out and is VERY moisturizing mud so you can get away with leaving it on for a long time) then gently rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. To still dripping wet face rub in oil.  I am a huge believe in facial oils for daily use.  I use jojoba oil from acne.org, the give you a ton and it lasts forever.  It slowly absorbs into the skin no need to rub too much (is FANTASTIC for oily skin) so no roughing up tender skin and there isn&#x27;t a long list of ingredients which could potentially interact poorly with the acid that just ate at my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** 10. I use Acne.org Treatment (a really gentle 2.5% benzoyl peroxide cream) every night as well.  I find it helps a lot with keeping my skin clear of acne and new blackheads as well as help keep my make up in place if I put it on the night before and then don&#x27;t wash my face in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I use step 8 to eliminate dry, flakey skin after a peel, but I have SUPER combination skin that is, at times in the same places, super oily and super dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** If acne and blackheads are really your deal, I would still suggest the acne.org Treatment to tighten pores; however, if that also isn&#x27;t your deal whatever cream or serum deals with you would go great &lt;here&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheesh, this is long and I am aware my Process (if reading this out loud make sure to properly emphasize the P) is convoluted and tailored rather specifically to my skins quirks.  However, if you used this product and liked it lotsbut was then plagued by redness and dry skin consider some variation there in and see if it helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve skipped this product for one two respective occasions and my skin simply did not look as good those weeks.  So this is a skin addiction, not a one time use skin cure forever (what ever is?) which might matter to some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright, I&#x27;ve run out of things to say.  It might seem like I have a lot of qualifires, but I do believe this product to be worth every penny.  The price and The Process, have nothing on what a Spa would do in terms of both money and time, and the results are on par for me.</li>
            <li> I got this product last week and have tried it twice. The first time I applied it with a brush and it really stung - was afraid I had done something wrong so I rinsed it off within seconds of applying it. After re-reading the reviews on this site, I tried it again last night. This time I applied it with my fingertips and it didn&#x27;t sting much at all. I have had some bad breakouts on my chin for the last month or two, a couple of which would NOT go away or get better. I was afraid I was getting some kind of adult onset acne or cysts. However, after I used the peel last night, I noticed this morning that those two spots looked MUCH better - less inflamed and well on their way to healing. Plus the large pores I am plagued with are looking tighter/smaller already. I left the gel on this time for maybe three minutes before rinsing off well and moisturizing. I am very happy with what I&#x27;ve seen already and would recommend this product  to anyone who wants to see a real improvement in problem skin - and we all have problem skin in some way, don&#x27;t we?</li>
            <li> First you should know that I have been struggling with acne since I was 12 and have been on everything you can think of and have spent countless dollars on solutions, concoctions, pills that ultimately did not work. I did find some relief while on Accutane, but after 2 rounds of it (2003, 2006). But now, 4 years later, I am still breaking out like I&#x27;m experiencing purberty all over again. I decided I didn&#x27;t want to put my body through the stress of Accutane again and deal with the dangerous side effects. I have so many scars from the acne and new acne continue to appear daily. And being a woman of color, the discoloration of the post acne marks leaves your skin looking horrible. I literally look disfigured. My complexion is so many different shades that I could never leave the house bare faced. I have literally become a prisoner of makeup. To try to help this, I&#x27;ve began to monitor my diet (limited fried foods, dairy, citrus, fats) and increase my amount of water intake in hopes that my skin will notice and clear up. I have yet to see any hope with this plan. So in desperation, I&#x27;ve decided I need to start my skin over fresh. I&#x27;ve had several chemical peels in the past from dermatologist but being a graduate student, I don&#x27;t have the funds to afford them now. So after doing some research, I found this peel. After reading some awesome reviews, I decided to give it a shot.    I received the 20% salicylic acid on Wed (3/3/10) and decided to use it the very next day (today). I also decided that I would use the peel every other day (3x/week)for 6 weeks before stopping and giving my skin a break. Before I applied the peel, I washed my face with a gentle cleanser using warm/hot water and rinse in cool water. I patted my face with a towel and allowed my face to further dry for roughly 5 min. I applied the peel using a Q-tip and started with my forehead working my way down my face and then to my cheeks. Soon (about 30 sec. into the application) my face began to tingle then burn! I expected this and had a fan nearby. The use of the fan did allow me to stand the peel for approx. 4 min. for the 1st application. I do realize the directions say begin with one min but that just seemed like a waste of time and I could tolerate it for much longer than that, so I did (everyone&#x27;s face/pain tolerance is different). After I couldn&#x27;t stand it any more, I rinsed off with cold water. The burning sensation persisted during the rinsing and the towel blotting. It wasn&#x27;t until I applied Ambi SPF30 face moisterizer that the pain stopped. My face looked the exact same (still acne present and dark spots galore) but my skin did feel noticeably softer. No redness or signs of irritation. What I did notice though, was that the acne that was present was beginning to dry up and become smaller in size. That&#x27;s a good sign. I repeat I&#x27;ve only used it once so I guess I&#x27;ll see how it does. I&#x27;ll check back in 6 weeks when I&#x27;ve had a series of mini peels for a full review.</li>
            <li> I had terrible back acne as a teenager, I no longer have it, but I had/have the dark spots to prove it. They are currently fading with each use (weekly), the really numerous small ones that weren&#x27;t so dark have already disappeared. Still waiting on the big/dark ones, but I can tell they are getting lighter and lighter. Used it 3x so far. I will be buying again when I run out. Shipping was also very timely. I would recommend this to any person of color who is trying to get rid of dark scars faster.</li>
            <li> Unbeleivable how I didn&#x27;t know about this product earlier.  I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 weeks (I apply once weekly) and can already notice the difference! I have brown skin that breaks out monthly and leaves black heads.  Even though the blackheads are still visible, they keep dimishing with each peel.  I would caution not leaving it on too long; the longest I&#x27;ve left it on is 5 mins, was trying to go for longer, max 8 mins and it irritated and left a scar when I inadvertently rubbed off the dead skin from not listening to my skin &amp; not rinsing when it was burning.  Overall, I will follow instructions more closely and not try to rush the re-growth.  Glad I found it and look forward to additional glow![[ASIN:B000PLUZL8 Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)]]</li>
            <li> I just got the product today and decided to go ahead and try it out. First of all, the shipping was AMAZING. I ordered it Monday and received it on Tuesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is not awful. I am not plagued with lots of acne but when I do get a spot its usually followed with a large whitehead. I do have lots of severe blackheads on my nose and chin, which is really why I bought this peel. I also have large pores on my  cheeks close to my nose. Im hoping this diminishes the blackheads and pores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I started the peel I used a cotton pad and rubbed rubbing alcohol all over my face, which ouch, kind of stung. Then I took another cotton pad and wiped a layer of the peel all over my face. I started with my forehead and worked my way down. It did sting, but I had myself worked up about the stinging so it wasn&#x27;t AS bad as I thought it would be. I lasted a little over a minute and then starting cupping cold water and patting it on my face for probably close to a minute. After I finished with the water I then patted my face dry. I noticed my skin still slightly stinging and tightening for another two minutes or so after I had rinsed with the cold water. After this I applied some Olay moisturizer with SPF 30. I have not gone outside yet or slept yet, so I will give this a few weeks and update!</li>
            <li> It seems to me like the most common complaint is that nothing happens with this product. Perhaps these folks need a stronger peel. It is definitely a process to figure out what your sensitivity levels are, but I think it is certainly wise to start on the low end of peel intensity and work up from there. The last thing you want to do is hurt yourself. For me personally, the 20% peel is perfect. I put it on for a minute and peeled ever so slightly for the next day or so. Three days later, I tried it again. This time I tried five minutes. It took about two days for the skin to start peeling and it flaked noticeably for about four days. It&#x27;s not the same type of deep peeling that I got from the peels I was getting from my esthetician. In that case, I didn&#x27;t really want to leave the house for days. With the 20%, there was still obvious flaking but I didn&#x27;t look like I had a skin disease. I definitely prefer more frequent but less intense peels because I don&#x27;t like having to drop out of my life while I&#x27;m doing them. I am thinking you could probably get the same results if you stick with it and stay patient. With more intense peels, you can only do them once every three weeks to a month, but with this peel you can do it weekly. According to the instructions, you can work up to several times a week, but if I did that I&#x27;d probably hurt my skin. If you have the extra money and a weekend to stay home and hide out, the benefits of a deeper peel done by a professional is definitely worth the time. You can see pretty dramatic results from just one peel. This isn&#x27;t that peel, but stick with it and do it weekly and I think you can probably achieve something similar.  Just don&#x27;t try and leave it on for ten minutes the first time or you might burn yourself.     As for the effectiveness, there&#x27;s no doubt that peeling your skin yields results over time. I started using this in the midst of a breakout and it has definitely helped clear me up. I starting using peels to control acne, butI don&#x27;t mind the fact that it helps with aging skin as well.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions, and after gradually increasing the time i left the peel on my face, at the four minute mark, the peel just dissolved all of my blackheads. It was amazing! I&#x27;m glad I stuck with it, because the first few times, I just got some mild exfoliation from it. Build up to a time that would be effective for you, and it will give results.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for several months and while I really wanted to love this product, It just doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;At best, this product works \\&quot;okay\\&quot; as a spot treatment (maybe a 6 out of 10). Sometimes I can apply it at night to a developing pimple and the next day it will be gone, but other times, I will apply it at night and the pimple will still develop the next day. It works best on \\&quot;mild\\&quot; pimples, which is disappointing because I bought this hoping to reduce the appearance of what I like to call my monster pimples (cystic pimples). It seems to have little to no effect on these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried using this product as a full-face peel and it is one of the most painful experiences I have ever put my face through. As the directions instructed, the first time I tried the full face peel, I kept it on for one minute and I was in absolute agony the entire minute. My eyes teared, my nose ran, it felt like I was holding my face over an open flame. I was terrified I had burned my skin. Fortunately, it only felt like I had and while a little red, my face was not drastically damaged. My skin did build a small tolerance over time and I could stand up to 6 minutes with this peel on my face; however, keeping this on my  face for so long resulted in my skin peeling between my eyes and around my nose and mouth. Peeling so badly that I could moisturize in the morning and half-way through the day, I could touch my chin and find flakes on my fingers. It was very embarrassing. I realize these are sensitive areas; however, these are the areas I get white/black heads and I as hoping this peel would help reduce these, since it wasn&#x27;t working on my cystic pimples. Nope. My skin peeled, but the white and black heads remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 20-something woman with combination skin and have what I consider mild-moderate acne on my face (the rest of my skin is perfect). Maybe this is for people with oily skin, or severe acne, or mild acne, or something that I don&#x27;t have. I have stopped using this because for me it causes more damage than it fixes.</li>
            <li> I got this last week and have used it twice already, it burns a fair bit but leaves my skin feeling and looking amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a few weeks now and LOVE it! It does make my skin peel and burns a little bit while applied to my face, but that is to be expected with a \\&quot;peel\\&quot;. I have been seeing great results. I have also started to use this on my chest and it has been working great there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is NOT too harsh at all and doesn&#x27;t burn my face (leaving it red for days) like other products have. I also haven&#x27;t seen negative reactions to being in the sun. I would recommend this to everyone as a starter and if you feel you need something stronger move to a different strength then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions that come with it are less than desirable and look rather unprofessional.</li>
            <li> My background: I am very light skinned and in my early thirties. I have oily and sensitive skin with facial acne since high school (many blackheads due to oil &amp; large pores, random small bumps all over my face and infrequent cysts). I have tried countless over the counter and infomercial salicylic acid products for years with ho hum results. (I&#x27;ve always liked how salicylic acid makes the overall appearance of my skin look better. However, in the past I&#x27;ve found that a strong benzoyl peroxide, even though it burns, was better at treating my skin problems.) Also, I have never been to a dermatologist for prescription treatment and have never had a chemical peel mainly due to the costs involved.     That being said, I tried this product for the first time today and already love it! After years of dealing with scrubs and acne products I already know where my sensitive spots are, so I kept the acid away from the area surrounding my mouth. By doing that I was able to keep the product on the rest of my face for a couple minutes with minimal discomfort. (I used a paper towel folded into a triangle to apply and my favorite healing lotion since I couldn&#x27;t wait to buy gauze and the recommended non-comedonic moisturizer.) I was amazed to watch my blackheads start to \\&quot;melt\\&quot; away and my pores shrink. (This instant gratification alone makes it worth the price!) I am sure with repeated use (it says 6 treatments for best results) the product will continue to dissolve the small bumps as well and keep away any nasty cysts. This peel impressed me so much it prompted my first ever Amazon review. Thank you for making such a strong and effective salicylic acid available!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 years old and I have what most people would consider mild to moderate acne. My face really went crazy when I started college. Ever since then, I haven&#x27;t been able to completely control my acne. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried everything except accutane. It will get better off and on, but it never sticks. Even when my skin is pretty clear (for me) I still have a lot of redness/discoloration/acne marks. My skin is weird because it gets really dry, especially during the winter months. It&#x27;s odd because my skin is dry and it breaks out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve become pretty good at covering my pimples, but Acne products definitely dry my skin out and make it really difficult to use makeup. In the morning it will look nice, but then after lunch the makeup looks dry and disgusting. I just checked my makeup and it looks terrible on my pimples. I&#x27;s embarrassing. I want to be able to use makeup to enhance features, not cover them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, that&#x27;s my story. I tried the peel out last night. It burned so bad. I did my best to leave it on for 1 minute. I moisturized afterwards and didn&#x27;t put on any makeup. When I woke up this morning, one of my pimples had a huge whitehead on it but some of the others were minimized. The skin around my pimples seemed to look a little bit better. As I just said, my skin is dry, but I expected that from this product. My acne is not severe so I will probably wait and try the product again over the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have acne, I know exactly how you feel. It&#x27;s terrible. I got married last summer and my dermatologist gave me a VERY strong antibiotic to ensure that my face would be clear for my wedding. It was pretty clear, but I could only take it for about a week. I want so very badly to feel comfortable leaving the house with no makeup. None of my friends have acne like I do. They have beautiful skin, like a 20-something should. My skin is also damaged from the sun, because I always felt like the sun temporary cleared it up. It did, but I know it&#x27;s bad in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any advice, I&#x27;d love to hear it. I&#x27;m going to stick with this for a while. I mean, why not? What&#x27;s one more product?</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 7 weeks now. At first I tried the recommended of one application per week but apparently the solution is not as strong as some reviewers made it out to be. I ended up changing it to 5 days and now I am actually seeing a minor difference. I also had to change it to 8 minutes (max application time) right on the second time, because it was honestly not doing anything otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the only change has been the elimination of blackheads. While that is pleasing in and of itself, the main reason I bought this item was for my acne scars (merely a few small hardly-noticeable bumps) that I have had for around 5 years now. I read some reviews and some claimed they had their long-time scars removed by this product. I do not believe it has done the job yet for me, but I am hoping to be proven otherwise in the coming weeks. I had pretty high hopes for this item</li>
            <li> Seems to work as expected</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for several years and tried just about everything.  This product gets it under control.  After I use it, any blemishes that I have heal much quicker and leave less scarring.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a whole lot of difference in my pore size/black heads, but I have been using this peel for several months now and I am excited to move up to the 30%.  As soon as I&#x27;m done using it, my skin it much softer and there is usually minimal visible peeling.  Definitely worth a try if you suffer from acne.  I only wish that there were a natural alternative that produced these results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now, though not on a regular schedule.  The first day I got it, I used it for two consecutive days.  I try to use it about every three days depending on the dryness of my skin.  When I first used it, it burned very badly and I left it on for a minute.  Initially, I saw no changes in the clearness of my skin and it actually made my skin very dry at first, then very oily even when using a good moisturizer.  There was quite a bit of peeling on my nose after the first couple uses and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing makeup after using this unless you want to look cakey and flaky.  I typically use it on Fridays and leave it on for the maximum 8 minutes then let my skin recover over the weekend.  My skin looks quite a bit clearer with a few minor cystic blemishes here and there.  Overall, I would recommend this product.  It works better than most other acne products I&#x27;ve tried.  Just be patient and persistent. :)</li>
            <li> Well this is the 3rd bottle of thisvthat I have purchased.   I was skeptical at first, and did have some redness and dry skin the first few times I used it.  Now my skin has adjusted to it and im using it about once a week.   My skin has never looked better and been so clear.  This product doesn&#x27;t seem to have much effect on skin discoloratiom, I plan on purchasing the glyco/lax peel to take care of that.   I definately would recommend this if you have mild to moderate acne.  this company is great, the peel always arrives earlier than quoted.</li>
            <li> Okay so i have acne holes and dark brown spots from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im tan; hispanic not dark at all and not light just tan &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;well i always wash my face with neutrogena salicylic acid&lt;br /&gt;and i haven&#x27;t really seen any difference..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve done chemical peels before and those actually made my skin peel&lt;br /&gt;which i love to see bc it means it works!&lt;br /&gt;i havent notice any peeling though &#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;i do see my skin is a light tighter..&lt;br /&gt;i have used it 3 times but ill keep trying&lt;br /&gt;in a month i might try to switch to the gylic or whatever u call it&lt;br /&gt;since my skin prob isn&#x27;t sensitive</li>
            <li> After using product as directed, and even increasing the length of time that product stayed on skin, I saw NO DIFFERENCE! Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> It really zaps blackheads like no other! On my skin it burns very badly but I do feel it helps with my skin. There is an initial breakout that happens because the product is pushing your acne to the surface. Still, worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Just as effective as dermabrasion surgery - but less painful in your pocket - in smoothing out lines and wrinkles and in even-toning your skin. I use it every other day until peeling takes place. Then, I slough off the dead skin to reveal a fresh layer of unblemished and fresh looking baby skin. Followed the process with a high SPF to protect the new me. No regrets!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of acne scars and discoloration skin. This works really well. It makes my skin clear and even. It does sting when applied, but it&#x27;s only temporary. I start to flake days afterwards, but it&#x27;s worth it for the nice skin. A little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old with fair, acne prone skin. Whenever I break out this clears my face up quickly and is not too harsh. I prefer this over higher strength peels.</li>
            <li> I did notice changes after a couple of uses. Haven&#x27;t used it enough to say if I really like it.</li>
            <li> This is the best anti-acne product that I ever buy, it works just in 1 week, the only thing you have to do is use a cream fro hydration.</li>
            <li> Long story short been trying everything under the sun. I didn&#x27;t change anything to my system (I wash my face with a Salicylic acid face wash morning and night and follow with face lotion). I started this twice a week Mondays / Thursdays. I&#x27;ve gone for about two weeks and the results have been simply fantastic. I haven&#x27;t had any zits at all! Sure, it burns like crazy but I think the results are worth it. I usually go for about five minutes then wash it off. This little bottle also seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> I have used this product once a week for about a month now. It has done a good job of reducing the appearance of my acne scars, and has helped increase skin cell turnover. I haven&#x27;t really seen a huge reduction in acne, however, but am hopeful that it will do that in time.</li>
            <li> This product is very helpful in both acne and acne scars. Yes, it stings but that should be expected. It is the only thing I&#x27;ve tried that has helped me clear up so much. I have acne scars from years and years ago, and it&#x27;s really helped them fade away. My skin will never be perfect but it is now 100x better than it used to be, all thanks to this product!</li>
            <li> Works well in conjunction with other products for acne/aging skin.  For me, I can typically expect to peel approximately 3 to 4 days after a 3 minute application.  I do use other acne products and retinoids, so assume my skin is fairly sensitive to the product.  It will sting for sure upon application, but will not be noticeable after removal of product.  Overall seems like a safe adjuvant to home acne treatment.</li>
            <li> i bought this item on skinlabo&#x27;s web site. product works really well, i have rarely acne so i can&#x27;t tell too much about this concern but i have large pores and i can say that it really works for large pores (at least their appearance, so definitely  it worth to try it.    for customer service, i bought item from Switzerland, and one bottle (other bottle was lactic acid) and bottle was broken so i sent email to customer service and wrote them that bottle was broken and they agreed to sent me a new bottle. It&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne prone skin since I was 10 years old...Now I&#x27;m 26 and STILL have problems, mainly with clogged pores and what seems like too much oil production.  After trying any and every product I could get my hands on, I decided to try a peel.  I have very sensitive skin, so I was a little weary at first, but the 20% solution has worked great for me so far!  The first time I used it I could only leave it on for about 30 seconds.  (The stinging was a little more than I had expected.)  But even after leaving it on for such a short time I have had great results!  My face is not nearly as oily as it was before.  I used to get really shiny about an hour after applying my makeup, but now my face looks great throughout the day.  And the number of pimples has also dramatically decreased.  I would strongly suggest using this product.</li>
            <li> I have had acne since I was 10 years old- I am now 21 and although some may argue it&#x27;s a teenager thing I feel like I have had it quite long enough. I am VERY pale and the acne has left scarring which is very traumatizing in itself. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything for my skin- Skin ID (ps don&#x27;t buy that it&#x27;s OTC products you can buy at the store, just do the evaluation and it&#x27;ll tell you what to buy :P) Proactiv, Zeno, every face wash on the market, steaming my face, 10% benzoyl, even prescription creams and antibiotics. Nothing worked, not even a little. I have pretty oily skin and my acne mostly consists of blackheads all around and small whiteheads around my cheeks/mouth/jaw and occasional large cyst like zits that never pop &gt;:[ I decided to buy this peel in combination with the glyco/lac peel because so many people I know rave about how great the peels are. I did this one first, my skin is pretty tolerant to medications since I&#x27;ve had acne for so long so my first application I left on for 4-5 minutes, bad choice. It didn&#x27;t burn bad until I decided to rinse it off and I blasted the cold shower on my face and the combination of the cold shower and my face burning was so intense I could barely breathe. A few minutes later the burning subsided and my skin suddenly didn&#x27;t feel oily anymore, but not in a bad way. I used neutrogena healthy skin moisturizer and my skin felt great! I see no differences in acne yet but I also realize it needs to extract the acne before it can eliminate it. Even if it doesn&#x27;t cure my acne completely the oil elimination is so nice I would buy it again. Giving it 4 stars because I have only used it once- will update! :]  Update- 2 days later-  Skin is slightly flaking, applying lotion often. Breaking out slightly but it is probably just the extraction. I also work out so maybe my sweating has something to do with the breakout although I did the peel post workout because it says not to sweat for a few hours after.  2 weeks later  Wow, this stuff really works! I bumped it up to using it 6 days a week then a week of the glycolic/lactic and it&#x27;s amazing! It does get a bit sensitive around my nose but other than that I&#x27;d say 80% of my acne is gone!</li>
            <li> I have used the peel twice and my skin is amazing!  I always have blackheads on my nose and a couple of whiteheads on my cheeks.  Biore would temporarily get rid of the blackheads on my nose, but nothing ever got rid of my whiteheads.  I&#x27;ve tried all types of inexpensive to expensive facials, creams, and gels. I can only stand leaving the peel on for about 30 secs to a minute.  Afterwards, I wash it off with a ton of cold water. I use moisturizer and that&#x27;s it!  Right away I could see the difference.  My blackheads got a lot smaller, and my whiteheads weren&#x27;t as bumpy.  I&#x27;m hoping after a few more treatments, they&#x27;ll be all gone.  I also drink lots of water, cause I remember my esthetician telling me to do that after facial treatments.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from frequent break-outs for 20 years now. I have tried trips to the dermatologist, spa treatments, OTC products all with limited success. I have been using this peel for almost 2 weeks now and have seen a significant improvement. My acne has cleared up and my pores appear much smaller. My old acne scars have diminished as well.    Now, the first time I put this on, there was a definite burning pain. I only managed to have it on for about a minute before rinsing it off and applying some lotion. That alleviated the pain almost immediately. I am now able to leave it on for several minutes and am seeing more noticable improvement.</li>
            <li> I have had breakouts for most of my adult life.  I am 41 years old and wondering when all this was going to stop!  I bought this thinking that it will help to get rid of the zits finally.  Well, I was not let down.  Number one, it does burn pretty good.  I have a high pain tolerance (four kids...natural childbirth) but it does burn.  Remember to keep fanning yourself once it&#x27;s on.  Also, once you rinse off with very cold water, it will continue to burn for a few more minutes.  I use Nivea Soft moisturizing cream afterwards because it has the vitamin E and jojoba oil.  I felt that my skin was tighter and pores were smaller.  In the two weeks I have been using it, there has been no new pimples.  Your face will peel but its like really dry skin.  Not very noticeable, I went to work the next day with no issues.  (The Nivea can be put on under foundation too to help with the flakiness/dryness)  I actually look forward to the burn, knowing that it is transforming my face.  I use a brush to put it on as a cottonball soaked up to much into itself and didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting an adequate amount on my face. I will continue to use this and hope to see even more results.</li>
            <li> YES it works but it burns like satan was in it. After 2 weeks my skin got scaly so 1 day I steamed some water and let my face just sit near the steam &amp; suddenly the dead skin started peeling off and there was new smooth pretty skin. I am ordering some more when I use this.    IT WAS WELL WORTH THE MONEY!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! This is my second time buying it from here and I love it. It clears up your face so well, it&#x27;s amazing. I have adult acne and I have a bad habit of popping and picking at my skin, which has left me with a lot of scars. This stuff is awesome because it takes away the layers of your skin to get new skin growing, promote healthy cell growth, and with fresh skin it is acne free. If you are like me however, once you stop using this, if you have a bad habit like picking your skin then you will need to continuously use this or get better habits :) only thing that I don&#x27;t enjoy about this is that because it is literally getting rid of you old skin cells, you can feel a burning sensation. The sensation is pretty intense, however beauty hurts right? I am a happy buyer and I will continue to have clear skin with this product!</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work for my skin- combination skin with tiny pimples in the TZone plus occasional large zits.  I applied it regularly (as instructed) for almost 3 months.   I was hoping it would eliminate my tiny pimples, reduce breakouts of the larger zit and even my skin tone.   This is what happened to me:  1.  Yes, I felt like I built up a tolerance  2.  Yes, I experienced initial redness   3.  Yes, I experienced peeling a few days later  4.  No, I did not find my skin tone evening out or my acne clearing up.   if anything, this seemed to completely confuse my skin, throwing it completely out of wack and triggering more breakouts.  What did work- sticking with a gentle routine of cleaning with a mild ph cleaner and applying an oilfree lotion with 2% salicylic acid.  If anything, I might apply this on a larger zit, but beyond that, I don&#x27;t think this is the best thing for my entire face.  I think the acid in this is even higher than the wart remover Compund W!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 14 year old daughter who has suffered from acne for about 4 years now. We had tried prescriptions like Retin-A, Tazorac, etc... I have bought her proactive and many over the counter products that just didn&#x27;t work. The second week of using this her skin was clearing up very well. This is the 4th week and her skin is almost acne free. I have recommended this product to everyone I know that suffers from acne. Its very strong so you may want to start out only using once a week and then gradually work your way to 2 to 3 times a week. I due recommend using a good moisturizer after. Now I&#x27;m gonna try the glyclorid peel to see if that will help with the scars that&#x27;s left.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from acne (like I do :( ) you will love this product.  The company who makes it is, imho, the best.  I had tried one from another company (my review of it is on here somewhere) but this particular company is 100%.  Beware, though, if you&#x27;re not used to using this, it&#x27;s seriously powerful stuff.  You&#x27;ll feel tingles and slight burning, so read the directions first.  It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought this peel for my son who has moderate acne and also for myself because I have bothersome blackheads I can&#x27;t seem to get rid of no matter what. I did the peel a couple of days ago and I can already tell a difference. I don&#x27;t believe I put enough solution on my face though or on my son&#x27;s face for fear that I would over do it so I believe next time we do this I will be sure to put plenty on. It does burn quite a bit but I believe it&#x27;s worth it for the end result. My face is just starting to peel and I&#x27;m excited to see how it will be after a few more treatments, especially for my son.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 and have had acne since age 9 and still do. I have been a smoker for 18 years (quit 3 months ago-wish me luck), so obviously this has taken a toll on my skin. I have been using Retin-A since I was 16 years old. I have dark marks where previous acne has been. I have a few tiny dent-type scars that blend into my smile lines mostly. I also developed \\&quot;melasma\\&quot; 3 years ago...SUDDENLY when I was on a Caribbean cruise (obviously in the sun). Even though I had been using VERY high SPF and very water/sweat proof, on my face for many years...and was wearing it FULL TIME on this trip...it still appeared and never went away. It is less noticeable when I haven&#x27;t been in the sun for a very long time (winter time), but even with high SPF it still appears MUCH DARKER as soon as the sun hits my face and doesn&#x27;t go away at all during summer months. I also have had very dark circles under my eyes for many years due to my olive skin complexion. I also have had redness around my nostrils and on my chin for the past 7 years. 7 years ago a derm told me that the red stuff was also sun damage (I was expecting a rosacia diagnosis). I have also had large pores for a long time especially on my nose and chin...but they all look big to me. I also still have an oily T-zone.    Ever since I developed the melasma 3 years ago I have been searching for a cure that I could afford but I never found anything. My wrinkles and acne I have learned to live with...not happily but as a matter of nature. After researching I knew that the only fixes would be expensive salon or derm procedures. So I gave up and tried to embrace my new marks all over my face...(ARE YOU KIDDING?). I have not been able to do this so THANK GOD I RAN INTO THE REVIEWS OF THESE PRODUCTS ON AMAZON!!! I&#x27;m SOOOOO EXCITED!!!    I purchased THIS peel, the Lactic 35% &amp; Glycolic 25% Combo Gel Peel, the HQ+ (to use in the future - once I have a tolerance to peels), and the pH balancer. The balancer is worth the [...] bucks!!! I did buyall but the ph balancer @ [...] because it was a tiny bit cheaper and I like the applicator gauze that they sell which I couldn&#x27;t find on Amazon. It is only [...] bucks for 200 and they are perfect for this use! More sanitary than using a brush over and over also. They are not very absorbent so you don&#x27;t feel like the gauze is sucking up/wasting the product.    5 days ago I got the purchase in the mail. I used the Salicylic first because it was a Saturday and I therefore knew I would have a little healing time, if needed. This Salicylic 20% was stronger than the Lactic 35% &amp; Glycolic 25% Combo Peel. Today is Sunday (a week later) and I just used the combo peel.     So, I put this mask on and could only leave it on for 20 seconds.  The feeling I had around my nostrils (the most sensitive part of my face) caused me to remove it. I KNOW that the peel was effective even in that short of a dose.  Both masks make pores smaller IMMEDIATELY! Especially the biggest ones so THAT IS AWESOME!!! My skin felt/feels and looks very smooth, clean, brighter and tighter than prior to using (experience after using both peels). I can&#x27;t wait to work my way up to the HQ+ since that is the one that is for \\&quot;dark marks\\&quot;. This Salicylic peel did make my darker areas of my face look a tiny bit brighter (including the redness, scaring, under eye circles and the melasma). This shocked me in a wonderful way, because this peel isn&#x27;t supposed to improve these things specifically. I had a mild breakout on my chin and forehead after this peel in areas I always have acne (about 3 days after using the peel) therefore I&#x27;m assuming that it was acne already underlying my skin that the peel \\&quot;brought out\\&quot;. I&#x27;m used to this when ever I restart Retin-A so I&#x27;m not worried about it continuing. I had some redness and peeling only on my most sensitive areas of my face about 36-48 hours after using the peel. This only lasted for a day and was very mild.  There was one tiny place that a thick piece of skin came offbut I didn&#x27;t know it was there until it peeled off (happened to the area that \\&quot;stung\\&quot; most when peel was on).  Today when I applied the combo peel I applied all over my face without putting it around my nostrils and left the peel on for 3 times longer than I was able to leave it on around my nose.  From now on I will apply this way: face first, then sensitive areas for reduced time.  I wouldn&#x27;t have guessed properly exactly where my sensitive areas were before using the peel all over so just try it out the first time and wash it all off as soon as one area has been stinging for a couple of seconds.  This way you will have a gauge for what areas to be most careful with. I am looking forward to using this peel again and leaving it on full face for longer.  I am guessing that I&#x27;m going to like the results of this peel better than the combo peel because it is stronger and my face can handle it...but only time will tell. I was able to leave the combo peel on for 5 minutes on non-sensitive areas. I was shocked after starting with this peel.  I would have even left the combo peel on longer had it not been my first use of it. I DO SUGGEST THE PH BALANCER ALSO!!! I have been using Cetaphil moisturizer since it is so benign.     I&#x27;ll post an update in a month or so. Happy peeling!!!! Read the directions and don&#x27;t worry!!! Just make sure you have a very warm and wet washcloth waiting for you in the sink before you start and you won&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> While I had the typical set of pimples in high school, once I reached college and in the throes of my 20&#x27;s, the acne came full force.  I&#x27;m talking huge, pus-filled cysts building up along my face like houses lining up beach-front property.  I didn&#x27;t help the issue by continually popping them.  Only by reading books, such as this one:  [[ASIN:0446692417 The Acne Cure: The Nonprescription Plan That Shows Dramatic Results in as Little as 24 Hours]], did I realize that popping them was exploding further bacteria into my skin, which was agitating and increasing the number and volume of cysts I&#x27;d deal with.    I didn&#x27;t want to try Accutane or any other prescription medication.  I had taken monodox (sp?) once, but that left me feeling woozy sometimes and didn&#x27;t really \\&quot;hold\\&quot; it&#x27;s cure. I did use Pro-Active for a time, but that didn&#x27;t have the strength to battle my problem.  The Acne Cure book suggested a three-step process of salicylic acid, glycolic acid and benzoyl peroxide (BP).  For those who have read the book, many of the products recommended are either hard to find or not around anymore.  In my attempts to find suitable cleansers, from mud bars to sea salts and everything in between, I came across the salicylic acid peel.    To explain:  my skin is oily!  Five minutes will pass by after I wash (with Cetaphil-like cleansers) and the oil resumes.  My mother says I should be happy, as this will stave off major wrinklage, but, whilst I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, I&#x27;d like it to be one shade of color until that time.  Also, as a guy, with facial hair trying to come out, my pores have been clogged over the years.  Couple this with the oil and the dirt and the touching of the face and boom--constant acne, with severe cysts.    Back to the peel:  first time around, burn city.  I used a cotton ball and rubbed it all around.  Careful if you have whiteheads that are in the process of bursting.  The acid will sting more and won&#x27;t provide much help.  I washed it off quickly with some cold water as per the instructions.  At first, I didn&#x27;t pair it up with the glycolic nor the BP.  After about two days, I noticed mild peeling.  It looked like dried up plastic peeling from being in the sun too long.  (Maybe a touch too graphic, because it wasn&#x27;t as though it looked like I had dandruff on my face.)  A good, Cetaphil-like lotion quickly took care of that.    See, the salicylic breaks up \\&quot;clogged\\&quot; or \\&quot;gummed\\&quot; pores.  It&#x27;s like Drano for your skin&#x27;s pipes, clearing out all the gunk and allowing the natural process of your skin to take over.  When I&#x27;d look in the mirror, I&#x27;d notice smooth or gunked up pieces of skin.  After several uses of the product--my skin tolerated the acid rather well, to the point where I&#x27;d leave it on and not wash it off--I noticed that the pores were opening up, the smoothed, lifeless parts of skin were starting to \\&quot;breathe\\&quot;.    Here&#x27;s the kicker:  it began to \\&quot;pull\\&quot; out hidden acne; small bumps under my face, that were targeted with a mild red mark were getting bigger.  The acid was neutralizing the bacteria, drawing everything to the surface of the skin and eradicating the enemy.  But, the size and redness did not last as long in the past.  For one, I wasn&#x27;t popping them anymore and two, I was being patient and letting the medicine to its work.  Not easy to face the public, but the night is darkest just before the dawn!     Once I add the glycolic acid, [[ASIN:B000PNXBVW Glycolic Acid 35% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)]], paired with either this BP, [[ASIN:B00164FKWW Acne.org 8 oz. Treatment]], or the Pro-Active version, I started to see a reduction in redness, less oiliness, and hair follicles surfacing where there hadn&#x27;t been any, since they were clogged with dirt and oil.  (Using the 2.5% and the milled process of these BP&#x27;s is gold.  Anything more than 2.5% and it&#x27;s just a waste and could possibly dry out your skin.)    I took a break from the routine, but kept up the washing and the BP.  I&#x27;m back on it again to clear out the leftover pink spots and to try to get all the pores open to get the full beard in.    So, take this for a test, follow the directions as they&#x27;re listed.  It worked for me and continues to work.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, expected to experience some level of peeling and nothing happened.I have used other peels in the past with better results. Next time, I will buy a stronger peel will the  hope that I will  achieve more effective results.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I had a lot of scarring and this helped so much. The first 2 days i can see my face getting ready to peel and the 3-5th day its peeling a lot and its worth it...I noticed a huge difference even after the 1st use. Thank you Amazon for selling this Its a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I get cystic acne and this is the only product that works. It not only shortens the length of time I have acne, but keeps me from getting scarring and makes the overall condition of my skin far better. Improves elasticity and tone! I use it as needed, and I complement it with lactic acid peels for anti-aging. The two work so well I have postponed my trip to the plastic surgeon indefinitely-- for collagen injections!</li>
            <li> Best price I found, super fast delivery. Great product, my breakouts have really diminished and i&#x27;m only on my second application, comes with full instructions and works greeeeat! will definitely continue to buy more of this supplier&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> So the directions on Amazon say to use this two times a week at the beginning, but I don&#x27;t know how anyone can do that. I&#x27;ve used it once a week for three weeks, and it definitely helps my skin, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it more than once in a week.&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s on it stings/burns, but the feeling goes away a minute or two after you rinse it off. I leave it on for 5 minutes at a time. It makes the skin around my mouth flaky for a couple of days but using a good noncomedogenic, fragrance free lotion afterwards helps.</li>
            <li> Greatly helped my acne prone skin when nothing else worked for years. I highly recommend this product, just try it for 6 weeks. It will make your skin break out firt. Your pores will then smooth out. Miracle I say</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a pimple problem for years.  After years of trying different brands of items, going to doctors, nothing really works for me.  I accepted the fact that I couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;stop\\&quot; pimples.      The truth is pimples stay present for a small period of time on a person&#x27;s face.  What stays for a longer time are the scars left after pimples.      This product is said to remove the scars after a pimple has come and gone.  Honestly, it does peel some skin off the scar, but the scar never really goes away.  I followed specific instructions that came with the product and I wasn&#x27;t able to get the results promised.  My pimple scar seems like it looks a bit better, but that&#x27;s it.  I can still see it clearly.      I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  Do some of your own research and try to find some competitive products that work better.</li>
            <li> I had very oily skin, especially my nose. Before using Salicylic Acid (SA), I was using Neutrogena&#x27;s acne gel to reduce acne and make my skin dryer.  I&#x27;ve also tried other brands of acne gel with benzoyl peroxide, but they didn&#x27;t really work.  In addition to acne gel, I&#x27;ve tried facial cleaning product from Clean and Clear and the Walmart brand benzoyl peroxide cleaning pads.    I&#x27;ve gone to a dermatologist and she told me to clean my face daily and just use the general acne treatment products and I would be fine.  Unfortunately, I wasn&#x27;t very good at keeping up with these routines and I even thought about getting an operation to reduce the size of my pores.  That didn&#x27;t happen due to the expanse.    Finally, I came across Amazon and found this product and read the reviews.  At first I tried to follow the instruction to apply the acid on cosmetic pad and then my skin, wait for a few minutes and wash it off.  However, it worked better for me when I just applied it directly on my skin.    For the first minute or 2, after direct application on my nose, I felt a slightly burning sensation and my skin turned a little red.  However, after 5 minutes or more the acid is neutralized and I could see immediate improvement on my skin, smoother and the redness was gone.  I didn&#x27;t even have to wash it off.    In addition to this product, I washed my face with warm water to open up my pores and then I used Neutrogena&#x27;s pore refining toner to reduce the size of my pores and to clear old skin.  I applied the gel peel on top of the dried skin toner.    Instead of using acne gel, I used Neutrogena&#x27;s Rapid Clear Oil-Eliminating Foaming Cleanser to keep my skin dryer.  Depending on the condition of my skin, sometimes I would only use the skin toner and not the peeling gel.  However, when I saw mild inflammation from acne, I would use both.  The oil cleanser should not be used twice, it would really dry up my skin and irritated it.    In conclusion, I&#x27;ve listened to many stories and tried many different products to make my nose not look like Rudolf the Reindeer.  For my skin, the key was to reduce the oily condition and the size of my pores.  It was the combination of skin oil and dust that clogged up my pores and caused acne.  With the help from Neutrogena&#x27;s pore refining skin toner, oil-eliminating cleanser, and Skin Laboratory&#x27;s gel peel, my skin looked a lot smoother and had a healthy glowing feel.</li>
            <li> This works really well for breakouts! However, please research on how to properly use it since with improper use it could cause irritation and burn you!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel fantastic</li>
            <li> It is uncomfortable, but it has worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few times my eyes have watered from the burning (obvioulsy I don&#x27;t apply to my eyes), but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that I want to itch my face when it is applied. I put it on then try to distract myself by sitting at the computer a few minutes while watching my stopwatch. It helps, but it is still uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has worked on hyperpigmentation (red residual mark left by acne). Usually those last about a year for me, now they are all gone in about a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using minocycline (anti-boitic --- part of the tetracycline family and is the most powerful anti-biotic they have) and only used Prascion (a sulfur based topically applied wash) a few times. and my face is clear for the most part. My dermotologist said the next step up is Accutane from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I&#x27;m using this peel once a week, with spot treatments with a Q-tip. This is also good in spot treatment, I should add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recomend buying the small bottle to see if it works for you, then moving up to the larger bottle afterward. It took me only one application to see results, but about a month to see good results like the others around here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started light, then added time and more liquid to each session. I&#x27;d recomend doing the same.</li>
            <li> I use this as a spot treatment and it stops cystic acne in its tracks!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and I must say I have seen positive changes! I still have persistent acne on my right cheek but once I apply the peel it starts to dissapear fast. This product has shown positive signs clearing the dark spots on my face too. I have spent so much money on many products including proactive but this works far much better! I hope I continue to see positive results so I can have a spotless and healthy skin once again. I would reccommend this product no doubt. Also, I have dark skin and I sometimes use it more often than advised(don&#x27;t do it because I do). Goodluck!    March 25th- Still have acne but they have decreased in severity. I Still have dark spots but since using this peel, they have continue to lighten. I am still breaking out and changes right now seems slow so I&#x27;m thinking of buying Lactic acid peel. I&#x27;ll give y&#x27;all an update later. I would still recommend this product, I just thought by now, I&#x27;d have a flawless face.    May 10th- This product didn&#x27;t work for me in the long term. I&#x27;m going to try the Lactic acid and use this as a pre-peel. Argh! the search continues...</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is great.  I had no idea a treatment so simple could be so effective (for periodic cystic acne on cheeks).  Skin less oily too.  Once a week, and skin is so much better.  (I wouldn&#x27;t use more than once a week though).  Wish I had heard about this years ago.</li>
            <li> First, the bottle will last you much longer than you think, so the price is worth it. Also, I am very happy with it controlling my acne. I still get bad acne the couple of days before my period no medications has ever regulated that, but this helps a lot.</li>
            <li> This is an entry level gel peel and I recomend it if its your first time undergoing a glycolic acid treatment. You will see results after 2 or 3 applications. If you take the price of this bottle into consideration, it is a miracle cream. It really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 years old and I still suffer from break-outs.  I bought this product after reading the reviews on it and I had high hopes.  This product definitely delivered.  I&#x27;ve been a Retin-A user for years and I needed something to give my skin that glow.  Well, this worked wonders for my old acne scars, my oily skin and as for break-outs, almost non-existent! Definitely would buy again!</li>
            <li> First off, Im 18 with combination/oily skin that occasionally gets gets inflamed pores. I would call it cystic acne but these pimples are in a small inflamed area. These types of pimples are very hard to treat with benzoyl peroxide and do not respond well to many types of treatments. I have not used this for very long but I decided it would be ok if I left it on my skin for ten minutes and I was acne free for two weeks. It was amazing! I will continue to use this to treat acne and hopefully with continued use I will see a change in skin texture as well. I am amazed at what AHA and BHA acid peels do for my skin. One negative though, it is extremely painful to use on my skin even when I only leave it on for a minute or two.</li>
            <li> I applied this to my nose where my freckles are the most abundant and the most visible. Now I wear less makeup because my freckles aren&#x27;t so bad anymore!</li>
            <li> I could ramble on and on about this product but I&#x27;ll just keep it short, it works amazing if used correctly.  First, don&#x27;t use it more than every 4 days or so depending on your skin.  I used it a couple days between, and I literally burned my skin.  This stuff is strong and is not to be taken lightly.  If you follow the directions you should see a significant improvement in your skin within a month.  The changes will be noticable everytime you use it though.  I suggest using this only at night (your skin will be a little red afterwards) and use a good moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> If I had rated this product two weeks ago, I would of given it a 1 star. This is because after applying this my skin broke out even more. However, I read some reviews and they stated that the reason it broke out was because it was bringing my future breakouts up top. So I didn&#x27;t give up, I applied this peel twice a week for 3 min. This is my third week and right now all the breakouts are drying and clearing away.   It&#x27;s true my skin starts to tingle when I apply the salicylic peel, but it&#x27;s good because I know it&#x27;s working. Overall I am impressed with this product because it helps clear my dead skin and regenerate new skin.   P.S: I am an asian, if that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I had severe acne before I started using the Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel.  Before I used this product, I tried everything!  I had gone to many different dermatologists and have done everything from being on birth control, taking antibiotics (which killed all the \\&quot;good bacteria\\&quot; in my body and left me with severe yeast infections), and even having a laser peel on my face.  I even used Accutane twice, and still I was left with severe cystic acne.  I gave up on any kind of help from the medical professionals and started reading up on what alleviates acne.  My acne before was so bad that I was breaking out even along my jawline.  My acne was very persistent, I felt hopeless. I came across this gel peel and tried it out.  At first it peeled and flaked my skin.  The first application had a burning sensation on my face.  However, I stuck to using the product faithfully and what a difference!  My skin is so clear that I have gotten compliments from people at work. I have been using this product for almost a year.  I also use the other acid peels on this website.  The amount you get lasts a very long time.  My husband also uses the peel for his face and it has done an amazing job on his skin.  His skin looked rough before, but now it looks smooth.  I have found that I do not have to use the peel as often anymore, but I do still need to use it for maintaining my clear skin.  Another great thing about this product is that it evens out my skin tone.  I had brown blotches on my face after having the laser treatment and being put on birth control.  They have since faded into oblivion!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  One last thing I have to say is that this product is cheaper and more effective than the $500 laser treatment I paid for and all those doctor visits and useless prescriptions I paid for! It has been a real life saver for me!</li>
            <li> def helped to fade some acne scars i have plus heal active acne.  when i first starting using it i couldn&#x27;t stand it for more than 1 min, now I can handle the whole 8 min.  use with caution</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m 18 years old and I barely get pimples. My face is almost completely clear most of the time, but recently I&#x27;ve been getting some pimples hear and there..nothing big though. So I used this product to get rid of the pimples and I&#x27;ve only been applying it to the pimple areas and not my entire face since its already clear... So far I&#x27;ve never had any peeling around the pimple area and I&#x27;ve been using large amounts for up to 7 minutes and this is my third time using it. Basically what happens is that the pimples became much smaller and turn redish when the acid is applied. After water is applied it turns extremely white. Is this suppose to happen? Afterwards when I dry the water out, the pimples become darkish. So basically this product turns the big pimples into dark more scattered pimples that look worse than starting. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t be using this. Also I wanted to know if I could use this for my back?    Update: 3 weeks after product. This literally has done more damage than harm to my face. I honestly had only one or two pimples that were getting irritating and forced me to use this product. It has literally made pimples grow all around the area that I&#x27;ve used it and they pimple still haven&#x27;t gone. I would not recommend for people who are young or minor pimples. I&#x27;m really hoping the pimples will be gone soon...</li>

            <li> Hi. I bought this product hoping to clear my acne. I am 18 years old and had some acne in my chin area and a little bit in my forehead. Nothing serious but i just wanted to have clear skin. I have used this product twice and have seen lots of improvement. The ane scars dissapeared and the acne breakouts were much less frequent. Recommend this product 110%</li>
            <li> This damaged my skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after my last attempt of searching a solution for my persistent acne.  I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne since age 14 (I&#x27;m now 20).  I tried everything from Proactiv Solutions to every over-the-counter acne medication available on the market.    Warning:  This product is extremely strong and extremely concentrated and thus must be used with high caution.  Before you apply this product I will recommend testing it on a small section of the skin prior to use on face.  I will also recommend applying this product on to some kind of cotton pad to use as an applicator to facilitate the application process.     This product does just as it claims --  after an application it will cause your outermost layer of skin to fall apart.  You will notice the peeling within a few days or even hours.  I had never heard of chemical peels in my life but when I read the amazing reviews this product had on Amazon I decided I had nothing to lose.      It makes sense that the most potent way to make best use of a topical medication is to attack the skin in a way such as this (i.e. by shedding).  Proactiv and other topical medications are only programmed to be dissolved into the the epidermal tissue of the skin, so to me it makes more sense that by causing the outer skin layer to shed and be renovated, it will do a lot more (in terms of clearing skin and reducing pore size).  After all, even though we may not notice to a daily basis, new skin cells are consistently in rejuvenation and our skin cells are multiplying to replace old skin cells.  This happens although we might not see it.  Processes such as this one are common in nature.  For example, snakes shed their skin layer almost every season.  This product is only a catalyst and to an extent greatly accelerates this process.      This chemical which is extracted from a plant hormone does tend to dry out most skin types.  I will recommend some kind of moisturizer to alleviate the drying of the skin.  If you suffer from hyperpigmentation, the shedding of the skin will eventually even out the spots as new layers of skin are generated.    This product has been a panacea to the problem I never thought I could resolve.  All of my persistent acne has disappeared (completely!).  I suffer(ered) from hereditary acne and this has been the only product in the market I have found that&#x27;s been as successful as it claims.  I feel that Professional Laboratories has done a splendid job by doing an exhaustive research and then presenting this product to the public for cosmetological use.</li>
            <li> Why do I here about Proactiv more than this product? This worked wonders on my face and shoulders as it lightened my skin whhere I had previous scars. It may have burned like crazy after the first uses but it was well worth it. After using it 3 times my skin felt refreshed and it didn&#x27;t look as acne-ridden as it use to be. It cleaned up a lot the acne on my face including the dark spots and the pimples. Although it takes time this product really worked and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to rid their face of acne or other irritations. A huge warning in advance is if you can&#x27;t take the pain of a strong burning or tingling sensation then this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> problem: extremely oily skin with huge pores and a bad case of rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;d been searching for a product that would shrink my dime sized pores without aggravating the rosacea (like other products do). after a year of investigating i looked further into the salicylic acid peel and found that this is the best product to use for pores because it works from the inside out, not just the surface. mine are truly the largest pores i&#x27;ve ever seen so i was keen on trying it. i&#x27;d been using 2% OTC which helped reduce the redness from rosacea but it didn&#x27;t really shrink my pores so i assumed the stronger formula would but i was concerned that the stronger formula may aggravate the rosacea until i discovered that salicylic acid is aspirin related and i know that aspirin has a calming effect on rosacea, so this nailed it for me.  i ordered it and began using it right away. i knew it was going to sting but nothing prepared me for the heat. it is intense. i left it on four minutes the first time before rinsing with cold water. something i noticed is that once i splash cold water on my face the heat intensifies for about a minute then stops all of a sudden. i&#x27;m up to eight minutes now and still, the heat intensifies when i begin rinsing. it&#x27;s not an issue with me, just something i find peculiar.&lt;br /&gt;i do my peel at night, starting with a clean face and i tone with alcohol soaked cotton ball to remove the extra oil from my skin. i use an artists brush to apply and once the peel is rinsed off i follow up with Oil of Olay 15 spf for sensitive skin.  the combination works well for me without breaking the bank.  i also apply the same Olay during the daytime.&lt;br /&gt;well...... after years of looking for a miracle product my search is over. after a months use the tone of my complexion is around 95% improved, it&#x27;s smooth with no redness, no itchiness and no dry scaly patches (from rosacea). normally if i went without foundation on my face people would comment on my sunburned, that&#x27;s how bad it was. but now no one says anything and they don&#x27;t even stare.  i still have a tiny bit of redness in my nose creases but i look for that to disappear too. as for the pores they are about 50% improved which is a miracle in my book and i think they will get even smaller with continued use. i will use this product, if needed, forever. i am 100% satisfied with this product. fyi, i also posted pics.... http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/customer-gallery/A2NQF4KTRFWC0Ubad it was. but now no one says anything and they don&#x27;t even stare.  i still have a tiny bit of redness in my nose creases but i look for that to disappear too. as for the pores they are about 50% improved which is a miracle in my book and i think they will get even smaller with continued use. i will use this product, if needed, forever. i am 100% satisfied with this product. fyi, i also posted pics.... http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/customer-gallery/A2NQF4KTRFWC0U</li>
            <li> This peel is really amazing. Prior to using the peel, my skin was so damaged with blemishes and painful zits, to the point where makeup no longer covered them, and my skin was so patchy it was embarrassing. Nothing was working for my acne. Finally, I tried this peel and it has changed the way I feel about my face. It diminished the size of my pores, completely gained my natural skin tone back, and almost completely got rid of the zits only after 4 weeks of use.    The first time I used it, I followed the instructions carefully. Leaving it on only 1 minute. There was a stinging sensation but nothing too painful or unbearable. After rinsing it off with cold water I dabbed the Neutralizer skin pH balancer by Cellbone and rinsed that off...then pat dry face. I immediately saw a huge difference in the size of my pores. They were completely closed!     Continued the treatment every two days and about 2 weeks later noticed that my skin tone was no longer red from all the acne, my face didn&#x27;t hurt due to acne, and my acne was completely gone! Now, due to my high stress levels I got two measly little pimples but they don&#x27;t hurt or look as massive as they used to. I am very excited to have found this peel. I&#x27;m on my 5th week and will stop shortly after next week. I recommended it to my friend and she&#x27;s in love with it also.     You should definitely try this product! you&#x27;ve got acne to loose! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 33 year old suffering from acne for the last 15 years or so with some minimal ice pick scarring on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve tried everything from meds,prescribed topical solutions, 100s of face washes, homopathic natural approach etc etc. Nothing seemed to work for me. Bought this 20% solution about 2 weeks ago and gave it a try.     The 1st time I applied this stuff on my entire face which was a bad idea. I started on my forehead and by the time I got it applied to the rest of my face I was 2 minutes in on my forehead but only 1 minute in on my cheeks which made it difficult to time and to have it work evenly. Alot of \\&quot;frosting\\&quot; occured on the sensitive parts of my face such as cheek bones just under the eyes, my nose and around my mouth. For 2 days my face was severely red in those areas it looked like I got a black eye or a good beating. My sensitive areas peeled quite a bit and underneath revealed very smooth, perfect lookin skin. My Ice Pick scarring looked slightly less deep after 1 peel too.     On a side note my acne actually got worse on my forehead before it got better. I guess that has to do with the toxins coming to the surface? I suggest applying this peel to your forehead and jaw 1st because those areas can withstand a longer burn, wash off, THEN apply this stuff to your sensitive areas 1 at a time ( below the eyes,nose,around mouth) or you&#x27;ll seriously burn yourself like I did.     Also the  instructions said to wash off with plenty of water but maybe a PH neutralizer would be better. My face start to burn and frost over and I will dump my entire face into icecold water in the tub and it still continues to burn for 20-30 seconds after. So if you dont have a PH neutralizer I&#x27;d suggest washing this stuff off BEFORE you reach the painful point.    Also I&#x27;d like to add in that I never take the time to write reviews but this peel worked so good I had to share it with everyone. Good luck guys!</li>
            <li> Problem:&lt;br /&gt;Slight redmarks/leftover spots from shoulder acne&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attempts:&lt;br /&gt;Tried tanning indoors and outdoors.  It only left me with darker spots and unhealthy burned/tanned skin.&lt;br /&gt;AHA cream.  Left my shoulders oily and my clothes stained.&lt;br /&gt;BP cream.  Destroyed several shirts from the bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing.  Did nothing lol.&lt;br /&gt;Those scar removal patches.  It sucks that they are expensive and the results are negligible at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solution:&lt;br /&gt;Got in this as it is serious for serious results.  The first time I put it on 8 minutes.  I usually alternate between shoulders in case I get a bad reaction and don&#x27;t go sleepless from the irritation on my back.  I have been doing it 2x a week per shoulder area.  Since the skin on the shoulders is a lot thicker than on the face, I&#x27;ve left it up to 20 minutes.  That 20 minutes burned lol but my marks are fading quicker than ever.  I have some raised scarring that is fading also for the first time from these peels.  My method is using a Q-Tip and dabbing it over the area and try to cover the \\&quot;shoulder pads\\&quot; of the shoulders.  Just imagine the area football shoulder pads go on.  The redness disappears within a few hours and the peeling occurs the next couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t get the 100mL version!  I will next time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1: 11-22-11 - Been using this since I got the 30 mL.  Like I said above my only complaint was not getting 100 mL.  Well I am on the 100 mL now and still maintaining use 2-3 times a week on my shoulders only.  I read that others have had issues with their face from this product.  I tried it on chin one night and it burns like crazy after a few seconds.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on the face but that is just me.  There are many less irritating things to use.  For shoulders though, the skin is much thicker and traditional creams and methods just don&#x27;t penetrate well enough.  My shoulders are still slowly fading.  I am patient because I used to have acne on the face and it took a few years for that to clear up completely scars and all.  It just takes patience and understanding what is going on.  The way I think of it, when you use this, you speed up the exfoliating/healing process by constantly burning away old skin and bringing in new skin.  I did it on my face with less burning methods and my shoulders are following.  I predict all the marks on my shoulders will be completely gone within 1 year.  How do I know?  Because my right shoulder is nearly clear and that stopped breaking out about a year before my left stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!!!or that to clear up completely scars and all.  It just takes patience and understanding what is going on.

            <li> I have had bad acne since I was in elementary school, a decade and a half later I finally cleared most of it up with proactive. That would have been fine if it weren&#x27;t for my obsession with picking every pimple that I have ever had.  To date I have probably wasted around $15,000 on peels, laser treatments, creams, and derm abrasions, only to have the acne flare back up and have scars return.     I bought this product a few weeks ago and was extremely hopeful yet very apprehensive. If $15,000 can&#x27;t help the scars what will an $18 bottle of acid do?  Magic, that&#x27;s what it will do! I have done 2 peels so far and have seen a large reduction in the red scars, and the deep pock marks have a less cavernous appearance. I continued to use proactive and only had a small amount of actual peeling. On the other hand, my skin is very tough.      So far I love it! It is gratifying to watch the scars fade with each peel, even more exciting knowing that that same peel would cost me upwards of $150 if I were to go to a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have received salicylic peels 20% from the dermatologist office with great results - full peel within 7 days and no additional acne. The dermatologist version did not require neutralizing.  I have used this stuff at least three times with no success- no peeling and each time I have experienced worst breakouts than I did previous to using.  I left the solution on my skin 3- 15 minutes.  I am not sure that this formulation is right for my African American skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I have not been able to find anything this strong or at this price anywhere.  My face is always even and beautiful now, this is definately my favorite of the peels skin laboratory puts out.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised by what a great product this is.  I take meticulous care of my skin, use a good moisturizer daily, get regular facials, and even a few med spa chemical peels this year.  The spa chemical peels were HARSH and actually terrible for my skin.  it burned and flaked for days, and after?  Just about zero difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this peel in a search for a new skincare product.  My skin is oily in the summer, dry in the winter, and has some uneven redness that I usually cover with foundation.  I&#x27;ve been using this for just a few weeks now and I see a great difference already.  It&#x27;s not a miracle product but it definitely seems to work.  Just be sure to read the instructions carefully!!  You can only use this product at MOST every 5 days, I would recommend once per week.  Your face should NOT be wet with the product- it almost goes on more like a toner, with a cotton pad wiped across the skin.  You have to be very careful to keep it away from eyes, nostrils and mouth.  And the product shouldn&#x27;t be left on for more than 8-10 minutes, MUCH less at first.  You have to build up gradually with a product like this.  Start small, rinse off well with lots of cool water, and moisturize immediately.  Avoid any scrubbing within 24 hours of using this- I tend to exfoliate my face like crazy, either with a face scrub or with a washcloth, but the peel exfoliates your skin so any more will result in irritation.  I learned that the hard way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really worth trying.  I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of skincare products from just about every brand out there: Fresh, Philosophy, Murad, Proactiv, Ole Henriksen, DDF (which is awesome but not for this), Skoah, Dermalogica, Skyn Iceland, etc etc.  This is a far better value and really works, no frills.  I plan to buy the bigger bottle next time!</li>
            <li> One of the reviewers said that it would be used best as a spot treatment and I totally agree.  20% is really strong.  I recommend making a baking soda/water solution before you apply the peel.  It Can burn, as in leave white patches that peel like mad for days.  It will also make your face blotchy and uneven, if you do too long too quickly.  Some skin on my face could take it, the area around my mouth could not.  The 3rd or 4th time I have done this peel(not regularly), After 4 minutes I RAN to the sink and as I passed a mirror I was horrified to see a bright red \\&quot;goatee,&#x27; after a total face application.  I rinsed and rinsed, and put baking soda on it, repeatedly for about 10 minutes, then rinsed again and slathered my face with Olay Definity Night Cream. (I don&#x27;t know why, but I swear this stuff HEALS my acne marks if I pick or they are bright, takes half the time to heal up- nice of Olay to discontinue the line.)  After a couple hours I put on Eucerin redness relief night cream, which is also a miracle worker if you have redness in certain areas of your face.  I do not have rosacea, but I do have a lot of redness around my nose and chin.  As for what the peel does for the acne, sore bumps under my skin that will begin to raise in a couple days totally disappear, ones that are closer to \\&quot;zit\\&quot; have the process speeded up and they reach zit that day, gone the following day, and just a little red the 3rd day.  After 4 days whatever issues you had are pretty much gone.  With diligent moisturizing (and NO PICKING), you will not have any visible sloughing.  Enjoy your clear skin!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t place this review since I needed to see if I&#x27;ll see result soon. So, after almost four weeks, using this product as directed, NO RESULT FOUND YET, except it bursn when you apply it ! I would not recomment this product to anyone at all, another money making \\&quot;quick\\&quot; solution for flawless skin? NOT happy!</li>
            <li> Finally!  I have tried every OTC product I could find and sought help from several dermatologists.  Nothing worked well or had lasting results until I tried the peel.  This stuff is amazing.  Acne and blackheads were greatly diminished with the first use, fine lines were less noticeable, sun spots faded, and skin texture was more smooth and firm. Each use provides noticeable improvement and the gains continue days after the treatment.  This product costs little in terms of time, money, and effort.  Start with the shortest time recommended and gradually build up so you don&#x27;t have chemical burns and look like you just stepped out of an inferno.  Follow all directions and begin with the shortest time suggested-this is a powerful product!  Product was packaged well and arrived at my home in just a few days.  I would highly recommend this product, but suggest you do a patch test and follow directions to avoid pain and embarrassment.  The only drawback is the slight skin bleaching effect. The treated skin was lighter the the skin on my neck after each use. The great results outweigh this one small downside.</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions, keep at it and you&#x27;ll see results. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now, and it&#x27;s definitely cleared areas up</li>
            <li> I have been fighting blackheads ever since my teens. Even with washing my face twice a day, proper toning and moisturizing, they never seemed to disappear. Beyond the blackheads that plague my t-zone, my skin is in good shape.     I researched online for tricks to remove blackheads and was advised to try a salicylic acid mask on my problem areas to clean out the pores. The first time I used it, I followed the directions of keeping it on for only one minute (and building it a minute at a time each use) and I used it on my whole face. After rinsing with cold water and moisturizing my face well, my skin was ridiculously soft. The next day my skin looked glowing but there were still blackheads. As I used it every 3 days since then, the appearance of the blackheads on my t-zone has diminished. I know they are there because I analyze my skin too much but overall the quantity and size of them have been reduced. I have been using a pore minimizing toner with it as well to help tighten up my pores too.     I am really happy with the results but definitely test this product first to make sure it is safe for your skin and only use it on problem areas at the recommended every 3 days because I was using it over my entire face and noted some spots were getting dry. I figured leave good enough alone. Also it does tingle, a lot. At the point I was using it for 4 minutes, it got unbearable at the 3 minute mark but I sucked it up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne and oily skin for more than 15 years. Like most of you, I&#x27;m just desperate to get clear complexion, spending thousands of dollars over the years, trying different kind of treatments. As you know, these treatments/ pills are either harmful to your body if prolong usage, or they are just too expensive to up keep.    I am so thankful that I came across this wonderful product. I&#x27;ve done my 6th peel today and I must say 90% of my acne are gone, and my oily skin are under controlled! The embeaded white heads have slowly sufaced and exfoliated too. My acne scars are improving and pores are smaller!     This product is definately the best product i&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s affordable and very effective. Best part is, I don&#x27;t even need a expensive cleanser and moisturizer to have healthy skin now. What is the downside? Probably the stinging and peeling. Other than that, it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> so far so good. not as painful as some suggest, wish i got the stronger one. thanks to skin laboratory for this awesome product!!! (:</li>
            <li> I started getting acne young, when i was about 10 and i didnt know how to look after my skin then. No cleansing, toning or even moisturizing because i thought that would give me more spots, what a fool i was.   The problem with black skin is that it hyperpigments easy and by the time i was 21 i couldnt bare to look at myself in the mirror, i had  so many acne scars i couldnt stand it. Dermatologists were no help, the pills and creams are useless if you dont have a good skin care regimen which is something the doctors dont usually tell you.    In 2001 called around and was told by everyone on Harley Street that dermabrasion and skin peels were not for black skin tones so i paid £1800  for lazer treatment. It worked to some extent, the spots went and my skin looked clearer but if i had known about this product i wouldnt have bothered.   The truth is that these skin acids can and are used safely on ebony skin tones and have been for years. I am a caramel complexion (like Tyra Banks), my first peel ever was the Skin laboratoty 70% lactic acid peel and i experienced no problems at all, just be sure to follow the instructions. My second peel was the salicylic 20% peel by Skin Laboratory and my skin looks great. My skin is visibly clearer, lighter due to the fact that the hyperpigmentation is fading, i just look great and i&#x27;m so happy. And for the price, its a bargain compared to £200 per month on microdermabrasion or £1800+ for a course of lazer treatments. I would highly recommend both the product and the company. I honestly cant imagine my life without these peels now, i&#x27;m totally smitten.</li>
            <li> This product works really good but it takes times. After I use it, it takes literally a week for my skin to stop peeling and become smooth. I have to make sure I never run out because I noticed after not using for a while then starting up again that my skin starts peeling really bad instead of consistently using and after a while the peeling isn&#x27;t as bad using every week. I just bought some more. loves it</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product, I even bought one for my sister before I truly gave it a chance to work (or in my case not work).  I might have the wrong skin type, I don&#x27;t know but it freaking BURNED and it made my face all red AND it was oily/gross! I probably didn&#x27;t use this product correctly but I don&#x27;t like it.  And it&#x27;s expensive (I&#x27;m cheap, I buy a lot of things but don&#x27;t spend much ;-))</li>
            <li> I have inherited oily, acne prone skin from both my parents. I had my first breakout at the age of ten and it progressed regularly until my mid-twenties. I now have about one breakout a month and the majority of my face now has very large, clogged pores. Over the years I have tried several name brand and not-so-name-brand over the counter treatments. I visited 4 dermatologists and have tried antibiotics, prescription topical ointments and birth control. None positively impacted my skin and, in fact, the ointments irritated my skin. I chose to try this product because it&#x27;s a stronger concentration than the 2% solutions at the drugstore and I know salicylic acid is lipophilic. I needed to get rid of the built up oil and dead skin cells to help get rid of the gunk in my skin.    I received this product last week and have used it twice. I followed the directions that were enclosed in the packaging and also researched the procedure by reviewing information and videos produced by board certified dermatologists. Both times I cleansed my skin with a gentle cleanser, patted my face dry and used an alcohol prep on my face to remove any excess surface oil on the skin. I measured about 1.5 mL of solution and administered the product using 4x4 gauze and gloves, starting with the forehead and working my way down my face. When I was ready to remove the peel I rinsed my face with copious amounts of cool water and then patted my face dry with a clean towel. Afterward I used a moisturizer with SPF 50. The first peel stayed on for 1 minute and I only noticed slight tingling on part of my forehead. The second peel stayed on for 2 minutes and I noticed considerable stinging in the exact locations where my pores were largest and most clogged - nose, cheeks, chin and part of my forehead. My skin in these areas was a light shade of pink after rinsing.     Today is the day after my second peel. My super large, clogged pores appear smaller with less gunk and the small pimples I had last night are now gone. I don&#x27;t even see redness in the areas where they were. My skin is no longer the light shade of pink it was when I finished the peel and my skin texture is softer that it was. I have never seen results with a product this quickly. I am VERY SATISFIED with my results and will continue to use this product. It&#x27;s such a relief to have finally found a product that can really penetrate pores and deliver a great result.</li>
            <li> Used it twice and my skin look so much smoother and clear. I&#x27;m so excited to see what the results would be with along term use.</li>
            <li> This item did not cause the skin to peel, and we followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> My son and I both have used this peel many times, and it really didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference for either of us.  Used over 2 mos, and no real change. Definitely will not buy again. Unlike the peels purchased and used by Skin Obsession, this just wasn&#x27;t worth the time or money.</li>
            <li> I been using this product weekly and so far so good, I am seeing improvement. Iam using this product with ROC night time repair works great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various products to treat my skin that is prone to acne. Since I&#x27;ve started to use this products my skin looks much better and it does not get oily so fast any more. It did not leave any dry and flaky skin as other products did. When you use it according to the protocol, it does work, at least for me it does. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This stuff did not get rid of my acne or improve my scars. In fact, it exacerbated both! What a total rip off. For professional results, I think that you just need to go to the professionals.</li>
            <li> Great for a home facial and taking off some dead dull skin .</li>
            <li> If you plan on going to a spa or dermatology to spend hundreds of dollars for a peel, you are wasting your money. I purchase this 20% aha peel along with their 35% peel, shipping was fast, I got it 3 days after I place my order. If you have never done a peel at home, I highly recommend you start with the 20% and as your skin get use to it then move on to the higher concentration. Better to be safe than sorry. I&#x27;ve done chemical peels and VIPeel, I spent thousands of dollars, that went down the drain. One VIPeel treatment cost me $375 and that was on special, 6 weeks later I did another VIP treatment, I saw no improvement in my skin so I did not do the 3rd treatment as the dermatology recommended. I even spend hundreds on the products she sold me that did not work, but made me break out. With the chemical peel and VIPeel I was embarrassed to go out as my face would peel and it looked disgusting, people would stare at me. During the peel my face use to burn badly, hours after the peel my face was still be red. It took days for the peeling to stop. After all the dead skin fell off my face, I looked refreshing and the fine lines gone, however the brown spots from acne and sun were still there. Even if you have done a few peels please start at a low % aha peel.  I used the 20% peel for the 1st time on Friday night, after about 2 minutes my face started burning. I had set the timer for 4 minutes because I figured I&#x27;ve done a few professional peels which was much stronger than 20%, I could tolerate it, I was wrong... I managed to let it sit for 3 minutes, I couldn&#x27;t bare the burning so I rinsed with cold water, then I used a neutralizer which stopped the burning immediately. I let that sit for 5 minutes then I rinsed with cold water, pat dry, then put on moisturizer. Immediately after putting on the peel I saw my pores shrink so that was the 1st sign of satisfaction with the peel. Saturday when I woke up my skin felt dry but tight. Sunday I had a little flakes, but after Iwash and use a toner it wasn&#x27;t noticeable. Today is Monday and my skin is peeling, it is somewhat similar to the peeling that I got from the peels at the spa except not as bad. I can&#x27;t wait to see what the new skin looks like and I&#x27;m looking forward to the 2nd application which I will do Wednesday or Thursday night. After I&#x27;m done with the 20% aha, I&#x27;ll be using the 35% aha. The instructions says to take a break for 1 month after using the 20% before using the 35%, that I&#x27;ll be doing. I love this peel and the price is great. Not only will your skin looks great you&#x27;ll be saving a lot of money.</li>
            <li> This is my second order, and I find the gel works well to encourage peeling, and thus minimizes the appearance of blackheads. However, I also use rubbing alcohol before every application (which the instructions suggest and my doctor recommended). I can use the gel more than once weekly for more than 10 minutes each with no adverse results BUT I do this only after careful patch tests, starting with one minute on the inside of my elbow and working up, minute by minute, on my face. I do not use the product on my forehead or near my eyes. Those who complain that the gel is ineffective might consider applying it after a steam bath and the alcohol swabbing. One caveat: this product makes the skin extremely delicate and prone to tearing if you apply pressure with fingernails.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from acne from 8th grade and now I am a senior who suffers from  great stress from college and school work. About two months ago, I purchased Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel( I wanted to start with least strong product). I started to using this product by starting from 30sec, 2min, 4min, and 8 min. I had a pretty oily skin, thus i used once every two days. I could feel my face started to produce less oil  my face got really dry) but i still was having 3-4  acne on my face and some scars and red marks.   When i was half way through Salicylic Acid, I bought Glycolic 35 gel peel because website says that if used together it will give deeper peel. So what i did was apply Salicylic on my face for 8 minutes and then Glycolic for 8 min( for me salicylic gives me more pain not glycolic). I did this for 5 times, once every 3-4 days depending on my skin condition.   After i used all my salicylic acid, my right side of face was acne free but my left side was still having acne problems. Then i started to use glycolic every once every 3-5 days. I am almost half way through glycolic and on my face i have 2 acne forming, acne free on my right face and two acne on my left face.  I believe when I use all of glycolic acid, my facial condition will be good. I also bought BHA+ for future use  like once every week to keep it up)  I think you need patience to see the result. I do not believe there is no panacea for ance but time and your effort. Dont get discouraged by bad reviews on here, just keep using it regularly with daily facial wash  i use clinique soap for oily skin).   Try to regulate the use of the product depending on your skin condition. Wash your face three times or two times a day, use sun screen, and oh i forgot to mention the day after the peel I use (Acne free 10 percent benzol peroxide lotion    Thanks for reading  Hope you will get improving skin condition in two to three months.. not one to two days!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  The company also sent a free sample of another acid peel.  The sample had enough for several applications.  I sure appreciated that because I was curious about it.  But this one has been great.  My dark spots got lighter.  It cleared my acne and I haven&#x27;t had much of a need for a while.  I got it under control.  My cheeks are a little sensitive so I put it on them a last and a few minutes after the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> I have acne brought on by hormonal imbalances. As I&#x27;m closing in on 30, I figured this was a time to rejoice from those pesky kid problems. Little did I know!  I had gotten a professional peel a few years ago. It was a mixture of three acids left on the face for no more than 2 minutes. I loved the results. This peel, the Salicylic 20% is not as strong as the professional, but I have been getting similar results.  I have been blessed with large pores (thanks mom!) and I get the dreaded blackheads on my nose. I also get the classic outbreaks around my chin/mouth area and temples. I try to do a peel once a week, sometimes skipping a couple so that my skin can replenish itself appropriately. I leave mine on between 1-3 minutes. I can&#x27;t take any longer than that. Also, at this concentration, I don&#x27;t see the need to leave it on much longer.  I&#x27;ve read reviews were some people were leaving this on for 20 minutes or so. DO NOT do this. The insert clearly states no longer than 8 minutes. (There is a reason for this!) Also, I&#x27;ve read where some women (mostly African American) were having pigmentation issues. If you do independent reading on salicylic acid, it can cause hyperpigmentation. Since A.Americans have more pigment in their skin, this is more likely to happen to them. This is not to dissuade you! You know your skin better than anyone else. Just be aware. Also, do not use this product more than once a week...and I would even say no more than twice per month. It is an acid that dissolves skin cells (think...wart remover OTC is 18% salicylic acid). If you continuously remove layers you may put yourself at risk for scarring.  Those are just my warnings to new users. Use this product wisely. It&#x27;s not a cure-all, but it will help. I also purchased the neutralizer. It feels good after having the sting on your face. An acid should always be neutralized!  I hope you have found this helpful.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a lot.  It&#x27;s strong enough to do the job, but not so strong that it leaves me in pain or with rashes.  I&#x27;ve used it on my face, thus far have not exceeded 1 minute, once a week due to the intense \\&quot;tingle\\&quot;, &amp; it works for minimizing pores &amp; getting the top layer of dead skin off the surface (a nice, smooth feeling &amp; appearing result).  Also, I&#x27;ve used it on my family&#x27;s keratosis pilaris (those hundreds of tiny bumps on the backs of our arms) &amp; it has produced some results there as well (they seem to be clearing up).  No tingle is felt on our arms, I&#x27;ve only felt the tingle on my face.  *Note: I am a licensed cosmetologist &amp; have received esthetics training, but those willing to READ, follow instructions &amp; be patient should do fine applying this product &amp; receiving its benefits.</li>
            <li> Ok...never tried an at-home salicylic peel but this was pretty good. The directions said to use to before the acid peel (and Acid/Beta peel) but I wasn&#x27;t sure about the pH or the sensitivity of my skin to this stuff.    Although--I plan to try a salicylic/glycolic peel back to back I feel as if I may have to use a weaker salicylic. My glycolic peel is strong (40-50%) and I&#x27;m scared that it may overwhelm my skin.    Anyway--I&#x27;ve never done a full-face salicylic peel.  I peel section of my face but I mainly use the salicylic for spot treatments once a week (i apply with a q-tip). You have to assess your own skin sensitivity to see what you can/can&#x27;t handle but salicylic can be left on the skin as a spot treatment.   ***Just don&#x27;t try this with Lactic or Glycolic acid.***    But it works well. Thank God for peels. They&#x27;re an excellent addition to my skincare regimen. It keeps my acne away. I have to buy more actually. I may try the 30% next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 2 days but on the first day I noticed results the morning after I had used it. My pores were smaller (not by a lot but still noticeable). When I applied the solution to my face I could literally see that it was drawing up the oil in my pores. Literally. I had the burning sensation that the majority of the users here also had but it wasn&#x27;t that bad. My cheeks were a little pink after using it but it went away after 10 minutes. I&#x27;ve had acne since I was in grade school and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve tried that actually seemed like it really works. I&#x27;ll report back in a few weeks to report my results but I have high hopes that my skin will be much smoother and more appealing.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  It works great on teenage acne.  My son got great results in a very short period of time.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for some kind of miracle to clear up old acne scars on my back and to even out skin tone, reduce pores on my tzone, and clear up a few acne marks on my face and I have FINALLY found it!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this stuff with a little bit of trepidation, but after reading many reviews and deciding to give it a go as my last resort before heading to the dermatologist I couldn&#x27;t be any happier! I decided not to buy the toner or witch hazel, seemed like a waste of money when it clearly states that you can just use water to neutralize the peel and rubbing alcohol to clean the area prior to the peel. I did however splurge and buy 100% natural Argan oil as a recommendation from another reviewer, and since Argan oil has so many more added benefits for your skin I decided why not take something good and make it better? and yet again it was a good choice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is the argan oil I purchased,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Slice-Nature%C2%A9-Virgin-Argan-pressed/dp/B001PEZAHI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1335537002&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reviewer had given a link to a different brand which was quite a bit more pricier and I so I looked around for something a little easier on the pocketbook and still natural oil with high reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the peel for the first time last night. I started by wiping down the area with rubbing alcohol, then I used an old clean concealer brush (you can also go to your local craft store and buy a cheap art brush in a size 10 or so or a fan brush.) Then I added the peel to the areas I wanted to correct (Note I did not put it on my entire face) I added it to my T-zone, chin, nose, part of my forehead and part of my cheeks. I then also added the peel to sections on my back that had acne scars and healing acne spots. It was much more tolerable on my back and not too uncomfortable, I left that on for about 6-8 minutes. My face was much more sensitive and I started with a slight itchy tingly feel and progressed to a moderate burn. I tolerated that for about 3-5 minutes. I then used cool water and nothing else and scrubbed my face using only my hands and within 30 seconds I found relief from the burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the peel I added the argan oil all over my face and back and rubbed it in real well. My skin felt extremely soft and relaxed after this. This morning the redness from recent acne is almost gone, the acne scars has been slightly minimized, my pores have shrunk drastically, I have no more bumps or uneven skin, the skin tone has evened out, and my skin is baby soft. I feel beautiful :-))) I went to work this morning with minimal make-up and it feels absolutely wonderful, I touch my face in amazement. I feel like a peeled off several years of skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!!!! (with the use of argan oil)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I also added a picture from this morning, the day after of the peel. I did not take a before picture and I regret doing so now, but understand when I took pictures of my face I would ALWAYS photo edit out the blemishes and soften the focus to even my skin tone so I wouldn&#x27;t look like a walking dead person before anyone would ever view the picture. I&#x27;m the girl with the long brown hair and bangs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* I DID go to the dermatologist to help prevent new acne, which I learned I have cystic acne, plus OCD on picking at it. I started taking Minocylcine and that has improved my skin dramatically, along with still using this product as well as tea tree oil I had my acne down to just minimal dark spots. The bumps and larger nastier looking stuff was about gone. I was hoping to soon see a decrease in dark spots, however I became pregnant and had to discontinue my entire regime. Months later the horror of bad back acne started to resurface and began creating new scars, so I don&#x27;t know what the progress could have potentially been. Once the baby is born and I can continue back on the medication and gel I will restart and see what happens from there.start and see what happens from there.</li>
            <li> I used this product exactly as instructed when it came. I used for about a month with applications every 4 days. I Liked the effects from the initial couple of peels. Then like others I broke out with painful cystic acne after the 3rd peel. I wanted to muscle through this period reading that this will clear up eventually and I would have pushed through this period, however, I ended up having a disturbing side effect from this peel. Now, not only do I have acne scars, acne and clogged poors on the left side of my face (this is my only problem area for some reason) I now have a white spot of discoloration. I beleive this occured b/c I went into the sun a few days after a peel for only about 10 mins without sun block. I felt it wasn&#x27;t worth the side effects to continue. I&#x27;m not sure when this discoloration will get back to normal, but it&#x27;s been 2 months and I think it will be here to stay :(</li>
            <li> I think i hurt my skin after using this. Just after first use, there are dark patches and dark spots on my nose and forehead. Im hoping they will go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not using this now. Please hope the dark spots and dark patches will go&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 16th July 2012&lt;br /&gt;I can now confirm this has given me lot of black spots on my face.&lt;br /&gt;These spots WONT GO away with time.&lt;br /&gt;How sad.&lt;br /&gt;All the money effort now has gone into spoiling my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also created a CRATER on the side of my nose which probably will never go !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please help me with treatment for the dark spots.</li>
            <li> I was a bit afraid of home peels, but I find this easy to use. It&#x27;s great for acne-prone skin, and gentle enough that you could use it on a teenager.</li>
            <li> And this is it!!  The end of the quest to rid myself of acne!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, I suffered from adult onset acne.  Huge, cystic pimples that I would try to pop and nothing would come out.  I had scarred my face and still the pimples kept coming.  Then I got a Mirena IUD, and that makes your acne WORSE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried antibacterial soap, more moisturizer, less moisturizer, sulphur soap, no soap, every facewash on the shelf. I was starting to get so depressed and embarrassed of my acne.  I was going through concealer at a rapid rate.  On top of the acne, my skin was red around my nose and my mouth.  I had horribly uneven skin tone to boot!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally bit the bullet and tried this.  The first 2 applications, I didn&#x27;t see much of a result, but by the third, WOW WOW WOW.  People at work started to notice, my sister saw a picture and was amazed.  I can&#x27;t stop looking at my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this once a week and I also started using Jojoba oil as a moisturizer, which you would think is a bad idea for acne prone skin, but it&#x27;s another miracle worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know you&#x27;re probably nervous you&#x27;ll damage your face.  It&#x27;s easy and you just start off slow.  I&#x27;ll even use this as a spot treatment.  I had a pimple on my neck the other day and I just dabbed a bit on and in an hour, the pimple was gone!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the &amp;#34;Brazilian Peel&amp;#34; for about three years now and hit a bit of a wall in terms of results with that product-so I decided to step up a bit. This product is EXTREMYLY potent, but the results have been outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had a professional AHA peel once, but I can honestly say it felt very similar to the one in the bottle-though the results are not as extreme as those from a asthetician. My skin burns when this on, and it has taken about two months for me to be able to keep it on for the full 8 minutes. Although I didn&#x27;t experience major peeling right away, the next day my sensitive areas did peel quite a bit. My acne has lessened, and so has the greasy quality my skin naturally has. Additionally, some of my synerisis redness is less over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to use this if you have used a peel in the past and are looking to step up to a more potent peel. I Highly recommend a Neutralizer if you are going to use this peel-I tried going without one time and regret it. Additionally, make sure you have a great non-irritating serum and moisturizer. Although I have very oily skin-I have needed both these things to combat the harshness of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside to this product is application. I&#x27;ve tried using a brush, cotton pads, cotton balls, and finally decided that my own fingers work best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: 20-something, very oily, acne-prone, sensitive, semi-pigmented, pale</li>
            <li> I reviewed this back in the summer. Loved it then, love it now. I&#x27;m African American with a Medium to Dark Brown complexion. I&#x27;ve had cystic acne along my jaw line since having a baby (about four years). It does burn the first few times but you tolerate it more and more. It worked within 2-3 months. My patience has built up after using sooo many products and waiting for results. This is it. Within 3 months the scars had faded. The \\&quot;Cyscic\\&quot; acne was gone AND not coming back. I wanted to give face a break and just purchased the \\&quot;lactic\\&quot; peel. BIG MISTAKE! No real results from that in the last 2 months and it caused hyperpigmentation so its back to the Salicylic. If you really have an acne problem give this time be patient it works!</li>
            <li> Very good, powerful product. The gel immediately causes areas of blemishing to abate and controls areas of more complex, vexing blemishing. My skin complexion has become increasingly, invariably smoother and even after applying the gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5-weeks.  Honestly, my skin looks the same.  The only time I had any peeling was when I got a little peel happy and applied Alpha Hydroxy on off days.   YES!  I know.  Not everyone will experience peeling all the time, and not that I really wanted that.  I just wanted...something.  Granted, I only spent $18.95.  I should have known better.  Bah.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Burned a whole helluva lot though.</li>
            <li> excellent product.  clears skin, even worked on psoriesis and cleared bumpy skin from elbow 100%  have recommended to others .  will buy again</li>
            <li> This was a great discovery for me.  I have oily skin especially in the T-Zone and previous problems with uneven skin tone and enlarged pores.&lt;br /&gt;Since getting on a skincare regimen of Philosophy&#x27;s Purity made simple and the Microdelivery Exfoliating wash my skin looks better than ever.&lt;br /&gt;This Salicylic gel has been a wonderful addition to my routine.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every 6-7 days and leave it on approx. 10-20 minutes.  Yes, it stings, but if it didn&#x27;t.....it would not be working.  Afterward, I enjoy smooth clearer skin and much less oil production.  My pores are noticeably smaller and I now use less foundation because I no longer have problems hiding blemish marks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my second bottle and could not be without this product.</li>
            <li> Due to my recent cystic acne break-out I have been experimenting with every product out there which can provide some relief. I&#x27;ve had this product for a long time and have used it few times. This came in really handy with my recent outbreak of acne, I wash my face with a regular cleanser and pat my face dry. Applied SA with q-tips and left it on for 5 mins, although it stings and burns but calms down within a minute. I guess I&#x27;ve built some tolerance by now, I still need a fan on high during application. Then wash my face with plenty of cold water and apply moisturizer. I have also used it to spot treat some of the acne, the area gets little dry, then becomes darker and little browner and then flakes off. So that way i can get rid of acne plus there is no major scar remaining behind. All in all, nothing to get scared of with the word &#x27;acid&#x27;; its pretty safe for use at home - just dont leave it on your face for too long. If you cant tolerate the burning sensation, dont kill yourself just wash your face with water. You will build resistance slowly and dont forget to wear good sunblock lotion.</li>
            <li> I leave the peel on all night long. Yes it does burn little in the beginning but the burning goes away after a while. Does help drying out skin if you have oily skin. Buy it you will be happy.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this more stars! I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried absolutely every skin product known to man (I am in my 30s and have had problem skin since I was in the 4th grade). It is not necessarily a miracle cure, but a HUGE help in fighting the good fight. It has helped with clogged pores, fading scars, etc. It also seems to speed up getting rid of any acne type cysts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did NOT see results the first time I used this though. The results got better and better as I used it. Now, you can practically see blackheads begin to melt after I use it. Two things helped me improve my results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1. exfoliating regularly&lt;br /&gt;  2. using a toner with alcohol before the peel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seemed to help the peel penetrate deeper. This is only my experience and I know products don&#x27;t always work for everyone. Silly me purchased another peel form this company and it was like dabbing water on my face. This is definitely the right fit for me.</li>
            <li> Product works exactly as described. I broke out at first but it did an excellent job getting rid of all my blackheads. I would recommend this to anyone struggling to control and eliminate acne.</li>
            <li> I have had so many problems with my skin. I have very fair and sensitive skin and seem to have hormonal acne that started in my 30&#x27;s. I have used this only four times and all the bumps, blackheads, and problem areas are gone. I only have the red marks left behind now, which I hope will go away soon. I simply brush on, leave on for 2 or 3 min. And wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After I wrote this initial review, I went back to some terrible breakouts. I then knew that I was not fixing the problem from the inside out - but only the outside in. I did some research and believe I had a Copper/Zinc imbalance now for many years due to my Copper IUD. I started taking a daily Zinc supplement of 50mg. Then I do this peel once a week - leave on for about 5 minutes. Then I use California Baby Diaper Rash Cream (i know it sounds weird) and put that on my face. Diaper rash creams contain Zinc - which is really good for skin health. My face is now flawless and the red marks are diminishing fast. I wish I would have done this routine years ago - and saved myself a lot of heartache. One thing to remember if you try this- it took time. I have used this peel now for almost 3 months, and zinc for almost 2 months. It takes time - but it will be worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I am African American with very oil skin and hyperpigmentation left from using Proactive serveral years ago. My scars are primarily on my cheeks &amp; a few on my forehead. After meeting with an esthetician who suggested I spend $980 on Obagi &amp; an additional $500 on chemical peels, I thought I&#x27;d try this peel first. I also purchased the Glycolic peel which I&#x27;ve only used a few times and Kiss My Face Pore Shrink which I&#x27;ve tried and love. I no longer have reoccuring breakouts on my cheeks &amp; forehead. My skin tone has improved significantly. Previously I had raised bumps (that hurt when inflamed) on both my cheeks. These bumps would go from inflamed to non-inflamed, but pretty much never healed or went away; they are gone. I apply a baking soda/water mixture to my face to deactivate the acid. I cleanse with African Black Soap &amp; add a few drops of Jojoba Oil to my face while cleansing w/the black soap. Jojoba oil is a great moisturizer that actually penatrates my skin. After researching I learned my skin is oily b/c it is over compensating for dryness. The Jojoba Oil has balanced my nautral sebum (oil) production. In adddition to topical changes, I&#x27;ve completed a 5 day liquid only cleanse, twice in the last year. I&#x27;ve implemented Zinc Supplements &amp; Flaxseed (fresh ground or oil I go back &amp; forth) which is really good for your skin as well. These things have worked wonders for me. I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now. I haven&#x27;t noticed anything dramatically different. I use it about 3 times a week and leave the product on about 5 minutes each time. I noticed some peeling on the left cheek and a lot of peeling on the right. Its work well on new white heads, but does not do anything for cystic pimples. Its just dries the top layer of the skin but the cystic pimple is still underneath.     I may have spread it too close to my lip and nar my chin that it burned those parts and left some scarring.     My old scars are still dark and very visible.</li>

            <li> I have mix feelings about this product. I bought it after reading so many positive reviews and I was really looking forward to have my skin dramatically improved....but it did not work as well as i had expected.  And it is not that I am not patient.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now.  And i use it religiously for 2 - 3 times a week, 5 minutes each time.  My exiting pimples are gone faster then usual but they leave red scar for a long time while the new ones keep popping out.  I remember some of the reviews describing the occurrence of the new pimples so it did not bother me too much since i thought it&#x27;ll stop eventually but after two months, the new ones still come out near the area where the old ones are and it is ANNOYING!  I also have questions about whether or not I should use mask (from other brands) or acne cream in between the usage of the Salicylic peel.  And if it&#x27;s ok to use the facial wash brush like Clairsnic  mia the day after using the Salicylic peel? Did anyone know?  Thanks for sharing!</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin anyway, so I wasn&#x27;t surprised that this burned rather ferociously the first time I used it.  I&#x27;m not very bright, so against the instructions, I used it again the next night.  If I thought the first time was bad, I then became acquainted with what I&#x27;m sure is similar to the sensation of 50 bees stinging your face over and over.  It was brutal.  I had to cold water it after a couple of minutes.  I&#x27;ve since used it several times (every 2-3 days) over the last couple of weeks and it works.  It peeled my skin, and as another reviewer mentioned, it made my skin a bit worse before it started to improve.  The pores on my nose have all but disappeared.  The sensation is still slightly uncomfortable but it&#x27;s obvious that the longer you use it, the less it stings.  Currently it feels like I spread a thin layer of Icy Hot on my face.  I also notice that when I sit and think about it, it&#x27;s worse, so I recommend doing something to take your mind off of it.  Apply and play a few games of BubblePopp on Facebook or something less lame.  Overall highly recommended and worth it.  Also - you can&#x27;t beat this price!</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a month ago, and have been applying it about 2-3 times a week. I keep it on for about 10 mins. Even till this day, it stings for the first 5 minutes and my skin has not gotten used to the harshness, but I continue to apply it. The results are......slow! After the first week i noticed i was breaking out with more than average acne in my cheeks and chin. I was alarmed because I thought it was doing the opposite than it was supposed to but after reading some other user reviews, I noticed it was a common thing. But thats why i gave it 4 starts because the acne it created was not MILD, rather it was extreme and left me scars (i didnt even poke the acne). But, right away i saw my skin getting firmer and clearer. I have a light brown complexion, so i had some discoloration and it has been somewhat cleared. The acne, it was reduced...i currently have 5 pimples that are in the process of diminishing slowly. Ugh...But it is better than before. Before I would break out with 8-11 pimples on my face and now they have decreased dramatically. I still have acne scars, which have not decreased AT ALL. I have not seen any difference in my acne scars which are still red/purple. But then again, i have only been using this product for about 4-6 weeks and I cannot really determine its effectiveness. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it has reduced the amount of breakouts I have gotten. Overall, I would buy it again....not soon though because i have only used 1/8 of my bottle, so I&#x27;m guessing it will lasts me months.</li>
            <li> 20% solution is too weak to do a decent job of erasing age spots and other blemishes. I recommend a sronger concentration ofacid.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has acne should give this a shot. It sounds kinda scary but isn&#x27;t. My skin was a complete wreck because I tried out the Oil Cleansing Method. I won&#x27;t go into details because you can find out more about it on other sites. I expected some purging but it seemed to bring out 30 years worth of gunk onto my face. Every single pore was clogged and I had huge pimples and marks galore. I even persisted with the cleansing hoping it would clear up but no such luck. I was just one of the unlucky few who couldn&#x27;t get it to work.&lt;br /&gt;So in desperation I bought the salicylic acid. I followed the instructions closely, 1 minute for the first time and gradually increasing until 8 minutes every application. I used it every five days. It stings every single time! It feels as if there are a 100 ants biting the face. I also used a fan to blow my face because other reviewers suggested it and it does seem to help. After the time is up, I wash my face with water and use some baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;After 12 applications, while I still have some scattered spots, the improvement is amazing, considering how bad my skin was. Most of the clogging is gone, I don&#x27;t feel the little bumps under my skin any more and my skin is much smoother. A lot of the marks have faded as well. So I have hope that my skin will continue improving.&lt;br /&gt;The side effects were manageable. I&#x27;ve used Renova in the past and this acid doesn&#x27;t give me the same sensitive feeling I have on the skin. When I apply other things on my face such as sunblock, my skin doesn&#x27;t sting compared to using the retinoid. There&#x27;s usually some mild scabbing and peeling on the third day of using the acid, but the skin comes off cleanly. When using Renova or other retinoids, my skin would have dry, flaking patches which were more unsightly. At the beginning, it was a bit alarming because I had dark brown patches but after the \\&quot;burnt\\&quot; bits came off, the skin underneath was smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Aftercare is also important, every day I put sunblockand after using the acid I put some oil, usually argan or tamanu.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I tried this out.</li>
            <li> I saw results after the first use. No peeling, and where sunscreen. Follow directions carefully as warned!  Moderate to servere acne getting better. can&#x27;t wait to upgrade strength.</li>
            <li> I have issues with eczema on my arms and face and after paying LOADS of money to a worthless dermatologist and equally worthless prescriptions, I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used it in a few spots on my face (nose, cheek) where I was having small mini breakouts. A minute or two with it on, I was shocked to look into the mirror and see all kinds of major GUNK coming out of my pores. It was as if the product hit the \\&quot;evacuate\\&quot; button and all hands were on deck to help with the purging :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next spot was my arm. When I previously went with the dermatologist, it took honestly at least a year to see the SLIGHTEST improvement in my skin with my arms being the toughest spots. 4 minutes with this product on left my arm feeling much smoother. It will be a spot that will need repeat applications for sure but I was very encouraged by all results so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING:This is a wonderful product but like everything else in life, it&#x27;s not idiot proof. Read the directions!!!</li>
            <li> Save some money. Crush up an aspirin and add a little water to make an aspirin mask. Saliclyic acid is the key ingredient in aspirin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good for reducing the size of huge acne. I have had very fast results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do get some minor visible peeling. In addition, this stuff can be very painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have large pores on my cheeks, black heads, old pigmentation scars. After one use I noticed the scars fading.  My acne is better and my pores are smaller. The scars literally started peeling the next day! After the peeling subsided(3 days) my skin looked brighter and felt smoother. I barely needed to wear makeup! I peeled a few times in September and then took a break and my skin has been beautiful since and has not returned to its prepeel state even after I stopped the peels. It&#x27;s now nearing April and I am doing a few more touch up peels to target a few new blemishes. I definitely suggest filling the sink with cold water and baking soda to neutralize the acid. It substantially kills the pain when the peel is over and ensures that the product will stop after the time needed. Use deep moisturizer at night and don&#x27;t pick at it! Let the peel do its job.</li>
            <li> I bought this item a while ago. First, I have to tell you about my skin. I am a Caucasian, 20 year old female with very fair and acne prone skin. Furthermore, my acne is hormonal, and I get painful large red cysts. I have been prescribed hormonal birth control to deal with it, Retin - A, have used 10% benzyol peroxide cream, and EVERY other product out there (Acne Free, among all the other big brands, some of which provided some temporary relief). But basically, I have awful acne that does not go away even with my stringent cleaning and grooming methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fairly used to strong products, but regardless my skin dries up and looks flaky, no matter what. I decided to give thsi product a try and did use it once or twice, but got impatient with it, so it sat in my drawer for like another month. I decided I spent money on it and I was at least going to finish it. The first treatment was 5 minutes and I did it about once a week and then steadily upgraded to multiple times a week.&lt;br /&gt; Yes, it burns like hell at first, but I think it&#x27;s not unbearable and I kept a fan close by to relieve the stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am using the product every night and leaving a thin layer on overnight. My skin does get flaky still because the product is designed to get rid of that dead surface skin, but HOLY COW. My acne is sooooo much better. My skin is so soft to the touch now, I use far less makeup, and just need to exfoliate in the mornings to get rid of the dead skin. My acne is not all gone, and I have been applying every night for 2 weeks now, but it is almost all gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do still have acne spots, but I will definitely look to this company for a gel peel that addresses those needs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and advise that you take it slow at first and DO NOT GIVE up on it, be consistent and safe. It is NOT going to work for everyone to apply this every night and leave it on, that&#x27;s not how it is designed, but it is as close to amiracle product as I have been able to find. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find it sooner, that I accidentally knocked the bottle over and spilled like half of it out, and that I didn&#x27;t take pictures to document my progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will repurchase this when I run out, but it does last a long time and does wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 months now and my skin feels so soft and looks more radiant. I use it twice a week and the first bottle I used got me 15 uses (2 months)&lt;br /&gt;I used to suffer from acne and used accutaine for 10 months and my skin was clear and felt great for about 5 months, but after that, I started breaking out again (to a smaller degree, but my skin was supposed to be clear for good). I saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this product so decided to try it. After the first use, I noticed that my skin already looked more luminous and felt so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I leave it on my face for 5-6 minutes and don&#x27;t feel much of a burning sensation, but my skin has probably become resilient from the numerous other products I&#x27;ve used over the years. For the first couple weeks, as other reviewers have said, the acid brings out impurities from under the surface and will result in some breakouts but BE PATIENT. If you keep using it, it will shorten the life of the pimple and the breakouts will soon stop.&lt;br /&gt;This product also evens out my skin tone which had suffered scars from past acne :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase it here on Amazon but I have to say this is a great product. It is not for the faint of heart. I have very sensitive skin. I was only able to leave it on for probably less than 30 seconds the first time, the second time putting it on, I could only handle a minute BUT the difference was noticeable the 2nd time. If you can handle the tingling/burning sensation, it really is worth it. I make sure to start with the forehead, then to my chin, upper lip, then my checks as that is the most sensitive for me. There isn&#x27;t another product like this for such a great price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 2 weeks to ago and already I see and difference in my over skin appearance.  I have suffered from acne since the age of 11 and have done all the usual to help clear up my skin condition with little result.  However, after two or three peels using this product I see a difference. My skin is smoother. I have minimal underthe surface pimples. Unfortnately, I am a squeezer so i do have some acne scars especiall around my jaw line.  However, I see these are lighter. I am so pleased.  I also use the lactic peel.</li>
            <li> It has really helped to clear up my skin. I started to get \\&quot;adult acne\\&quot; and it seemed impossible to get off my face.  I started to freak out that&#x27;s when I ordered and it has really, really helped. Not vain..just not use to marks being on my face. This helped</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use this as a peel. I apply lightly to breakouts. I still got my acne but this really helped to dry them off a little. Not perfect but just O.K.</li>
            <li> I have used this several times now. It does sting quite a bit and I still cannot seem to get pas 30 seconds of it on my face before I have to rinse it off, but it does a good job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and I am extremely please with results. I&#x27;m already noticing that my acne scars are fading and my skin appears more clear and toned. Very happy with the purchase. This product is great for beginners, the tingle was still very intense - I couldn&#x27;t imagine starting out with a higher concentration.</li>
            <li> Instead of buying cosmetics with salicylic acid in them already, this allows me much more choice.  I add it to facial creams and foundation make-up. I can add the amount I need to any brand I want.  For creams I usually just hold the bottle neck firmly against the palm of my hand, quickly tip-blot the gel into my hand, and using my finger, mix it with a a bit of whatever.....  There is a probably a better way, but this works for me.</li>
            <li> It works to shrink existing zits and I think it softens the scars as well.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know for sure.  But for the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth the try.  Go easy on the first few applications.</li>
            <li> I need a higher % of a peel this is so weak of a peel and I just need to go up a notch!</li>
            <li> This is a great peel.  It has never burned my skin &amp; I use it as a spot treatment.  I dot it on my blemishes &amp; leave it on for 3-7 minutes &amp; then I apply my skin lotion on top of my entire face.  It has really made an improvement in my skin.  I can honestly say that it clears blemishes fast!  I have tried many, many products to clear my skin &amp; nothing has worked as well as this!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I need to get more consistent in use</li>
            <li> I have Asian skin. When I was young, I remember getting a dark skin pigmentation that just kept getting bigger on my forehead and two more in other areas of my face.  I got it from my cousin who was staying in our house. It was contagious.  I saw other people who also got this. That is why I believe Michael Jackson had the same problem. One of my family members had a pharmacy and we had a Salicylic Acid in the house.  I was told that it worked for other people.  I didn&#x27;t know the strength but I was desperate so I went ahead and used it.  It felt like I burned my skin when I applied it it hurts so much!  It must have been a concentrated strength.  Anyway, I only used it 2-3 times and the skin pigmentation just peeled off!!  I forgot all about it until recently many years later, I am getting age spots.  If this works when I was in high school I am sure it will work for me again in my age.  I will also try it on my scars. I am glad I thought about it again and all these positive comments confirms my decision.  Thank you everyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done three peels so far and am happy with the results. It definitely burns when you put it on, so I&#x27;ve only been able to tolerate it for about 4 minutes. It has shrunk my existing acne dramatically each time I&#x27;ve used it. The next day I wake up and it&#x27;s almost all gone. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin is much less oily and my pores much smaller. I notice that I peel two days later - which is annoying, but what gets the results. I just make sure I use a heavier moisturizer on that day and night, and I exfoliate with a facial sponge and that takes care of it quickly. I am also using Clinique&#x27;s acne solution system and started both around the same time, so it may be the combination of the two that&#x27;s producing the results. But either way, I&#x27;m very happy with how well my skin is looking these days. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results of another month of use.</li>
            <li> I used this product two days ago and I am really pleased with the results. The peel is effective, easy to apply, and it doesn&#x27;t run when applied properly. The packaging is ideal and the bottle is dark, which is excellent for the preservation of the potency of the contents. I will likely order this product again.</li>
            <li> First, for reference, I am a Black woman with a very dark skin tone who has suffered from moderate to severe acne since my teens.   I had such high hopes for this item, but unfortunately it has not worked for me. i used the peel exactly as directed and from the begining my skin has reacted horribly. I broke out worse than ever with deep painful acne. Reading all of the glowing reviews and the exhortations to stick it out, i continued to use the product once a week for eight weeks, hoping that the impurities in my skin were just working their way out and i would eventually stabalize. Not the case. The acne got worse and i developed dark scarring. Six weeks later, under the care of a dermatoligist specializing in people of color, my skin has mainly returned to the pre-peel state as far as the breakouts are concerned. The scarring, however, has not diminished and I don&#x27;t know if it will. I used to not wear foundation, but now I feel i cannot leave the house without it. My skin tone is so uneven that I have become very self-concious.  PLEASE- if you have a darker skin tone, are prone to scarring or hyperpigmentation, consult a professional before putting this product on your skin. Generally the more melanin in your skin the more likely you are to scar. i really wish i had never used this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and acne free.  I&#x27;m 30 yr old female who has struggled with mild acne since middle school.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from Retin A, proactiv and every over the counter product at CVS. I started using this product a few weeks ago and can already tell a difference.  I use it every other day and leave it on for a few minutes at a time. I haven&#x27;t experienced any excessive dryness or redness.  No more expensive facials or dermatologist appointments for me! I&#x27;m going to keep buying this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I was nervous when I first applied this peel, I thought I was going to burn my face off. My skin is also really sensitive, it gets irritated very easily. However, I did not end up burning my skin at all, and I did not have any other adverse reaction (skin peeling/flaking, irritation, etc). Although, I did take it slow (I left the peel on for less than a minute for my first use). I have gradually been increasing the time I leave the peel on for, you do build up a tolerance to it. My face does not stay red (for long) after use, I just apply Cetaphil spf moisturizer following immediately after.   Basically this is my regiment:(I apply it after I shower in the morning)  -Wash my face with green tea cleanser (it&#x27;s best to use a cleanser with out moisturizer or anything that will leave a residue on your face, it affects the efficacy of the peel).  -I apply witch hazel toner to my face with a round cotton pad. The toner helps remove any excess oils on your face (I read that oils on your face can also prevent the peel from working as well). It can make the peel sting a bit more if your face is really dry, so use discretion when choosing to apply a toner. My face gets really dry, but I want to get the maximum benefit from the peel so I use the witch hazel.  -I also apply vaseline (I use the kind that has cocoa butter mixed in, it smells so good!) around my eyes and on my lips. I us it as a precaution, I&#x27;m clumsy so there is always a chance I could accidently get the peel in my eye or on my lips. Lol!  -Once the witch hazel has fully dried, I begin applying the peel. I just use a round cotton pad (not the same one I apply the toner with, I get a new one out). You can get the cotton rounds at walgreens or any drug store, usually in the beauty section.   -After I apply the peel to my entire face (It usually only takes me a few seconds to apply all over) I set a timer. Once the timer goes off I rinse my face with tons of cold water. When I dry my face I do so gently, and I dab the towel on my face I do not rub.    So for my first time I set the timer for one minute after I applied the peel. But I ended up rinsing the peel off before the minute was up, just because I felt the peel beginning to tingle and I was so scared that I was burning my face off! I began rinsing my face off with lots of cold water. I dried my face, then immediately (gently) applied my moisturizer. My face remained a little red for a few minutes but wasn&#x27;t bad. And to my suprise everything went well! My face didn&#x27;t burn off, my face didn&#x27;t remain red for long, I had no peeling! I have become more comfortable using this peel and also leaving it on for longer periods (I left it on for about 2 minutes and had no adverse reactions) I noticed right away that my skin felt a little tighter. Now after I use the peel my face looks much better, it has this kind of renewed fresh look to it. I don&#x27;t know exactly how to describe it. I didn&#x27;t realize how awful and worn out my skin had started to look! I needed to get all that old damaged skin off. My skin seems to have gotten a little lighter, I think the sun damage has begun to fade a bit.   My acne has not diminished entirely, but I would say it has gotten better. My acne scars seem to have become more smooth, my face doesn&#x27;t looks as ruddy. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle to begin with. My face was/is pretty bad. I&#x27;m 26 and I have adult acne, and I&#x27;m beginning to develop fine lines and wrinkles. My face had begun to develop that tired damaged look. I know it will take quite awhile for my skin to look as great as I want it too (need to see a dermatologist someday!), but this peel seems to be helping it look better for now. Overall I am pleased with this peel! It will take awhile to get the full benefit from the peel. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month, but I see slight improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this peel for four weeks now and I really see a difference. I&#x27;ve paid $250.00 for a professional peel &amp; have seen the same results. My pores are smaller and complexion is clearer. I&#x27;ve gone from a full coverage make up to tinted coverage and and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I&#x27;m 50 \\&quot;something\\&quot;. No acne, no problems, just want better looking skin. I will finish out this bottle and then go to the 35. I really recommend this product to whom ever is reading this as well as my friends. It&#x27;s about time we as consumers can buy a product such as this at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from acne since 8th grade, and am now about to graduate high school and made my New Year&#x27;s Resolution to get rid of my acne for college. I know it&#x27;s something I really can&#x27;t control, but I had a 50$ gift card to Amazon and was determined to find SOMETHING to help. I&#x27;ve tried everything. Epiduo, Murad, Proactive, Clean and Clear, Neutrogena, Clearisil, EVERYTHING. My acne has stressed me out more than school work, and I would always try to cover it up with foundation. I wash my face every day and nothing would get rid of or lessen my acne. I have horrible scars because I&#x27;m OCD with picking my white heads (even though I know it&#x27;s bad) and just red sores all over my face.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 17 days now, and my am I surprised. The first week, the redness in my face went down and my bumps lessened. Then the second week, my acne was way worse. Mostly due to my period and the fact that the salicylic acid brings out pimples to get rid of them. But now that I&#x27;m in week 3, I definitely notice a difference in my skin. My face is smoother, my scaring is DEFINITELY smaller, and most of my acne is going away. I still have a few bumps here and there, but I haven&#x27;t had any new break outs in a couple of days. I got some Ph Prep and cleanser with this and use it before and after I use the product. I also apply some organic lotion stuff to help with dryness. I usually leave it on for a couple of minutes with minimum burn because my skin is pretty used to the acid from years of applying things with it. I do the treatment twice a week at night, and it&#x27;s been good so far.  I&#x27;m going to continue using this product for the recommended 6 weeks and see what happens then :)  I definitely recommend this product for anyone who has acne, acne scars, and redness and wants results!</li>
            <li> Hmmm.. Is this thing supposed to clear my skin of dead cells and zits? If so, big time fail. It does nothing, really.There is no improvement in skin condition, I get twice as much acne AFTER using it - this is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this stuff as I am 27 years old and I have been dealing with acne my entire life. I have tried EVERYTHING! No really, everything over the counter, and everything prescription short of accutane as I refuse to take that horrific drug. (that is a whole other topic)... regardless he purchased this for me in the hopes it would help. I have been using this for 4 weeks now and waited to post my review as I wanted to see if it would really work/help. Here are my recommendations and words of advice for you if you are thinking of purchasing this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FULLY BEFORE APPLYING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The directions say it may tingle slightly when applied... this is an understatement. It burns! To aid in this while the product is on your face fan your face with some paper or put your hair dryer on cool while the Peel is on your face. This will take the intensity of the burn down. (slowly increase the time you leave it on your face, don&#x27;t leave it on the full 8 minutes the first time as you don&#x27;t know how sensitive your skin will be to this stuff)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Rinse with cool water, not too cold, and NOT hot. Your face may be a bit red (like a sunburn) but it doesn&#x27;t last long, I HIGHLY suggest doing this at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply a REALLY GOOD lotion, don&#x27;t skimp on cheap facial lotion here. I have and my face felt like sand paper, get some good thick face cream. This peel will suck everything out of your skin and you need to replace some of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this is where I don&#x27;t so much like the product, I have been using it for 4 weeks and I have worked my way up to leaving it on for 4.5 minutes. My skin peels every week. My skin is sensitive and I look like a snake for the first 3-4 days after using the product. Even using good lotion I still peel like crazy. I know it is a skin \\&quot;peel\\&quot;, but I can not wear make up however, my skin is  getting softer and smoother so hopefully in time I won&#x27;t have to use it every week. (On the up side, if you had a HUGE pimple you needed to take care of stat you could dab this stuff on it as a spot treatment and seriously overnight it sucks it dry, a HUGE upside to this stuff. It KILLS active acne in its tracks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only two down falls with this product is the burn, and the peeling, you may not peel at all, but know that it may be a possibility.ou needed to take care of stat you could dab this stuff on it as a spot treatment and seriously overnight it sucks it dry, a HUGE upside to this stuff.

            <li> i just put 5 star for now hoping for some reply? dont have that bad acne but i realy want to get rid of some scars left om my face, for now im using pro active 3 step  and seems working alittle but the scars stays and make my face real dry. is it ok for me to use tis pruduct at the same time with pro active?</li>
            <li> This is as good as it gets professional result. Unlike the direction that come with the bottle, which I do not find effective enough, I experimented and it worked really well for me. Here is my own direction: I place a few drops of gel into my palm. Then I massage it into my face and let it sit overnight when I sleep. It stings but it&#x27;s tolerable and fanning it helps a little bit, too, but do not wash it off. The stinging sensation will die down after 30 minutes.  For 2-3 days afterwards, the skin begin to exfolidate and peel, revealing fresh pink skin underneath, just like the result of the $70 facial professional job. Be sure to put on sunscreen and moisturister to protect the young skin, especially under strong sun. Happy peeling!</li>
            <li> id been on a skin product buying binge. I began breaking out in acne since i was about 16, ( im now 20). Nothing worked. Even if a product took away many of the actual pimples i was still left with very bumpy skin.  I used this product for the first time last night, and im not going to lie, it burned like hell. i could only keep it on for about 2 of the recommended 8 minutes. it was burning so badly i found myself running around my house trying to cool my face down lol. i washed it off with water, and it was still burning so i applied a pH balanced toner which took all the burn away. I noticed results right away. It burned away all existing pimples and i woke up the next morning with people commenting on how great my skin looked. For me, its a miracle cure.  just make sure you remove the mask the second your face turns red and frosting begins. great product!!</li>
            <li> I used this product to help rid my face of some acne that I had. After application there is a slight tingling sensation, which lets you know its working. After 3 uses I noticed my acne had gone down noticeably. Very effective product and I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I have acne and I have tried a lot of different products, nothing seems to work. I have used this product several times over a period of 4 months. I can not say that it cured my acne because there is no cure for this problem, but it did improve it. I still get pimples but its a lot less and they are smaller. And my face is smoother.</li>
            <li> Product works great, noticeable immediate improvement, though not drastic. I have been repeating it and have not had harsh results, just the expected peeling. I have large pores on my nose, chin and between eyebrows. After the peel I notice a change in pore depth and size. I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a previous salicylic acid 20% n it worked!! But this one wasn&#x27;t so good. It didn&#x27;t peel your skin. It didn&#x27;t with for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the glycolic/lactic acid combo peel at the same time. The first time I used this, I could only keep it on maybe a minute as it was really uncomfortable, and I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin. But subsequent times I kept it on for long er with no problems. I would use this once a week, alternating with this and the gly/lac peel, for about 4 weeks, then the last 2 weeks of my first cycle I would put this one on first, leave it for a couple of minutes, then apply the gly/lac over the salicylic and leave on for another few minutes. I then stopped using for a few weeks, and went back to just using a clay mask once a week to give my skin a break. In that break time though, my skin has stayed clear, with very few blemishes, and the oiliness in my t-zone has been definitely reduced. I think it did help to make my pores appear smaller, if for no other reason that that less oil is being produced. I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in fine lines, but I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles anyway, and I don&#x27;t think it penetrated enough to help reduce acne redness, but since I&#x27;m not breaking out anymore that will help overall reduce acne redness. Definitely recommend for problem skin as an alternative to pricy dermatologist&#x27;s peels- it&#x27;s the same thing!</li>
            <li> As others have said, this is a great product.  The shipping and service is quick, the product is excellent.  A great deal from a great company!  Preferred over the Gylcolac 60 (but both are great).</li>
            <li> I am a 46 year old male who has had bad acne from my 20&#x27;s until present. I tried all of the OTC products as well as several cycles of Accutane over the course of 26 years. A friend of mine at work who also had acne started clearing up a few months ago so I asked him what he had been doing. He told me of this product and his regiment (don&#x27;t all acne sufferers have one)he suggested that I give it a try as there was nothing to lose other than some money. I started around 6 weeks ago and here is how it went:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. week one: After the initial use, I started breaking out a little more with a lot of whiteheads and sensitive under the skin bumps. (this is the phase where it all starts to come out and basically is purging the skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Week two: Still breaking out but the skin is beginning to look tighter and more youthful with smaller pores. I was really starting to doubt the product but my friend told me to stick to it and I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Week three: Still breaking out but not as much with the pimples disappearing at a faster rate and smaller pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Week four: My skin looked and felt better than it had in years of doctors visits and medicines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Week five: My skin has never looked better and the scars are beginning to fade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Week six: My skin looks great! I have never been happier with my skin than I am now this product is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read reviews of folks that it did not help and my heart goes out to them, I sincerely wish them luck in finding a solution. But if you do have this product give it at least 6 weeks before you decide that it does not work, after all you have had acne most of your life and 6 weeks is a blip on the radar. I would recommend the a Neutralizer skin pH balancer as it most definitely helps with calming the skin post peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regiment now consists of Aveeno Active Naturals Ultra Calming Foaming Cleanser, along with Acnefree salicyclic foam that you leave on the faceand Clean &amp; Clear Persa-Gel 10 Acne Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do the peel no more than once a week and as other reviews have stated do it on a few days/nights before, if you will be going out as it does make your skin a little sensitive. I hope my review is helpful.</li>
            <li> Every time I read reviews saying \\&quot;It&#x27;s a miracle\\&quot; or \\&quot;Best product ever\\&quot;, I&#x27;m skeptical.  Usually because it doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Ever.  I&#x27;m 30 years old and after going off birth control permanently last year I&#x27;ve started getting horrible breakouts along my chin and jawline.  Like everyone else, i&#x27;ve tried everything!  Benzoyl Peroxide 2.5% has worked, sorta, but it makes my skin dry, dull and ugly. I used this peel two nights ago - the burning was intense, duh.  Also, I&#x27;ve read enough about chemical peels to know that you really should rinse with a neutralizer. I filled my sink with cold water and mixed in a couple tablespoons of baking soda and used that to rinse.  Thank god I did!  It took the burn away immediately.  I was only able to tolerate the salicylic for about 2.5 minutes.  Redness afterwards was minimal and went away within about 15 minutes. The next morning my skin looked radiant and smooth.  The 3 or 4 chin and jawline pimples were dried up and I didn&#x27;t feel oily at all - a huge improvement.  My skin continued to improve throughout the day - I could almost feel the peel continuing to work.  I figured the improvements I saw the first day would be the extent of it&#x27;s power.  That is, until I woke up this morning (day 2).  Wow.  Red marks and scars on my cheeks with significantly lighter, skin looked even MORE radiant and all active blemishes were GONE!  I didn&#x27;t wear makeup today.  That&#x27;s a first.  I had a little peeling on my chin but it disappeared with some cetaphil moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold.  Can&#x27;t wait to use this product again!  For me to take the time out of my ridiculously busy life to leave a review for this product speaks for itself.  I don&#x27;t leave feedback, ever.  But I had to share this with anyone struggling with acne, scarring or uneven skin tones.  This stuff works!  I&#x27;m so happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review in a month with my progress.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the \\&quot;new\\&quot; me!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have been using for a week now, and I have never found a product that works as great. I already see a huge difference. I have been using every other night vs once ever week, and it is just amazing. No lie, I can almost go without makeup. It will make you break out with small little pimples the first few times, but that is just getting the old bad stuff out of your skin. Nothing to bad, or anything to worry about, at least not for me. I will continue to use this stuff. I don&#x27;t really think that it stings other than, maybe, the first minute you put it on, but definitely nothing one can&#x27;t take.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s  &amp; like many others I&#x27;ve tried just about every product out there for my hormonal acne. This is the only topical treatment that I&#x27;ve ever found to work. I started out with recommended usage but I&#x27;ve found it most effective to use it twice a month &amp; leave it on for 30 minutes at a time. It burns for the first 5 min &amp; then subsides after. This product works wonders. I wish I had found it in my 20&#x27;s. I use it in conjuction with herbal pills that support liver function &amp; help to clean the blood such as Murad clarifying pills.</li>
            <li> after reading the reviews on this product i felt as if it was worth a buy. when i recieved the product i placed the solution on a scar on my nose for a few minutes, within seconds after i washed it off the scar has turned complete black. Darker then it originally was including areas on my nose that where not dark. its really have left me very self conscious, and disappointed about how dark my scar looks after using this product. i have seen a dermatoligist and am now using a product to try to reverse the affect and bring my orginal pigmentation back to normal. i am African American with a dark skin tone, and this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I use this when I feel like my skin is getting clogged and murky.  What I do, based on some of the reviews I read here, is apply it on my face with a cotton pad avoiding the eyes and corners of the mouth and leave it on for as long as I feel like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it stings which is scary at first, but after it goes away, it does not return.  Now, I can say that only because my skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive and I have also screwed around with a lot of different products and chemicals on it before (microdermabrasion, light peels from the drugstore, glycolic acid face wash, benzoyl peroxide, atralin, etc) so my skin is used to stinging.  I agree with others who said that if you are not used to harsher chemicals, that you should gradually build up to longer applications.  My first time, I could only bear it for around 5 minutes, but I feel like that was mostly hype built up from knowing that it was going to sting.  One time, I decided to take the risk and just left it on my face for the whole day.  I didn&#x27;t wind up peeling any more than I would have if I left it on for 5 minutes, but that is just my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as results, this stuff practically eliminates my pores for the first few days and then it sloughs off about a week later for me (I know that seems like a long time, but the peeling isn&#x27;t really obvious).  The peeling stays close to skin and is never flaky, it kind of reminds me of the texture of a peel off mask, but to a lesser degree.  After peeling, I have soft, smooth and fresh looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I used it more consistently, I&#x27;m sure my skin would look even better.</li>
            <li> I am not trained so this was a good starter. It didn&#x27;t hurt, just itched. I didn&#x27;t see any peeling but my face got clearer. I think I just need to upgrade to a stronger version. For the price and quality, it was great.</li>
            <li> if you are going to use a peel for the first time, this might be the one for you, but it was way too weak for me</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild acne and I have brown spots. I used this product for approximately 2 weeks. It burns and it did nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks and it is working pretty good.  I have sensitive skin but have not had any bad reactions to this product besides the normal peeling which is not very bad. I am satisfied with this product and it is a great value.  You can use this product without going to a spa and spending $100 or more.</li>
            <li> Works good, good service</li>
            <li> Have only used 2 times, but so far not seeing any difference in the aging brown spots, which is the reason for my purchase per the ad....will give it a little more time to see if its going to make a difference... I did note the information packet references more on acne concerns, than eliminating the brown spots associated with aging.. :-(</li>
            <li> So I am 28 and have had acne since 12. It has never gone away and sometimes I get nasty cystic type ones. Well I decided to try this product and so far great results.&lt;br /&gt;The first day I kept it on for 5 minutes and the next day I had a really bad pimple I did not have the day before but it quickly disappeared the day after. I felt that it was my pores getting the gunk out. I have so far used it every few days just for spot treatment and my skin has been clear. I love it! Hopefully it starts to lighten the spots from previous breakouts. Do not forget to use lotion after or your skin will peel.</li>
            <li> used on my oldest daughter acne it works very well.I also used it for fine lines works nicely with the glycolic acid would recommend using the both a day apart or so.</li>
            <li> I used a wide-tip paint brush, poured a little of this acid in a glass container, and painted it on. The first time I left it for 15 minutes, the second and third times I left it on for about 30. I should have bought the 30% because it doesn&#x27;t burn how other people have reported, but it does make my complexion clear for a while. Makes me look younger for sure.. I love this product and will continue the application, but with the stronger dose next time. But for people with delicate skin this is probably very good.</li>
            <li> This peel is just perfect. It not only works on the scars but also helps control acne. I&#x27;ve used it for 4 weeks now (applying it once a week ), and haven&#x27;t had a single new breakout. The peeling is subtle, but none of my blemishes are visible anymore.    Although the instructions say not to keep it on for more than 5-7 mins, I keep it on for 2 hours. I&#x27;m not saying everyone should do that. (I did try keeping it on for 10mins for the first time and nothing happened). Maybe it&#x27;s because my skin is used to salicylic acid.     I have been using the Neutrogena 2% salicylic products for three years with no great results. And this peel worked wonders in a month. Needless to say, I&#x27;ve discontinued using them.    Also, the processing was pretty fast. Got it in four days flat.  All in all, a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This stuff saved my skin.  For some background, I am a 25 year old Asian female with combo-oily skin.  Throughout high school, I had problematic skin but most of my pimples were tiny pimples spread out on my forehead, temples, side of cheeks, and chin.  Around 21, my skin cleared up for the most part, though I&#x27;d get a few break outs around the week of menstruation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, about 8-9 months ago, I began breaking out again.  The pimples were initially small, much like my teen years, but a month later, I began forming cystic pimples.  I could have anywhere from 1-5 cystic pimples at any time.  For a few months, I changed my facial cleansers, laundry detergent, tried several facial masks, Mario Badescu skin care, argan oil, and Tretinoin Gel (as prescribed from a dermatologist).  Nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not until I purchased this salicylic peel that I saw my skin change.  The first time I used it, I left it on my skin for four minutes, then put on toner.  The next day, I noticed some of my smaller pimples were gone and some of my cystic pimples were drier. Nothing major.  Five days later, I used the peel again, and this time I began noticing a change in the reduction of my acne.  It&#x27;s been about two months since I began using the peel, and I&#x27;d say 90% of my small acne is gone.  The larger pimples have not necessarily stopped, however, when I first feel one under my skin, I dab the peel onto that one specific site and leave it on.  That method stops the cystic acne from ever breaking skin--I can feel it if I press on the site, but I can&#x27;t see it; then it goes away.  My skin looks the best it has in over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Just as a warning, do not overuse this peel.  I now only use this product all over my face once every 1.5 to 2 weeks, otherwise my skin peels.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t write reviews, but this product is totally worth it, first the shipping was super fast, I ordered it on April 29th  got it in the mail day before yesterday May 6th, really impressive because I&#x27;m in Toronto Canada.  I tried it last night in my face and my back, I have really bad acne scars , I have a hormonal problem and even thought my acne is gone the  scars were really bad.  It was amazing, it&#x27;s just the first time and my face looks way better, I can&#x27;t notice any changes in my back so far, but I&#x27;m hopping for it to clear too.    Anyway don&#x27;t think it twice, I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t try this before, I was contemplating getting laser done, but this seams to be an easy fast and inexpensive way to solve my problem.</li>
            <li> A waste of time. Simply wash your face with soap and accept what you have. This product did nothing but irritate.</li>
            <li> Fabulous! A facial between facials. Has improved my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of acne treatments with poor to moderate success, including prescription acne medication. This peel has yielded the best results, hands down. I&#x27;ve been using it bi-weekly for the past two months in conjunction with my regular acne regimen (gentle cleanser + moisturizing BHA treatment, daily). After three applications, my skin was noticeably clearer.</li>
            <li> It stings like crazy, but is mild enough that I don&#x27;t need any downtime, which is important for me as I need to show up for work every day.  There is some amount of visible peeling, esp in my nose area.</li>
            <li> I never ended up using it. So i am not sure.</li>
            <li> I never write a review. However, this product cost less and provides the same effect as the $150.00 chemical peels I receive at the dermatologist office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1&lt;br /&gt;I applied alcohol, then the Salicylic Acid 20% peel for apprx 8 minutes. My face began to burn so I used a fan to alleviate the stinging (I have experienced the burning in the Doctors office). After 8 minutes, I splashed my face with water ( I know some use a nuetralizer). I did not feel any more buring. The next morning my felt tight.  The acne bumps were significantly minimized- not gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 2&lt;br /&gt;I applied the lactic peel(Intense Repair 88% Lactic Acid Peel Kit with Hyaluronic Acid Repair Cream) to even out the many blemishes/scars- my face looks brighter(vibrant) and the acne is completely gone! (do not apply to much of this one or leave on to long..nearly burned a small part of my skin on my chin applying too much/my skin has healed)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 3- Applied the salicylic Acid peel again ... I am so proud of my face texture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In between week 1 and 2, I have been washing my face with shea moisture soap in the  morning and the skin medica foam wash at night followed by the acne stop by skin obsession and Aveeno Mosturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a black female. I have suffered with acne all my life. I have religiously seen the dermatologist w/ no success in clearer skin. I have accomplished in less than 2 weeks what I was unable to accomplish in years seeing a dermatoligist. I am stoked and wish I would have researched and purchased this product a long time ago.. would have saved myself the frustration and time of going to the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I was using this product for skin tags like i was advised, does not work don&#x27;t waist your money and time.</li>
            <li> I have combination oily/ dry skin of my t-zone. I am still a newbie but this works. I got this to slough off blackheads that won&#x27;t go away from steam pore extractions---and to remove dead, dry, dull skin! I don&#x27;t have acne scars or acne. I am in my early 30s with olive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t leave it on for the suggested five minutes if you are completely new to at home peels.&lt;br /&gt;My first time, it was burning after 30-seconds and I kept it on for only one minute. Then after rinsing in cold water and using a neutralizer, I coated my face in vitamin E. I didn&#x27;t notice anything until a few days later when dry areas started peeling---blackhead and huge pores on sebum clogged nostril, that really dry part under nostril, around lips and chin, smile lines----dead skin peeled off to reveal healthy, blackhead free skin.&lt;br /&gt;My forehead started to get little frosted bumps that turned into pimples the first time---so I didn&#x27;t repeat the treatment as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;Then two seasons later, when summer shifted into autumn, my skin was so dull and dry that nothing worked--masks, light scrubs, pore extractions----the nose was just dull and coated in dark enlarged pores with freckle-like blackheads from an entire summer of sebum clogged skin.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it again and kept it on for 3 minutes this time until frosting appeared. It just became super unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;This time, along with the frosting, there were varying shades --the more dead skin you have, the browner the patches will be,&lt;br /&gt;My laugh lines were yellowish brown and my chin and the area around my lips and nose were brown.&lt;br /&gt;This time, my skin started to feel dry, achy, and tight like I was wearing a mask that was tightening my face---I moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;After moisturizing obsessively for 3 days---it&#x27;s starting to patch and peel nicely to reveal fresh, smooth, even skin without dark blackheads and enlarged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No acne this time. You get acne the first few times you do this---the more toxicity your skin has to purge once the dead layers come off--the bigger the post-peel breakout will be but if you keep on---it diminishes with each peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use this two days before a long weekend---it doesn&#x27;t require you to hide and miss work.&lt;br /&gt;When there are variations of color (red, brown, yellow)  on your face though it is still awkward--sometimes you will have dead skin in your hair or falling on your jacket! So definitely don&#x27;t do this before a date or a special event!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had gotten a lower concentration. But this works so I will use up this bottle. I also want to try different brands once I am done--not because I am unhappy but because I am new and also want to try others to compare.r skin has to purge once the dead layers come off--the bigger the post-peel breakout will be but if you keep on---it diminishes with each peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use this two days before a long weekend---it doesn&#x27;t require you to hide and miss work.&lt;br /&gt;When there are variations of color (red, brown, yellow)  on your face though it is still awkward--sometimes you will have dead skin in your hair or falling on your jacket!

            <li> use this once a week, per instructions. get comments on how my skin glows, etc. this stuff is amazing. it also liquifies blackheads, so you can biore strip right after to pull out everything!</li>
            <li> My pores, acne scars, and blemishes are significantly decreased with consistent use of this product once a week. I&#x27;ve  been using it for well  over 6 months now and this little bottle lasts a long time, considering you need very little of it.</li>
            <li> This product is good but definitely not professional quality. I just use it to spot treat areas. If your looking for the real deal this isn&#x27;t it, but it does a decent job if used correctly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in hopes of getting rid of my acne scars and this junk made the dark marks on my face even darker.&lt;br /&gt;I would never use again or recommend anyone to ever use.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have used it once a week and I can feel the difference in the smoothness of my skin-Others have even noticed. I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I am a biracial woman in her late 20s and I bought this product to use to clear up minor bumps and rough skin. This product caused skin discoloration as well as dark bumps that bled. Threw it out, would never try again.</li>
            <li> Terrible, Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. I broke out horribly from this one and I only used it twice. I have really bad acne scarring from this that will last for months, and will never use again. I have used another one much stronger than this and I didn&#x27;t break out at all. it actually helped. not this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my bf bc he&#x27;s been struggling with acne for about 3 yeas now. we have tried just about every over the counter face wash or ointment and nothing works. after the first use, we saw a difference.</li>
            <li> Helps zap blemishes quickly!</li>
            <li> This was the first strength peel I started started out with.  Since my skin had never had a peel applied to it before the salicylic acid kind of stung and made my face red at first.  I may have left it on too long too in my zealous first time attempt.  Just start out with the least amount of time, if it is your first peel to see how your skin will react.  Since using this I have graduated to the 30% salicylic acid peel and even tried a TCA peel (way stronger than the 20% salicylic acid peel so be careful it you go this route).  Good for oily skin and acne, but \\&quot;always\\&quot; read and follow directions. I have thick, oily aging skin, though, and needed something stronger that 20% to deal with my problems.  Good first time peel for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch of this stuff or what but I used it directly as described and it didn&#x27;t do anything. No skin peeling, no nothing. I originally got it for my Keratosis Pilaris but it didn&#x27;t change a thing. Too bad it&#x27;s too late to return it. :(</li>
            <li> Best thing I ever bought for acne. I get acne on my face and my upper back and have tried everything. I have found that as long as I followed a lengthy routine of exfoliating, stridex pads, and then benzoyl peroxide it help me pretty good but if I even missed one day of my routine I would be broke out. I started using this product. I would wash my face and back with a wash cloth and then put the acid on a cotton ball. First I would do my back and then my face. I would try and keep it on atleast 2-5 minutes. (I warn you it stings but not a lot) and then hop in the shower and wash it all off. Don&#x27;t get in your eyes. My acne is non existent now. I do this routine once a week, sometimes twice and that is all I need to do. I don&#x27;t have to use stridex pads or benzoyl peroxide anymore. Invest  in a good moisturizer like emu oil to put on after. The redness only lasts 5-10 minutes after treatment. It is even fading my old acne scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that SkinLab will respond to comments on Amazon, so this review/question is directed toward their representative:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Salycylic Acid peel for about a month now with one application a week, and at this point I don&#x27;t know if I should continue the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;My goals for the peel were to speed the fading of past acne scars on my cheeks, reduce the size of the pores in my T-zone and improve overall complexion. With that said, I&#x27;ve found that the peel is not painful for me -- it just barely stings -- but the results I&#x27;ve gotten so far are the complete opposite of my goals! My skin is now *extremely* dry, flakey and old, and I&#x27;ve developed acne!! I have acne in areas on my face where I NEVER get acne, and it just won&#x27;t stop. I looked in the mirror this morning and nearly cried at how blotchy, bumpy and spotted my skin is. I&#x27;ve also noticed that a dark patch of skin has developed over my past acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews that state that skin will get worse and may develop acne before it gets better, but I need to ask for a professional opinion. Judging from my current state, should I tough it out and continue the use of this peel or stop now while my skin is still salvageable?&lt;br /&gt;(FYI, the acne developed around the third week of use. From what I can tell, it is not cystic acne and is not painful.)</li>
            <li> However, this is very strong, and I could put it on my face only for 60 seconds. Considering the price and the result, this is a fine product.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and I was using this product as directed once every week, but it wasn&#x27;t doing much so I decided to start using it as a spot treatment and it&#x27;s working much better that way. I don&#x27;t have cystic acne anymore, I just seem to get the hormonal acne around my chin and jaw line. I just put a dot on every pimple I have after I wash my face. Then I wash it off after 5 minutes and then put on an oil free moisturizer. It&#x27;s been working ok, dries out my pimples but they&#x27;re still pretty red. I get scaring from my pimples (hyperpigmentation) and I&#x27;ve been using the glycolic acid 35% on the dark spots as a spot treatment as well. They&#x27;re both definitely better than just using face wash and 2.5% SA or BP spot treatments that you can get at the store so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have had PMS-related cystic acne along with some blackheads and whiteheads since my early thirties. This product works the best of anything I have ever tried to keep my skin clean and smooth with no breakouts. Here&#x27;s my method: Into a tiny ceramic dish (like a soy sauce dish) I stir together with a Q-Tip a pea-size drop of aloe vera gel and the same amount of 20% salicylic acid. I then apply the mixture very carefully to my clean face and neck without rubbing, being extremely careful not to get any product into my eyes. I leave it on for only about 4 - 5 minutes before rinsing with copious amounts of cool water in the shower. After the shower, I gently pat my face dry and apply Shikai Borage Oil Facial Moisturizer, which is very light, all-natural, and unscented. I apply the acid/aloe mix every 5-6 days, and use Shikai face wash and Shikai borage moisturizer twice a day. My skin feels wonderful - amazingly clean and soft, and it looks clearer, brighter and much smoother. I am careful not to use any other sloughing products, scrubs etc unless I have been working in the garden and am really grubby, since I think it&#x27;s important to be gentle with one&#x27;s skin. Rather than go to a stronger solution, I think regular, consistent use of a milder solution is better long-term.</li>
            <li> My middle-age skin was in need of a wake-up. I hadn&#x27;t had a professional facial in about 4 months, and I really didn&#x27;t want to drop $100 on another, so I tried this. Good choice for immediate results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main issues -- congested skin, big pores. I saw immediate improvement after only two applications for a minute or so. I was definitely in need of help, and this product helped. It also is helped to heal a cystic pustule. The only time I saw such immediate improvement on one of these was when I resorted to steroidal shots to heal a nagging one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Money well spent in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My struggle with acne is much the same as everyone else&#x27;s-persistent acne that refuses to quit despite medication and special washes and creams like Proactiv and skin i.d. (which by the way don&#x27;t help much unless its very mild acne). I was skeptical to go so far as Accutane because I already have a history of depression without it being egged on by yet another medication. When I discovered this on Amazon and read the other reviews, I decided to give it a try since so many others seemed to have success with their serious acne and skin issues. I know they recommend the BHA as best for acne, but it seems to dry my skin out so badly my skin overproduces oil and makes it worse. This is the best balance for me, as well as the glycolic acid they make. On first use it can burn quite a bit, but after several uses you don&#x27;t notice it so much. And as other people have said, you want to wash it off your face with the coldest water you can find! I am absolutely astonished that after so many years of battling and trying to hide my acne, it is gone for good, as well as all the scars and pock marks from picking and squeezing to get rid of blemishes anyway I could. If you have any doubts about buying any of the peels to help with your skin issues, squash them and don&#x27;t look back! You&#x27;ll love what you see in the mirror!</li>
            <li> I decided to order this product after spending way too much money on professional chemical peels. The product is exactly what I wanted. I have had some very light peeling and i feel like my skin has improved after a couple weeks of use. Hopefully, it will continue to as time goes on. my only issue with this product is the unclear directions. There are multiple places where the information on application frequency varies.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old, with oily skin, moderate breakouts, mild acne scarring, forehead wrinkles, and slight jawline sagging. I have been using store-bought SA products for decades with no noticeable improvement. This product makes all the difference! It was much milder than I expected during and after application. First application, I had it on for 8 minutes with minimal to moderate stinging and redness. On the second application I had it on for 10 minutes with minimal stinging. I had no noticable peeling or redness afterward, and a slight improvement in the texture of my skin (smoother). I hope to see smoother, clearer skin after using this regularly over the next several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I am now 53 years old, and have been using this product as a weekly peel and daily spot treatment for about 2 years.  After using almost half the bottle, I diluted it with witch hazel and added a few drops of tea tree oil. It is an extremely effective spot treatment and weekly peel. It keeps my skin clear and smooth, and is mild enough to not need rinsing off. After 5 minutes of application, I just add my other skin-care products. A homemade anti-oxidant serum and oil-free moisturizer. I have happy, clear, refined skin, FINALLY!</li>
            <li> This thing is no joke follow the instructions or you will burn your face off. If you apply this on the right schedule your skin will look fab. I&#x27;m young so I dont have wrinkles just lines from my smile but I swear it will even take that away. It literally makes your pores so small that they dont even seem visable after a month. It keeps that fresh clean look on your face all the time. It is amazing what this stuff can do just be careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and have had occasional blemishes in the chin area since my early 20&#x27;s, usually hormonal and very rarely maybe a big cystic one. I&#x27;ve kept my skin under control using proactiv everyday(all 3 steps), trying out sulfur mud masks which I really like as well as a lactic acid peel by this same company. I bought this salicylic acid peel to help the mild occasional acne and to just get a good peel and more even tone to my skin. Upon my first used, I liked it. It had a mild tingle(after about 2 minutes when I&#x27;d rinse with cool water) and left my skin feeling soft. I used it steadily for 10 months, maybe every other week, before I realized THIS was the source of my new problem. I have gone from the occasional hormonal issue to congested unhappy pores since I began using this last February...I&#x27;ve had consistent little white plugs I could see burrowing under the surface of my skin. I&#x27;d never ever had breakouts like this. I cut out everything new I could think of that I&#x27;d added to my regime, anywhere from skin products, to vitamins to food. I have a reasonably healthy diet and daily exercise. I finally realized this was the problem. I read up on salicylic acid and for some it can make the skin shed so much it actually clogs pores instead of clearing them. Now that I&#x27;ve stopped using it, things are getting back to normal. My derm also said there&#x27;s no such thing as things getting worse before they get better.....That&#x27;s a myth perpetuated by the industry to explain away bad reactions.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I believe is a necessity for life.  You can never age if with this product.</li>
            <li> use it once a week, i put it on a cotton ball and dab it on my skin in the &amp;#34;bad zones&amp;#34; i aim for scars and blackhead prone areas. the more you use it, the more change you will see, but give it time. you dont want to leave it on long in the beginning if this is your first time trying it at home. you can scar your skin that way. 5-8 minutes is enough. within a few days, you might notice flaking in the areas that it was used. mine only flaked around my chin. it worked so well, it got rid of this strange bulging mark between my eyes that looked like  a wart or pimple that wouldnt go away. make sure to use gloves and ALWAYS moisturize afterwards. if you want a moisturizer that will help brighten your skin more, look for Avalon brand vitamin C lotion. It is expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> For those with some experience with chemical peels, this is nothing special. For the value, it&#x27;s great and it works as stated. As advertised, the strength is about 20% (I have had 30% peels before and this is slightly weaker). Nonetheless, you can layer this on and it gets very intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep this on for 10 minutes at the longest, and usually for spot treatment on specific acne scars. I always keep a wet towel around to ease the burning. It does start to peel in 3-4 days. Just make sure to use a lot of moisturizer and sun screen throughout the process. I also recommend stopping the usage of other intense skin care regimens (retinol, Retin A, microderms, laser, etc.) for at least one week before and after the full peel process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone with acne scars, I can say this has worked in a reasonable manner. It does take a lot of time and patience to get the results that you want. I have been working on refining my deep scars for almost 6 months and I would say I&#x27;m halfway there. To get your desired results, make sure you do not OD on peels and give your skin time to replenish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 1 1/2 yrs. Not only does it help with my previous sun damage but also monthly breakouts and overall texture.  I have sensitive skin and am so pleased I found an economical option to the spa-grade treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase of this product. This is a very responsible company !    Although I&#x27;ve tried the salicylic acid once, I can see the results and the difference now !!!    Thank you very much !</li>
            <li> I have had problem skin forever. In 2006, I went all out and spent money on a plastic surgeon to remove some scars and then underwent expensive acne treatments in his office.  That only lasted as long as I kept going to his office for the treatments. Once I quit going within weeks my skin looked terrible again and the scar came back just a bit. So since then I&#x27;ve had terrible skin. I was willing to spend so much money on it and I just tried to deal with my skin condition using over the counter products UNTIL I discovered this Salicylic Acid Peel. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since I bought it. And wow, what an improvement in my skin. The scar area is about to fall off right now. My pores are significantly smaller. My oily skin isn&#x27;t oily anymore. The overall condition of my skin is such an improvement.  Just in the nick of time too because I have an important event coming up and I will look great in my new skin.  This stuff works. Try it out and see your skin condition clear up and improve overall. I have one wrinkle in between my forehead which I haven&#x27;t had luck getting rid of but I&#x27;ll continue to apply this and see if it improves.  I&#x27;ll keep you posted.  Best product I&#x27;ve found on amazon.com.</li>
            <li> My chin tends to get clogged pores resulting in either blackheads or large, painful zits and this is the only remedy I&#x27;ve tried that actually keeps the pores clear and even shrinks them. I use it about 2x a week rubbing it on the area with a clean q-tip. I leave it on for only about 45 seconds, until it starts to burn, then wash it off with water. There is no redness and it has cleared up the area so well. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works but you need so much on your skin to work it could be that I am not use to the buffer in product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I am 32 and have had consistent mild acne since I was 11 - nothing could control it! Laser treatments, antibiotics, proactiv - you name it I tried it.  I was hesitatant to try something else since nothing ever worked - but for less than $20 it was worth a shot.  I added this to my regime of items that had seemed to help a little in the past and saw some results after every treatment. It was not immediate but my face got a little better after each treatment - Then after the first complete round of treatment (6 weeks) the results were amazing.  My face is 99% clear and I can get rid of/prevent more acne with the solution if I feel a problem area starting.  For the first time I am in control of my face - my skin tone looks much better too. It is amazing and the price is even more amazing.    So no pain no gain right - so it stings/burns like crazy annd I had to slowly increase the time to the full amount -(careful around the nose and mouth) stand with your face in front of a fan that helps, wash really well with water and then immediately use moisturizer and the burn goes away. After the first few treatments I felt a little sensitive to the sun so I tried to stay in the shade the day following but that went away with use. My skin tolerates spot treatments as needed but be careful and make sure your skin can tolerate the extra treatments.  I wish I had found this years ago I will never go without it again.</li>
            <li> I am a lovely latina. I have had hyperpigmentation around my mouth. I was embarrassed at times to be seen. I bought many products cover up, concealers, foundation. Nothing worked as well as this product. I have used this product each time my skin improved. I am a work in progress. I see this beautiful skin appearing. It has also erased fine lines, extra plus. I wish I would of found this product a year ago. It would of saved me heart ache and lots of money. This product is worth the money. It was a miracle I had prayed for.</li>
            <li> this product is absolutley fab! its been about three weeks now since ive started using this product and the results are remarkable.</li>
            <li> Well, I suppose my title got your attention. What does that mean? Let me start at the beginning and walk you through this. I developed Rosacea as an adult, about 40 or so, I&#x27;m 58/male. At first it was just some redness that was no big deal. Well one of the side effects is that Rhinophyma can start to develop. That&#x27;s what happened to me. It starts slowly, you don&#x27;t even realize it is happening. If you have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; bathroom lighting it actually masks a lot of the first stages. I went to Vegas for a wedding and the bathroom at the hotel had fluorescent lighting. If you want to see something frighting, go look in a mirror and use fluorescent lights. Holy COW! The skin on my nose looked gray! I also had one place on my nose that was a stubborn pimple. It wasn&#x27;t red though so I never paid it a lot of attention. I like to think that I&#x27;m not narcissistic, but my nose got to the point that it was starting to call attention to itself. There would be times that I got pimples also, make no mistake about that! I tried OTC acne products,not much difference, heck I tried so many things I can&#x27;t list them all. Sure I&#x27;d get some peeling but nothing really changed. So, I ordered this and Glycolic Acid and got them the first of August. I wanted to use it for 2 months before I reported back. So here I am. I have not used the Glycolic Acid yet, I&#x27;ve used 1/2 bottle of the Salicylic.     O.k. here is what I did. I have used it almost exclusively on the nose, along with a couple other problem areas. First the results on the nose. Like the title says - I have my nose back! It is a normal looking nose as smooth as you would expect for someone my age if not smoother. The excess gray (dead) skin is 95-99% gone at this point. It is flesh-colored and has no bumps anymore. I figured the bump was a cyst of some time, deep in the nose. It took a lot of work to get it out, even with this product. When I had finally removed enough layers of dead skin then an amazing amount of fluid came out. I hopeI haven&#x27;t grossed you out too much but if there is anyone out there that has gone through this they understand the frustration. BTW I&#x27;ve been to dermatologists in the past, ALL of them told me that it would cost thousands of dollars to apparently do what I&#x27;ve done for under $20.     Here is exactly what I did. I used this product every day, sometimes twice a day for two months. Did it sting? No,not for a LONG time. There was so much dead skin that it didn&#x27;t make a dent. Does it sting NOW? Yes, but nothing that I can&#x27;t handle. Mild stinging. I used a cotton swab(Q-tip type) to apply it. I waited the ten minutes then used COLD water to remove it. Patted it dry with a towel and then used jojoba oil immediately after. I highly recommend the jojoba oil in conjunction with this. I produce a lot of Sebum btw (probably had a Sebum cyst.) You can get the jojoba oil right here on Amazon too. It seems to balance all kinds of skin types.    You will get some peeling but I saw a lot less peeling on areas of my face besides my nose. The other areas I mentioned are another problem area that also had an old acne scar that looked like a small punch hole. This area improved so much that one day I went to apply the Salicylic and I was unsure where the area was. THAT was very gratifying. You DO have to keep using it though. Based on my results you can&#x27;t just stop using it. I have gotten to the point where I use it a couple times a week now. I think that I will switch to the Glycolic Acid next since it&#x27;s a longer interval on that regime. The Salicylic instructions say that you can use it every day. I&#x27;m also going to use a bit over the rest of my face because it DOES smooth out the flesh very nicely.     At any rate, that&#x27;s what I did and that&#x27;s what I got. My nose back!</li>
            <li> I saw results right away with this product, its amazing. my skin looks awesome, the only bad thing is they sent me an old batch expires in 4 months.</li>
            <li> OMG ! I was so afraid to put this on due to the other people saying how painful it was. Can&#x27;t really say how much it helped because I just got out of the shower. It stung a little. Nothing painful -not burning , please don&#x27;t be afraid of this. Can&#x27;t believe how afraid I was. Waited three hours to get up the nerve. Everyone is different. Left it on for 8 minutes because it said no longer.</li>
            <li> I first used this when I received it as a sample with my usual glycolic peel order and since  then, I purchased th  full-sized bottle.  By far, it is the  best peel I have ever encountered. One use and my skin was noticeably clearer and smoother. After three treatments, old dark acne scores which had been around forever were practically ERASED. Buy it, buy it, buy it if you have been looking to a solution to uneven tone and acne scarring. One caveat: I have  normal to dry skin, so I found it better to use it twice monthly rather than once a week, as it can be a little drying.</li>
            <li> Really awesome...This is a repeat buy.</li>
            <li> great product! I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but my skin is already softer and clearer even just the morning after. I put it on, left it for 5 min and rinsed off with a baking soda/water solution (to neutralize the acid). It does burn a bit, but once its all gone there are no problems, I sat with a fan blowing on my face for the 5 minutes and had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I do not give 5 stars is that the acid had leaked a bit onto the instructions during the shipping process. Maybe needs to be packaged in a box instead of a padded envelope.</li>
            <li> I am very conflicted with this product, I wanted to try an over the counter product before i go to a professional for a chemical peel, and after doing research and reading reviews i decided to go with this one, but it doesnt do much good or bad for my skin, right after i use it my skin becomes extremely dry and after i use a moisturizer it feels a little softer than usual but this only lasts for a few hours. I have been using it for a few months now , about once or twice a week, for 8 min each time. So i think it was a waste of money and next time i will have a professional do it</li>
            <li> I have had this for about 3 weeks and have used it twice.  I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable changes in that time period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It burns after about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Great!!! Ecxellent product.</li>
            <li> Really burns and you need to follow directions, but it does make your face shiny and new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 6 times now, and I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement of my overall complexion. My skin is smoother and clearer.   Like other reviewers have said, at first blemishes seemed to emerge immediately after doing a peel, but then also went away faster than usual. Now after several applications I have fewer blemishes than ever.     Pros- Fewer blackheads, pores appear smaller (actually just cleaner :), skin is smoother, fewer blemishes after several uses.  Cons- Burned during the first few applications, can be drying (must moisturize!)    I will keep using this stuff, and definitely reorder again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend more! I already told a friend to order one for her. You&#x27;ll notice the difference just after one use. Great product and very fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Just as described, Works the way it should. great shipping time and good tracking. overall happy with this product, would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works decently well, but takes a while. The people claiming you put it on and next day your skin looks normal are exaggerating. I used it once a week for about 6 months, for the crummy acne scarring I have around my nose. Started in the springtime, and now my skin is looking a bit smoother and more mellow-toned. It works, and it works pretty well, but it&#x27;s not a miracle product. Nothing is. I might move up to a higher acid concentration and see how that works.</li>
            <li> Nothing happened even though I followed the directions. I&#x27;m hoping it works better next time.</li>
            <li> I used it because my face is soooooooo oily, but no breakouts except rare cystic acne.  Even this peel does not permanently eliminate my oily nature. But it made my skin look better, less hyper-pigmented from all the sun-filled activities this summer. Everyone seems to complement me on my skin, but I know my skin! It&#x27;s so oily (I have to blot my face every 3 hours) and that&#x27;s the only reason I did this peel. Maybe I need to do it more often, on a routine basis to see it get less oily over time.</li>
            <li> do not get this one.  It does not work.</li>
            <li> Works, after use everything comes back, have to use regular, dangerous if not careful, would never want to spill or be careless with, got on mouth once, put cold water on fast. Was alright. After I used on some flaws on skin they were not as noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Then came back when I quit using. I don&#x27;t use on whole face. Stuff seems to dangerous to use without professionals. Unless you know what your doing wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean my pores once in a while and it really works.  But my skin also tend to peel more than I would like after using it.  Wish it works with less peeling.</li>
            <li> U can feel it work it burns.works pretty well.using it as spot treatment instead of a mask seems more pratical and works better for me.</li>
            <li> I used to work at a spa and they would use this and charge you $65 per peel!! I buy this at home and my husband who is acne prone loves the immediate results. It won&#x27;t cure your acne completely but it helps to control breakouts! I have pretty good skim skin and i use this once in awhile for a deep cleanse and my skin comes out nice and clean. Happy with the product, shipping time and price!!! :)</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. I&#x27;ve been using it on my permanent eyebrow make up . I use it once a week. The tattoo is getting lighter but you need to be consistent. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does reduce pore size if used consistently.</li>
            <li> It eventually gets rid of some pimples, but I thought it would zap them overnight like some of the reviews said.  It doesn&#x27;t zap over night, but within 3-4 nights pimples are dried out.  I only use it on the pimple itself and not over my entire face.</li>
            <li> OMG 20%? that is dangerous. people, don&#x27;t use it. my sister works in skin care and she says NEVER use higher then 2%. ask any doctor or anyone in skin care</li>
            <li> I bought this peel after trying a series of lactic acid peels. The first and most important thing I can express with peels of this nature(glycolic, salicylic, and lactic) is that you need to be PATIENT. This is not a miracle overnight cure for hyperpigmentation, acne, enlarged pores, scaring, and superficial wrinkles and lines. It will make these problems MUCH better with time.  I have mild acne and some clogged pores and the winter season makes my face flakey red, and more prone to breakouts, especially not being in the sun, pool and tanned all the time. I was looking everwhere for something to work. After a lot of research I started trying the lactic acid peels, which are very moisturizing. I wanted to combat the dry flakey skin first. I tell you what I BROKE OUT LIKE CRAZY. I was so upset, but I kept at it. One peel a week, or sometimes less if I felt I needed it. Soon, my skin started looking a lot better, smoother, and the tone was more even. It also hurt less to put on the peel. So I decided to try this peel. WOW EVEN BETTER. My skin has never looked so good. I use the peel about once every three days, but I only leave in on for 1-2 mins at a time before i rinse. Then I follow up with amlactin (a lactic acid moisturizer) with a few drops of hyaluronic acid. If I am having more acne issues I will follow up the salicylic acid peel with Benzoyl peroxide, but nothing more than 3% or it is too drying. I think someone with the same skin situation as me would really benefit from this product and for the really great price, its worth its weight in gold. I will be a repeat customer for sure.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this salicylic acid gel peel because although I mostly have scarring from old pimples all over my forehead, I also have occasional breakouts of two or three in random places on my face. This stuff seems to be working, and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little under 2 weeks. My old scars are lighter, and the pimples that occasionally pop up dry out pretty quickly. Also, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel super tight or dry after I use it as long as I apply a moisturizer. With Murad, no matter how much moisturizer I used, I still felt \\&quot;creaky.\\&quot; My only complaints are the peeling skin and the sting factor when applied (although based on other reviews, these were expected).    Also, please note that as other reviewers have said, you will SEEM to break out more when using this for the first few times. But it is simply \\&quot;under-the-skin\\&quot; pimples coming to the surface. For over three months I have had a small patch of bumps on the left side of my face that were definitely pimples but never came to a head. After using this peel 3 times (once every other day), I suddenly have white heads on that side! Sounds gross, but NOW they&#x27;ll dry up, pop, and go away, rather than sitting under my skin like glorified goosebumps. :D I couldn&#x27;t be happier.     Tips for this product:  1. Test out how often to use this for yourself (I use it every other day unless my skin gets too peely)  2. Moisturize! Moisturize! Moisturize! It would be good to get a face moisturizer with aloe, because it may irritate your skin at first.   3. Have patience. It may look bad at first, but keep going!</li>
            <li> This chemical peel really is the real deal. I used it to spot treat some pimples and within a couple of days, they were all dried up and gone!</li>
            <li> I went to school for Esthetics so I have been subjected to \\&quot;the real deal\\&quot; I felt as though my skin looked/felt great the very next day but through-out the week there was nothing. Usually with peels your skin gets better day by day.    I probably wont purchase this particular peel again unless I go for a higher level.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user, you can tell the difference. It does sting,but you can handle it. I do not leave it on for longer than 5 minutes. Avoid corners of your mouth or nose. Face feels so much smoother. I applied it twice, every Monday.I feel it was good investment and I am glad I did not order the stronger one. That would be an overkill. Cannot tell if it will be effective on dark spots, not enough time, but I will use in future since I could feel the difference in how smooth my face feels. 46 yrs.old</li>
            <li> I have been using this peel several times a week for 3 weeks. It has drastically improved my skin tone and texture. I was hoping to reduce some of my acne scarring, and this has definitely helped. I can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin looks in another month! It does burn a bit, and it is imperative to moisturize after. I hope it helps your skin, too! :)</li>
            <li> This product has done EVERYTHING it claims.  Absolutely less scars, my fine lines are GONE, FIRMER skin, evening out my skin tone.  I am in LOVE with this product.  YES it is harsh and YES it will make you peel.  But it is somewhat controllable.  If you want better results than last time (resulting in more peeling) you leave it one a little longer.  If you peeled too much last time, then leave it on a little shorter (resulting in less peeling).  Pretty basic.  I use this product for 7 minutes.  The peeling (in my case at least) happened two days after use, and lasted for two to three days.  But i am always able to exfoliate it off easily and conceal it easily.  The day after use, your skin feels like a sunburn, a little tight and red.  Then the next night you will see flakes.  But the flakes are very kind and easy to remove.  Then a couple days later when you thought your face was finished shedding, it starts flaking again.  And I&#x27;ll tell you why: BHAs are different in the fact that they go DEEPER into your pores than AHAs, because they dissolve oil (they LOVE that stuff).  So because it is going deeper, it is going to shed the deeper layers of skin as well as the top layer.  This is why you get better results with Salicylic Acid (BHA) than say Glycolic Acid (AHA).  Definitely try this over ANY AHA. I&#x27;ve used Glycolic and Lactic Acid before and it was more irritating than effective.</li>
            <li> Although this product scared me at first and can be quite drying, it still deserves all 5 stars.  After my first time using it I noticed a much improved appearance (red acne marks faded, bumps diminished, etc.).  My skin has quickly and drastically improved- existing bumps reduced, no new bumps to speak of, oiliness solved, etc.  I even had a couple of pimples seem to, well... fall off. I already feel much more confident.  I am so glad I found this stuff!!</li>
            <li> this is NOT lotion or skin..  this is Medical product..  20% is not low position. 5% and more is very serious to your skin..  Carefully consider to use..</li>
            <li> I get periodic breakouts and the major problem is the scarring some of the breakouts leave behind. While I&#x27;m desperate to fade the scars, it would only make sense to eliminate the breakouts to prevent more scarring. I think this peel has helped. Most of my breakouts occur with PMS or when I&#x27;m under a lot of stress. The peel has helped minimize the number of breakouts, though I still do get one here and there. It&#x27;s my first peel and have been using it for a couple months. However, I&#x27;m trying to get back into the habit of using it regularly while trying to decide what a good frequency is. My aim is to use it 3-4 times a week. I leave it on for the entire 8 minutes. It can/does sting like hell, but I like that feeling; let&#x27;s me know its doing its job, haha. I use Ponds face moisturizer if I use the peel at night or when I&#x27;m not going out. Other times, I use Aveeno Positively Radiant since it has SPF. I have noticed a diminish in the scarring, and am hoping one day they will be gone for the most part. Be advised that you may notice worsening of your skin after initial usage. For example, some scars will appear darker. But the darkening is simply just the scarred tissue that is burning off, so after a few days, it will peel off and skin underneath will be lighter. I was also using microdermabrasion in between peels to encourage sloughing, but was worried that was an overload and didn&#x27;t want to make anything worse. I still will use it, but not so closely with the peel.</li>
            <li> I have done a couple of peels so far, but my only issue is the scarring that this stuff has done. My suggestion is if you use this product stay indoors for some days , because your face will not look pleasant at all. after two weeks or so your skin and acne does look much better. I guess you have to take the good with the bad here. you must treat your skin afterwards. overall , a decent product for acne prone skin,</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve bought tons of items on amazon and this is my first review.  this gets results quickly!  I started using the item last week, every 3 days or so, and the acne on my skin is gone!  I still have some scars, but I&#x27;m hoping this product will remove them in a couple of days/weeks.  this gives you very fast results!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like real acid in the movies (good thing for me) but it does burn like crazy some times. I have rosacea and the really bad kind. I havent had it for long, although I&#x27;m already highly sensitive to almost everything. This stuff, as I said burns and tingles, but when the procedure is done - my skin feels amazing! It does make it red which is why you should use it at night and not before work.     Application: I highly suggest you get a cotton swab for this, put over bottle, tip for a second or two then DAB not wipe on face. Replinish the cotton swab as needed, you don&#x27;t want a lot on your face but you do want enough to make it work. When it&#x27;s time to rinse your face, very carefully rinse over and over and over again for a couple minutes. If this stuff stays on your skin by accident, it can have gnarly consequences. The rest of the procedure is explained with the bottle itself..I just wanted to dumb it down a little.     Also, for the love of god do not use this all the time. I read one person using this several times a day, the damage to your skin could be astronomical. I read from a medical journal that you can actually become poisoned from using this too much. I use it twice a week which is more than safe and does the job.     Finally, if it burns too much then rinse right away. A some burn is good because it&#x27;s actually removing your dead skin which of course doesn&#x27;t feel good. Use sunscreen!!! You are pretty much making your skin naked to the atmosphere and the sun so as suggest 35 or above.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard that you can&#x27;t shrink pore size... whoever made that statement has NOT tried this product! I&#x27;m in the last year of my twenties, and over the past year my skin has been at its worst-- acne, old acne scars, congestion, wrinkles, unevenness, and the worst of all... HUMONGOUS pores. I&#x27;ve tried so many things... facials, expensive cleaners and lotions, etc. I&#x27;m SO HAPPY that I finally discovered the magic of salicylic acid! I&#x27;m on my third week (using it 2 times a week), and OH MY GOODNESS, my skin looks awesome! Especially the pores! They&#x27;re dramatically smaller, and I didn&#x27;t think that was possible. My skin is so much more even and smooth, and the acne scars are beginning to fade. I even got carded ordering a drink for the first time in at least TWO YEARS, so obviously other people are noticing my new youthful looking skin. ;)    It does sting quite a bit, so be prepared! The first time I could only leave it on about a minute and a half, and now I&#x27;m about to five minutes. The peeling is barely noticeable, and my skin looks so vibrant and healthy after each peel. I&#x27;m so glad I finally found something that works!!</li>
            <li> salicylic acid is generally not that strong in terms of peeling so get a higher % if your skin isn&#x27;t crazy sensitive</li>
            <li> It is quite good so far and the product met my expectations. I use it quite often, much more often than it is recommended - 3-4 times a week! The results have been really satisfactory. I had quite a lot of spots on my shoulders and down my neck and I use the salicylic acid to fight against them and also to regenerate new skin cells on the affected parts of my body so that I have no stains that are left behind after spots have recovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike is the price, which is why I deduct one star for this product. I know that this product can&#x27;t really be as expensive, since my mom used to buy a pure salicylic acid for so much (!) cheaper.</li>
            <li> I just got the bottle today and used it straight away.  I just washed my face and applied it. Didn&#x27;t really burn (but you could feel something). Left it on for 2 mins then washed it off with water. I noticed visible results almost immediately! Pimples kinda shrank too! Think will use a higher percentage next time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item on the Amazon website to step up my skincare routine. I had never done any facial peels before, and was nervous about the burning sensations that some reviewers had experienced. The first time, I left the product on for only a couple of minutes, as I was feeling a burning sensation mostly around my nose. when I rinsed the product (with cold water, no neutralizing solution), I was amazed at how my skin looked. It simply felt squeaky clean! I had some peeling around my nose, and on my cheeks a couple of days later, and my T-zone-oily skin was less shiny. I have been using the peel very 5 days or so, and my friends have noticed how clear and bright my face looks. Most of friends now want to try this product. Trust me, it does wonders, especially for the rest of us with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I had terrible acne that decided to come back when I was 25. I tried everything: Proactive, Epiduo, and even antibiotics that my dermatologist recommended. Then I decided to see what was the best reviewed acne treatment on Amazon. I was not disappointed! This peel is absolutely incredible. I&#x27;ve been acne free for months! You rub the gel on your face with a cotton ball and let it work its magic! The one drawback: it is an extremely intense pain. It feels like a burning acid is eating your face. The first several times I barely last a minute. However, the more you use the treatment, the less painful it gets. Beauty is pain! And being acne free is a dream! I will definitely order this stuff again.</li>
            <li> I never ever had acne as a teen. Then something happened at age 28 (adult acne) and the past 3 years have been horrible for the skin on my face. I have oily skin apparently and after just 1 application of this my skin dried out tremendously. The texture also appeared different right away, I will use this once a week for a month and I have a feeling I will see good results. Beware this peel does burn like fire. I am an experienced peeler and this one hurt from the second I put in on. I lasted 2 minutes in front of an open window with cold air blowing in. Start slow because this stuff is no joke. I did not actually &#x27;peel&#x27; either.  Good Luck.</li>
            <li> Is Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel save for pregnant women??&lt;br /&gt;I used it 3 times with Neutralizer skin pH balancer and Iam pregnant in  the first month, now I am freaking out</li>
            <li> a friend recommended this for me. I have acne scars and though I know they&#x27;re not going to go away, I just want something I can do at home to slough off the top layer of the skin. This works great. At first I didn&#x27;t even notice much peeling, but I realized that it was because I wasn&#x27;t putting very much on. I used q-tips and with a small tip not very much was getting on my skin. So while it felt hot while it was on, it didn&#x27;t result in any peeling. Then weeks later I used a cotton ball and that did the trick. I kept it on for a little over 3 minutes and it was hot, very hot. My skin peeled a lot 2 days later. The peeling lasted for days afterwards, but I like the result. The little white heads are gone and pores look smaller. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is potent and works well.  I have sensitive acne prone skin and after having a baby, my face exploded in volcanoes. It was so bad that I did not want to go outside.  I have used this peel twice now within a week and my face is starting to heal because all of the junk is getting exfoliated off.  I use this in conjuntion with other homeopathic products because I tried everything under the sun and nothing has worked.  I also take zinc and pantothenic acid pills 2x a day.  Because of the peeling, I also use hyaluronic acid with my moisturizer and sunblock.  Seems to be working like a charm.  Sounds like a lot of stuff, but its still cheaper than paying to see a dermatologist who writes out expensive prescriptions that do not work.  Everyone reacts to treatment for their acne differently so I hope this will help some people! Having volcanoes all over your face is traumatizing so I can empathize with people looking for something that actually works.</li>
            <li> For the first few times it burns alot. But you&#x27;ll get use to it.  I would not recommend using this on like the day before going out. Because there is alot of skin that comes out. Try use it like 2 days before going out so there isnt as much flaky skin.</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and have experience with many types of acid products. My mistake was purchasing something from a company i am not familiar with. I read the instructions and found it odd that the recommendation for removing the acid was by using water. Generally you must neutralize any acid then remove it with a warm cloth. But i decided to follow the instructions. I left this product on for only about 5 minutes and it was burning my face so i started to put cool water on my face, as i suspected the acid was not coming off and was, in fact, burning even more.   I luckily had a neutralizer product on hand and was able to save my skin. I gave this product 1 star not because it does not work but because the company is selling it to anyone who wants it and they are not giving good and safe instructions on use and removal of this product. It is now 4 days since i have used this product and i have been dealing with some terrible peeling spots on my face. If you decide to purchase this product please also purchase a pH neutralizing product and have it ready so that you can properly remove this acid. Better yet, buy form a reputable company that can give good and accurate instructions.</li>
            <li> I suffered from adult acne for the last 8 years. Being allergic to benzoyl peroxide, my options were limited to salcylic acid (I used to use OTC, 2%), antibiotics and retinol gels (tretinoin). Tretinoin works, but it casued dermatitus/eczema on my skin and I had to use it very slowly, which gave me limited effect. It worked and I liked it, but after using 4 tubes I was looking for something more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the salicylic acid peel, I followed the instructions and left it on only for a minute on only the areas with most breakouts. It was still very effective. I eventually started covering bigger areas for 3-5 minutes, and my breakouts are almost completely gone now only after 2 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many people pointed out, it did make my skin peel a little. But only the areas that are supposed to peel because of healing process. When used on my healthy skin, it did not peel at all. Also, my skin did get red while the peel is on, but it went away after I rinsed with water. Finally, although many reviewers seemed to be concerned that it doesn&#x27;t come with a PH neutralizer, according to my doctor PH neutralizer (like baking soda) is optional. Rincing with plenty of water will neutralize because water is neutral.</li>
            <li> Holy moly does this burn! If you have sensitive skin, do not even touch this stuff! Stick with AHA and BHA at the most and heavily use sunscreen after that.&lt;br /&gt;That said, this does exactly what it says it will do, although I don&#x27;t think it does it quite as well as other reviews have said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a slave for skincare, so I&#x27;ve tried many different peels over the last 16 years,  this one by far gave me the best result for an at home treatment.&lt;br /&gt;What impressed me the most was after my brother used it. My brother had really bad acne,  like his whole face was covered with huge zits, after using this once a week for a month, his acne has cleared up completely.  He continued using once every week, and it&#x27;s helping to lighten up his acne scars,  too. Now he is no longer insecure about how he looks hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> THIS HELPS KEEP COMPEXTION CLEAR AND TIGHTENS PORES.</li>
            <li> I saw drastic results after the first treatment. This is a miracle in a bottle. I started having trouble with acne about 4 years ago and during that time I tried everything I could think of. This is the only thing that worked and after the third treatment you would never know I had trouble with acne. I would recommend this product to anyone who had a problem with acne.</li>
            <li> This tore up my skin. I used as directed and it gave me blotches that a year later I am still repairing.  I am a Black woman. Don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> Its a must have for oily skin people. its cleans pores and purify the face</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I&#x27;m about out and need to order more. My 70 y/o skin does very well with this product and I find alternating it with Glycolic Acid peel works nicely for me and helps diminish small lines and crepe type wrinkles in my aging skin. I really have enjoyed the results and the money saving of not having to visit a salon with escalating prices to get the same outcome.</li>
            <li> Boy this hurts. But it works. I just wanted to let people know that if they don&#x27;t make it the whole 7 minutes, they do still get benefit. I rarely make it through 3 minutes. I have a very low pain tolerance. But still my skin is lovely after I wash this off. And since some people have a bad reaction, there is no reason not to start with one or two minutes. I use a q-tip to apply very carefully (I can&#x27;t imagine the pain and injury if a drop of this got in my eye!). There are MANY treatments in one tiny bottle, so don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re \\&quot;wasting it\\&quot; with only one or two minute treatments.</li>
            <li> After much research online and deliberation I bought this product. As advertised it does address all the problem areas pointed out. I initially started with 2 minute application on certain spots on my face followed  by ample washing with cold water and moisturizing. It stung in the beginning till I got used to it. Now I apply for longer times ( t &amp;#62; 20 min) and while it still stings at the beginning, the sensation doesn&#x27;t last long. I have had good results with the use of this peel. It has helped me with acne scars and mild pigmentation that was visible on my face. The only care one should consider is to apply sunscreen the next day after the peel and do not skip on moisturizing. I avoid this peel during winter ( dry season) and during peak summer. Apart from that, it is a good peel to start off with and advantage is even people with no experience like myself could get started and comfortable with it. Definitely recommend it !</li>
            <li> I bought this peel and the lactic acid peel to use together on rotational weeks. One week I apply the salicylic acid peel and smear my face with Egyptian Magic for a few days while my skin recovers. Sometimes I peel a lot, other times I peel very little, depending how much damage I have and how long I have waited in between peels. I tan very easy and am very sensitive to the sun (hyperpigmentation), have acne scars and acne along with an oily face and visible facial hair. When I thread my face I get breakouts almost immediately. I am 24 years old and still have acne problems especially around menstruation. So I use this peel alone during the summer once a month and drink lots of water regularly.&lt;br /&gt;Now that it is colder and I stay away from the sun as much as possible, my face can take more. At the moment I am doing a salicylic acid peel and use Egyptian magic for a few days until the peeling is over. A week later I use the lactic acid peel and at night apply Ageless skin bleaching serum for that week. After the lactic acid peel I take a week&#x27;s rest. Every day even if I am home all day, I apply skin moisturizer with SPF.&lt;br /&gt;I never really cared about my facial features until I met my husband, I figured that all these complications, I should just deal with it for the rest of my life. In high school I used Retin-A and that was when the hyperpigmentation started. I then started taking tetracyline for my acne for over 6 months and then learned about antibiotic resistance, so I stopped since there was no change and did not want to try other antibiotics to target the bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;I recently underwent a series of laser treatments for my face, hoping that if I had less or no hair, I would have less clogged pores that would become acne. And that worked, especially since the laser zaps your face, killing a bunch of surface bacteria (no risk of resistant strains from forming).&lt;br /&gt;Seeing a specialist is the best thing to do, so do this regimen at your own risk. So far my regimen has been improving my skin texture, smoothing it out and controlling my acne. My hyper pigmentation hasn&#x27;t showed much improvement, but I just need to give it more time.&lt;br /&gt;---- Wife&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For FYI purposes, here is my routine that I do at the end of the day:&lt;br /&gt;Cleanse face with gentle face wash or african black soap.&lt;br /&gt;Clean face with cotton ball damp with rubbing alcohol (stay away from benzoyl peroxide while using peels).&lt;br /&gt;Apply salicylic acid/Lactic acid peel with fan brush (I use only a droplet from pouring).&lt;br /&gt;While waiting, I clean my dish and make a mixture with baking soda and cold water (does not need to be a paste, just make sure you have enough baking soda).&lt;br /&gt;When timer is done, I use my fan brush and brush the neutralizing mixture all over my face (it bubbles a lot more with the lactic acid, no worries), face gets really hot for a moment, just keep applying until you do not feel burning.

            <li> I&#x27;ve waited 7 weeks to write this review. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, I am a 28 year old Asian female. I do not have acne but I do get occasional pimples that leave its scars/marks after they go away. I am also genetically freckly, freckles I am fine with, but this also makes me prone to UV exposure so I develop sunspots more easily than those who are not genetically-inclined. I started noticing more visible sunspots on my cheek in the last 6 months albeit the fact that I do have a beauty regimen and moisturize with spf 30+ whether I am in or out of the sun; but, as with genetics, it&#x27;s inevitable for me to develop these. So I finally decided to find something to treat the dark marks from pimple scars and the sunspots, and to manage those issues somehow. I came across this product and with such great reviews, I was so excited to try it and here is my review after 7 weeks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions exactly as recommended. I rinse, clean with Witch Hazel Toner, apply peel...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 1st week, it stung so terribly I only lasted about 3 minutes after application. The following day showed no signs of drying, flaking or peeling and I assumed it was because I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough and my face is naturally oily so the peel didn&#x27;t affect it too much. No biggie, it was only the first week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 2nd week, it still stung like hell for me. I was able to leave it on for 6 minutes while using a piece of paper to fan my face. Same results as the 1st week. I still had hope for this product so didn&#x27;t question it, onto the next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 3rd week, I championed it for 8 minutes with my head in the freezer while fanning my face. It just stung so terribly, I don&#x27;t know how anyone is capable of coping with the burn otherwise! I had VERY LITTLE peeling the following day but that was about it. Otherwise, the results were pretty much the same as the first two weeks. I still didn&#x27;t feel it was enough treatments to judge the effectiveness of the product. So optimistically, I waited for the next few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- 4th week... same&lt;br /&gt;- 5th week... same&lt;br /&gt;- 6th week... same&lt;br /&gt;- 7th week...I did 8 minutes with my head in the freezer and am starting to feel silly and ridiculous. I am beginning to doubt this product very much. There has been ZERO change in appearance to the scars and sunspots. I mean ZERO change. I&#x27;ve seen Mederma and Mama Lotion do a better job with a 10th of the pain of this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed so far and feel absolutely deceived. But, I will continue with this until I finish it and will update with progress if there is any at all.</li>
            <li> the first time i used this it burned so bad i could only handle seconds to a minute then i was scared the next day my face would be red and looked burned but it was fine the next week i tried it and it still burned i think its slowly getting better im not using it more then 1 or 2 a week just on bad spots im hoping this will work for my acne but as of right now i still havent found that amazing product</li>
            <li> I have used glycolic peels in the past and have used up to a 50% strength with no problems.  I accidentally ordered the salicylic 20% peel by accident (I thought I was ordering the glycolic) and was disappointed at my mistake when I received the product.  After reading other reviews and how mild the product was I decided to use the product anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIG MISTAKE!  I used the treatment on my chin/cheek area.  I don&#x27;t think I left the product on for more then 30 seconds.  As soon as I put it on, my face was on fire.  When I looked in the mirror I had several white patches on my face.  I washed the peel off and still had the white patches.  When I woke up the next morning, I had thick brown scabs all over my face.  The biggest scab was on my chin and was about the size of a silver dollar.  My skin felt so dry and it was painful to talk or make expressions.  I practically hid for a week and was so thankful my boyfriend was out of town that week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I will never use this product again.  Please beware of this product - it is not as gentle as everyone states and I do not have sensitive skin as I&#x27;d never had a problem with any glycolic peels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks now, and I definitely notice improvement in my skin. My skin is not breaking out terribly (there are still pimples, but there are less), the texture is smoother, and the large pores on my nose have shrunken!!  The first time I used this product, it did sting! However, I followed the directions and left it on for exactly 60 seconds.  FOLLOW DIRECTIONS WHEN USING THIS PRODUCT... If you leave it on for more than 60 seconds or you don&#x27;t fully wash off the peel, your face will become red and irritated.  I suggest testing on a small patch of your skin prior to testing your entire face.  On the second and third peels, I left it on for 60 seconds longer.  Work your way into this product, as it is very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Works well&lt;br /&gt;-Powerful&lt;br /&gt;-Pretty bottle :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Does not come with a fan brush&lt;br /&gt;-Can irritate skin if directions aren&#x27;t followed&lt;br /&gt;-Dangerous.  DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT NEAR YOUR EYES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL,&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this product is absolutely worth the $$.  I would suggest anyone suffering from acne to at least try it, but do so with caution (i.e: avoid eyes, avoid leaving it on for longer than directed).</li>
            <li> I tried using this because i was getting adult acne on my chin (large recurring zits right before my monthly cycle). All this product has done is severely dry out my skin rather than prevent or treat acne. If you&#x27;re looking for a way to get rid of premenstrual zits, What i&#x27;ve found to be more effective is to ice the zit immediately when you start to feel it forming under the surface. In addition to icing it, i also push the zit down while icing it, repeating that 3 times daily, but you have to start doing that before the zit has time to get bigger. I also put benzoyl peroxide spot cream on it. I&#x27;ve also noticed an improvement and less breakouts since i&#x27;ve been exercising 30 min a day several days a week, drinking more water and adding more raw fruits and vegetables to my diet, also taking low doses of vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) supplements which is supposed to help balance hormones during that time of the month.</li>
            <li> Not only did I receive this order SUPER quick, I was eager to use it because of ALL of the GREAT reviews AND I have been having flare ups on my forehead and chin for the last few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 30 year old woman and of COURSE during my pre-mensa My skin gets oilier, but I am SICK of breaking out.  I&#x27;ve used 2 courses of accutane and I STILL get breakouts!? wtf!? It&#x27;s RARE for me to get cystic acne but I do get MANY little clogged pores of both blackheads and whiteheads.  Although they are small, they are STILL noticeable. They also leave me with tiny brown scars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product the first time and left it on for one minute.  I didn&#x27;t feel much stinging EXCEPT where the creases are in my nose (beware for that area) -- washed it off after one minute and the next day my skin seemed a little better.  I decided I would try it AGAIN the VERY next day -- yes against the product directions, because I just didn&#x27;t feel as if the one minute was thorough enough.  This time I left it on for about 4-5 minutes.  It began to sting and I had to wash it off because on my cheeks I just couldn&#x27;t take anymore.  It stung for about 1 minute after I rinsed it.  I used Trader Joe&#x27;s coconut oil on spots that felt and looked dry after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The VERY next morning, my skin was NOTICEABLY better! Even my girlfriend said \\&quot;your skin is looking really clear, what have you been doing?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are still a COUPLE of tiny black heads on my forehead but they have decreased drastically, the skin on my cheeks looks a LOT smoother, its pretty fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use it again in a few days to see if it clears up the remaining blackheads on my forehead.  I feel hopeful and happy because this product works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING too, and I was about to pay a lot of $$ to get a professional facial or see a dermatologist for some kind of help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say TRY this product at $20 a pop -- it&#x27;s not a huge loss if it doesn&#x27;t give you the results you seek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am MORE than happy with the outcome.</li>
            <li> At 40 I started getting bad break-outs on my forehead (around the temples). Prescription products didnt control the problem. Peels at dermatologist&#x27;s office did. But they were $$$ and I had to get them twice a month. This product is working just like those peels. It did take about two weeks of twice-a-week use to totally clear up. Lately, I&#x27;ve been using it weekly and my skin remains clear.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this product, but since it was \\&quot;professional\\&quot; I thought I&#x27;d give it a try! I left the watery solution on for 1.5 minutes and there was a whitehead forming on my nose and holy shiz. I woke up the next morning and it was gone. Just a small red bump of what it was! So far so good :)&lt;br /&gt;I also am a long time acne medication user. I have used Accutane whilst in high school and my acne (not as bad as it was) is still here and a bother. My skin is reacting very well to this medication. If you have some spare cash then definitely try this :)</li>
            <li> Ive had acne for over 5 years. Ive been to a dermatologist who gave me around 5 different creams to use which never worked, ive been put on a pill (I forget its name) which worked for 6 months then i broke out horribly, only to be put on accutane which did wortk, until 6 months after i was off it. During this time i had gotten around 3 chemical peels through my dermatologist, which really didnt seem to do much for me. But after seeing these reviews and realizing that no topical creams or washes were going to work i tried this.&lt;br /&gt;I get nasty cystic acne, and a lot that are under the skin and i cant do anything about. My face is always oily and feels hot. BUT NOW.&lt;br /&gt;My acne&#x27;s almost gone!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2-3 weeks, using it  every week as a full peel, but in between peels i use it as a miracle spot treatment and to get rid of a gnarly sunspot i have. I&#x27;m actually comfortable to go outside without any makeup now I LOVE THIS STUFF.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it help with acne, but also with my whole complexion.&lt;br /&gt;and the pain is bearable, i leave mine on for about 5 mins, and wash off with water. Yes, it does sting, but its worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Ive gotton a peel done for $50 at a place, SO not worth it after buying this!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really burns. I don&#x27;t like using it. dries out your skin and the bottle will out last the expiration date on it. Think I got an older one.</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered 40% strength not two bottles of 20%. I didn&#x27;t like that. I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> good stuff but be careful not to burn your skin</li>
            <li> Works well if you know how to do it. But it is not for everyone.Do not use if you are allergic to aspirin or have a darker skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT NEUTRALIZE WITH BAKING SODA!&lt;br /&gt;Salicylic acid is self-neutralizing and thus neutralizing it with a baking soda and water solution will do more harm than good. Simply run your face under cold water for 60-90 seconds after you are done and follow with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> has a tendency to bring stuff to surface</li>
            <li> I have fair, sensitive skin and this product has done nothing. In reviews people spoke of heavy peeling and nice skin tone after a while. I got 0 peeling and no change in skin. I left the product on for 10 mins, felt a little stinging and had a little redness using it but after about an hour the redness would fade.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this stuff out. Had one spot on my foot, and this cleared it up. It worked very quickly(a week or so), and should work great for anyone with any rough skin/callus/wart type issues.</li>
            <li> Ive used this twice a day, faithfully. I&#x27;ve had it maybe 3 weeks now so I really can&#x27;t give it 5 stars as of yet. I see on my skin, as far as the sun spots go, just a little bit of improvement.  Not much yet though. Oh, how I want this to work on me! I&#x27;ve heard very good things of this product. The cost certainly is a great value. When it has done what it says it is supposed to, I WILL be singing its praises! I will be excited to write a review that would be worth 10 stars to me. I&#x27;ve even taken the \\&quot;before\\&quot; pictures. Then I&#x27;ll do the \\&quot;during\\&quot; and hopefully the final \\&quot;after\\&quot; pictures.  Wish me Luck, Guys! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars for the formula but I only gave it 4 because this really should be a medical grade product to be applied by a professional. For those with sensitive skin, it will make you feel like your skin is on fire!!&lt;br /&gt;Even when you wash it off, the stinging lingers. Be cautions and extremely careful if you choose to use this product.</li>
            <li> I love this peel! I&#x27;m a peel novice, so I&#x27;ve never used one before. After a horrible breakout in September due to hormonal imbalances--my entire face was covered, I decided to give this a try. Years of Accutane and prescription medication obviously did nothing, so what&#x27;s one more try? For the first two weeks, I wasn&#x27;t really hopeful. It seemed to be working better as a spot treatment than an overall mask. I wasn&#x27;t peeling, and my acne wasn&#x27;t going anywhere. Also, it never \\&quot;burned\\&quot; my skin. It just made me itch a lot. Then I decided to up the time I had it on from 3 minutes to 5, and it worked! I finally peeled, and with that, my acne subsided. I currently only have 3-5 pimples on my face, all of which I&#x27;m confident will disappear in the next week or so. I can&#x27;t believe that this little bottle is all it took to help my acne. I wasted so much money going to the dermatologist over the last few years. This amazing!</li>
            <li> Okay so I&#x27;ve only used this product for two days and I will come back in a month when I feel I can update (with pictures). I have had acne since I was about 8. It died down a lot now that I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s but my main problem is every pore on my face is big and clogged. Not only that I have what I call \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; on my chest and inbetween the girls, it is flesh colored raised bumps which I&#x27;m guessing is also clogged pores as well. I waited 48 hours to do my face because I did just get a waxing done but I tried it out on my chest. There were no visible improvements the same day (obviously) but the next I noticed the bumps had gone down just a bit in size. Also i had small stinging in certain spots nothing that I really noticed because that skin is way different from my face so I could leave it on the full 8 minutes. In the instructions it says that chemical peels will give you cold sores if you are prone to them, I thought well it&#x27;s not on my face so I didn&#x27;t have to worry, wrong. I woke up the next day and had one in the corner of my mouth (ouch). So BE AWARE that you will get one if you are prone to them or carry the virus (not the std kind). Second day I did my face, I lasted about 5 minutes and it started burning but not too bad so I rinsed, WORST PART. I felt like the water activated it and my whole face burned so bad, but as I have read other reviews it does go away in about a minute so keep splashing water on your face till it does.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good. Will update again in 30 days.</li>
            <li> 2 stars is more than generous.  This has propylene glycol.  Also, the price is half what I paid just over 1 month ago.  Sadly, by the time I noticed, it&#x27;s too late to return it.  Now I have a full bottle of useless product and I&#x27;m out $30. Sellers, list this poison because many of us are avoiding it!</li>
            <li> I get really bad flare-ups from rosacea that only seem to get worse as I get older. This peel helps to keep them under control. I’ve experimented with just about everything over the past 15 years and this has been really helpful. It’s a trade-off though since even though it brings down my flare-ups, the skin shedding can be embarrassing. I’m always checking the mirror to see how much dead skin is visible and trying to find ways to remove it without prematurely peeling off the skin that’s not ready to come off yet. I have very fair skin but find this to be very tolerable, perhaps because my face has “hardened” from of all the harsh things I’ve tried for acne and rosacea throughout my life. Given its price, it’s certainly worth a shot for those who have tried everything else without success.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t include the right directions to remove it. You must have Sodium bicarbonate to clean your face after applying it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t quite know what to expect when I bought this. After reading instructions I gave it a shot, it burns somewhat but no worse then putting a liquid bandaid on. After three days or so I noticed the top layer of my skin was starting to peel. Week and a half of using it every other day and my skin has peeled twice and returned to normal.       I can tell the difference, like one reviewer noted yes it doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of a scar but it did what it was supposed to, blend it in a lot better. Newer scars are completely gone, older one faded just a bit. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I never had much acne growing up, but it would seem that each little pimple left a mark on my face. Most of the people I know kept telling me that the scars were \\&quot;barely\\&quot; noticeable. Still, noticeable enough for me. So I went through a laser treatment and I noticed an improvement of 30% to 50%. I wasn&#x27;t impressed: scars were there still.    So I did a bit of research and bought this product. I was reluctant to use since my skin is very fair and sensitive. To my surprise, I was able to handle it very well: ten minutes, twice a day. After nearly a month of use, I can say that many small scars have disappeared and the big ones look flatter and softer. I will keep using this product for sure!    Note: Don&#x27;t expect results overnight, you have to be very constant and wait at least 3 weeks or so to see how it works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and had no problem tolerating the product, but I didn&#x27;t see any difference with my acne.  My pores may be smaller now, but it&#x27;s hard to tell.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from pretty severe acne problems for about four or five years now, and my face hasn&#x27;t been free of a breakout since before my teens. I also have pretty oily skin, resulting in blackheads and large pores across my \\&quot;T zone\\&quot; area. I&#x27;ve been to multiple dermatologists to try and solve my problems but with my insurance the most they&#x27;ll give me are antibiotics that only upset my stomach. I was weary of purchasing this, but I knew that salicylic acid was in a lot of drug store acne treatments and the company advertises this as a \\&quot;level 1\\&quot; peel, meaning the least irritating. I figured this peel was a good place to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it I was using the peel once a week for fear my skin was going to fall off. I was seeing some results in my acne, but nothing to really say it was a great product. I took a break from using it and when my acne was starting to get really bad again I decided to give it another round, but this time using it once every four days. Once I was doing it more often, I was seeing more improvement in my skin. Does that mean using it once a week won&#x27;t give you great results? No, probably not. I just saw them faster using it more often, and who doesn&#x27;t like that? Their website states that you can use it as often as every 2-3 days. I&#x27;d say how often you use it really depends on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my results, again, they have been great. For literally a year and a half I had this stubborn pimple on my left cheek that just would not go away. After using this for a few weeks I noticed that the pimple had turned into a white head. Needless to say, the stuff that came out of it was disgusting, but it went away! I also have gotten completely unsolicited comments from my friends and family (Some of whom I hadn&#x27;t told about the peel) saying how good my skin has been looking, so I know it isn&#x27;t all just wishful thinking on my part! Unfortunately, I dropped the bottle while doing one of my peels, so I can&#x27;t say what consistent results past two months really looks like. I have seen the most improvements in my acne, but not so much with any large pores or scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tips to anyone using this would be...&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t use it right after you get out of the shower. Your skin will be far more sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;2. Purchase a neutralizer with this. A lot of water will do the job to get it off, but strong acids like this will be better neutralized by something specifically designed to do so. (This has a pH of 2.3)&lt;br /&gt;3. Use a cotton or gauze pad to apply it. I tried using a fan brush as suggested and I found it wasn&#x27;t a very controlled application-not something you want when dealing with acid.&lt;br /&gt;4. Buy an SPF moisturizer. My skin got extremely dry between applications. You&#x27;ll be very uncomfortable without some on hand. (I recommend the Neutrogena brand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this simply because I&#x27;m looking for something stronger for my acne. If you only have slight acne or the occasional breakout this strength should work beautifully. For my skin I&#x27;m going to try the BHA+ chemical peel next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really thought of myself as having sensitive skin, but this peel HURT. The burning was tough to handle, so I would only leave it on for about 2 minutes each time. (The directions say to start off with 1 minute at a time so it&#x27;s not like I put on an inadequate amount.)&lt;br /&gt; I used this product for 5 weeks, once a week, and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin. Perhaps the people giving this 5 stars are putting it on more frequently and for longer, but they have extraordinary tolerance (or fried facial nerves.)  I have now stopped using the peel, and there hasn&#x27;t been any change. What a flop.</li>
            <li> I have some acne scars and sometimes breakouts.  I have used Salicylic Acid peels in the past with great success.  After the first two times using this product there is a very big difference in the appearance of my face.  I caution everyone because this product should be used EXACTLY as directed, and everyone should try a test spot first.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so a great success for one person may not mean everyone will benefit from this peel.  My face is somewhat resistant to Salicylic Acid because of regular extra strength face washes and creams every day for the past 10 years so I don&#x27;t turn very red at all when using this mask, and I really don&#x27;t feel irritation on my face; however, I decided the second time that I used the product to do my upper neck (under my chin) and that area of skin turned bright red for about a day.  After using this product it is important to use some type of non-comedogenic moisturizer with an SPF of 30.  I can&#x27;t stress that enough.  My experience with most peels, especially salicylic acid, is that it is VERY easy to get sunburn after use even during the winter months.  The moisturizer with SPF 30 is worth using even if you don&#x27;t think that it is needed.  It is very unpleasant to get sunburn/extra irritation to a recently treated area of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This peel can also be used for reasons other than your face, but you should avoid using it in large quantities, over large areas of skin, or too frequently.  In the past I had noticed headaches and upset stomachs when I used too much salicylic acid.  If you&#x27;re unsure about the peel or if you become overly sensitive to the peel it may be best to talk with a dermatologist, but the most important thing is to follow the instructions EXACTLY.  Also, use a face peel brush to apply and not your hands.  It is important to have control over where the gel is applied, and letting using your hands will likely lead to skin irritation and drying on your hands.  Face peel brushes are pretty cheap and they are fan brushes so it is easy to control the application and get the peel on evenly and fast to avoid an uneven result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I feel this is an AMAZING product that is very cost effective.  When I don&#x27;t use the peels I use face washes and lotions to prevent breakouts and reduce scars, but the face washes and lotions easily cost me over $80 per month.  I still have to use moisturizing lotions and other products each month, but when I use this peel I am only spending about $10 per month for face wash and lotion, and I have found that this size bottle of peel is good for a few months.  I think this is a great buy.ty cheap and they are fan brushes so it is easy to control the application and get the peel on evenly and fast to avoid an uneven result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I feel this is an AMAZING product that is very cost effective.

            <li> This product is really great.&lt;br /&gt;But BE CAREFUL&lt;br /&gt;I have been consistently using once a week for about two months now and I still don&#x27;t use it past a minute and 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Rinse with A LOT OF WATER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin definitely looks way brighter and clearer with this though :)</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it would. Definitely would recommend this product to friends. Took about 2 weeks for my skin to clear up completely</li>
            <li> These product didn&#x27;t work I have applied it to my face as indicated and I haven&#x27;t get any peel off</li>
            <li> If you are like me, you have struggled with acne from the time you were a tween and well into your 20s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had acne since I was about 13 and have tried literally everything under the sun. I mean EVERYTHING. As a teen I went to our family physician and was given topicals. I have also tried every brand of acne abrasive soap, gentle soap, scrub, toners, lifters, tighteners, clay masks, rubbery peel masks, over the counter pills...ect. I even tried doing nothing to my skin for an entire summer. No makeup, no special soap, just bare natural. You get the idea. I tried everything. Nothing worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had all of given up at ever having clear skin at the ripe ol&#x27; age of 25. On a whim I decided to give it one more go. I hopped on Amazon and started looking for products that focused on evening skin tone rather than getting rid of acne (I was more or less convinced that I will simply never get rid of my acne). In my search I stumbled across acid peels. I was very skeptical about using something so drastic and abrasive, but the customer reviews were raving about the product, so I decided to do a bit of research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a bit pricy for purchasing on a whim, but I was desperate. Besides, I have spent 100s of dollars over the years on products that didn&#x27;t work, so what is another $18? Right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very glad that I took that fateful chance. Using this product is still a love/hate relationship, but for the most part it is love. My skin is much more even toned since using it and it looks much more fresh and youthful. It is also the ONLY thing that will clear up my face with record speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the hate part - When using this product be mindful that your skin is going to look horrible for about a week after using it. I mean horrible! It dries everything out and you will have very dry, flaky, gross skin that will make you want to hide in your house for 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To combat the effects, I have a few pointers. Lotion, firming masks, rubbery peel masks, hot showers followed by rubbing the dead skin on your face, immediately followed by lotion. Oh, and liquid make up. Powders will just magnify the dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, once all of the dead skin is gone, you&#x27;ll love how fresh and beautiful your skin looks. It is worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Burned my skin and aggravated my acne</li>
            <li> I been using this product for a few weeks, now. Let me start by saying the first time I tried it, I didn&#x27;t apply it \\&quot;right\\&quot; (LOL). I was scared that I was going to damage my face or something...since it is acid you&#x27;re using. Anyway, the first time I applied it, I applied very little and barely rubbed my face with a cotton-pad, so honestly I didn&#x27;t see much results in those few days. The only thing I experienced was a little bit of stingy...so after seeing my face didn&#x27;t burn off or anything like that, I did it again the third day (applying 2.5 ml, and rubbing my face according to the directions with the cotton pad). The bad thing was my face was a little irritated (since I did it twice the same week)but that was it. By the fifth day, I saw positive results. So, for the NEGATIVE reviews that I read before trying it; maybe you didn&#x27;t apply it the correct way to your face or read the directions thoroughly. Well anyway, I use this product once a week and my face does not get irritated (unlike the first week).   I am mixed with black, white, and Austrian, and I have oily skin.  I always had pimples since 8th grade, and it got worse after my first pregnancy. I tried every kind of cleanser you can name...Neutrogena, Biore, ProActive, spa treatments...spa treatments every month did me good BUT it is a bit pricey. After using the Salicylic Acid (20%) for 3 weeks now, it cleared my mild pimples off my forehead, and my huge pores had tightened up. Now that it is the third week, most of my huge pores that I got before has either shrunk, or disappeared. The first day I started this product, I had a very large pimple on my cheek...and by the second week, &#x27;that pimple&#x27; shrunk, the third week (today) NOTHING is there (that pimple is GONE; not a scar, not a spot, no blemish, NOTHING). I also noticed other large pores shrinking into small pores, AND my small pores disappearing. My face is a lot smoother and glowing. If I could put pictures up from before and after, I would :)  The reason I give this product 5 stars is because it is the only product that gave me the best results within a week, AND I had/have no breakouts (what so ever) since I started using this product.  It will take time and patience for some of you who has the worse break-outs, or bad acne. However, depending on your skin type...either you will see immediate results or it may take a couple weeks or so to see \\&quot;The Happening.\\&quot;  My advice to a beginner (like myself) is to FOLLOW the directions. The first day you try it for the first time, try focusing on that one pimple on your face (day-by-day for 5 days)...take a picture daily if you need too. That is how I was able to notice \\&quot;It Works!\\&quot; You will see the changes like I did and by the way, IM LOVIN IT!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and I just had to get it. I went to Dermatology Consultants here in Atlanta and they charged me about 100 bucks for a peel and eventually they charged me less because the ladies there loved me. Two of them were really cute. Anyway this product is working. I probably threw away about 400 dollars getting beta peels and chemical peels. Then i wondered if I could get those kind of results for less and bam, I found this product by Skin Laboratory. I didn&#x27;t even know you could use it twice a week and I will start doing so. For all of those that are skeptical.....DON&#x27;T BE. give this product a shot because you will no be disappointed. And for those wondering if it works on African American, well it does cause I&#x27;m am. My skin complexion is lighter than milk chocolate. Anyway hope this review helped. And don&#x27;t be shy, go ahead and order this product because you can&#x27;t afford not to be good looking.</li>
            <li> 11/03/2011 As of today I have around a week and a half using the product and besides been excited from the prior reviews I am in love with it and the reaction of my face. I&#x27;ve been using it every other day or leaving 2 days apart and it works! My scars from years from the acne are lighter and I see my pores in a better shape and in general my face has been behaving like never. I will keep posting as I advance on it.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me.  I tried it exactly how instructions showed and even though it  made me break out more i stuck with it for months, in the end it just did not work.  I had tons of little pimples all over my face worse than before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from breakouts ever scince I turned 30+.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from Pro-Active to expensive products like Obagi. They seem to work at first but then the black/white heads come back: SO ANNOYING! However, I&#x27;ve notice that as long as I get regular facials with someone who is Good with extractions and follow up with a light peel, my skin clears up. But Today, not many of us can afford peels at $85-$150 a pop!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so Glad/Happy I found this product online. I am so naive and had NO Idea I can buy these peels online without a license, especially at these price (duh). Now I feel like I got rip off all these years by paying a professional to do something as simple as a Light Peel.  It is important to know how your skin will react to a peel!!! I&#x27;ve many over the past few years, so I know! For someone who has Never had one, I would highly recomend going to a professional to see what % they&#x27;d use on you and then you&#x27;ll have a better idea on which one to order and what to expect.  I am 40 years old, I guess it is fair to say I have \\&quot;thicker\\&quot; skin and takes 20% peel with out any problems. This does NOT mean every 40 year old Skin will have the same reaction! Some people have \\&quot;thiner\\&quot; skin layers and 20% may be too strong, especially if this is your First. Everyone is different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve tried 20%, I will move up to 35% maybe I&#x27;ll even go up to 50%. The 20% helped me with the black heads: they fell right off! Love it! This one is good for every 10-15 days treatment but b/c of my age, I&#x27;ll need something stronger for the fine lines on my forehead. Warning to you virgins: THIS WILL STING/BURN AT FIRST! HAVE A FAN CLOSE BY AND WATCH YOUR SKIN TO BE SURE IS NOT ACTUALLY BURNING. SERIOUSLY, I&#x27;D NOT DARE TO DO THIS IF I DIDN&#x27;T HAVE DONE SO MANY OF THEM OVER THE YEARS, DONE BY PROFESSIONAL. GOOD LUCK!!!!</li>
            <li> Wow am I happy that I bought this!  I was having acne issues along with chapped cheeks and dry itchy skin from the harsh winter winds at my high-altitude (endlessly winter seeming) college.  I started using this as a mini-peel 2 days a week leaving only until it starts to tingle only slightly.  Lathering on tons of moisturizer afterwards is the most rewarding part, your face feels incredibly baby-soft and smooth! I won&#x27;t ever probably leave on long at all but I definitely notice the effects.  The first time I looked in the mirror after a treatment I was literally shocked because my pores were so smooth they were practically invisible! Not to mention my acne has cleared up entirely and my complexion is again glowing (think - post salty sunny beach trip shower:)&lt;br /&gt;Not only will I be purchasing this, I&#x27;ll probably experiment with their other varieties of peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;To make application easier, try using a foundation brush to apply the gel, and rinse from brush immediately after application.&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well on my skin.  I am african american and I get dark spots very easily.  This peel is very much professional grade and burns like .... well you know.  I&#x27;ve had a chemical peel at a spa and this peel burned much....MUCH more than those but it is also more powerful.  When I use it I do not see immediate results but it is WORKING, believe me.  The next day I get dark spots that are as big as a quarter and it resembles a chemical burn but then it begins to peel.  I help my skin heal by using hydrocortisone cream 2-3 times a day and this helps the skin peel itself to reveal your new, baby-soft skin underneath.  Be sure to do it well in advance of a big day.</li>
            <li> This is an effective product. If you know your skin&#x27;s trends, you should apply this following the directions on the insert before you usually have breakouts as well as any time you have a breakout because this treats mine. First bottle is almost done and lasted a few months; WILL order a second soon. Only downside is this sucker STINGS! So have something to do to distract yourself for a few minutes. It also stings pretty bad whenever I wash it off with water; I don&#x27;t stop rinsing until all the stinging goes away. For some reason, the first few times I used this product it didn&#x27;t sting as bad, but maybe that&#x27;s because when you have a breakout it stings more or maybe even with your skin during different seasons... DOES work as advertised though! Would recommend because let&#x27;s face it, if you&#x27;re interested in a product like this, you will do anything to get rid of acne, including taking on some facial stinging ;)</li>
            <li> I just received this product yesterday, and I immediately did the patch test. Much to my relief, the product did not burn like I expected it to. This morning the area wasn&#x27;t in the least bit red or dry, so I decided it was okay to use on my face. When applying, it feels warm immediately. For me, it tingled about 30 seconds in, and then by a minute it was a warm stinging. Unpleasant, but nowhere near intolerable. I left it on for three minutes and it didn&#x27;t sting any worse than the one minute mark. However, when I went to rinse, the second my skin made contact with water it burned a surprising amount. Luckily, I read around a lot before purchasing, so I had a mixture of baking soda and water ready. I splashed that over my face and the burn stopped immediately, along with the initial sting. (You can purchase the neutralizer it suggests, but why spend the 20 bucks (S&amp;H) when baking soda works just as well?) I rinsed for a minute or two, making sure to be 100% thorough, then followed the directions by patting dry with a cotton pad and applying Cetaphil. Now I&#x27;ve applied the moisturizer about three times in the six or so hours since using, but my face isn&#x27;t flaky or red whatsoever. If anything, it already looks better! I&#x27;m excited to see the long term effects of this product and as of right now, I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/18/13: I&#x27;ve now used this product three times, once a week since I got it. So far the burning has increased with each application, but I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s because my skin isn&#x27;t as tough as it was the first time. It&#x27;s still not an intolerable burn though, as long as you use the baking soda and keep up on applying the cetaphil whenever your face feels even a little bit dry the day you use the peel. My skin isn&#x27;t perfect, but I&#x27;ve only done three applications - it does look noticeably better, so I&#x27;m standing by my initial review.</li>
            <li> This acid doesn&#x27;t dry up after two weeks in the container and is strong enough to kill skin abberations. It kills worts and skin tags.</li>
            <li> We use this as a spot treatment on acne spots before we go to bed.  I have tried it on blackheads, whiteheads, and those deep painful cystic feeling nodules...it works particularly well for the whitehead and cystic types (especially the swelling).  Sometimes it also helps to cover them with a spot bandaid after the gel has been applied.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on the same spot more than a few nights in a row otherwise it can dry out the skin too much and cause it to...well, peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other acne products, it does not discolor your sheets!</li>
            <li> Initially it did little. After a while I broke out. Then, after a few weeks of use once a week or so, after the many layers of my cruddy skin had broken down--I was cured! Clearer and smoother than ever. Very few deep blackheads now. Its not perfect but it&#x27;s worked well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months and find it to be ok on melasma and sun spots, but surprisingly good on my rosacea.  I was diagnosed with rosacea 8 years ago and used Finacea for several years.  I developed melasma about 5 years ago and tried TriLuma cream for a year or so, but it never did much for me.  I stopped going to the dermatologist a few years ago and have been trying to treat my skin problems on my own.  I bought this product hoping that it would help fade my sun spots and melasma, which is mainly on my forehead and under my eyes.  I used to have rosacea outbreaks at least a few times a week, which consisted mainly of redness and flushing.  I had persistent redness and splotchiness on my cheeks and one red spot from rosacea on my nose that the dermatologist told me was permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few times I used this peel I was only able to tolerate it for a minute total.  I&#x27;d start on my forehead and do my cheeks last.  It burned so badly that my eyes teared up, and after I washed my face, my skin was left very flushed.  But by the next day my skin was back to normal.  I used this once a week for a few weeks and noticed that my rosacea outbreaks stopped completely.  Even using Finacea twice a day I&#x27;d have flare ups occasionally, was very surprised that it stopped entirely with this peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this peel once a week for about six weeks, then cut back and only applied it every few weeks.  I started getting rosacea flare ups a month ago and realized that I hadn&#x27;t used this peel for several weeks, so I started up again and the flare ups stopped.  I put it on my forehead first, then wait 2-3 minutes to apply to the rest of my face.  I can tolerate it for 2-3 minutes now on my cheeks, and have no redness afterward.  It has faded the darkness on my forehead and the splotchiness on my cheeks, but very slowly.  I didn&#x27;t notice any fading at all until very recently.  I look in the mirror now and often don&#x27;t see any of my horrible rosacea splotchiness at all.  Maybe a more aggressive dermatologist would have done some sort of treatments to fade my redness, but my doctor was very nonchalant about my skin, told me that I was basically stuck with the redness.  I used a green tinted powder to tone down the redness, but thought that I was going to have to live with it the rest of my life.  This peel has done more for my rosacea than Finacea, TriLuma cream and all those trips to the dermatologist.  My bottle is almost empty and I will definitely buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive to sunscreen, and it&#x27;s important to apply sunscreen after using this peel.  Neutragena and Aveeno can burn my skin, so I normally use Vanicream sunscreen after this peel.  It can be heavy otherwise, but my skin is dry after the peel and the Vanicream works well for me.</li>
            <li> Had a few small round brown spots on my face. One of those things that happens when you get old. I put a small spot of this stuff on each one and it burns. Washed this off after about ten minutes. Tried this three times so far, it looks like it will take a week or two but will work.</li>
            <li> Received item promptly, good quality thank you!</li>
            <li> Perfect and exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and it did nothing.</li>
            <li> you serivce excellent</li>
            <li> So, It&#x27;s been about a month I&#x27;ve been using this product and I haven&#x27;t noticed any noticeable results in fact last week I left it for around 5 minutes on my face and my hyper pigmentation turned darker. So frustrated right now.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product, I read the reviews and the impression I got was that it was really good but can be risky due to its potency. And, that I had to give it time for it to work its magic. Well it&#x27;s been about 3-4 weeks now and I was using it once a week on my face. I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and have had acne since my teen years. I&#x27;ve tried other products out there including biocutis, which doesn&#x27;t do anything, and Proactiv Solution, which actually works but it leaves my skin very oily/greasy. I&#x27;ve also tried blue light therapy, which is costly and results are not permanent. This salicylic acid product stings and itches my skin when I apply it on with a cotton pad. I leave it on for 8 minutes (per the instructions), and rinse it with cold water. The itchiness doesn&#x27;t go away when I rinse it off but it&#x27;s less severe. Throughout the week, I made sure I follow the instructions and it appears that my skin is improving. I have some acne scars so my skin is uneven, and the product seems to work like a sand paper because my skin appears to be resurfaced. I do notice a bit of improvement after 3 applications (once per 5 days) and am actually hopeful about this product. Will have to see later down the road if it will cause a significant change or not.</li>
            <li> I would give this five, except it did not meet my (perhaps wild) expectations. I expected this to remove my scars, instead it madde my skin look super-clean. I still would reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. Beats proactiv for sure.    This s*** is NOT snake oil. It works because it gets inbetween the dead skin cells and burns off the superficial layer of skin. How long you leave it on depends on your skin type. It can leave your skin reddish and sensitive but you can see immediate results. In my own experience i recommend applying some castor oil after to leave your skin soft and help neutralize the acid.    So far its the best thing i&#x27;ve tried for acne, so much so that i&#x27;ve pretty much stopped using anything else.</li>
            <li> i give this five stars because it kept my face clear when i have hormonal breakouts.... it stung a little and i peeled for  a couple of days but overall it is great for ance scars toooooo!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing results - I am going to try the 30% next.  Nuetralize when rinsing off with baking soda, helps with the sting.  Also applied to my feet for &amp;#34;baby feet&amp;#34; - the dead skin just falls off!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with some excema on my face. I tried Glycolic acid for months and wasn&#x27;t impressed. I switched to Salicylic acid 20% and it makes a big difference. I only do it once a week for about 4 minutes, but it has helped after 3 weeks with excema and dry patches. Skin is softer, younger looking and I am starting to see &amp;#34;the glow&amp;#34; of youth return (I&#x27;m 35). The acid does sting and burn like crazy and seems to get worse when you first start washing it off. COPIOUS amounts of COLD water are needed. Then I follow with a good moisturizer like Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Beauty Facial Cream or Curel&#x27;s Ultra Healing (both are great on sensitive skin and even open skin). Get a soft fan-shaped brush and dedicate a small glass custard bowl to your acid treatment. You can&#x27;t beat the price and convenience of doing it t home.</li>
            <li> Started off using this once a week and then up it to once a day for a week and saw amazing results! I am a red head with medium to fair skin. Highly recommended. I am able to use it for 4-5min every day without peeling/frosting.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life. I used it as directed and am so impressed. 6 weeks of using this product and my face has become beautiful again. My cystic acne is gone. My mother and friend have bought this product and are seeing the positive change in their skin too! I recomend this product to anyone that has struggled with acne and is ready to give up, try this and see how wonderful you face can look. Not only has it removed my acne but scars now are starting to fade. I saw reslults after the first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product one star because after two uses my face was covered with small zits.  I&#x27;ve never had that happen.  I usually just deal with a few large zits that drive me crazy.  I bought this based on the reviews, hoping that it would work.  I am bummed that it didn&#x27;t.  After three uses at once a week for less than two minutes on my face due to a burning feeling, I&#x27;m tossing it.  It may work for some people, but just didn&#x27;t for me.  I have combination skin, and it has been impossible for me to find a good product.  Going to step away from chemicals now and try all natural.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I have &amp;#34;adult acne&amp;#34;. My chin has blackheads &amp; these hard bumps with a deep rooted &amp;#34;bulb&amp;#34; on the inside. My nose has blackheads and my forehead blakheads too. Since I have been using this product, my forehead is clear!!! My nose is less populated and my chins is clearer. I only use the peel 1-2 times per week (I started at 1 min, then 3 min then 7-8 mins). I don&#x27;t use sunscreen because it makes my face oily, so I am careful with how often I use this product. I only use at night before I go to bed. I plan to use it more often, but things are going great. This is the ONLY product so far that has worked for me. I always use a moisterizer after and use a moisterizer mask 1-2 times per week overnight as well. My skin looks great. I may try the next level up if I can&#x27;t get rid of the rest of the junk on my chin &amp; nose after increasing my usage. Anyhow, its really does work.</li>
            <li> If you do it at a spa it costs a lot of money, you do it at home you save a lot of money and pretty much the same results. I&#x27;ll choose option number two. I do it myself and I like this brand.</li>
            <li> I happened to have a fan brush with which to apply this, and wish that it came in a different type of dispenser as it is awkward to pour it onto the brush without spilling.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd bottle of the 20% gel peel and I think it works great.  Be careful if you have sensitive skin because this does sting a bit and will cause your face to peel and flake if you use too much too often.  I don&#x27;t use it on my whole face very often; I like to use it as a spot treatment.  I put some on the end of a cotton swab, dab it on the blemish and leave it there.  It will neutralize after several minutes and doesn&#x27;t sting as much as the whole face so I don&#x27;t wash it off.  It is drying so I don&#x27;t do it all the time, just when a large blemish appears.  I also use this on my back and shoulders when those break out as well.</li>
            <li> I have occasional acne and I also wanted to improve the texture of my skin. It didn&#x27;t help with the acne, but it did help a little with the acne scarring (in combination with Mederma Scar Gel). It also improved the texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions, starting with 1-minute application and increasing the time up to 5-6 minutes. I didn&#x27;t have any problems, no frosting, no redness, no irritation at all. The bottle is small but the product applies easily and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be able to get much more than the 15 applications the manufacturer promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t perform miracles but the results were good, and I was very pleased with this product; I recommend it.</li>
            <li> this has definitely helped improved the turnover of my skin. i have oily skin and so my skin cells do not shed as often as they should. using this once or twice a week has helped with that. its also great to put on a pimple that you see coming on. if you catch it early on and apply this to it the next two days after it will simply flake off instead of having to be popped (which nobody wants to do-gross, and which also causes dark spots, also unsightly).</li>
            <li> Works just like salon.  Strong.  If you follow directions, do patch test and watch time you will be pleased.  My skin looks great.  You use a very little of the liquid so this bottle will last a LONG time. May also want to investigate the at home micro-dermabrasion also.</li>
            <li> you can tell it&#x27;s working right away.  be carefuly with this and follow the directions.,  after one minute or less you can feel the burn so proceed with caution.  I have great results with this acid in other products but have never tried this strength until now.  I used a Q tip to apply it,  no special tool needed.</li>
            <li> I have spent several hundreds of dollars on professional peels, and I finally got sick of it. I will say that I&#x27;m glad I had a few professionally done first so I could get a feel for what was normal as far as redness and burning go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you have had several salicylic peels, this is probably too weak for you. That&#x27;s the mistake I made with this one (20% solution), but not knowing what concentration had been used on me, I figured better to go a little too weak than to risk a chemical burn. If you&#x27;re not sure which solution to use, always go with the weakest (and shortest time on your skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also agree with another user in regards to the number of &amp;#34;uses&amp;#34; in the bottle. It&#x27;s definitely way, way more than just 10 peels. This was a great deal.</li>
            <li> Instructions are so easy, and the product works in less than 8 minutes.  For any skin issue, removing a top layer, or exfoliating is generally the procedure.  This is soooo easy to use.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide if I should give this product one star or two stars, because each time I&#x27;ve used this, my skin has had such an odd and/or downright horrifying reaction that I think I&#x27;ll stop using it. The sad thing is, it seems to be working ... if ever so very slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First: I&#x27;m a dark-skinned African-American who&#x27;s suffered acne, acne scarring, and hyperpigmentation because of that scarring for years. I was looking for a product to erase some of that damage. This product burned my skin, which was expected. I didn&#x27;t expect it to turn my skin three shades lighter, to have it \\&quot;melt\\&quot; my skin, or to experience a horrific rash on my face. And that&#x27;s with just 1-1/2 minutes of leaving this on (I rarely go over that amount of time because of what&#x27;s happened when I do). Thankfully, the whitening, rash, and melting seemed to \\&quot;clear up\\&quot; and my skin seemed normal again after about one or two hours. But I seriously doubt I&#x27;ll continue to be that lucky, considering just how my skin has reacted every one of the four times I&#x27;ve used this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dark mask around my mouth is lightening up, but that could be in combination with other products I&#x27;ve been using on days I don&#x27;t use this. My skin does feel smoother ... which is probably the best I can say about this. I think I&#x27;ll be abandoning this \\&quot;entry-level\\&quot; chemical peel because I feel like I&#x27;ve dodged a bullet re more permanent skin damage. Besides, I&#x27;d like to not see my skin melting when I look in a mirror!!!</li>
            <li> As it is, this works but you have to have the other tools to use it properly. Also packaging is a little difficult to pour the liquid from. I ended up using an eye droppers to make sure I don&#x27;t waste any.</li>
            <li> The peeling is perfect. I like it. My skin is so much better. I will recomended to people with oily haut.</li>
            <li> This is the highest percentage I could find on amazon and boy can you feel it! I will try and break this up into different sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length of Time:I have used it twice, the first time the instructions said of 1 minute, and the 2nd time approx. 1.5 minutes on my face, and 2 minutes on my chest (bad acne scaring) and it worked even better! Though I wouldn&#x27;t go much above that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To wash it off: Now, if you don&#x27;t get this stuff off fast it will start to burn. I usually do it before I get in the shower. (apply with a small fan brush works best) So that I can wash it off fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results:  The first time I saw my face brighten and lighten up. The 2nd time, I literally could feel the blackheads above the normal level of skin, and even saw a few patches of darkening going away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I&#x27;m very happy with this product, doing more progress on clearing my skin more than over a thousand dollars of other products.</li>
            <li> Bought this peel to see if it would remove or reduce sun spots on my facial cheeks.  I have been using the OTC spot remover with some success but it takes continuous use of 30 or more days.  I&#x27;ve only used this item once so the jury is still out.  However, at the first try, I felt a burning sensation right after application.  I&#x27;d suggest following the guidelines as suggested in the directions:  not leave on for more than 8 minutes although I think that would be much too long a time.  I removed it within 1 minute of application which required lots of rinsing off with water and followed with a soothing face cream.</li>
            <li> This product works exactly how it says it will! If you have serious skin problems then you should not play with this stuff at home. If you just want to do some light peels or use it for spot acne treatment...then this is your product.  Note that it is a chemical and it can burn your skin if you are not careful or do not do your research before you use this product. I have had not issues with it but I can see where people could go wrong!</li>
            <li> I am a 21 year old female (using my boyfriends&#x27;s Amazon account, of course) with stress-induced acne and plugged pores on the nose and chin, as well as unevenness under nostrils and acne scarring on either side of my chin. I just got done using this peel, following top commenter Elane&#x27;s steps 1 - 8. I very highly recommend using her steps for the use of this product, as it will greatly help with the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before anything, I washed my face with a bar of witch hazel soap in the shower, then I poured a pot of boiling water into my bathroom sink and steamed my face for five minutes. I then applied a lavender witch hazel toner generously and waited for that to dry. Once the toner had absorbed, I took a cotton ball and quickly applied the salicylic acid (don&#x27;t get too close to the sensitive areas underneath your eyes!) and was able to leave it on for the maximum time of 8 minutes by sticking my head in the freezer...I wish I were kidding. This stuff is intense. Do be sure to rinse with cold water for a minute and then use a baking soda/water paste to VERY GENTLY wash your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it weren&#x27;t for the freezer and baking soda cheats, I&#x27;m not sure how I would have gotten through this treatment. Had I not resorted to sticking my head in the freezer, I would have only lasted about a minute. As I&#x27;m typing this comment, I have on a raw honey/coconut oil mask (1/2 teaspoon of each) which I plan to leave on for 30 minutes. After rinsing off, I plan to apply a mix of my usual moisturizers which include lavender oil, argan oil, and olive oil (one drop of each). I will continue using this treatment, and highly recommend it so far.</li>
            <li> Skin color: white (pale)&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: normal / combination&lt;br /&gt;Use: attempted to clear skin of acne &amp; acne scarring&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the reviews and figured I&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for 3 weeks before realizing that I shouldn&#x27;t really be putting myself through this. Basically, it burns my skin- I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin or anything. My face feels like it&#x27;s on fire from the moment I put it on. Once I wash it off, I see red angry splotches of what the hell did you just do all over my cheeks and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is after carefully following the instructions card.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see any results from the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve used it, but that could just mean I didn&#x27;t use it long enough.&lt;br /&gt;Oh- also, when it says peel- it means your face will peel. I had sunburn looking peelings on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope... Not for me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Very nice!</li>
            <li> Good product. I follow the instructions. I suffer from really bad acne, and have since 13 years old. I am a black male, very fair skinned/light skinned. This product definitely helps with the scaring. I have noticed that the scars and discoloration usually left over from acne are almost unnoticeable within a few days of a breakout and are completely gone about 2 weeks after that breakout. Im not really sure if its helped with how often I have breakouts. I dont use it very often, but would probably see great results if i used it weekly. I am happy with the purchase so far. I think it was great for me to start out with a small concentration. Once this is all gone, I will move up to a stronger concentration just to see how it works. Its definitely worth a try. Happy I tried this first instead of spending the money on a chemical peel at a doctors office. Cant afford that and dont see the purpose of going now that I have tried this out.</li>
            <li> Burns thes*** out of your face. Doesn&#x27;t really work as a peel. If you like pain and love looking red for a day then this is for you</li>
            <li> First let me say I just did my first peel about 20 minutes ago BUT as I was watching it in action, I could see really old \\&quot;stuck\\&quot; zits coming to the surface!!! yay!  I also want to say I will never use the fan brush again as it had a tendency to run no matter how many times I tapped it off.  Just use a cotton ball or round (much safer)  I left it on for approx 1.5 minutes as I couldn&#x27;t stop staring in the mirror lol It was so cool!  Also, I could see a patch of brown skin dissipating before my eyes. It isn&#x27;t totally gone, but well on it&#x27;s way to being zapped off my face forever.  I cannot wait for my next peel as it looks like the results are going to be stellar.  It didn&#x27;t burn too bad so no real problems there. I will update more later. Woohoo!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE...OK, I&#x27;m on my 3rd peel (left on for 10 minutes) and I simply cannot believe the difference in my skin!  Old scars \\&quot;scabbed\\&quot; a bit and I just left them alone to heal.  They are almost completely gone leaving my skin looking very smooth! I&#x27;ve had mild peeling.  Its a bit inconvenient to go out in public with flaky skin, so I take some CeraVe lotion on a damp washcloth and gently rub in a circular motion all over my face.  The peeling skin vanishes!  The peeling does come back so I leave it alone and just moisturize if I&#x27;m staying inside.  I&#x27;ve had no pain aside from the initial burn of the peel and my hyperpigmentation is almost a thing of the past!  Use a high SPF, moisturize with a very small amount of emu oil and you are on your way to looking 10 years younger (At least I am!!!)</li>
            <li> My skin did not do well with this.  I felt like my face was on fire.  So I waited it out and it didn&#x27;t get better.  And it hurt for a while even after I got it off.  I feel like it might work for some people but not for me.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product. I have very mild acne but lots of blackheads. I have been using this on and off for the past two years. At first, it stung so much but now, I can handle the max amount of time easily. One problem I have is blackheads on my body that I can never extract. I have had one for over a year and after using this twice in a week, I noticed after the second time that the blackhead seemed to be dried up. So, decided to take my chances with extraction again and was able to squeeze a bit out and use a pair of tweezers to pull the entire comodone out. Success!!</li>
            <li> It works and its not too harsh on my skin. I recommend for ladies of color.</li>
            <li> works great on acne, well, helps anyway. never had anything work so quickly/well. Egyptian goddess&#x27; bathed in sour goat milk to \\&quot;glow\\&quot;. a simple acid \\&quot;peel\\&quot;. Same idea here.</li>
            <li> This at home peel is truly amazing!!  I have suffered with acne for YEARS and years.  Roughly 2 years ago I slowly started to make the switch to natural cleansers and treatments.  Those worked great in clearing up my congested skin but it wasn&#x27;t until I added this peel 2x month that my skin became radiant!!  If I have a pimple coming on, this will either immediately reduce the size and redness or bring the infection right to the surface so that I may extract it.  Be warned, this peel burns like a mother, but is so worth it!</li>
            <li> I have many crater scars from 11+ years of acne. I&#x27;ve tried many products on the market for scar removal but always end up with disappointment. I read some really good reviews on this product and decided to give it a try. I figured, it&#x27;s $16, why not?! And my boyfriend has bad break outs occassionally so I figured if it doesn&#x27;t work on me, he can try it out and see if it works for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, it REALLY does hurt/ burn the first time. I have a high tolerance for pain but when I did this the first time, it definitely bothered me a lot. I was jumping around in the bathroom, fanning my face with my hands... just wanted to get it over with! It felt like it&#x27;s itching and tingling and burning. It was not a good feeling. But I feel like if it&#x27;s hurting so badly, it&#x27;s gotta be doing something good to the skin and it&#x27;s gotta be working! From past experience, when I have a growing pimple, and if the product I applied burns, the pimple usually disappears the next day...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For first time users, I&#x27;d recommend rinsing with a shower head in cold water. It&#x27;s very hard to rinse it off over the sink. Rinsing with a shower head is quicker, as well as calming down your skin faster so the burning sensation will go away faster too. It&#x27;s almost like a rinse off + light facial massage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple uses, I find my skin more firm and vibrant. The scars are visibly lighter and slowly fading away. My boyfriend has severe adult acne break outs and he loves this product too. It does wonders in clearing away break outs. But it does take time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I think this is money well spent. $16 is a worth try. You do have to prepare yourself for some pain... but you know what they say, \\&quot;beauty is pain!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (3/26/12): I&#x27;m still using this twice a week. It does wonders as a spot treatment. My boyfriend&#x27;s very imflamed pimples die down after the very next day of usage. My crater scars are much better and my skintone is brightened and air brushed. The overall pigmentation is just amazing. I received many compliments for my skin and I barely need any foundation coverage at all. And after a few usages, the \\&quot;discomfort\\&quot; of the peel doesn&#x27;t really bother me anymore. It&#x27;s actually quite bearable! A lot of people recommended a neutralizer to use after the peel, but I think, start off with the peel and see how your skin reacts to it first. We never bought the neutralizer and it works fine without it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with SkinLaboratories 35% Lactic Acid Peel and their 35% Glycolic Acid Peel. I have only used this one and the Glycolic acid peel thus far but let me tell you, do NOT let the percentages deceive as to how much of a wallop these products pack when it comes to the \\&quot;tingling sensation\\&quot;. I have had problem skin all my life (I am 21 now and started having acne at 8-so much fun) and as a result I have used my fair share of prescription grade and drug store grade products. That being said I am on week two of using these items and I am seeing quite a bit of progress. The first week I used this product once a day everyday for about a minute, yes it does burn but as soon as you wash it off you can visibly see where it is doing its magic. Furthermore in order to sooth my skin every night after doing this I would slather it in Jojoba Oil and really rub it in like a gentle massage. Yes, your face will be red after you use it but the redness does fade by the next morning. Your skin will feel tight and it will peel (literally) but it will not be painful it is comparable to just speeding up the rate at which dead skin sloughs off. For me the dry patches were my forehead, chin, and around my nose area-interestingly the oiliest parts of my face. Another thing, your skin WILL break out when you use this seems discouraging believe me I know however it takes about two weeks for your skin to purge itself when you start a skin regime that is as intense as this. I also use and ultrasonic cleansing tool on a daily basis and no my skin is not irritated or raw. I do not expect instant results simply because I have prior experience with multiple skin regimes however compared to the result times I have gotten used to (2-3) months this one is working out rather well. This week I have been using the Glycolic acid peel so I suppose I will leave feedback about that.</li>
            <li> This made my skin break out MORE. I have a pretty high pain tolerance, but this stuff was killer on my skin.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Had to return it. After only 30 seconds on my face, I knew it was a VERY strong acid. Rinsed it off and that made the burning worse. Looked like I had a severe sunburn for a week and the peeling (which I guess it&#x27;s supposed to do) was out of control. I recommend using only the 0.025% or 0.05% tretinoin gel to facilitate a gentler cell turn-over. It can be purchased real cheap on the web. DO NOT buy this product, it is not worth the chance of getting a chemical burn like so many reviewers have had! If you have acne, that is what a dermatologist is for (and they can give you Accutane, which despite the negative publicity is the one-and-only 100% miracle cure) The bottom line: Don&#x27;t play doctor at home!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had pretty good skin to start with but there were some things I wanted to improve. Not only did this product improve the items I wanted to address but it also had some other benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***The texture of the skin in my tear troughs under my eyes was crepe like and would make the concealer look \\&quot;cakey\\&quot;. The skin texture has been dramatically improved. The surprise is that my under eye circles almost invisible now. I don&#x27;t even need to put on concealer anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***When I smile I would get a bunch of wrinkles under my left eye. There was one deep wrinkle and the other finer wrinkles. Those fine wrinkles are gone and the deep wrinkle is much less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I had orange peel texture on my lower cheeks and around my mouth. Much of this is now gone. The deep texture on my left lower cheek is still there, but significantly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***The skin above my lips looks awesome. My hubby even said \\&quot;the skin around your mouth looks great\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now 6 days post peel and my skin is as soft, pink, moist and wrinkle free as a baby&#x27;s bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the first few days, my skin feels a little irritated and sensitive. It is not that bad and is quite normal with any chemical peels out there. But I can definitely notice it as well as a lot of other reviewers on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason is quite simple, you&#x27;re removing the outer skin layer so there is more exposure to the thin and sensitive skin underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To stop the sensitivity, I use [[ASIN:B004Z209HS Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil 4 fl. oz.]] and apply a small amount to it to help form a protecting, moisturizing and healing layer. It works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Susan</li>
            <li> I tried this product for four times. It really ruined my skin. This is the worst product i have ever bought. i hope my person experience can help you deeply think before you attempt to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from the Caribbean and have brown skin and have always struggled with hyper-pigmentation. I have read and done a lot of research on this product and thought I should give it a try. When i first started with this product, it burned like crazy. I mean it was truly unbearable but after that first application; a few days later, 3 days to be exact i noticed some peeling around my chin area. I was excited as i thought that It would peel the rest of the dead skin from my face. As i continued using this product and my tolerance level became longer, i noticed that i was not peeling as i did with first application and my cheeks are the problem areas with spots scattered about. I don&#x27;t know if it is peeling slightly and I am not aware because I do notice that the spots are fading a bit but i use another cream on my face at night so it could be that as well but my pores have shrunk a tiny bit. I continue to use this product with the hopes that i will be blemish free or at least close to it. It&#x27;s not a miracle product and I ordered this back in February but my skin just may just take a while to see the results that i want. However, it does peel and you should see some improvement in your skin as it relates to even skin tone.</li>
            <li> Have been using this weekly for the past month on my daughter who suffers from back acne with sevre scaring. On first application she felt no stinging and did not peel (left it on for 7 minutes).  Did a follow-up days later and while I noticed some frosting on her back - she still has not peeled and she started breaking out more. Sheesh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s working for some...definitely did not work for us. I received the instructions and followed them to the tee (cleaned her back, wiped down with alcohol, applied the peel, rinsed with cold water and applied a liquid skin neutralizer, moisturizer and sun screen). Absolutely nothing! Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> I recently got a bad breakout and after nothing was working, i decided to try this product.  At first i followed the directions and put a very thin coat on my face and let it sit for 4 or so minutes.  It got rid of my acne..and my skin!  My skin was burnt, red, and flaking.  After that experience i started to put a small dab on the pimples instead of my whole face.  That worked ok..but it didn&#x27;t always get rid of the acne.  So overall i gave this product a 3 because it worked some of the time, was a little overpriced, and i had to stop using it because it irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I really LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product. It has helped tremendously with new acne outbreaks! I can&#x27;t wait to get the next strength up. Maybe I was just living in a cave for too long, but I didn&#x27;t know how effective these peels really are. All the money II&#x27;d spent on past acne products was all just cash down the drain in comparison to this. I wish knew about it before!</li>
            <li> This works well as it is but I like other types of acids as well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the mild salicylic acid products that do nothing for acne.  This is the best thing to help keep your pores from clogging.  I have used it for a year.  It works well at preventing acne.  It will peel the top layer of existing blemishes too which helps to speed healing.  This combined with a topical to kill bacteria works as well as anything else I have tried.  It burns and itches, but it&#x27;s only for a few minutes weekly.  I apply with a cotton swab to problem areas weekly and existing blemishes daily.  Rinse well after 1 to 8 minutes.  Start slow and be cautious.</li>
            <li> Background on me.. 35yr old white female. History of cystic acne. I use retin-a and still get acne though not nearly as bad as when I was in high school.&lt;br /&gt;My hopes when I bought this were to help with some blackhead type bumps where I knew my skin was congested and I had the dream that it would possibly help with some of my post acne scarring *(Note Scarring not pigmentation issues... I have a few ice pick type scars that make my skin texture less than desirable. Color wise my skin tends to be a little reddish but overall very good)&lt;br /&gt;The instructions they send to you are extensive so I won&#x27;t blab on about my personal routine.&lt;br /&gt;I found the cost of this product to be VERY reasonable when you consider how easy it is to go to any drugstore, makeup counter or makeup/skincare store.&lt;br /&gt;What this does do... it loosens the chemical bond of skin cells so that they can lift/exfoliate easier. I used this product and found that a few of my bumps a comedone came to the surface (being reasonable only like one or two each time) saving me a breakout.&lt;br /&gt;As for my scarring... I have about 2 and a half weeks with this... It&#x27;s not a miracle cure all... perhaps with regular use it will encourage the skin turnover to be smoother in texture. I will make updates&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product and think the price is very reasonable. Just keep expectations reachable.&lt;br /&gt;;) best of luck and keep smiling</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s saved my life and confidence. I don&#x27;t sleep much so acne comes very easily. Every since I started using this 4 months ago, my skin is almost completely clear. I don&#x27;t expect it to be 100% effective, but wow, no more ugly skin! This is potent enough. I actually recommend staying away from the 40% glycolic acid sampler that this comes with. It&#x27;s burned my skin... but not this one! This one is great.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this product. A great peel that doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;overdo\\&quot; it. Felt my skin looks very smooth and soft for weeks after I used it. I also did not experience any peeling with this milder strength.</li>
            <li> I bought this peel to improve the texture and tone of my skin. After three peels done weekly, I have seen remarkable improvements in the superficial scarring on my cheeks and a definite evening out of the pigmentation of my skin. My acne has almost completely disappeared as a result of these peels as well. I really wish I had tried salicylic acid sooner!</li>
            <li> My problem&lt;br /&gt;- 30 year old female with tan skin&lt;br /&gt;- started breaking out in pimples for first time since I was 14&lt;br /&gt;- dark patches of skin near mouth and cheek due to mineral deficiency and hormonal imbalance&lt;br /&gt;- no other creams, masks, etc... were helping with either of these things&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened with the product&lt;br /&gt;- left it on until I couldn&#x27;t stand stinging&lt;br /&gt;- next day after a 2 hour drive home, looked in mirror and my face looked normal but the dark patches mentioned above were all peeling totally off.&lt;br /&gt;- peeled off skin with my fingers, washed my face, and scrubbed more dead skin off.&lt;br /&gt;- dark patches are now much lighter, pimples still there but smaller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;- worked for me although I have no idea why or how</li>
            <li> use this if your skin can handle the burn.  I literally left it on for 2-3 min and burned my face. Maybe i&#x27;m just too sensitive so i don&#x27;t recommend it for eveyone. caused alot of peeling and dryness.</li>
            <li> Arrived on my doorstep in a padded envelope embedded within another envelope. I&#x27;ve been wanting to use a facial peel for so long to combat sun damage, MANY acne scars,current acne, and general dullness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the instructions, I wiped down with alcohol and used a gauze pad to apply the peel all over my face for a minute. It stung a little but was totally bearable and not bad at all. After a minute, I rinsed with cold water and you could actually see little flakes of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately I had glowing skin - it definitely faded some very light scarring on my cheeks. The larger and more defined scars, however are still visible and hasn&#x27;t changed much at all. Throughout the day you can see subtle patches of skin peeling off. So don&#x27;t expect a drastic change at once, but I&#x27;m sure with continued and controlled use my scars will look much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a buy. I plan on using this once a week. I&#x27;m already super happy with this product. CHYEA!</li>
            <li> I had an 18% salicylic peel done by a professional.  The healing process was not bad at all. Some frosting during the peel and moderate dry skin with light brown patches for about 3-4 days after.  I got this product based on the rave reviews.  I figured I would try it out. I did 4 spot treatments on my face (2 on cheek, 2 on chin) just to see how I would react.  Thankfully, I did not coat my entire face.  I used a Q-Tip to apply.  I left it on for 2 minutes.  I had some frosting and moderate tingling, but not bad at all.  I washed it off with cold water and a little bit of baking soda to neutralize (I did not scrub with the baking soda). The patches were red and irritated.  Fine, ok, that means it worked.  To my dismay, I woke up in the morning with significant brown patches. The skin is very dry as expected, but the brown patches were much more noticeable than my professional peel.  Luckily I have some Obagi Hydroquinone cream!  I am applying that first, then Polysporin then Cetaphyl.  I just hope there is no permanent damage.  For all those acne sufferers, go get your peels done by a professional.  The gal I went to does the same peels to her face as the ones that she applies on her patients. Good luck and much caution recommended.  I will never use this product again.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Background:  I have what the doctors call \\&quot;problem\\&quot; skin.  I have active acne, acne scars, sun damage, and the beginning of some not-so-fine lines.  In short, I have a hate-hate relationship with my skin.  Like many people, I have truly tried every product out there.  Prescription, over the counter, every acid you can think of.  This is one of the best \\&quot;over the counter\\&quot; product I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, keep in mind it is not a miracle worker.  Salicylic acid has been used for years to \\&quot;exfoliate\\&quot; the skin, that is, to increase cell turnover.  The great thing about this product is its potency, but that also means it will sting like the dickens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also seen a lot of misinformation out there about how often this can be used.  The truth is, you can use this every day (the company itself will tell you this).  It is not actually a peel.  Your skin may peel a little bit after the first couple of times using it, but for the most part there will not be visible peeling (unless you have incredibly sensitive skin and/or have never used an exfoliant. Like, ever).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I am one of the people who don&#x27;t wash this product off.  It will absolutely self-neutralize after anywhere from 5-10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I hate when people tell you that some skin product is a miracle worker after just one use.  Nothing will change your skin after one use.  But when used consistently, this is a great product to increase cellular turnover, which will keep your pores more clear and will reduce inflammation.  This means that you are likely to see lesser breakouts after extended use.  And, salicylic is the only acid that can be used, rather is encouraged to be used prior to other, stronger peels.  Considering how expensive most products are with salicylic acid, I think this is a great deal and can totally work for you.</li>
            <li> First, let me say, that I have acne (pink/red) marks on my skin from pimples. After using this product, I notice them getting ligher! which is great. My face (except for maybe my cheeck-bones) feels ok with this product on, especially my forehead and neck. It&#x27;s a little sensitive on my cheecks and definitely near my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My question is, for the first time yesterday, I applied this under my eyes with a Q-tip on my fine lines and had to remove it immediately (about or less than a minute). My skin under my eyes were slightly pink and my fine lines now look like wrinkles!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My questions are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will this go away? my fine lines are prominent&lt;br /&gt;and when I use this prduct, should I continue using it under my eyes or no?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get that this product is good for acne scars and pimple prevention, but I was also hoping it was good for fine line removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughter who has daily breakouts that stays for weeks at a time and leave red scars.  She tried this for 3 weeks doing it only once a week because she didn&#x27;t want to over do it to begin with.  It did not stop the acne.  Her face was a mess.  She stopped using it and now we are trying something else. Maybe it would have worked if she did it more often or had a higher % acid, but she didn&#x27;t want to keep making it worse.  She had as a teenager used the over-the-counter salicylic wash, but it never worked and the Proactive did not work either. I can tell everyone from my own experience with acne that the only products that work for me are the prescription ones with sulfur in them but you have to use it twice a day everyday. Everyone&#x27;s face is different but this just did not work for her.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I really do. I was looking at my skin this morning and almost cried because I never thought my skin would look so normal. I have had horrible acne since I was 10 and I am now 30. A few months ago I developed the worst hormonal breakouts along  my jawline. I had 20 + cystic zits at a time. I found this online and ordered it because of the reviews, though I must admit some sounded too good to be true. I purchased some witch hazel and cotton balls and always  use that first. My first application I only left on for two minutes. Which is fine, please don&#x27;t have the warrior mentality about this stuff because I honestly believe that you get better results by gradually easing into it. After rinsing with lots of water I apply Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer with SPF 30.  This is a great sunscreen/moisturizer to followup with as it has a little skin tone evening/ brightening effect and it smells so nice and fresh. I do not wash my face with any harsh cleansers the day I do the \\&quot;peel\\&quot;. I did this routine once a week for one month and all of my pimples and deep zits cleared up. Completely. In between treatments, I wash my face ever day with an Oil of Olay ProX  using Olay Total Effects Blemish Control Salicylic Acid Acne Cleanser with it. I spend a good two minutes letting it work its way all over my face. I follow up with the Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer. Sometimes if my skin gets a little dirty feeling I&#x27;ll swab some witch hazel on my face. That&#x27;s it. Really low maintenance. Now I do the peel once a month. My skin looks so much better. I know I can&#x27;t promise results because everybody is different but I know that it worked for me and I had tried everything. Since I started using this I have not gotten a single cystic acne flare-up and have probably only had about 5 or so little pimples here and there that came the day after wearing BB cream or powder. So, buy it, its so worth it and I haven&#x27;t even used half the bottle yet. You can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> This product is great. I am a 34 year old hispanic woman with a tn or mediterranean complexion. I never experienced acne until I turned 30 years old and when it came, it really came. I suffer from cystic acne that is terribly painful but not disfiguring, thank God. It has only left dark spots all over my face. Recently, some of the cysts, if left alone, would kind of dry out but leave hard bumps underneath. And other would not dry out no matter what. I had tried everything, saw about 10 different dermatologists but since it isn&#x27;t disfiguring they would just stick to topical medicines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this as a way to even out my tone, but right before I received the product I got an episode of cysts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the salycilic acid on the forehead, where I didn&#x27;t have a breakout. I followed the instructions but only left it for one minute. I didn&#x27;t want to burn my skin. It tingled but didn&#x27;t burn. It did not frost it just felt tighter, and my pores looked remarkably small and smooth. I was going to wait one week but then, all these pimples starting coming to the surface, and cysts too! I went back to the review and people said it was normal. I decided to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, on my chin I had a bad breakout and the sulfur drying cream was drying my skin but not the cyst. So, in desperation I dabbed some of the salycilin acid and left it for 40 seconds. It felt like it burned, it forsted and the next day it was completely dry and scabbed. It didn&#x27;t leave a hard bump. I must add that the process of scabbing was a lot faster than it would have been normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also using vitamin E oil and tea tree oil. I can&#x27;t say if it will continue to work for me, but it did work this one time.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought a salicylc acid and I wasn&#x27;t sure what the effect is going to be look like when I put them.&lt;br /&gt;It was really hurt when I put them, in the next day my skin was start feeling a little bit also I had a dry skin so I put some olive oil or vitamin E oil on it. but after 3days I can see that some of my acne scar feed out ^^ I will continue this product</li>
            <li> After using some online tutorials, I was well on the way to using this. I am allergic to benzoyl peroxide, so alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids (SA is a BHA) are my go-to products. Works as it should. I don&#x27;t think I need anything stronger.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and well packaged. Feels like it works because it burns, but didn&#x27;t see dramatic results. Not giving up on it yet.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says but be very careful and be very cautious with the amount you use. Use only a small amount in the effected area only! This product WILL dry your skin out-it says so on the bottle! All and all, it does work just be VERY careful with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the many reviews.  It does sting a little when first applied.  Sitting in front of a fan like one reviewer did, does help.  The \\&quot;itching\\&quot; is a little bothersome.  But if I get busy with something else and get distracted, it is tolerable.  I am 56, fair skinned, freckled with oily skin, large pores on my nose and at least 5 small hypertrophic sebaceous bumps, left side of my face.  I heeded the other reviewers caution regarding time.  Two minutes to start.  I started using it 2-3 weeks ago, at least twice a week.  Now, I can leave it on for 15 minutes until it is completely soaked in and don&#x27;t even notice it.  I really don&#x27;t notice any difference except my skin feels \\&quot;tighter\\&quot; after I wash it off.  Still oily later on.  I might get a pink flush after I put it on, but I am very fair and have some roscea on my cheeks and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it until gone and then make a final decision on whether it has helped pore size, sun spots, fine wrinkles.  I am thinking maybe next time a strength of 30%?  We will see.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping and I love the fact that it isn&#x27;t white colored (like the kind you buy in the local drugstore!)</li>
            <li> I am so happy I bought this. I saw improvements right away in how much smoother my skin looks. I&#x27;ve worked my way up to the full eight minutes, and the burning isn&#x27;t to terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest instead of buying a PH stabilizer, use baking soda. Baking Soda is a natural acid neutralizer. Way back in the day it was drank to help with heartburn (it tastes nasty by the way, but better than tums). I make a paste out of it, and slash it on my face. For the first second it will burn like fire while its neutralizing, however after that all the burning will be gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For moisturizer I use thick coco butter. Then during the rest of the week I combine the butter with Retinol cream. I wait a day after the treatment to put anything harsh on my face. Let me tell you your skin will itch after every treatment. It&#x27;s not a bad itch, it&#x27;s mild and wont last past the first day. All of this might vary for you. My skin is not sensitive at all due to years of worthless Acne treatments. I suggest giving this a try. Good luck to you!</li>
            <li> Just only 2 days, I just have a feeling of this product.  It is good, just a little makes skin dry.  I will submit more information of the effect of this product later.</li>
            <li> This product reduces visible sun spots within two weeks time. Excellent product for people that want to reduce the spots and light wrinkles.  I will use this seller again.</li>
            <li> I average at home peels bi-monthly with peel types ranging from lactic acid (40%), glycolic (10%), and now this salicyclic acid peel. I&#x27;ve had one TCA peel done professionally a couple years ago and that was the deepest peel I&#x27;ve ever had (and did that thing hurt like none other).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I&#x27;m trying to solve with this peel is scarring on the sides of my face and these bumps on my right jawline that I think are dormant cystic acne lesions. They are usually not inflamed but they are bumpy, as if there&#x27;s something underneath each one. Once in a while they will get inflamed and swell up as active cysts. I&#x27;ve never had any good advice for this problem, not from derms nor various estheticians. I hope to use this peel to wear down the bumps and purge the cysts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that background, this salicyclic peel is rather mild for me. I&#x27;ve done this about three times. There&#x27;s a bit of stinging but it&#x27;s about the same as the lactic acid peel. It&#x27;s not unbearable at all for me. My routine starts with a double-cleanse; the first one to get rid of my make up, and the second to clean as if from scratch. I&#x27;ve used my Clarisonic on one occasion. I did not notice any difference with the peel in that instance. I first apply to the thicker areas of my face that coincidentally need the extra peeling -- sides of face, jawline -- then I do the T-zone starting with the forehead them the nose area. The skin around my nose is much thinner and that&#x27;s where I notice the tingling the most. I leave it on for about 5 minutes, then I add more to the jawline area where I have cystic acne and some bumpy scarring. I leave it on for another 5 minutes or so and then I neutralize with a baking soda and water solution and wash with water. I don&#x27;t find that I need to use a cleanser afterward, but I do moisturize. I do not get any sort of frosting whatsoever but my skin does get red so it only looks marginally better immediately after the peel. The next morning, my skin looks much smoother and even. It&#x27;s most noticeable in my forehead where the skin there is smoother and has minimal spots to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bumps do feel a bit flatter after the third peel. I&#x27;m hopeful that they&#x27;ll continue to get flatter or come to head with continued treatment.</li>
            <li> Burns like hell but it works</li>
            <li> This product does what it is intended to do.  Be careful though if you misuse it or leave it on too long you get ugly welts from being burnt!</li>
            <li> I was scared with the reviews saying it burns but this does not burn my face at all. I&#x27;ve used salicylic acid face wash and products with 2% in it but that&#x27;s no where near 20%. Product says use it once a week for 8 minutes, so far I&#x27;ve used it three times in five days for about half an hour each because I don&#x27;t see it doing anything. Says it will be a little red, maybe peel, burn.. I&#x27;m getting none of that. Not sure why,  maybe because I&#x27;ve used salicylic products before. But like I said, I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so hopefully it&#x27;ll work over time.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no irritation, beautiful results. Beats having to make an appointment, drive and pay a lot more for someone else to do it! Have a fan ready to reduce the sting - it is not unbearable, but it&#x27;s nice to cool the face down while waiting for it to work. This bottle will last and last. Clearer, smoother face and such a bargain!</li>
            <li> no directions with it not very happy about that dont know how to use it , dont know if it would order again but was very fast and exact what i order ty and was very fast and shipped was what i wanted  ty</li>
            <li> I have gotten proffessional peels in the past and they cost 45$ each. After a while that got expensive. So, i decided to buy this. I have acnetic/oily/sensitive skin and this product did burn when i put it on. But, ever since i used this peel my skin is half as oily and my skin doesn&#x27;t break out as much. I am extremely impressed. No other product has worked this well. Def. buy again.</li>
            <li> Works well. Helps with acne without causing your skin to visibly peel on a surface level.</li>
            <li> This gel peel was perfect. My husband said I look a lot younger after using the salicylic acid gel peel.</li>
            <li> I must say i bought this in hopes that i will burn my skin tags on some sensitive areas. Since the first day i applied it with cotton swabs i noticed that the tags were getting burned and becoming whitish. It wasn&#x27;t very itchy even though i left it on them for 5 minutes every time. After about 3 weeks applying this gel 2 times per week the tags are gone! This doesn&#x27;t leave any marks as well on the skin! A must 5 star rating! I tried other products for skin tags over-hyped by the ads here on Amazon and on the TV, and they never even worked a little bit, they were just a waste of money... People, whoever has these unpleasant tags this is the way to go! Thank You so much!!!</li>
            <li> Based on my experience ~ (I have combination skin, typically oily throughout the day with drier patches in certain areas of thinner skin, frequent breakouts, some acne scarring)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 20% strength is powerful enough to notice an overall change in my skin clarity and texture in about 2 weeks, but gentle enough that I didn&#x27;t experience excessive discomfort during application or dry skin patches after. You will experience a burning sensation... because it is acid... BUT nothing too crazy. Just work with the suggested time increments: start with 1 min, increase every week, up til 8 minutes max--- I prefer the 5-6 minute mark. I&#x27;ve been using a cotton pad to apply instead of purchasing a fan brush. Don&#x27;t be discouraged after week one, you may experience an initial breakout. Stick with it :o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been following the peel with Kiehl&#x27;s Midnight Recovery Concentrate (100% natural btw), followed by 100% pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum (also an AMAZING find on amazon that is powerfully hydrating). Both of these products have limited ingredients, and I&#x27;ve found them to be gentle and highly restorative for after the peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my new skin peel regimen!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a wish list with lots of skincare goodies that I love where you can find some GREAT stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Skin-Care Extraordinaire:  http://amzn.com/w/2IK8VDQHAOJ72</li>
            <li> Ordered this several months back however I think it lost its potency cause it does not work...Followed the instructions but yet it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> It will remove dead skin very well but water doesn&#x27;t neutralize acid (as the directions seems to say).  You MUST use a skin neutralizer (a base--go back to basic chemistry).  Buy something like \\&quot;Acid Neutralizer Skin pH Balance\\&quot; on amazon WITH this product.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been working with Chemical Peels for years and we have really liked how this product works.  The consistancy is good and the strenght is perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the main ingredient in wart removers. This works amazingly well for that use. I also mix this product in aloe gel to lessen the drying effects for all over and it really helps. Great product.</li>
            <li> Real powerful stuff. Used it on a large blemish I had and literally was gone within a few days. Burns if you leave it on too long but that&#x27;s expected with a product this concentrated.</li>
            <li> First let me say that Im a big skin laboratory fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  However, this salicylic acid peel just didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I started getting random bouts of acne this past summer in little clusters on my cheeks, something i never experienced before, especially not in my mid-twenties. After trying everything that I knew that worked for acne in the past, I decided to try the salicylic acid peel. Well it did nothing for me at all. I think that it may have even made my acne worse because I noticed that I would always get fresh pimples the day or two after using it. I still used it and finished the bottle because I just wasn&#x27;t sure what was going on. But I had no results at all from this peel. I went back to my 50% lactic acid&lt;br /&gt;and my acne is starting to clear up as well as fading the newly formed scars on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Also, the salicylic acid peel really burned, much worse than the other peels I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from adult-onset acne off and on for the past 3 years - which mainly has been along my jawline.  I&#x27;ve tried multiple products, either online or in store with such positive reviews, but never worked for me.  After 2 applications of the salicylic peel, I can completely see a difference - my face looks and feels smoother, I have no new acne and the acne scars are fading quite nicely.  I read another review that stated to use a baking soda and water paste to neutralize, which works really well!  I would highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, changed my LIFE. i hide when i have breakouts but now i feel alive again when i have clear skin. seriously, anyone with skin issues of any kind would benefit from this stuff. worked better than any acne meds from the dermatologist, and helps more than birth control did too. it really has been the only solution to my acne. i feel so thankful to have found this (by recommendation from my sis). in photoshoots, i have perfect skin and don&#x27;t have to wear a bunch of makeup to cover up and make the acne worse. i posted an unretouched pic from my last shoot to show how clear my skin was. i didn&#x27;t have to cake on makeup, it was so nice</li>
            <li> I have combination oily &amp; dry skin &amp; I used this product 3-4x/week starting the 3rd week &amp; used it regularly for almost 6 weeks &amp; didn&#x27;t really see any results. Had to stop when I moved because the new place has almost 0 humidity &amp; this peel made my skin super dry. But my main complaint is that unfortunately for me, it didn&#x27;t seem to have made much of a  difference after 5 weeks. But then again, other products haven&#x27;t really worked either, so I think it may be a hormonal issue &amp; I&#x27;m trying birth control pills to see if they will help control my crazy hormone imbalance (my acne actually got worse now in my 20s). I may try it again whenever I visit friends &amp; family in humid areas just to see if it&#x27;ll work later, or just to maintain my skin when it&#x27;s finally clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman and this product didn&#x27;t work for me. Didn&#x27;t even sting. I was so excited but no results. I&#x27;m going to try a different acid</li>
            <li> In my early 40s, medium complexion.  I have combination skin and blackheads, mostly on my chin and nose.  Also I dislike the larger pores on my upper cheeks.  Salicylic Acid is working great at minimizing the blackheads!  I saturate a small piece of cotton ball, and apply to my face as directed for about five minutes.  I am used to the tingling, but those sensitive to the burn may find relief using a tabletop fan to cool the face.  The pores and blackheads shrink after I use this.  Occasionally a whitehead or two will pop up during the treatment, which tells me that the acid is doing its job of bringing the bad stuff to surface.  In about three days post use, my skin will have some dry patches or other bumps.  I continue to moisturize and one week out, my skin looks much improved - clear with shrunken pores.  Also, when I feel one of those hard bump pimples starting to rise, I use a cotton swab to apply the peel to the pimple, and it is reduced almost completely overnight.  I alternate between full face application and spot application to specific areas only, because I&#x27;m not an aesthetician and don&#x27;t want to overdo it.  Bottom line:  This is an excellent treatment for clearing up blemish-prone skin and maintaining a clearer complexion.</li>
            <li> After reading all these amazing reviews on this product and having no luck with getting rid of my past acne scars I went ahead and bought this with high hopes. They were unfortunately too high. I&#x27;ve been using this product now for about a 2 weeks, almost everyday. The first few times I only left it on for maybe 2 minutes at a time. (Perhaps that is why I am not thrilled with my results thus far) The past two times I&#x27;ve left it on for 5 minutes. I took a before and after photo from when I first started to last night and I honestly see no difference. I MAY have some less acne, but I definitely do not see a huge difference. I was really just hoping this would help me with my past scarring and overall appearence of my face. I will continue to use it maybe...  I purchased the pH Balancer from Cellbone to use after the peel, with the Balancer, Cellbone included a free 35% Gylocolic Lactic Peel - I used this ONCE, MUCH BIGGER DIFFERENCE! I may still use this, I may not.</li>
            <li> I have the worlds largest pores, it makes my skin look uneven and makeup doesnt glide on well :-/ After using this product i noticed that the pores were actually lifted out from my skin immediately after rinsing off the peel. blemishes were brought out from under my skin that were invisible before the peel and were gone the next day. Seriously  worth it!</li>
            <li> I did not see any results using this product. Instructions are not easy to follow. Stick to a milder product.</li>
            <li> amazing product,&lt;br /&gt;just simply amazing!!</li>
            <li> Not as harsh as some peels I have tried. I think my skin is clearing up too (adult cystic acne). I&#x27;m using once a week.  Pores are getting smaller, skin overall looks better.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to use as a  mild chemical peel, but happily discovered that it works well in controlling new acne breakout.</li>
            <li> This product will do a great job However, I wish I would have ordered a greater solution like 35% instead. I have only done one treatment and so far I have had fewer  breakouts. The instructions say to wait 7 days before doing another treatment. Im going to do another treatment this week and hopefully I will see more results with my blemishes. I didn&#x27;t get peeling at all NOR burning and this is why I believe I need a stronger solution. Overall this is a great product!</li>
            <li> I am not knocking this item. It just didn&#x27;t work for me. I left this on for the time stated but this did not peel my face. I use salicylic or glycolic in my face lotion sometimes and those work great but this left my face dry even though I had acne and oily skin. It said your skin will gradually peel but mines was just tight red dry and itchy and felt like I was clogging my skin even more because it did not eventually peel off. I waited a week and it only made my face irritated. To those to who it worked for then I am glad it works. I guess everyone is different.</li>
            <li> Ok so I got the product mailed in today, tested it under my chin, inner forearm, and on this ugly white cyst pimple on my forehead. I waited about 3 minutes and washed it off with cold water, then used a wet cotton ball to wipe it off, then used a dry cotton ball, and to my amazement the WHOLE white nasty cyst came off with it!!, and there wasn&#x27;t any left inside the pimple. Im so glad I can use it on the white heads and just wipe it off so easily without having to pop it. I will start using it on other parts of my face in the next few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh BTW I tried Proactive and prescription acne medications, and none of them worked. This is definatly worth a buy.</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne and I get big scars easily. I&#x27;m a black woman with tan/brown skin. I get really dark spots left from the acne. I just received my bottle Friday and tried it two times. The first time I used a cotton ball and it was very little burning so I left it on for 10 minutes. I didn&#x27;t really see any results. I tried again the following Tuesday and I had received my brush that I ordered. I used it instead and I felt a major difference. It began burning immediately. I was able to distract myself for 10 minutes. I didn&#x27;t get red but I didn see the white spots that others spoke about. I used the neutralizer and my skin was so smooth. I also noticed that I only had a shinny nose where my entire face is usually oily. I think if I keep using it twice a week, I will see more results and the bumps will completely clear. I&#x27;m satisfied. I will change my rating to a 5 if I&#x27;m able to use Amby on my dark spots without reoccuring break outs.</li>
            <li> I started to apply it from forehead as the instruction says but I felt a strong sting immediately.  However, I continued to apply onto my nose and then to my right chin.  During this time, I felt such a strong sensation on my nose that I couldn&#x27;t bare.  I stopped and immediately wash my face using cold water continually for quite a few minutes because the sensation could not go away.  I was so afraid of scaring my face that I couldn&#x27;t go to work the next day.  After washing my face for a long while using cold water, I also applied a thick moisturizing mask on my face for over 45 min.  Finally the whitness around my nose went away.  Luckily my face was not scared but I felt very tightness and dryness around my nose now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is oily and combination and has some acnes especially during the summer.  My face is a bit sensitive sometimes but not overly sensitive.  I saw the good reviews and wanted to remove the acnes and acne marks by purchasing this product.  However, for some reason it does not work on my face and I have to return it today.</li>
            <li> Ive used this product for about 3 1/2months and didn&#x27;t see a lick change my acne stayed horrible the entire 3 1/2months of use and I used it twice a week I kept in denial thinking it&#x27;ll have to start working soon! Also I&#x27;m not one of those other reviewers saying \\&quot;boohoo I&#x27;m too much of a puss to handle the pain so in giving it no stars\\&quot; that&#x27;s not it, trust me in a female mix martial artist in conditioning, so i can handle pain.With all the raving reviews i thought it has to work soon! I was wrong. But as soon as i stopped using it my acne slowed down tremendously, I&#x27;m starting to think it was the reason my acne never left those months, I understood that other reviewers said you&#x27;ll break out before it gets better, well, I broke out but never got better! I kept ATLEAST 6-13 pimples every single day for 3months straight using this product&amp; I&#x27;m not exaggerating. I was so sure it was going to work i took pics of my face 1-2 times a week to track the \\&quot;progress\\&quot; I thought was going to happen, instead i just have 3months worth of horrible acne pics of my face! I was going to make a youtube video of the progress but Since their wasnt Theres no point. If you&#x27;ve used salicylic in the past and it didn&#x27;t work for you, it probably won&#x27;t now, What really cleared my acne up to this day is acne.org&#x27;s regimen &amp;their products, benzoyl peroxide works for my face,not salicylic, now that I know that I won&#x27;t be touching this product. &amp;i did follow the instructions on this too, also I believe it made the acne scars on my cheeks even darker! Horrible product to use, if salicylic acid based products didn&#x27;t work for u in the past don&#x27;t buy this!! Try benzoyl or AHA. If you still plan on buying this I will say if you applying it and having it on your face is a painful bitch wait till you splash water on your face, It&#x27;s more painful getting it off then having it on!! Something I saw no other reviewers really put.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and a lot of professional sites that all said this was a great product and the recovery time would be negligible. I read several that said the title of \\&quot;Peel\\&quot; was facetious as most people don&#x27;t actually notice any skin peeling; others said that the skin would peel the first 48 hours and then look so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m here at day seven and my face is still peeling. It seems as though I&#x27;ve lost four layers of dermis. I followed the directions explicitly, and only left it on for a little over a minute. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with dry skin or excessive peeling outside of sun damage. After using this product, my face feels tight and dry no matter how much moisturizer I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still hoping for that glow everyone is talking about, but at this point my hope is dwindling. I&#x27;m glad this product has worked so well for others, but for me it seems to be a bust.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this it burned like hell, and I think I have a good tolerance to pain. It definitely takes a few times to build up a tolerance to this product.  The first time I tried it I put it all over my face, and the sides of my nose were raw and peeling really bad by the next day.  The next time I just did it on the spots where the acne scars were and that seemed to work a lot better for me.  After a couple of days I was looking in the mirror and one of the scars literally disappeared in front of me. I saw a dry piece of skin ready to fall off and it peeled right off along with the scar.  That was enough for me to keep using this product.  It does dry your face out, but that&#x27;s the whole point. I have gone through a ton of moisturizer while using this product but it&#x27;s totally worth it. Probably not for everyone, but it worked for me and I&#x27;m very happy.  I also purchased the skin PH balancer which feels awesome after rinsing off the peel. I&#x27;m Hispanic and have medium to dark skin so I tend to get really dark scars, especially around my mouth, chin, and jaw line. This really minimized that.  Sunscreen also does wonders.  You have to used it everyday, especially when you&#x27;re using a chemical peel.  Good luck to all using this product. :)</li>
            <li> I read some reviews before I bought this product and the majority of people like it so I gave it a try.  I am 28 years old and have battled acne for the past 10 years.  I&#x27;ve tried many many products - over the counter and prescription.  I used Proactive for years and then that stopped working :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the peel about every 5 days or so for over a month.  My blackheads are still there but I have noticed that my skin is smoother and is less likely to break out!  (After I do a peel I don&#x27;t break out after, my skin does the opposite thankfully!)  Like another reviewer said, its a process.  This isn&#x27;t going to solve all of your problems in one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is NOT for everyone.  I do NOT have sensitive skin.  This product does NOT make me bruise, incredibly red or make my skin turn brown like other reviews.  If you know you have sensitive skin I would say this isn&#x27;t for you.  I had no problem applying it to my entire face right from the start.  You should gradually ease into the product by slowly increasing the amount of time you leave it on every peel you do.  Yes it burns badly but you have to do something to distract you while its on lol.  My face still burns after I rinse it off, apply a ph balancer, rinse that off and apply a cream....beauty is pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I read other reviews because I created my own ph balancer for after I rinse the peel.  Like other reviewers I created a baking soda paste (just add water) and I apply that to my skin after I rinse the peel off.  It is gritty so you can&#x27;t rub it in, it&#x27;ll irritate your skin.  I just apply it with my fingers and let it sit for a couple of minutes then rinse it off.  It helps with the burning!  I actually mixed the baking soda and water and put it in a small plastic container and keep it in my fridge so I don&#x27;t have to make the paste for every peel.  It keeps in the fridge just fine and its nice and cold on my face after the peel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product and will continute to use it!  It hasn&#x27;t eliminated scars or blackheads yet but I&#x27;m hoping.  My goal is to have clear skin so I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup..maybe thats a lofty goal.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t, its still a great product for people prone to get blemishes.  I&#x27;m mad I didn&#x27;t find it sooner!t and will continute to use it!  It hasn&#x27;t eliminated scars or blackheads yet but I&#x27;m hoping.  My goal is to have clear skin so I don&#x27;t have to wear makeup..maybe thats a lofty goal.  Even if it doesn&#x27;t, its still a great product for people prone to get blemishes.  I&#x27;m mad I didn&#x27;t find it sooner!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well for me as the glycolic acid for acne and hyper-pigmentation. Ok for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product works well but DO NOT try to use it if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing.  I&#x27;ve been getting professional peels for years, and my skin is used to the process.  I know what it should feel like, and I know when it needs to come off.  If you are inexperienced, you will burn your skin.  If you are used to getting regular peels by a professional, you will like the results of this product.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff!  It is somewhat hard to apply and burns a little but like most say, it makes your skin SMOOTH!  Once a week is all my skin can handle but I like washing my face because it is so smooth!</li>
            <li> I clean my face in a steamy shower.  Wipe with alcohol.  Wipe this product on lightly, like a toner, with a cotton pad, avoiding my eyes, sides of my nose, and mouth.  Leave on for 8 minutes.  Splash off with cold water for several minutes.  Blot dry and immediately moisturize.  It stings and burns slightly while on, and while rinsing off, all the way until the moisturizer goes on, and then it stops.  It helps with acne (does not eliminate), and makes my skin look newer and smoother.  I read the directions and followed them to the letter, and have had no problems.  I do this about once a week.  The only time I had a problem was when I got over-zealous about it and did it 2 or 3 times in one week -- then I aggravated my skin, thinking if once was good, then 2 or 3 times would be even better, which it wasn&#x27;t.  So once a week is fine for me.  I think I will easily get about 15 to 20 applications out of this bottle.</li>
            <li> I like this for spot acne and dark spot treatment. It seems to help the cell turnover and bring up acne faster.</li>
            <li> So as I&#x27;m maturing, I started looking into how to take better care of my face. I read a lot of good reviews on this so I decided to try it. Well first time is definitely that the most comfortable. Then I can start feeling a little tingling in my nose from the acid fumes, so I started breathing and hyperventilating thru my mouth then it started tingling in my mouth. I guess you ahve to make sure you have a good ventilation when applying this. So the next few times I&#x27;d used this, I used a small fan blowing on my side, not directly in front of me. Also, start where skin is the thickest or less sensitive, I made the mistake of starting in my nose and the liquid pooled on the side of my nsoe and really hurt! SO start at the are where your skin is the thickest or less sensitive. I usally start on the forehead, cheeks, then temple, side of my face and last one on my nose area, not freshly dipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the BRUSH, I did use the fan brush, but I modified mine. I think it&#x27;s too long that it kinda bends when you dip and brush it on your face, also I think it&#x27;s a little too wide and thick, (sorry I&#x27;m stingy and want to use as less as I can) so I trimmed the brush, made it narrower, don&#x27;t cut too close to the plastic, made it less thick and cut it shorter. I noticed that with the shorter brush it was easier to apply. I just tilt the bottle and spread it a little on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next few times were more bearable, its the first 3-4 minutes that are a little uncomfortable as expected. So while waiting for the next 8 minutes, I use my alarm on my cellphone, didn&#x27;t want to forget the time, Also I do something distracting while waiting for time, either, dancing, LOL, or folding laundry, or play cnady crush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RINSING, I tried the baking powder water solution and Man does that really sting!!! Water is a good neutralizer, so I just rinse in the shower, (my hair is always pulle back when I&#x27;m doint this), stick my head in and use the handheld shower head anduse lukewarm water, defintely doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad as the baking soda solution and gets the stinging away faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to apply a really good moisturized after and ALWAYS use sunscreen! I use the Hyaluronic with C &amp; E and just Olay of Olay regenerist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> The Salicyclic Acid 20% Gel Peel, is great for somewhat sensitive skin.  With subsequent use any skin problems you may have [acne, pigmentation,roughness] totally disappears.</li>
            <li> I have so many great things to say about this product! I will just give you a few things that I&#x27;ve learned though. Do not leave this on for very long the first few times you use it, it will burn your skin.Build up to the 8 minute max. Be careful around this skin near your eyes. Use a good moisturizer afterwards.I know that sounds crazy, especially when you&#x27;ve been use to keeping your skin free of anything like that. I use neutrogena wrinkle repair, it is not greasy and leaves just the right amount of moisturizer without leaving my oily skin feeling greasy. My skin has a whole new look and feel after decades of severe acne. I use it often times when noticing a new pimple or cyst forming, applying a dab with a q-tip.</li>
            <li> Stats about me:&lt;br /&gt;19 year old Caucasian female.&lt;br /&gt;Struggled with severe acne during puberty and moderate acne these past few years.&lt;br /&gt;Had acne, acne scarring, large pores, oily skin, and two fine lines on my forehead when I bought product.&lt;br /&gt;Has never before written a review on Amazon, but was so satisfied with product that I simply HAD to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t remember how I came across this product on amazon, but once I did, I decided to give it a shot (20 bucks isn&#x27;t that painful to spend on an experiment). All I can say is WOW. Immediately after using this product, I noticed that my skin looked fresher and clearer. I gasped when I saw it because I wasn&#x27;t expecting such an immediate change. The next day, the true extent of the effects was seen (I think skin continued sloughing off throughout the night). Many of my pimples had become unclogged and were shrinking, many light acne scars had disappeared completely, the stubborn scars had noticeably faded, and my fine lines became even finer. Talk about fast results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve continued using the peel every 5 days (I&#x27;ve used it six times now) and now, my pores don&#x27;t even have the chance to get clogged and develop pimples. The only zits that I get nowadays are on the edge of my face--either my hairline or along my jaw--because those are the parts of my face that I am not as thorough with when applying the peel. The fine lines on my forehead are virtually undetectable unless if my face gets oily, which only happens if I go without showering for more than 3 days (my skin dries out easily so I space out my showers). The scars aren&#x27;t even there anymore, and my skin is overall much softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has gone from being rather unremarkable--you know, not bad enough to notice, but not good enough to notice either--to beautiful. I now have the type of skin that is clear more often than it is breaking out... something I haven&#x27;t experienced since I was 12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have scars on my arm from selfmutilating when I was young and stupid. I read online that chemical peels are used to professionally remove scars and so I decided to try out my salicylic peel on mine. This was the thing that finally pushed me into writing a review. The results were way above my expectations; all of the fainter scars have faded into being practically nonexistent and the not-so-faint ones have become faint. I cannot wait to see what my arm will look like after I use this peel on it more that once. This is coming from a girl who has bought countless scar-removal creams and has never seen much improvement. At 20 dollars, this peel is half as expensive as mederma and has given me the results in 1 use that 3 tubes of mederma have been unable to. I am so happy because I was always asked about my scars and I was very self-conscious, but now I don&#x27;t think they are noticeable enough to attract anyone&#x27;s attention. For all of you who have scars of your own or who know someone who can&#x27;t get their&#x27;s to go away, recommend this product PLEASE. It is simply amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the reason that so many people on here have had unsatisfying results with this product is because they do not allow the peel to work on their skin long enough. I&#x27;ve kept it on for the maximum 7 minutes every single time I&#x27;ve used it, even the first time, and that&#x27;s probably why I&#x27;ve had such great results so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;It really burns like hell when you first apply it; but the longer you keep it on, the less it burns. At the end of the 7 minutes, I can&#x27;t even feel it on my face anymore. So... if you can just get yourself through the first 3 or 4 minutes, you&#x27;re good to go for the full 7!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found that fanning my face with something heavy-duty, like a plate, takes away the burning sensation and makes it much easier to get through those first few minutes. I don&#x27;t know how long I could stand to keep it on if I didn&#x27;t fan my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I go into the shower to rinse it off because I feel like it is safer to stand under a jet of water in order to remove acid from my skin rather than simply splash some onto my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you remove the peel, your skin will get super dry. At first, I just used lotion because that was what was recommended, but when I did so my face stayed dry for days (even when I applied it generously). I had some vitamin E oil in a drawer (a failed scar removal attempt) that I got from walgreens for probably 7 bucks. I rubbed that onto my skin instead and have found that it keeps my skin much better hydrated than lotion. I think the reason for this is because, well, it&#x27;s pure oil (it feels like olive oil), so its like returning the oil to your face that you had stripped away (but it doesn&#x27;t look oily after it has been absorbed). Normally, doing this to your skin would result in waking up with a break out, but since your pores are so clean after the peel, I&#x27;ve found that they do not get clogged even when I rub oil into them. The vitamin E oil combined with the effects of the peel also leaves your skin feeling like a baby&#x27;s butt, which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure that you read the directions of the peel and use a toner beforehand to help open up your pores so the peel can dig deeper. Also, I&#x27;ve noticed that the peel burns A LOT more when your skin is very dry when applying it. Make sure your skin is hydrated before putting on the peel because it hurts much less then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this is a long review, but I just had so much to say about this true miracle in a bottle. I love it so much that I&#x27;m even giving bottles away as Christmas presents. I highly recommend that you try it and try all of the tips that I&#x27;ve provided, because I&#x27;ve had amazing results using them and I hope you do as well!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product because after the dry skin went back to normal I noticed the marks got extremely lighter but the process of putting this on your skin Im not too thrilled about but that has nothing to do with the buyer.</li>
            <li> Does what salicylic acid is supposed to do. I am mad at myself for using glycolic before, because all glycolic acid does is burn the top layer of the skin and thins it out. Salicylic has many benefits described above. Having a 2% content is not enough, as in some face washes (Clinic). Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive products. I started using regular Dove soap and Cetaphil wash, and salicylic acid twice a week at first, and it&#x27;s all that&#x27;s need to clear the face. The initial break out was ferocious. I stayed home for two weekends feeling like I got the plague, which made me very depressed. The problems went away and the texture of the sking is still getting better (pores are smaller).</li>
            <li> I find that products with Salicylic acid work very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I used this for 6 months weekly and I have never experienced irritations.&lt;br /&gt;It smooths and cleans and I seem to have far fewer skin breakouts.</li>
            <li> Use this for acne every once in a while for spot treatment leaving it on for about 30 seconds, but the reason this is a great product is it cured my planters wart. After suffering for a month with a planters wart on my toe often bringing me to my knees in pain, I read online that Salicylic acid can be used for treatment. I busted this out of my closet, and I scraped off the excess skin and applied this every day for about two weeks, and the planters wart was gone! This product is amazing! The alternative was to go to the doctor and have them cut the planters wart out of my foot which would&#x27;ve been my last resort if this failed.</li>
            <li> I used this a few months ago, left it on for about 3-4 minutes and then washed off with copious amounts of cold water just like the instructions indicated. I&#x27;m an Asian-Indian in my late 20s with tan/oily skin and mild acne. I would *HIGHLY* encourage washing off this peel with normal BAKING SODA mixed with water. I don&#x27;t know why the instructions don&#x27;t require the use of baking soda, but water alone will NOT wash this off quickly enough. Therefore, if you have &#x27;frosting&#x27;, the baking soda will neutralize it rather than allowing it to burn/blemish/scar deeply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing off, there was some small areas that &#x27;frosted&#x27;, meaning that it was still WHITE. I tried to wash it more and more but it wouldn&#x27;t come off. Eventually, I developed a DARK, DARK, DARK blemish on the right side of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blemish still remains almost 4 months later. I can&#x27;t get rid of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this leaves my skin feeling and looking very &#x27;wrinkled&#x27; the next few days. Some reviews indicate that the skin will peel afterwards, but mine didn&#x27;t peel properly so the damaged skin remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I read some reviews suggesting that the entire face should &#x27;frost&#x27;. Are you guys serious?! My experience with frosting is that it&#x27;s equivalent to burning and scaring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**For those who have good results with &#x27;frosting&#x27;, please elaborate in the comments and indicate your type of skin, ethnicity and skin color. These are personal details but very important when using this product. This product can otherwise be very dangerous, even if left on for a few minutes!**</li>
            <li> I love it really works greats thanks</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have ever purchased. I am over 40 and have been out in the sun a lot through the years. I&#x27;ve been trying different products to try to counter the effects of aging. I have spent a lot of money and, ironically, this product (which is by far the least expensive) has done the most to improve my skin&#x27;s appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesistant to purchase this but it got such good reviews that I decided to give it a try. I know that some of the reviewers let it burn their face and then let it heal which almost made me not purchase the item. First, I have sensitive skin so I was worried about what it would do to me. Also, I work every day and cannot be in hiding for a few days while my face heals. However, when I got the bottle and read the instructions, they specifically say to not leave it on until your face burns. It recommends starting out with leaving it on for one minute and then only doing it once per week, increasing your time up to eight minutes. I did that and increased by one minute per week. I did learn to only wash my face by hand before I apply the peel; when I use a Clarisonic first, it makes my face too sensitive and I start to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using this, my acne (which didn&#x27;t even develop until I turned 35) got worse but now I have not had a blemish in months. The real improvements this peel provides don&#x27;t show immediately but come after using the product consistently for a few weeks. I have had many people ask what I am doing and I tell everyone about this. It has really improved my skin. I am now ready to increase to the 30% solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do recommend reading and adhering to the instructions that come with the bottle. I think that is the safest and most effective way to use this product.</li>
            <li> I moved to NY from Scotland during the summer months.  My skin had a really hard time dealing with the humidity and the pollution - not something I&#x27;d had to deal with before.  I&#x27;ve never had the best skin; it&#x27;s always been oily and I suffer from blackheads and large-ish pores.  Arriving in NY my skin became so oily it was disgusting and lots of tiny little spots started forming across my forehead.  I now use this once or twice a week for just a few mins at a time and then follow with a benzoyl peroxide cream at night, which I use most nights and a light oil free moisturiser.  All these three things combined have really helped the oil control, my skin is nowhere near as greasy, I&#x27;ve less black heads and my pores are definitely smaller. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Excellent products, great price. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have had to use this product more frequently than the instructions in order to achieve desired effect. I is just beginning to work, and I wonder if it is truly 20%, or if it possibly my skin. I am using it for age spots and I noticed that these spots seem to be &amp;#34;thicker&amp;#34; than other unaffected areas of my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite some time. I use the 20% peel once a week for two months at a time, taking two weeks off and my skin has never looked better. Although this isn&#x27;t a very deep peel, it is a powerful product so use with caution and follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using, I wash my face and wipe with alcohol. This step is very important because the peel is most effective when the skin is completely clean and free of any residue, oils, etc. Then I apply a thin layer of peel with a fan brush, moving quickly and evenly across the face, taking special care not to let the brush rest on any part of my face for too long. I leave this on for five minutes, then I rinse with cool water and baking soda to neutralize the acid. Afterwards, I pat dry gently. This peel can be very drying so moisturizing is critical. I use organic rosehip oil and I have seen wonderful results. I will always keep a bottle of this gel peel in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I think this product can really bring great results if you are super careful about using it and don&#x27;t give up. I used it to shrink some pores and improve my acne scars, and although I do think having used it for months it has had good effects, it has randomly burnt my skin every now and then. That made me give up on using it for a while but I think the key is to really follow the instructions that come with it; take not exposing yourself to the sun and not using any skin products the day before as well very seriously.</li>
            <li> Product works ok.  Never really noticed any major changes in my skin though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice. After reading all the reviews I was worried to leave it on too long, so I rinsed it off my face in about 5min.  Nothing happened. I didn&#x27;t even peal a little bit.  So I thought I didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough - so I did 8min the next time. Yes it burned a bit both times - but nothing happened. I used it on my chin and forehead as I only have some small whiteheads  - nothing major. didn&#x27;t do a thing.  It was a waste of my money.  I don&#x27;t understand how all these people talk about the amazing results. Especially with acne scars...didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used products in the past that would clear up some of my acne but my biggest problem was always the deep scarring and the damaged/irritated skin that my breakouts would leave behind. The reviews on here really encouraged me to give this a try and I am amazed at the results! I do have to admit that it is uncomfortable to use at first. After I would apply it, my whole face would start rapidly heating up and it is a bit to endure, but the results are well worth it! I&#x27;ve used it about once or twice a week for the past three weeks now and my scarring has tremendously gone down and my skin feels extremely smooth. Before using this, I wasn&#x27;t able to leave the house without caking on layers of foundation and now I honestly have no problem going out without any at all!.</li>
            <li> Same thing as at the salon with out the big prce of the salon. I would order this again!!  I love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product on 3 different occasions and did not peel. I followed directions and even left it on my face longer then instructed this last time. I am disappointed but the price was ok so Im not out a lot of money.</li>
            <li> it has kept my facial blemishes to a minimum, lightened up sun spots and people tell me my skin looks good after I use it.  But be careful....start out less than a minute and let your skin get used to it.</li>
            <li> I have a few different acids I rotate through throughout the year, glycolic and lactic, and a combo of the two. This one, despite being a lower level salicylic peel, gives me the flakiest skin a few days after. I don&#x27;t at all like how flakey my skin gets from this, but I know it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job. My other higher potency glycol acid/lactic acid peels don&#x27;t make me this flakey. Idk… I figure flakey is good, even though i prefer non flakey? lol</li>
            <li> The verdict is still out on this product. When I first purchased it I started using it and had some promising results with clearing up dark spots. Was a little nervous about having to use baking soda to neutralize it. Felt kinda dangerous. Couldn&#x27;t use it long because became pregnant and opted to stop for safety. I will update my review when I start back using it.</li>
            <li> I had very high hopes this would finally be the ticket but was a bit disappointed that this didn&#x27;t work on my scars. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have always had awful acne scars on my face, and I have tried many ways to get rid of them. A friend of mine recommended this to me, and I was surprised and happy when after a month I no longer had any signs of scars on my face. It stings just a bit, but for this price and the results, the ending outcome is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> It definitely burns so I never leave it on for longer than a minute and a half, but I&#x27;m definitely not blown away by the results. I notice a glow to my skin afterwards, but it&#x27;s nothing permanent. It also doesn&#x27;t help my blemishes which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> great stuff. works great. My wife and I both use it regularly with great results.</li>
            <li> i used this kind before. I would try the 30%. These results are slow</li>
            <li> I had finally resigned myself to Acutane - this was my last attempt before going to the dermatologist to get started and it works GREAT. Absolutely incredible, and my acne problems were fairly severe. Almost completely gone in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Cellbone Technology is a great product! I use it often and many of their products! Just don&#x27;t over sue the acids!</li>
            <li> I have 37 year-old African American skin that is the color of toast or almonds.  It is oily and I get small acne on my forehead with larger blemishes on my cheeks and jawline.  I&#x27;ve been using this off and on (from once a week at the start to once or twice a month now)since August and I like it.  I have some hyperpigmentatin from past cystic acne which this hasn&#x27;t done anything to clear up but I haven&#x27;t gotten any more large pimples since I started this peel which is awesome. Any pimples that I do get tend to go away faster than they used to. My skin feels so smooth after I rinse. I&#x27;m considering the glycolac for my next purchase to get rid of the old dark marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I started off applying this with a fan brush but now I just tip my fingers over the top and use them to spread the peel.  The product lasts a lot longer this way because it&#x27;s not soaking into the brush. But be careful, you are really NOT supposed to rub it into your skin. It burns after about 2-3 min and then I rinse in the shower.  Wash your face first then follow with toner to remove excess oil which helps the peel to penetrate your pores. There is usually no redness after unless I had any frosty areas which then turn brown and peel after a few days with no residual scarring beneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have milia around my nose and on my chin which it hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of completely but it is much easier to extract after this peel. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not help me with acne or hyper pigmentation. I&#x27;m not sure how much money I will have to lose before finding something that actually works for me. :(</li>
            <li> This stuff is as strong as the SA peels you get with a facial.  I use this periodically on my chin where I have milia and hormonal acne and it seems to take off the outer layer exposing the whiteheads.  I can easily extract the whiteheads after.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4/5 stars, simply because I feel that the burning sensation when it is on my face is a little too much. My skin is not overly sensitive and if I left this product on for more than three or four minutes I was nearly in tears at the stinging and burning sensation. I thought after I built up a tolerance, (I started at one minute as suggested and worked upward with the time), that the stinging would become less bothersome but that did not occur and it still stings every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;That aside, the peel works wonderfully and does exactly what it is supposed to do. For up to 2 weeks after using the peel, there are no visible blackheads on my nose and my face is extremely soft and smooth. I have never gotten completely rid of blackheads or acheived a lasting smoothness like this with ANY other method &amp; I&#x27;ve tried them all! The results definitely make the stinging for a few minutes worth it.</li>
            <li> I am a 44 year old mom and grandmother who still had to deal with acne...It WAS terrible. I have tried various regimens that worked to some degree but never always or consistently until now. I love using the Salicylic Acid Gel Peel. I use it once a week followed the next day by either a [[ASIN:B001THWULA Glycolic Acid 50% Gel Peel, 100ml]] or [[ASIN:B000PNXBU8 Lactic Acid 50% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)]]. After doing this for three weeks I began to notice that I was not breaking out anymore, AT ALL! I have continued to use this regimen with magnificent results with no acne, much fewer and smaller blackheads, and my skin tone is so smooth and even. I have given up on foundation all together because I love the way my skin looks. I use [[ASIN:B002NBJAWI Physicians Formula Tinted Moisturizer SPF-15, Fair to Light 1122 1 fl oz (30 ml)]] and a translucent face powder and I get compliments on my skin which use to never happen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30s and still break out.  After using the product for 2 weeks the break outs almost disappeared and my complexion has been so much more clearer.  The product is strong and stings my skin so I can&#x27;t keep it on my skin for more than 5 minutes.  The Bottom line it works.</li>
            <li> If you are buying this product you have studied its proper use. This has worked miracles for me. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about trying this product (I&#x27;m in my mid twenties and am starting to notice early signs of aging skin, despite taking good care of my face and staying out of the sun). Unfortunately, after using the product a second time, I developed red, bumpy skin around my chin that still has not gone away (it&#x27;s been seven weeks as of today, Nov 30).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Feb 5th 2013: It&#x27;s now been several months since I used this product, and the red/bumpy scarring has not faded. Please see my customer photos for reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE May 5th 2014: It&#x27;s been two years since I used this peel. The scars are no longer raised or bumpy, but the redness around my chin is still prevalent and requires a green concealer and a heavy-coverage foundation to hide. I have received a few messages suggesting that this scarring make actually be rosacea, but a dermatologist ruled that out and confirmed that these types of peels can cause permanent hyper-pigmentation or scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please avoid this product. I have ruined the skin on my lower face for the rest of my life. It&#x27;s truly, truly not worth the risk. If you absolutely feel like you need a chemical peel, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. Save up the cash and see a professional.</li>
            <li> This was really what I have been looking for it did the job...good purchase</li>
            <li> This product is great!  For a  long time I was using a product that was 15% from another company that cost twice as much.  I&#x27;ve struggled with moderate acne for many, many years starting when I was 13 or 14.  About for many years I stayed on a strict regimen of Retin A, benzoyl peroxide, and moisturizer.  But too many years of using the Retin A started to create the problem of rosacea and was too harsh to use every night.  I also think the constant cell turn over and stripping started to cause sebaceous hyperplasia because the skin could not get enough moisture to the surface fast enough.  If your skin is extremely dry from all the harsh product use it will naturally make tons more oil and clog the pores. Then I found a terrific company called Paula&#x27;s Choice.  She is a chemist that actually designed products for many well known business out there.  She knows what actually works and doesn&#x27;t work for many different skin types.  She also explained that salicylic acid is highly effective in a high enough concentration to actually clean out the lining of the pores.  It&#x27;s the only product that will literally clean out your pores.  The problem with most products is that they don&#x27;t have a high enough concentration of salicylic acid to do this.  It needs to be 2% or higher.  People with moderate to sever acne need a good product that actually contains probably at least 4-20%.  I do recommend using a good moisturizer and even supplementing it with a good serum with lots of cell communicating ingredients and antioxidants.  If you have acne BUY THIS PRODUCT!  It actually works and the price can&#x27;t be beat.  You&#x27;d spend a lot more in a med spa or a dermatologists office for the exact same product to use 1 to 3 times.</li>
            <li> I was getting peels professionally every month.  I had stopped and noticed that my breakouts were coming back around my jaw line and neck.  I seen this on Amazon and thought why not do it myself.  I use it once a week for about 3-5 minutes.  I don&#x27;t leave it on longer than that being that I use it every week.  This is the second bottle I have used.  As long as use this regulary my face is clear and looks great!  I love this salicylic peel.  Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I have used this product once a week for the past three months. I have had problem skin for years, very oily and frequent break outs. I purchased this product for the scars the acne leaves since I heard it works great for this purpose. While it hasn&#x27;t completely eliminated the scars, it does peel some skin off the scar, and has made them almost invisible. Not quite gone, but barely noticeable anymore.    For past 3 weeks or so I have also been using a acne medication supplement for overall skin health and its been working pretty darn well;    [[ASIN:B00QU3EFXO Acne Treatment Supplement: Top Rated Acne Pills for Women, Men, and Teens - 29 Powerful Acne Fighting Ingredients]]    The vitamins and minerals or whatevers in these pills makes my skin more even looking, and I haven&#x27;t even had any new zits in the past couple weeks which is unusual for me unfortantely.    The combination of these products are working wonders for my skin and would be my first recommendation for anyone with skin problems.</li>
            <li> works great to reducing pimple overnight</li>
            <li> work for beginner peel, I give it 5 star...would buy again.</li>
            <li> Please be careful with this product! Do a skin test first on a small area of your face to see how your skin reacts... I  applied this product for less than a minute and my face was burning severely, even after rinsing it still burned. So please be careful and apply with caution!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews on wow, this is making my skin clear up and I have had a weird acne thing on my chest (forgot the term te dermatologist gave) for years and have been trying to get it off my chest for YEARS and this stuff makes it fade every day and so far it has done more in a week than I have in those years!!! totally see why people rave about this. Here&#x27;s hoping it keeps helping me!</li>
            <li> as other reviewers already noticed i did not have any effect for the first time but i kept applying little by little first few days. on third or forth day i felt the burning and the skin started peeling the next day. i will write more after awhile....it does peel the dead skin away and brightens the skin. i am wondering if i need the higher %...</li>
            <li> This product comes with clear and detailed instructions on how to use the same safely and efficaciously.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed some reduction in my acne scars since I have begun to use the same. However, I have just begun to use the product. I have had no adverse reaction to the product.&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> My skin never peeled, and I followed the directions to the T. There was no difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> This has saved my skin.  I rarely write reviews, but had to for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had mild adult acne for about a year now.  My hormones completely changed after having my daughter.  Nothing worked.  I saw a dermatologist, had microdermabrasion, and tried many different products,  Nothing truly worked.  UNTIL THIS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my miracle product.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Professional quality for an amateur price- same effect as the spa/dermatologist!</li>
            <li> It makes my face sting really bad when I use it. My skin is super sensitive too. And I think it actually makes me break out more than make my face better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have asked a derm. before getting this but I was desperate. Just go see a doctor, not worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 17 year old male and I&#x27;ve been fighting the great fight against acne for years now.  I tried Neutrogena Skin ID and used it exactly as directed for about a month or so with very little to no results.  I tried naturally getting rid of my acne using lemon juice every night for a couple weeks with no improvement.  The only break I got was if I stopped eating anything with a significant amount of sugar in it, I might not break out so bad.  But this product... it changed everything for me.  Warning, you can&#x27;t use this if you have sensitive skin, it definitely burns, but it&#x27;s worth it.  Within the first application after waiting only one week (I recommend 5-7 days between applications), the results showed!  I even got compliments after only one application.  Then it just kept getting better.  Try this, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works great. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Slow peel which is great to keep from irritation. I use often and love this product.</li>
            <li> it does whats its supposed to; burns outer layer of skin to removie old damaged cells.&lt;br /&gt;extremely potent, dont use more than once a week. keep olive oil/aloe vera neaby. you will need it.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a chemical peel. I&#x27;ve used salicylic acid in my other products, but I needed something stronger for my cluster and quarter sized dark spot of blackheads on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning to those with sensitive skin and are prone to infectious outbreaks, those of you know what I am talking about, well, this product warns that it may cause an outbreak and in my first use, it did. So beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for those who want to get rid of dark spots on their face.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of redness after I apply this product on my face, maybe because my face skin is very sensitive to this type of Acid, and one of my friend who learnt medicine told me that Salicylic Acid is not very good for Acne, since it may cause some dark element sediment deeply in our skin. Be careful to use this type of Acid.</li>
            <li> AND...... it works, slowly but surely.  At the age of 65, my skin is already severely dry and this product helps me remove that dryness and generate a softer skin.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a chemical peel at home on myself. I&#x27;ve had the Vi Peel professionally done a few times to help get rid of acne marks that were leftover after a bad cystic acne breakout.&lt;br /&gt;This product worked great, wasn&#x27;t too strong and I only peeled slightly or not at all.&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face with Cetaphil then used Witch Hazel on a cotton ball to start my face with a clean surface. I applied the acid with a cotton ball all over my face and more generously on bad acne spot areas (I also rubbed alittle harder on these spots). The first time I let it sit on my face for a minute, then 2 minutes the next time, then became brave and left it on the full 8 minutes, which did seem to make me peel a little more. Rinse with lots of cold water and be sure you moisturize afterwards or your face will feel really tight and start flaking.I do it once a week at night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I have been researching for a peel that could help reduce my pores and help soften the appearance of my indented acne scars (boxcar &amp; rolling) which my cystic acne left behind during my teenage years for a period of time. Now, i know that a majority of people misconstrue that indented acne scars are from the effect of picking on acne, which is not always the case for most people. My cystic acne was so bad and inflamed during my teenage years that they left indents on my skin, i tried everything, i consulted with a dermatologist who gave me some antibiotics and 2% Salicylic acid cream to apply on my face, i even tried to change my diet but all to no avail, alas when the acne&#x27;s healed, they healed badly resulting to my scarring. Anyways, long story short, my twin sister and i were discussing about skin issue&#x27;s and she recommended that i use this peel as it saved her skin when she was going through a bad phase with acne after her first pregnancy, seeing that she rarely and i mean RARELY breakout nowadays and that her skin is so clean and less oily than mine, i was immediately interested to try out this peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the peel arrived, I decided to wait after my third application to write a review on this peel as I thought it should be more than sufficient time to at least see what it does to my skin. Anyways, the 1st time I use this peel i could only withstand 1 minute of the stinging (yes it does sting, not tingle but STING!! so if you&#x27;re the kind who could not tolerate pain than i suggest to stay away from this peel), after the 1 minute is up i rushed to the bathroom and splashed water all over my face for about a minute until i felt the stinging stopped. The next day i saw new breakouts on my forehead and jawline, it&#x27;s nothing major and the acne calmed down and dried out within 3 days. I also noticed my skin slightly peeled on my cheeks which is totally a good sign thus explains the word PEEL on this product. A week later, when i felt that it&#x27;s safe to applythe peel again, I increased my application time by 30 seconds, the following day i found 2 new breakouts on my forehead and chin which did dry out soon after. I did my 3rd peel last night and this time i tried to brave it out and applied it for 2.5 mins and i saw a little frosting on my forehead, chin and above my lips (the skin below my nose) but it went away after i doused my face with water. I haven&#x27;t noticed any breakouts today and i saw my large pores shrunk tremendously, overall I&#x27;m quiet satisfied with this peel. Yes it did broke me out BUT a majority of Salicylic acid peel users including my twin went through the same phase as i did before seeing great results, so i&#x27;m not disheartened by a few breakouts as it has shown a tremendous improvement on the size of my pores, it has dried out my acne&#x27;s/pimples quickly (there is no acne marks or scars after the acne healed) and my face is now less oily. *Note that I use to have super oily skin, plus i live in Singapore (a VERY HUMID country/environment) therefore my face produce oil like there&#x27;s no tomorrow* I will continue my usage and WILL UPDATE on my progress when i&#x27;m done with this bottle. Below is other products that i use in conjunction to this peel and my current skin regime, hope this helps those of you who are looking to soften your indented acne scars and combat active acne&#x27;s (GOOD LUCK EVERYONE!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a gentle cleanser with cucumber extract for my face wash &amp;#34;BRAND: SAFI&amp;#34; *unfortunately this cleanser is only sold in Singapore and Malaysia* (helps to decrease pores)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Followed by THAYER&#x27;S Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner which i bought here on Amazon *This helps clear my pores, takes off access makeup which my facial wash miss out, it has helped decrease my pores and has helped tighten and smooths the texture of my skin.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I ONLY USE THIS AT NIGHT BEFORE BED AFTER WASHINGMY FACE AND APPLYING THAYER&#x27;S Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner* I USE St. Ives Facial Moisturizer, Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin on my face and neck - layering more under my eyes and on my laugh lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this peel once a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND i use Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay in between my Salicylic acid peel cycle. (The Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay is a clay mask and is best used with Apple Cider Vinegar, it helps extract all the impurities deep within the pores and it leaves your skin radiant and pore free. I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS MASK FOR ALL SKIN TYPES NO MATTER HOW GOOD OF A CONDITION YOUR SKIN IS IN, YOU GUYS SHOULD TRY IT!!) *You can find this mask here on Amazon*</li>
            <li> Works and saves money! I use this once a month and twice a month on my son who is 16. It clears his acne within a day. I am convinced using this initially every week and moving to every two weeks, has made a dramatic difference in his skin and confidence. I administer them but I am sure he is able to do them himself now.</li>
            <li> After all the reviews I just HAD to try this......I was NOT disappointed.  I just completed my 5th peel in 5 wks (I do weekly) I do not have acne, just the occasional pimple.  A lot of blackheads around nose and chin area is my main problem.  Started the peel....left on for 2 minutes the first time.  I thought that my face would be beet red..it wasn&#x27;t.  Gradually left product on longer and now I&#x27;m up to 71/2 minutes.  The blackheads just seem to dry out...and  DISAPPEAR.  The day after peel I am a little red (not bad at all).  2/3 days maybe some flaking... After 4-5 days I see the difference!  I am so excited and happy with this product...I would give it 6 stars. I can go out with NO make-up.  My skin tone is nice and even too!  Make-up goes on smooth like a dream.  Some quick FYI:&lt;br /&gt;- no need to buy neutralizer....just use cool to lukewarm water and rinse, rinse, rinse and rinse some more&lt;br /&gt;- moisturize, moisturize, moisturize when you get done&lt;br /&gt;- SPF, SPF, SPF when your out in the sun</li>
            <li> Dealing with warts is a little like viewing to &amp;#34;dark arts&amp;#34;, there is lots of mystery and hundreds of opinions about what works.  I bought a product at Walgreens, but the vehicle evaporated so fast that the product was useless after about 60%.  I am making progress, and it does not evaporate so quickly as to cause application problems.</li>
            <li> I bought this peel and used it 4 times before leaving this review..The first time on my face, I did not do much, and I purged for two days with acne -- about a week later my skin was clear and a little more oily.  I did it a second time and same result with some dryness.  The third and fourth times (all over 10 days a part), my skin frosted and never recovered.  I got BIG acne and pimples on my face and my face just did not bounce back quickly.  I know have 5-6 big acne scars.  I did it on my back and chest 3 times and no problems there and it even helped clear up and bring to a head those nasty pimples on my back.  I did notice a reduction in my back acne, which returned a  month later.  (Maybe if I kept doing it, it would have wiped it out)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this seems like a decent product if you have active, inflammatory acne and you spot treat on it there.</li>
            <li> Good product, works as described.  Use on my son, and helping clear his skin.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I like to use it on my acne clients skin &amp; sun damage ...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit strong for normal skin.. But I will keep it as a professional product as part if my back bar.. Love it!</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz says don&#x27;t try a chemical peel yourself. Some of these products are too strong. See a professional skin Doc.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product. None of them was realized after using it many times. Now, I stopped using it. I am very frustrated. The product did not improve my skin. Contrary it made some scars darker and more visible. Peeling never happened. I wasted my money. I started to use this Indian Clay thing. And I am very happy for what I am getting out of it. I would recommend Clay instead of this chemical baloney.</li>
            <li> My skin used to tolerate all kinds of harsh chemicals, however I guess with age it&#x27;s gotten more sensitive. I thought this product would help clear out my congested pores but it gave me a horrible bumpy red rash instead. If your skin is very oily it might work for you, but any other skin types should be wary of using this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks with noticeable results.  You have to follow the instructions and use it for a minute the first time then increase the time with each use.  It does sting a little but some cold water fixes that.</li>
            <li> I have found that *nothing* clears up my occasional breakouts better - or faster - than this product. If you&#x27;re one of those people that likes to feel a \\&quot;burn\\&quot; to know that their product is working - this is for you! If I get a breakout (whitehead) I&#x27;ll just put this on it for 5 minutes then rinse it off with cold water and by the end of the day it will be gone; occasionally I&#x27;ve had to do that twice (5 min each time) in one day but really and truly the zit is gone after that. I&#x27;ve used so many other products that have me applying and reapplying for 3 to 4 days with way worse results, so I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with this.</li>
            <li> I have had incredible reduction on my pores. I was frugal with my bottle. just finished it last week. I was using this in congestion with other exfoliating face wash. it&#x27;s too pricy but it works. I could ask for a change - bring down the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this stuff. I am 28 and still get bad, bad acne all over my chin and sometimes on my forehead. It&#x27;s horrible to deal with so I decided to try this along with switching to a more natural face wash and facial lotion and also using a very soft bristle face washing brush to get my face extra clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once a week I use this peel and wow...it&#x27;s great. Yes...it burns like crazy. Actually, I can handle the burning for the 8 minutes. It just feels hot and slightly stings. However, it&#x27;s the washing off part that is horrid. It&#x27;s like once the water touches your face the burning intensifies by ten times. Brings mini tears to my eyes and makes me want to scream bloody murder (I would rather be tattooed on the worst parts of my body). I typically leave my face under a stream of running water for about a minute to get it all off. Best thing to do is take your shower after your minutes are up and rinse off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But ahhhh...after the pain subsides your face will feel soft and soOo clean. Feels like it&#x27;s sucking and killing all the bacteria and after three-four weeks of using it now my chins is completely CLEAR!</li>
            <li> Works well, but you have to get used to the stinging, which can be bothersome.</li>
            <li> I would be careful if you are not a licensed esthetician.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really change my skin other than to make white blotches</li>
            <li> This felt like a weird cross between burning, tingling, and tickling on my face. Definitely follow the instructions when they say to build up to the full amount of time this sits on your face. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my skin but I may not have used it long enough to effect much of a change (only about once a week for three weeks.)</li>
            <li> After a recent breakout (of the kind I had not seen since my early teens), I was left with little pimples and some dark blemishes. By blemishes, I mean dark awful scars that come from frustrated nights of picking and popping! Anyway, I was looking for something and anything that would reduce these &#x27;blemishes&#x27;. This stuff works! The secret is to use a Q-tip to dap on pimples and scars. Do not rub the solution in a circular motion, DAB it on with a tap,tap,tap motion. Rubbing causes a burn and it seemed to make the dark spots darker. Also, I kept the solution only until it started to feel like it was beginning to burn and then I washed it off, and used the neutralizer (VERY IMPORTANT STEP), after I dried my face, I dabbed on a little Tree Tea Oil. Don&#x27;t use this product everyday, because it will make your condition worse. Your skin needs a few days between to heal. Miraculously, the pimples dried up almost overnight and the dark spots have begun to shrink, dry up and flake away. I definately reccommend this product! I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because they need to provide more instructions with how to use the product and if you aren&#x27;t careful, you can really burn yourself.</li>
            <li> my son&#x27;s acne is a real problem. Have tried a popular \\&quot;by mail\\&quot; acne treatment that includes several steps that did not help a bit. This stuff has, at least, improved his condition and lightened some of the redness left by the acne.</li>
            <li> I have just begun using this product.  The product arrived promptly and as described.  I was concerned that it would be harsh and potentially burn my skin...was delightfully surprised that it is very gentle and my skin tolerates it easily.  I think that for me BHA is superior to AHA for my skin-type and I am using this to held reduce blackheads.  I have realistic expectations and hope for a little more glow in my skin and slightly cleaner looking/easier to clean pores.  Will update in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I am planning to do a TCA peel in a couple of months and I am priming my skin with Retin-A and Salicylic Acid peels.  Just started up the Retin-A again this week, so my skin is a bit sensitive.  Last night I decided to skip the Retin-A and do a Salicylic Acid peel again on my face, hands, arms, and chest :).  Well, I really felt the sting on my face this time!  I could only tolerate it for about thirty seconds with the fan on my face. With only 30 seconds, you cant expect much; my skin was a bit tight; when I woke up, it had a very even tone and looked lovely, which is a word I would rarely use to describe my skin :) To be safe, I am going to wait a week and then do another peel.  I will try to leave this one on longer (I will take Ibuprofin first to help the stinging) to help myself work up to the TCA, which is supposed to sting like a mother! :)  Really excited about the process.  The neck, chest, hands and arms didn&#x27;t hurt a bit; left them on for the full eight min.  a little pink in the morning, but very even toned :)  could probably use a stronger % for those areas, but not too worried about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADVICE FOR NEW PEELERS: If you are thinking that you might try a peel for the first time, I would like to encourage you to spend some time getting to understand how chemical peels work so you have an idea of what to expect.  Some of the reviews I see from freaked out people have a great deal to do with them not understanding how chemical peelswork.  For me, the AHA 20% stings a tiny bit, the BHA (sal acid) MUCH more.  If you educate yourself first, you will feel so much better and not freak out if you frost, scab a bit or peel.  Its your face and it is really an emotional thing to go through, especially if you dont know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I have really bad sun damage on my chest which was made worse by my dermatologist freezing off rough spots.  Where my dermatologist had done her work the skin is completely white and makes my dark spots look worse.  Basically my chest looked like I had been in an awful fire.  A plastic surgeon gave me laser treatments which worked but each treatment cost $300 and would lighten an area about the size of the dime.  At that rate I would be spending $30,000 on my chest!  I have been using the Salicylic Acid for about 6 weeks now.  I clean my chest with alcohol first and then dab it all over my chest. I leave it on for about 10 minutes and then rinse it off with cold water. My chest is still not perfect by it certainly has made a huge difference.  The dark spots are definitely lighter and the contrast between the light and dark areas in considerably less noticeable. I plan on ordering more and continuing the therapy.  I have high hopes that this product will continue working and that I will be able to wear something other than turtlenecks all winter!</li>
            <li> good stuff. arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li> I had a blackhead above my eyebrow and after using this peel, it came right to the surface and came right out! It was amazing! Not to mention how SMOOTHE my skin was for days after using this. I just laugh thinking about all the suckers out there that pay $85 for this same treatment at a medi spa. And they have to tip too! Ha!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to help with my acne. Wow, zits be gone! Be careful, it will burn and sting...but it does a number on pimples. I use it once a week and my acne is, after trying everything over the last 20 yrs, finally going away.  Now, I get like one pimple a week...totally manageable. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for helping with blemishes and blackheads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a product nowadays that receives such high reviews, especially when the product is inexpensive and deals with a sensitive issue (appearance).&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews here on Amazon and researching Salicyclic Acid 20% on the internet, the believeable consensus is that this peel works very well. I was completely sold.&lt;br /&gt;After receving the product I tried it for the recommended time with nothing during, nor days after, the application.&lt;br /&gt;Frustrated, I left the peel on my skin the next application for over half an hour with no response. No redness, tingling, peeling, nothing- and obviously no results.&lt;br /&gt;I am kind of in shock about how this product, if anything, isn&#x27;t for beginners, but for me is like putting water on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;While I am dumbfounded, the product did absolutely nothing for me, not even negative things.&lt;br /&gt;Who knows, maybe I have skin as tough as nails.</li>
            <li> This was my 1st peel and I was very happy.&lt;br /&gt;It hurt a bit for the 1st time but was very tolerable afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;This really helped clean my pores and gave my face a nice overall glow.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for noticable results and a stronger peel I highly recommend the TCA peel by Skin Laboratory. 15% TCA.&lt;br /&gt;The salicylic peel helped me get prepared for a stronger peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value and quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never reviewed a product on amazon before even though I rely on them to make purchases. I&#x27;ve used this product 4 times in the last week and a half for the whole 8 mins. I have scaring on my cheeks from acne I&#x27;ve had my whole life, I&#x27;m now 25 and still get it alot. Just after these few applications alot of my scaring has lightened considerably. It&#x27;s not gone but it&#x27;s alot lighter. Makeup wasn&#x27;t covering the scars but now they are hardly noticeable without makeup. I&#x27;m very impressed and so thankful finally something is working! Make sure you have a great moisturizer to put on after the application, you&#x27;ll need it. Oh and for the burning part it&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s not tolerable to help your skin.</li>
            <li> Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)&lt;br /&gt;Skin Laboratory&lt;br /&gt;The product does work. The product is gentle on the skin if used according to the directions..</li>
            <li> I agree with all the positive reviews about this product.  I did want to add that in my case, I could see the skin breaking up and wanting to peel but it just was not happening.  I am Hispanic with olive skin.  My skin is thick and oily and has tolerated many peels.  So, I contacted the company that makes this peel and they answered me right away.  Were very nice and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you skin is not peeling, you can apply a second coat or layer after about 5-6 minutes.  Leave second coat on for another 4-9 minutes or not to exceed 9-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After doing the layering 2 times, I finally peeled and was very careful to wear high sun block, hat, sunglasses and no rides in convertibles or sun-roofed vehicles.  This is very very important as this layering causes a deeper peel and consequently more sensitive new skin. This is not to say that you have to be super careful forever but just until the new skin has been exposed for a while.  Boat rides, sking, swimming pools, beach without a some protection from the sun could damage the skin.  My skin is very smooth and clear now.  I had suffered from hyperpigmentation, acne, fine lines and large pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did talk to my esthetician about this product and she highly recommends it but stresses the importance of going easy.  She also said it is a good idea to get a facial done with extractions when using this product.  The clogged pores and acne will come out real easy and your skin will be super super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product and a wonderful way for getting medical office results at home for a fraction of the cost.  Be patient, consistent and very very careful and you will be rewarded.</li>
            <li> I would recommend seeking a dermatologist first before buying this product. I had an allergic reaction to it, so it wasn&#x27;t the best fit for me</li>
            <li> This salicylic acid was exactly what I needed to get rid of pesky closed comedones along my chin.  My chin is usually clear, but after an allergic reaction to a new makeup, I had these small pimply bumps on my skin I just couldn&#x27;t get rid of.  Aggressive treatment with this stuff did the trick.  This product is strong, and you should use it with caution.  Do NOT take any sun while you&#x27;re using this, you will burn yourself.  But as a last ditch effort to eliminate your pimples, give this treatment a try.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product after reading all of the great reviews on it.&lt;br /&gt;I used this as directed following all of the steps in the instructions for the maximum recommened time (8 minutes) and had no noticable results.  This made my face tingle a little bit when on, but it did not burn like I read about.  I figured my skin may be used to Salicylic Acid since I have been using cleaners containing salicyclic acid since my early teens.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this again mulitple times (used once a week for about 8 weeks) and increased the time I left on every time, finally leaving it on for a half hour the last time I used it.  Still no results.  In fact, my breakouts seem to have increased since I&#x27;ve used this product.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed with the performace of this product for myself. Not saying it won&#x27;t work for others, I&#x27;m just assuming my skin is to used to salicylic acid and I need to get a stronger peel for results :(</li>
