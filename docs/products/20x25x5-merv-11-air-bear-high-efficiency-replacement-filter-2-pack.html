            <li>Perfect fit.. love the product..</li>
            <li>Product works great and is easy to install</li>
            <li>It is great fit in my furnace.</li>
            <li>Even my furnace man liked them.  </li>
            <li>and I ordered my own, plus I found an A/C man I can trust not to rip me off.</li>
            <li>The form and fit were good.  </li>
            <li>They fit as they should and do a good job.  </li>
            <li>Just the right size and a really great filter.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I needed and for a great price I was able to get 2 air filters.</li>
            <li>It was a replacement for an Ultravation filter which has foam strips at the top and bottom which this did not.</li>
            <li>These filters do an outstanding job of keeping dust out.   </li>

            <li>Easy to install.  </li>
            <li>This was easy to install and functions as an air filter.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The replacement does fit and appears to be working fine.</li>
            <li>Its description was accurate.</li>
            <li>I had to force this into my furnace to fit because I didn&#x27;t want the hassle of returning it.  </li>
            <li>and shipping included, They work as prescribed and fit snug</li>
            <li>The higher MERV rating provides better filtering and that&#x27;s what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li>Original Trion 255649-102 filters are listed at a height of 19 3/4\\&quot; whereas these are listed here as 19 5/8\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It meets or exceeds the original product.</li>
            <li>These filters will replace the original Air Bears</li>
            <li>Most of my experiences with Amazon.com have been very good, but this time Amazon.com has really let me down.</li>
            <li>The label on the filters say they are good for only 3 months.</li>
            <li>overall I think it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>Product works fine and consistent with the description.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>However, I needed it quickly, I had to keep it.</li>
            <li>The product always seems of solid quality, fits great and a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Received in less time than expected...was just what I ordered and at a great price compared to others...</li>
            <li>My heater take pricy filters and it is nice to be able to buy replacements at much less expense.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and exactly right.</li>
            <li>My old filter has as many pleats as the one pictured.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price from this vendor is certainly worth giving these a shot being 1/4 the cost, delivered, of what 2 of the originals would have cost.  </li>
            <li>but these were good value compared to other sites I searched.</li>
            <li>Price is right too.  </li>
            <li>The sizing was right on.</li>
            <li>These filters are exactly what we needed.  </li>
            <li>Considering that Home Depot have only one model (Honeywell) of the MERV 11 filter (and my local store doesn&#x27;t even carry the size I needed), and it&#x27;s already a good 40% higher than Amazon...</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed at a decent price!</li>
            <li>A little sturdier cardboard packaging would have been nice, as they were banged up a bit in delivery.  </li>
            <li>Item was packed very well, even if it&#x27;s made of cardboard, there was no dents or damages to the filter.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price, thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>If your system uses this type of filer it is much easier to change than the unit with the combs in it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>The door wants to keep popping out after putting the filter in.  </li>
            <li>Its&#x27;s a cheap knock off that is smaller than advertised.</li>
            <li>The Merv 11 is affordable and comes 2 to a box, also fits much tighter preventing dust from escaping through into our home.</li>
            <li>In order get it to seal properly, I had to cut the top and bottom off of my old filter and stuff them in the filter housing with the new filter.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how effective</li>
            <li>I have asthma and needed a high efficiency filter for my Air Bear system.</li>
            <li>This filter is not quite as wide as the original</li>
            <li>I usually get the MERV11 filters, the more the MERV rating the finer dust particles are captured.</li>
            <li>These specific air filters are somewhat difficult to find but with Amazon I was able to have them delivered pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The filter does have less pleats than the original filter</li>
            <li>The filters are clearly labelled MERV 8 and not MERV 11.</li>
            <li>Actual air bear brand fillters are very comparable in price, so buy those instead.</li>
            <li>had them leave the old filter</li>
            <li>We origonally had electric air filters that would constantly snap periodically and had to be cleaned often as we live in the suburbs, [country].  </li>
            <li>Minor repair necessary due to both filters suffering a bit of crushing that I assume happened during shipping.  </li>
            <li>No five-star rating just because I find it a bit tough to say &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; about an air filter.  </li>
            <li>These filters fit nicely, no complaints.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that stated MERV 11 compliance was on the external shipping box label, so who knows what the MERV level of the actual contents really were.</li>
            <li>My old filter, which I purchased locally, also has 21 pleats.</li>

            <li> My old filter, which I purchased locally, also has 21 pleats.</li>
            <li> We just pushed/pulled them out a bit, and barring a few small dents, they work fine.</li>
            <li> Not quite as big as it says, so it fits loosely in the slot.  </li>
            <li> Filter is smaller, thinner, and lighter than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Just got them today and after minor repairs have installed one in my unit.  </li>
            <li> Not happy about it though, as it didn&#x27;t quite fit the furnace as tightly as my \\&quot;Air Bear&#x27; filter did, and I wonder if it&#x27;s as efficient.  </li>
            <li> the next day if the order is placed by 5PM the previous day,[...].</li>
            <li> the construction is pretty sloppy / border-line.</li>
            <li> The size is a little too smaller (19.x, 24.x, 4.x)</li>
            <li> The widely spaced pleats were obvious out of the box but the 80% number took a little figuring since my filter is also horizontally pleated instead of vertically as in the picture.  </li>
            <li> Read carefully about what you are getting.</li>
            <li> The filter itself is slightly too long for the Air Bear box.  </li>
            <li> Other filters that I have bought from my HVAC contractor have a MERV 11 certification on the filter.  </li>
            <li> Never had this problem with other filters.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have reported, the number of pleats are about half of what&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li> of the filters I received was also slightly shorter than the other.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase a filter locally because it was 4-1/2&amp;#34; thick instead of 5&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> less material).  </li>
            <li> As others have mentioned before, the filter has less number of pleats than what is the picture that has been posted by the seller.</li>
            <li> This translates to about a 30% loss of surface area, which also means this is a much less efficient air filter.</li>
            <li> In addition, I previously had a filter measuring 20x25x5</li>
            <li> I saw the price that was lower than where I usually buy, but with the over $ 20 price shipping it was almost the same price compared to where I usually get.</li>
            <li> I tried and tried and ended up damaging the filter a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Little dust in house.  </li>
            <li> where x is less than the filter I usually get.</li>
            <li> I ordered the size I usually get, but the filter would not fit into the space.  </li>
            <li> With the MERV 11 filters I have seen a decline in the number of times my four year old daughter catches cold and allergies.</li>
            <li> The seller ships very quickly usually</li>
            <li> Look up on line provided wrong size and had to use other filter material to make do.  </li>
            <li> one is thin as well.  </li>
            <li> The filter is flimsy and poorly constructed.  </li>
            <li> While this may be an unintentional misrepresentation, I am not happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Unable to salave boxed filters</li>
            <li> As a filer goes it is dirty when I change it</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Came quickly and exactly right.</li>
            <li> The product description says Purolator.  The product shipped is not a Purolator product but rather a \\&quot;replacement for\\&quot;.  They should not advertise \\&quot;Purolator\\&quot; if the product being sold is not Purolator.</li>
            <li> We researched prices and this was the best - works beautifully - fits well - came on time - would buy again</li>
            <li> Filters arrived and looked as advertised.  It was a replacement for an Ultravation filter which has foam strips at the top and bottom which this did not. The replacement does fit and appears to be working fine.</li>
            <li> Do not buy! I just received the filters and they are not Air Bear brand and they are not MERV 11 as advertised. The filters are clearly labelled MERV 8 and not MERV 11. The higher MERV rating provides better filtering and that&#x27;s what I thought I was getting. As other reviewers have reported, the number of pleats are about half of what&#x27;s pictured. The label on the filters say they are good for only 3 months. Filters in this price range should last longer. Most of my experiences with Amazon.com have been very good, but this time Amazon.com has really let me down.</li>
            <li> Received in less time than expected...was just what I ordered and at a great price compared to others...would purchase from them again...</li>
            <li> The filter I received only has about 80% of the number of pleats as that pictured (ie. less material).  The widely spaced pleats were obvious out of the box but the 80% number took a little figuring since my filter is also horizontally pleated instead of vertically as in the picture.  I have 13 horizontal pleats.  My old filter has as many pleats as the one pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the filters I received was also slightly shorter than the other.  In order get it to seal properly, I had to cut the top and bottom off of my old filter and stuff them in the filter housing with the new filter.  Original Trion 255649-102 filters are listed at a height of 19 3/4\\&quot; whereas these are listed here as 19 5/8\\&quot; (and my short one is only 19 1/2\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> I had to force this into my furnace to fit because I didn&#x27;t want the hassle of returning it.  It is a quarter inch too fat and next time I will stick with honeywell.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly. Its description was accurate. It is great fit in my furnace. I will definately purchase these filters again from this company.</li>
            <li> I ordered the size I usually get, but the filter would not fit into the space.  I tried and tried and ended up damaging the filter a little bit.  I had to send it back.  I hope I can get some money back.  It was a whole lot of trouble for nothing.</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent value for the money.  It meets or exceeds the original product.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly on my Carrier AC/Furnace. No issues installing or operating the furnace.  Item was packed very well, even if it&#x27;s made of cardboard, there was no dents or damages to the filter.  Considering that Home Depot have only one model (Honeywell) of the MERV 11 filter (and my local store doesn&#x27;t even carry the size I needed), and it&#x27;s already a good 40% higher than Amazon... overall I think it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned before, the filter has less number of pleats than what is the picture that has been posted by the seller. It also does not have any \\&quot;Air Bear\\&quot; brand name on the frame of the filter. Have already contacted the Amazon.com customer service and notified them so they can take the proper actions.</li>
            <li> I always buy these on line as I can get two for the price of one at a big box store. and shipping included, They work as prescribed and fit snug</li>
            <li> Perfect fit I will order this item  again when.</li>
            <li> Product works fine and consistent with the description.  Will be reordering.  These filters fit nicely, no complaints.  Can&#x27;t beat the price, thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I received a different brand. (AFB-AIR FILTER BUY)  I ordered \\&quot;Air Bear\\&quot; filters.  However, I needed it quickly, I had to keep it. Not happy about it though, as it didn&#x27;t quite fit the furnace as tightly as my \\&quot;Air Bear&#x27; filter did, and I wonder if it&#x27;s as efficient.  I feel I got ripped off!! So what happens from here? Will you send me the correct filters?? It&#x27;s what I paid for!!! Won&#x27;t order again, unless this is dealt with.</li>
            <li> Works well to filter house dust and impurities.  Little dust in house.  Easy to install.  Price is right too.  Affordable.</li>
            <li> If your system uses this type of filer it is much easier to change than the unit with the combs in it.  As a filer goes it is dirty when I change it so I guess it works.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit.. love the product..</li>
            <li> We have been ordering these for years now and have never had any issues.  The product always seems of solid quality, fits great and a reasonable price.  We will continue to order these filters.</li>
            <li> The efficiency of these filters is comparable to none. I usually get the MERV11 filters, the more the MERV rating the finer dust particles are captured. With the MERV 11 filters I have seen a decline in the number of times my four year old daughter catches cold and allergies. These filters do an outstanding job of keeping dust out.   The seller ships very quickly usually the next day if the order is placed by 5PM the previous day,[...].</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed and for a great price I was able to get 2 air filters. These specific air filters are somewhat difficult to find but with Amazon I was able to have them delivered pretty quickly. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> The form and fit were good.  The delivery was prompt.  The only concern was that there was no MERV 11 marking on the filters.  Other filters that I have bought from my HVAC contractor have a MERV 11 certification on the filter.  The only thing that stated MERV 11 compliance was on the external shipping box label, so who knows what the MERV level of the actual contents really were.</li>
            <li> The filter itself is slightly too long for the Air Bear box.  The door wants to keep popping out after putting the filter in.  Never had this problem with other filters.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Beware these are not air bear brand and the seller charges a hefty 20% restocking ree!  Read carefully about what you are getting. Actual air bear brand fillters are very comparable in price, so buy those instead.</li>
            <li> Excellent filter and excellent price. I have asthma and needed a high efficiency filter for my Air Bear system.</li>
            <li> These filters will replace the original Air Bears but I don&#x27;t think they are the same quality.  These will do the job.</li>
            <li> These filters are exactly what we needed.  They fit as they should and do a good job.  A little sturdier cardboard packaging would have been nice, as they were banged up a bit in delivery.  We just pushed/pulled them out a bit, and barring a few small dents, they work fine.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this filter, I assumed that it would be as pictured. However when I counted the actual pleats in this filter, there were only 15; the picture showed 21. My old filter, which I purchased locally, also has 21 pleats. This translates to about a 30% loss of surface area, which also means this is a much less efficient air filter. While this may be an unintentional misrepresentation, I am not happy with this product!</li>
            <li> This filter is not quite as wide as the original but it is servicable for the price we have paid</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed at a decent price! Will order again soon if the price stays 30 for 2 filters!</li>
            <li> Not quite as big as it says, so it fits loosely in the slot.  Not sure how effective a filter is if the air can pass around it.  Size on the box reads the dimensions shown but then in smaller print there is a disclaimer that provides actual size, which is of course smaller.</li>
            <li> Product works great and is easy to install</li>
            <li> Look up on line provided wrong size and had to use other filter material to make do.  Unable to salave boxed filters</li>
            <li> The product description says &amp;#34;Air Bear&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Purolator&amp;#34; in the description and it&#x27;s neither. Its&#x27;s a cheap knock off that is smaller than advertised. Won&#x27;t make this mistake again!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t comment on the performance of this as I don&#x27;t have ability to measure it but these were good value compared to other sites I searched.</li>
            <li> Filter is smaller, thinner, and lighter than I expected.  I didn&#x27;t purchase a filter locally because it was 4-1/2&amp;#34; thick instead of 5&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;This one is thin as well.  Think I just pick up the next ones at Lowe&#x27;s or Home Depot.</li>
            <li> This was easy to install and functions as an air filter.  I do not have the ability to test to see how well it removes particles, but my AC is functioning so I assume it is working properly.  Easy to install.</li>
            <li> The filter is flimsy and poorly constructed.  In addition, I previously had a filter measuring 20x25x5 and it fit my unit perfectly.  This filter didn&#x27;t come close.  I DO NOT recommend buying this product even though the price is very attractive.</li>
            <li> Great replacement filters at a good price. My heater take pricy filters and it is nice to be able to buy replacements at much less expense.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest filer ever and kind of had to squish it into place, but seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> These air filters are exaxctly as stated in the product description.  They were a good price for box filters.  The sizing was right on.</li>
            <li> The size is a little too smaller (19.x, 24.x, 4.x) where x is less than the filter I usually get. I saw the price that was lower than where I usually buy, but with the over $ 20 price shipping it was almost the same price compared to where I usually get. Never buy again.</li>
            <li> Fit was perfect.  Just the right size and a really great filter.  Even my furnace man liked them.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Several years back the A/C maintenance company ordered the filter and charge me $160.&lt;br /&gt;I had them leave the old filter and I ordered my own, plus I found an A/C man I can trust not to rip me off.</li>
            <li> We origonally had electric air filters that would constantly snap periodically and had to be cleaned often as we live in the suburbs, [country].  The Merv 11 is affordable and comes 2 to a box, also fits much tighter preventing dust from escaping through into our home.</li>
            <li> great price for a quality filter</li>
            <li> It does the job but you can tell its mass produced, the quality isnt as good as it used to be</li>
            <li> This is a great price for a replacement filter of this type. Very quick delivery. The price was the best I have seen</li>
            <li> Great arrived on time and keeping my home from harmful allergines.</li>
            <li> Considering it&#x27;s a throw-away air filter, the quailty is - acceptable. For emphasizing &amp;#34;Made in America&amp;#34; ?? the construction is pretty sloppy / border-line.</li>
            <li> Just got them today and after minor repairs have installed one in my unit.  Minor repair necessary due to both filters suffering a bit of crushing that I assume happened during shipping.  The filter does have less pleats than the original filter but how many pleats does one need?  The price from this vendor is certainly worth giving these a shot being 1/4 the cost, delivered, of what 2 of the originals would have cost.  No five-star rating just because I find it a bit tough to say &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; about an air filter.  I&#x27;ll look in on it in 6 months to see how it&#x27;s holding up and, if necessary, update this review.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product because of the cost savings and in my case this fit perfectly into my system.</li>
