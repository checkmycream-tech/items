            <li> I have tried several different kinds of Pre de Provence soaps and they are all wonderful.  It is not easy to find French-pressed soaps locally and I was thrilled to find this product on Amazon.  This is the only brand of soap that I now buy.  The smells are subtle but nice, and the French-pressing assures that they last for a long time.</li>
            <li> while I agree the soap lathers nicely, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I was hoping for much more long lasting rose scent. I could only smell the roses for the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> This soap smells very nice.  However, it does leave my skin feeling a bit tight when I get out of the shower.  I don&#x27;t like this feeling on my body.  My face, yes, my body, no.</li>
            <li> I gave this soap to my wife and she loves it.  The French soap is very high quality and has a great fragrance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking when I bought this soap.  I like the smell of roses, but I like it in small doses, such as when I&#x27;m leaning down to smell one.  This soap, true to its description, smells like roses.  It might be too rosey for some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will attest to the genuineness of its ingredients.  While walking toward campus last week, I managed to attract a rather tenacious bee on the way from the parking lot... at the end of October.  I can&#x27;t be certain, but I think that bee picked up on my scent and wanted a piece of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll stick with the honey almond and mint leaf varieties from now on.  If you really like roses, this might be the soap for you.</li>
            <li> I really liked these soaps, and the quality of Pre de Provence.  They are fantastic scents and made my skin quite smooth and soft.  I plan to purchase more eventually.  I really liked the scents of Rose Petal, Coconut, Peony, Lavender, and Honey Almond.  I recommend these soaps highly as a gift for a friend or for yourself.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is probably the nicest soap I&#x27;ve ever used. The lather is so soft and luxurious, and the rose fragrance is lovely but not overpowering. Definitely will purchase again (and again).</li>
            <li> smells okay, but made for  a lumberjack&#x27;s hand!  will have to cut it down in order to hold on to it in shower.</li>
            <li> This is the good stuff, the right kind of rose scent, a giant bar, lasts a long time, the right balance.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, high quality soap, wide spectrum of scents... Leaves skin incredibly soft and fragrant. Pricey, but worth every penny</li>
            <li> These are nice soaps, I like the Milk Scent and especially Lavender now the Rose</li>
            <li> Smells just like roses, and has kept it&#x27;s fragrance throughout it&#x27;s entire usage. It is certainly the loveliest soap I&#x27;ve ever had. Can&#x27;t wait to buy more!</li>
            <li> I love this triple milled soap.  The bars are huge.  The soap smells luscious , and it leaves my skin feeling soft.  In addition, it lasts much longer than regular soaps.  A wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of rose petals and the lather of this soap, and I enjoy feeling fresh and clean after using it. And it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dried out like some of the cheaper fragrance soaps. The petals embedded in it seem to help me hold it in my hand while showering. Highly recommended to anyone enjoying true rose fragrance.</li>
            <li> This soap is aromatherapy and body therapy!  I look forward to my shower daily.  It lathers well and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> Truly sensual and light rose fragrance.  Delicate and welcome.&lt;br /&gt;Buying an unknown product is always a gamble.  This rose petal soap quality made me happy.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap. Smells great, lasts a log time, and lathers up really well. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This large bar is very fragrant with rose scent. The smell fills the room where it is stored. I was happy when this bar was finished as its scent is overpowering.</li>
            <li> I like the Rose petal but my first choice is the lavender. Any of the soaps you get from here are great though.</li>
            <li> Upon recieving this soap..I was confused in part to the picture on the site,was one of a dark pink solid bar. No rosy scent at all just smidgents of rose petals. Weleda has a stronger scented 3.5 bar if that&#x27;s what you desire. Big bar..</li>
            <li> Love this soap as it is luxurious, indulgent, and a total sensory experience. The scent is exactly as Rose Petals would be, and it is a wonderfully soft scent, just right, not overpowering or fake. Just perfect and leaves my skin pampered and wanting more.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the rose soap.  It is very creamy and luxurious with a wonderful, strong scent of roses.  The bars last forever. I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Apparant thin layer of rose fragrance disappears quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over 6.00 for a bar of soap (even though it is a big bar) was expensive for me. But for the first  few days,it really did have a great rose aroma. Then it seemed like that top layer just washed away and after about a week, that great rose fragrance was gone.</li>

            <li> This soap has lasted much longer than I expected and it still has the lovely scent.</li>
            <li> smells great. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> All of the Provence soaps I have purchased have been accurately described .  The shipping and packaging is very good.  I use this soap on a daily basis and the fragrance has remained the same since purchase.</li>
