    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the BEST shaving product Ive ever used!  </li>
            <li>Its performance is spotty (literally) at best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s got to be good!  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s happy with it, I&#x27;m not.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think any electric razor can give you the smoothness of a BIC, but this one is great.</li>
            <li>The design is also great, it looks very nice in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this product I am buying 9 more to give as Christmas gifts to all the girls in my office and my two daughters!</li>
            <li>To my dismay, it didn&#x27;t look as good as it did in the pictures.  </li>
            <li>Good luck with that.</li>
            <li>If you like electrics, this is a good machine.</li>
            <li>she suggests that the lady razors they make just never are as good as a mens razor for whatever reason.  </li>
            <li>The ergonomical handle is comfortable to hold and the on/off switch is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This electric shaver is as good as any others that I have used.</li>
            <li>My legs feel just as smooth after shaving with this product as with the razor blade and the best part</li>
            <li>She is very pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>When I first got this shaver I was impressed.</li>
            <li>that leave the skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this product for over 5 (or is it more?)</li>
            <li>The next time I used it with a shaving gel in the shower and it worked perfect.  </li>
            <li>Had to replace it with something better.</li>
            <li>oh so cute there is nothing cute about what it does to your skin.</li>
            <li>You are better off buying disposable razor&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It was like the shaver didn&#x27;t shave any hair at all;not even close to a smooth shave!  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 1 week and find that it works better for me with a shaving cream or soap.</li>
            <li>This is quick  and so easy I am amazed!</li>
            <li>It runs fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for last minute touch-ups on your way to work or whatever.</li>
            <li>Superior design, compact, safety sealed for complete immersability.</li>
            <li>Like \\&quot;Amazon Shopper\\&quot; I too read many good reviews on this electric razor--both on amazon.com and several magazines.</li>
            <li>I have very fine light hair on my legs and most electric shavers have done great for me in the past.</li>
            <li>It is also an attractive design and holds the charge for a really long time.</li>
            <li>It is not user friendly.  </li>
            <li>This electric razor is okay-- very good on delicate underarms, but does not give a close shave on legs.</li>
            <li>This by far is one of the best personal care products I have purchased!  </li>
            <li>However, I am young enough to want to look my best.  </li>
            <li>I saw a commercial for this razor and was leary, but I did some research and read some good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Although the instuctions said to use the shaver for at least a month before you will get the best results</li>
            <li>and I had to make several passes before I got good results.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver about a year ago, used it a couple times with mediochre results and tossed it in a box with a bunch of other products that didn&#x27;t prove to work great.   </li>
            <li>With no irritation I was able to put lotion on my sensitive skin and my legs are silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty good for an electric, especially as it&#x27;s wet/dry.</li>
            <li>The shaving guard thing in the middle got all warped from trying to take it off for cleaning and the blades on the top and bottom end serve NO purpose!  </li>
            <li>and I think you will enjoy it as much as I have.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m going to stick with my blades and not waste more money trying to find an electric razor that gives a close shave.</li>
            <li>me, as an emergency-only option, it&#x27;s been worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Mine didn&#x27;t cut worth anything, and then it broke when dropped.  </li>
            <li>it just is not cutting the hairs anymore.  </li>
            <li>but it does a wonderful job on the small fine hairs in the facial area.</li>
            <li>Moi for Me went right into the trash.</li>
            <li>It worked GREAT the first few times that I used it.  </li>
            <li>The shaver head is much easier to use &amp; clean</li>
            <li>Because my legs are so sensitive and often break out in a rash with regular shaving, I find this to be a good alternative.</li>
            <li>It took well over a year (and alot of abuse) before my first Moi for</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this razor 3 times now, thats how much I like it!</li>
            <li>It works well under the arms if you use baby powder, in fact for me it worked better than a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>I charged it for the required 16 hours and then took it into the shower for the first time.  </li>
            <li>so I tried it on her leg and no matter how many times i ran it over an area, it felt exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to clean, the battery lasts a long time...</li>
            <li>it went it first</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair to Norelco, i use a mens norelco on my face every day and have had it for about 5 years and have only recently considered replacing it.</li>
            <li>The shave was almost as smooth as a blade and much safer for a quick dry shave showing no irritation.  </li>
            <li>+ inch growth, wet and dry, with the same flawless results.</li>
            <li>It really looks like I haven&#x27;t shaved when I am finished.  </li>
            <li>The razor is very tricky.  </li>
            <li>This razor was a gift, but it didn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li>This one is VERY painfull, as it \\&quot;shaves\\&quot; you it also scrapes your skin.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed in Norelco and tossed this shaver into the trash can.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight and compact, easy to grip and maneuver, handles bumps, curves, and edges flawlessly, has no problem with tight or awkward spots, holds a charge for weeks, and, most importantly, gives a silky smooth shave, wet or dry, every time!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been leary of women&#x27;s shavers, since my past experiences haven&#x27;t been good, but Norelco&#x27;s new \\&quot;Moi for</li>
            <li>Hopefully it gets even better after 21 days as has been the experience of other users.</li>
            <li>This product has allowed me to shave my legs, safely and thoroughly after I step out of the shower, before I completely towel dry.  </li>
            <li>Although the electric shaver is compact, has a long battery life and can be used in the shower, It does NOT give you a close &amp; smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap cheap razor, you get what you pay for, and there is a reason that this costs less than a ten pack of replacement blades for your real razor.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a decent shave, this product will not help you.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Does a fabulous job, even dry and no scraped skin!</li>
            <li>and they sent me a new guard.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s loud, and doesn&#x27;t charge properly, or even fit in its charger properly</li>
            <li>It is pretty convenient for daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The unit comes with a very cool and unique charging base, which can be stored away easily or mounted.  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor at a filene&#x27;s near my home and without having read any of these reviews online.</li>
            <li>It does not shave all leg hair completely off</li>
            <li>On my legs (which had hair) it completely missed the hairs.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the results.  </li>
            <li>I am 50 years old and have tried ever method of removing the hair on my legs.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my more sensitive and delicate areas-</li>
            <li>The first time (and each time after) I used the shaver I got almost the same results as with a traditional disposable razor, which blew me away.  </li>
            <li>But please, do not go by the GLOWING review that is posted twice on this site--it is very clearly written by an employee of the manufacturer (note all the specific details, like the person is reciting lines from the manual!).</li>
            <li>The unit has to be charged for 16 hours before the first use and you don&#x27;t have to charge it again until it runs down (Norelco suggests that the battery been completely used before charging it).  </li>
            <li>I had order this razor because it  was the only electric razor available for women,   needless to say it wasn&#x27;t worth my time.</li>
            <li>When my eyes got older, shaving got harder.</li>
            <li>and that is where it REALLY outshines all other razors!  </li>
            <li>If the foil should become damaged (very delicate and can bend easily) you&#x27;ll have to replace it.  </li>
            <li>well there are some good and some bad reviews about this item.</li>

            <li> well there are some good and some bad reviews about this item.</li>
            <li> The new guard fell off less than 5 minutes after I put it on.  </li>
            <li> My only issue so far is that the shaver doesn&#x27;t work as well on dry skin as it does with wet soapy skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves stubble 1/8 of an inch long which totally looks like you haven&#x27;t shaved.  </li>
            <li> However, it is not nearly as close a shave as a blade.</li>
            <li> and then it leaves long stubs.</li>
            <li> It does, however, hold a charge a long time.  </li>
            <li> The little metal teeth seem to serve no other purpose but to \\&quot;exfoliate\\&quot; as you shave wich</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it does miss a few hairs and that occasionally I have had ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> After running the razor up and down and back and forth over my legs for 20 minutes I could still see and feel the hair.  </li>
            <li> I have tried wet, I have tried dry, I have tried with and without shaving gel</li>
            <li> It will not easily trim morning stubble but it will work on hairs long enough to wax.</li>
            <li> however I fear I would have little skin left the shave after a month of using.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s because it sucks and doesn&#x27;t work!  </li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it isn&#x27;t a bad razor</li>
            <li> YOu have to squeeze the trimming blades to get the cutting block out.  </li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate buy this now you will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> well how bad can it be?</li>
            <li> I purchased the razor hoping that it would allow me to ditch the painful razor.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the testers at Norelco let this product go on the market! :(</li>
            <li> the shaver dug the charging base out of my trunk and charged it up.  </li>
            <li> is very painful.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This razor gave me the WORST shave of my life!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas - she says, \\&quot;It is the worst electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> It is about time that someone has made a shaver for females that does cut your leggs and doesn&#x27;t smell terrible and doesn&#x27;t require you to shave for 10 mintues on each leg.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, it has been 21 days and still terrible.</li>
            <li> This razor is horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this razor because I read the other reviews and people said that it shaved just like their blade or they got a close shave etc.  I can tell you this did not give me a close shave.  After running the razor up and down and back and forth over my legs for 20 minutes I could still see and feel the hair.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it isn&#x27;t a bad razor but I&#x27;m going to stick with my blades and not waste more money trying to find an electric razor that gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> Although this razor looks sleek and cool, it performs horribly. I have used it a couple times, and afterwards it&#x27;s like I didn&#x27;t even shave at all! I go over areas 5-6 times, and the hair is still there! It even managed to cut my skin while my hair stayed intact. I would not recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST shaving product Ive ever used!  It is lightweight and compact, easy to grip and maneuver, handles bumps, curves, and edges flawlessly, has no problem with tight or awkward spots, holds a charge for weeks, and, most importantly, gives a silky smooth shave, wet or dry, every time!  Ive been using this product for over 5 (or is it more?) years now, and couldnt be happier with it.     Ive used it on daily stubble and 1/2 + inch growth, wet and dry, with the same flawless results. I&#x27;m Eastern European so I&#x27;m no fine-haired frauline (however you spell that) either. I also use it on my more sensitive and delicate areas- and that is where it REALLY outshines all other razors!  It took well over a year (and alot of abuse) before my first Moi for Me razor dulled and the foil needed to be replaced.    I&#x27;ve bought this razor 3 times now, thats how much I like it! (one was lost, one was stolen)</li>
            <li> Instructions were charge for 16 hrs., however, it never charged.  I had order this razor because it  was the only electric razor available for women,   needless to say it wasn&#x27;t worth my time.</li>
            <li> I have tried and tried to get my razor to charge and it will not do so.  Since I did away with the packaging I did not think it could be returned so I am indebted for $28.00 for a product that does not work.  As you can imagine, I am not very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I always have trouble cutting myself and with razor burn and irritation with regular razors.  I do not have this problem with this razor.  It works well under the arms if you use baby powder, in fact for me it worked better than a regular razor.  The only drawback is that it does miss a few hairs and that occasionally I have had ingrown hairs.  Because my legs are so sensitive and often break out in a rash with regular shaving, I find this to be a good alternative.</li>
            <li> I read the negative reviews and ignored them.  I chose to be optimistic and believe that this product would be ok.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> You might be thinking... well there are some good and some bad reviews about this item. ANd like I did, you might be thinking, well how bad can it be? I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not as bad as they say. Think again! Those people were telling the truth. This razor gave me the WORST shave of my life! No kidding! And it&#x27;s loud, and doesn&#x27;t charge properly, or even fit in its charger properly so while you think it&#x27;s charging it&#x27;s actually not and have to constantly press it back in. I feel robbed of my $15! just spend that money on something else. trust me, you&#x27;d be a lot happier! uggh.. i don&#x27;t know how to convince you anymore, except: Seriously people!! DON\\&quot;T BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor at a filene&#x27;s near my home and without having read any of these reviews online. I still keep it as a back-up for when I lose my regular razor. It does work but it&#x27;s not ideal for everyday maintnance. It will not easily trim morning stubble but it will work on hairs long enough to wax. You can use it for shorter stubble but it&#x27;ll take you a few passes. It&#x27;ll trim hairs short enough to feel but not see. &lt;br /&gt;For me, as an emergency-only option, it&#x27;s been worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Moi razer for about a month.  I have tried wet, I have tried dry, I have tried with and without shaving gel I can&#x27;t seem to get a close shave.  It really looks like I haven&#x27;t shaved when I am finished.  I am very disappointed and would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and shaving with a razor is painful, so I can only do it once a week.  I saw a commercial for this razor and was leary, but I did some research and read some good reviews.  I purchased the razor hoping that it would allow me to ditch the painful razor.  Oh, I was so wrong!  Please, don&#x27;t buy this razor.  It does not give a close shave at all!  You have to go over spots over and over and still nothing happens.  So, by the time you get done, your legs will still be hairy and they will be all red.  It leaves stubble 1/8 of an inch long which totally looks like you haven&#x27;t shaved.  You can&#x27;t wear shorts, swimsuits, nothing.  Plus, the battery dies all time when I am in the middle of shaving, even though I charge it properly.  If you are looking for a decent shave, this product will not help you.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my wife. She uses it in the shower. It does not shave all leg hair completely off but it does a wonderful job on the small fine hairs in the facial area. She is very pleased with this shaver. We plan to buy another one when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> Never a \\&quot;primper\\&quot;, shaving always was a dreaded task! Sometimes I&#x27;d let it go until the leg hair tangled into my socks! When my eyes got older, shaving got harder. I&#x27;ve tried other electric shavers in the past... scaping my skin but leaving the hair. Moi has changed all of that! The Norelco money back offer convinced me to try it. I&#x27;m sold! Does a fabulous job, even dry and no scraped skin! Superior design, compact, safety sealed for complete immersability. I love it! Pricey though... I hope it lasts.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on this site and thought I would take a chance. I thought it was the cutest thing ever.  To my dismay, it didn&#x27;t look as good as it did in the pictures.  I charged it for the required 16 hours and then took it into the shower for the first time.  The noise was a loud buzz that I just hated.  The razor is very tricky.  The middle aluminum makes it difficult to have both razor edges touch the skin.  Anyhow, I tried it.  On my legs (which had hair) it completely missed the hairs.  I stroked it again and again and yet it still missed the hairs.  Dissapointed, I attempted to shave my armpits.  It didn&#x27;t work there either.  It left me with hair and a painful cut, which never happened with my Intuition.  After this experience, I am returning the razor with its 60-day money back guarantee.  In conclusion, I would recomenned not buying this but if you are just SO currious, buy it like I did and try it out.  Good luck with that.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the product at all or with your company as I had to send it back and received a different one  and I do not like it at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver about a year ago, used it a couple times with mediochre results and tossed it in a box with a bunch of other products that didn&#x27;t prove to work great.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Last week tight on cash and with a dulling razor blade I pulled out the shaver dug the charging base out of my trunk and charged it up.  I was pleasantly surprised with the results.  The shave was almost as smooth as a blade and much safer for a quick dry shave showing no irritation.  The next time I used it with a shaving gel in the shower and it worked perfect.  With no irritation I was able to put lotion on my sensitive skin and my legs are silky smooth.  I would definitely recommend this product  for anyone looking for a convenient electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good for an electric, especially as it&#x27;s wet/dry. However, it is not nearly as close a shave as a blade. If you like electrics, this is a good machine. If you are looking to duplicate the shave you get from a blade, this will leave you wanting a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product!  I got this for my wife for her birthday and I agree with the earlier reviewer that asked if it even has a blade in it.  My wife asked me to check it out so I tried it on her leg and no matter how many times i ran it over an area, it felt exactly the same.  The clippers on the side are the only thing that appear to snip hairs.  what a waste of money.  I should have just gotten her a mens razor.  she suggests that the lady razors they make just never are as good as a mens razor for whatever reason.  &lt;br /&gt;I even tried it on my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and there was no impact on it whatsoever!  No whiskers were cut! &lt;br /&gt;To be fair to Norelco, i use a mens norelco on my face every day and have had it for about 5 years and have only recently considered replacing it. &lt;br /&gt;But my wife hates the Moi that I bought her.  Look someplace else. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas - she says, \\&quot;It is the worst electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  It fits well in your hand but it does not even start to shave closely.  I would not recommend this razor at all.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> 1. It is pretty convenient for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The charging system is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weak point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The side trimmer may hurt skin if it is used in a improper shaving angle.</li>
            <li> Is it me that I just can&#x27;t get a close simple shave with electric razors!?  I bought this product out of a recommendation from a friend.  She&#x27;s happy with it, I&#x27;m not.  I guess it&#x27;s just me.  I always revert back to razors.</li>
            <li> No more bladeshaving for me since I have used the Moi. It shaves like my blade used to do, but finally no cuts anymore! The design is also great, it looks very nice in my bathroom. I would recommend everybody to try it, you will never want anything else anymore!</li>
            <li> When I first got this shaver I was impressed. Then over time its efficiency went down hill. It stopped shaving the hair. I tried to change the blade and foil and that did not help improve the efficiency. I ended up just returning it to get my money back. I would not recommend you buy this shaver.</li>
            <li> This by far is one of the best personal care products I have purchased!  I am physically disabled, so at times showering is a safety challenge.  However, I am young enough to want to look my best.  This product has allowed me to shave my legs, safely and thoroughly after I step out of the shower, before I completely towel dry.  No more trying to hold on to towel bars and trying to stand on one leg(which by the way is VERY DIFFICULT) for those of us who are physically challenged. It is also an attractive design and holds the charge for a really long time.</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old and have tried ever method of removing the hair on my legs. I have used Nair, my husband electric shaver,my electric shaver, disposible razors. NOTHING comes close to the Moi shaver.It is about time that someone has made a shaver for females that does cut your leggs and doesn&#x27;t smell terrible and doesn&#x27;t require you to shave for 10 mintues on each leg. This is quick  and so easy I am amazed! I am so happy with this product I am buying 9 more to give as Christmas gifts to all the girls in my office and my two daughters! Don&#x27;t hesitate buy this now you will not be sorry!</li>
            <li> This razor was a gift, but it didn&#x27;t work very well at all. Had to replace it with something better.</li>
            <li> Like \\&quot;Amazon Shopper\\&quot; I too read many good reviews on this electric razor--both on amazon.com and several magazines. For the life of me I cannot seem to get a close shave, going back and forth over areas to no avail. The accompanying literature seems to say that the closest shave might not be obtained until after 30 days of use. Let me tell you, it has been 21 days and still terrible. In the meantime, you are not supposed to use a regular razor (presumably while your skin adjusts) so basically you&#x27;re walking around as a stubbly gal, even though you are shaving every day! At least it hasn&#x27;t cut me yet.  I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one. Despite trying to shave with it at every possible angle and using various levels of pressure, it just doesn&#x27;t work well. Its performance is spotty (literally) at best.</li>
            <li> This razor is horrible! I have very fine light hair on my legs and most electric shavers have done great for me in the past. This one is VERY painfull, as it \\&quot;shaves\\&quot; you it also scrapes your skin. The little metal teeth seem to serve no other purpose but to \\&quot;exfoliate\\&quot; as you shave wich is very painful. Although the instuctions said to use the shaver for at least a month before you will get the best results however I fear I would have little skin left the shave after a month of using. DO NOT BUY THIS SHAVER. Although it looks oh so cute there is nothing cute about what it does to your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think any electric razor can give you the smoothness of a BIC, but this one is great. It works well, it&#x27;s easy to clean, the battery lasts a long time... It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Although the electric shaver is compact, has a long battery life and can be used in the shower, It does NOT give you a close &amp; smooth shave.You have to shave very slowly to get any of the hair off and then it leaves long stubs. You are better off buying disposable razor&#x27;s that leave the skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t cut worth anything, and then it broke when dropped.  Now, Norelco is renaming it and targeting it at men.  This is a cheap cheap razor, you get what you pay for, and there is a reason that this costs less than a ten pack of replacement blades for your real razor.  It does, however, hold a charge a long time.  But, since it cuts as well as rubbing sandpaper on your skin, it must be noted that sandpaper needs no battery.</li>
            <li> Are you wondering why this shaver is now hard to find?  It&#x27;s because it sucks and doesn&#x27;t work!  Do believe the negative reviews on here!   Unfortunately I bought it went it first came out at it&#x27;s highest price!  I thought it&#x27;s Norelco it&#x27;s got to be good!  Wrong!  The shaving guard thing in the middle got all warped from trying to take it off for cleaning and the blades on the top and bottom end serve NO purpose!  It was like the shaver didn&#x27;t shave any hair at all;not even close to a smooth shave!  I was very dissapointed in Norelco and tossed this shaver into the trash can.  I can&#x27;t believe the testers at Norelco let this product go on the market! :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been leary of women&#x27;s shavers, since my past experiences haven&#x27;t been good, but Norelco&#x27;s new \\&quot;Moi for Me\\&quot; women&#x27;s shaver is an exception.  It has been designed with a women in mind.  The entire unit is thinner than past attempts, which have been bulky and hard to handle.  The ergonomical handle is comfortable to hold and the on/off switch is wonderful.  The shaver head is much easier to use &amp; clean and it&#x27;s small enough to get into small areas.  The pivoting head also helps get into the curves and hard to reach areas.  The unit has to be charged for 16 hours before the first use and you don&#x27;t have to charge it again until it runs down (Norelco suggests that the battery been completely used before charging it).  You must be careful to not damage the foil, which covers the cutter.  If the foil should become damaged (very delicate and can bend easily) you&#x27;ll have to replace it.  The unit comes with a very cool and unique charging base, which can be stored away easily or mounted.  It also comes with a shower hanging hook.  My only issue so far is that the shaver doesn&#x27;t work as well on dry skin as it does with wet soapy skin.  The first time (and each time after) I used the shaver I got almost the same results as with a traditional disposable razor, which blew me away.  To get the maximum use of your investment, Norelco recommends that you replace the foil and cutter block once a year.  I highly recommend this product and I think you will enjoy it as much as I have.</li>
            <li> This electric razor is okay-- very good on delicate underarms, but does not give a close shave on legs. It&#x27;s great for last minute touch-ups on your way to work or whatever. But please, do not go by the GLOWING review that is posted twice on this site--it is very clearly written by an employee of the manufacturer (note all the specific details, like the person is reciting lines from the manual!).</li>
            <li> I bought this razor in January.  It worked GREAT the first few times that I used it.  Then it stopped working(cutting).  It runs fine it just is not cutting the hairs anymore.  It is also difficult to get the cutting block out to clean.  It does not have a button. YOu have to squeeze the trimming blades to get the cutting block out.  It is not user friendly.  I am going back to Remmington.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver is as good as any others that I have used. I have been using it for about 1 week and find that it works better for me with a shaving cream or soap. My legs feel just as smooth after shaving with this product as with the razor blade and the best part is I don&#x27;t cut my legs!I think the expectations from disappointed users are that it cuts as fast as a razor blade. You do need to go slower and sometimes go over the area twice. You will not find an electric shaver that cuts like a blade. The plus features over other electrics are compact size,shaped like razor blade razors, wet/dry feature, and small charger.Hopefully it gets even better after 21 days as has been the experience of other users.Will keep using.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver because of its slim design.  I was hoping it would replace my traditional razor, but I was wrong.  It didn&#x27;t shave well and I had to make several passes before I got good results.  As with other reviewers, I had issues with the blade guard falling off.  After 6 months it was unusable because the blade guard just would not stay on.  I called Norelco customer service and they sent me a new guard.  The new guard fell off less than 5 minutes after I put it on.  There&#x27;s definitely something faulty with the clips that are supposed to hold it in place.  I was so fed-up Moi for Me went right into the trash.</li>
