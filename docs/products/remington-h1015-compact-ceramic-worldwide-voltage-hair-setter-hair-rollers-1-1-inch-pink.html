            <li>Two not so great things.</li>
            <li>It is a really great buy for the money.</li>

            <li>Great for travel too.</li>
            <li>I did purchase plastic roller clips separately as the metal ones that came with the rollers sometimes would fly off.  </li>
            <li>A great buy.</li>
            <li>Had these for almost a year now and they still work great.</li>
            <li>The curlers are great, but I have slippery hair and probably should have purchased flocked rollers.  </li>
            <li>but they are just okay--nothing great.</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>This product works just great and the assortment of sizes works well for me.</li>
            <li>Hey, the price was great</li>

            <li>in all, I&#x27;m happy with this set.  </li>
            <li>Did try them and am happy with the results...</li>

            <li>Great rollers at a great price.  </li>
            <li>LOL  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not too great.</li>
            <li>This item arrived in a timely manner and was in great shape.  </li>

            <li>She has used it and was happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>like the fact that it was dual voltage, this makes it great to travel with as i dont have to bother about converters.</li>
            <li>These are a great size for travel, but that is about it.  </li>
            <li>It works really great on my hair.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a great purchase all the way around.</li>
            <li>The ones for the medium curlers are great.</li>
            <li>they still work great.  </li>
            <li>I almost gave up on these curlers because the clips do spring out and fly across the room - then the curlers fall.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li>but the rollers give great curls.</li>
            <li>Really great product for the price.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with these rollers.</li>
            <li>Great product great curl.</li>

            <li>I used to have a travel set from Conair that was great.</li>
            <li>Great rollers for travel</li>

            <li>This set is very nice.  </li>
            <li>Of the ones that do heat up, they do not heat up very warm.  </li>
            <li>The size is perfect for travel, the quantity of rollers is perfect for me, the color is attractive and the price was right.</li>

            <li>Anyway, it is still a great set &amp; a good price too, so just be prepared if you get them to deal with replacing the pins.</li>
            <li>I find it best to wait a couple of minutes after removing all the rollers before I start touching my curls.  </li>
            <li>I find it best to wait a couple of minutes after removing all the rollers before I start touching my curls.  </li>
            <li>I love this set, it is absolutely perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>After spending the day at the beach, the rollers gave me nice curls after blow drying my hair!</li>

            <li>The curlers are just fine and heat perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The best part was that my fine hair did not get &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; in the curlers.</li>
            <li>Very good -heats fast and perfect size for travelling</li>
            <li>I ordered these to try out before I purchased a huge set, but these have seemed to be perfect!</li>

            <li>I like it because it&#x27;s small/portable &amp; good to travel with.</li>
            <li>but my hair just keeps flipping, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>I prefer using my curling iron to this, but it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
            <li>Good for travelling and can use in THAILAND..</li>
            <li>Felt good.  </li>
            <li>The size is nice for traveling purposes, but the quality is not that great.</li>
            <li>GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I travel a lot and these are a perfect fit.  </li>
            <li>They work good, but the clips sometimes don&#x27;t want to stay on the roller.</li>
            <li>Amazon was good, price fair.</li>

            <li>the curls are amazing.</li>
            <li>I am going to look for clips that fit and keep them because they are dual voltage and worked great in Ireland with an adapter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that they fit, so I can take one set when I travel.</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.</li>

            <li>Nice compact set but</li>
            <li>(before some fell out on their own).</li>
            <li>I really liked the \\&quot;travel pack\\&quot; design</li>
            <li>liked the size - just what I wanted for travel.  </li>
            <li>These are amazingly effective for the size of the set.</li>
            <li>I could not WAIT to get a set of my own.  </li>
            <li>So decided to buy my own.</li>
            <li>They are a nice compact size for travel.</li>
            <li>These curlers do not get tangled in my hair, and the resulting curls are nicely formed.  </li>
            <li>These curlers do not get tangled in my hair, and the resulting curls are nicely formed.  </li>
            <li>Nice for travel..small..compact..convenient.</li>
            <li>The newer set doesn&#x27;t seem quite as nice.</li>
            <li>Very Happy with this product , which arrived promptly , and before scheduled  date and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>My friend saw my set and bought a set of her own.  </li>
            <li>I also liked its compact design for use in travel.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled my reliable rollers are still available.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rubber sleeves on the rollers are kind to my super-fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have always liked the rollers (and remington products)</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for a friend who has beautiful long hair and she told me they worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>They heat up nicely though.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if there were a couple of spare clips included in the event you miss one.</li>
            <li>Nice purchase.</li>
            <li>I am now loving this set.</li>
            <li>Compact, heats up well, nice travel kit</li>
            <li>but I have another kind that I use with them instead.</li>
            <li>The pins do not work you need to buy your own clips  </li>
            <li>so I am thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li>I had a nice curl though that lasted maybe an hour with lots of spray.</li>
            <li>so I take them out while still warm.</li>
            <li>I ALSO BROUGHT MY OWN SEPARATE HAIR CLIPS.</li>
            <li>To be honest, at this point I was fed up with the search</li>
            <li>It has 10 rollers and and heats up fast and is perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li>travel really well and perfect size!</li>
            <li>The product would be excellent if they could fix this, as this makes them very time consuming and aggravating for her to use.</li>
            <li>The product is nicely designed and packaged but the rollers wouldn&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice inexpensive set.</li>
            <li>Rollers didn&#x27;t burn my hair, they created nice curls.</li>
            <li>I ended up using my own clam clips.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much room, so it&#x27;s perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li>they work okay, but not as good as I would hope that they would.</li>
            <li>These rollers are compact and a nice size for medium length hair.  </li>
            <li>I seam to have some problems with one of the rolls getting warm</li>
            <li>: They come with their own clips.  </li>
            <li>They are the metal kind</li>
            <li>Even with my two sets, I feel like they&#x27;re the perfect size and don&#x27;t take up much space at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I got home from work Monday, it had already arrived, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>Nice compact size for traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>keep their heat for about 10-15 min, so do curl nicely &amp; also impart shine &amp; bounce.</li>
            <li>I have to start saying that I don&#x27;t own, and never did, a curling iron.</li>
            <li>and I got nice curls with</li>
            <li>It comes out with some nice curls and volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>liked the result</li>
            <li>A nice size assortment, but the clips DO NOT work.</li>
            <li>I love love love these curlers!!</li>
            <li>These are easy to use, quick to heat up and perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li>This is a great product and simplifies my morning, however, I have fine hair VERY FINE HAIR and will need to seek something that will hold my hair.</li>
            <li>I have bought and tried many travel hot rollers, and these are the best.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful for my very fine and straight hair.  </li>
            <li>That aside, these Remington ceramic rollers are a quality product that will add body, shine and a curl to your tresses without damaging them, they are safe to use every day (I use them almost every day and my hair is very healthy).  </li>
            <li>My full set is by Remington and works great.  </li>
            <li>I think these curlers are brilliant - my first lot lasted 10 years (used every day).  </li>
            <li>Well, my desperation, in wanting a new hairstyle immediately, got the best of me</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m very happy with Cutie (my name for my new curlers.</li>
            <li>These heat up quickly and make great curls</li>
            <li>Great size for quick curls.  </li>
            <li>Heats quickly, travels well, and curls great.</li>
            <li>For a quick fix - as opposed to a permanent - this is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m super happy with this product.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly, the leave great curls.</li>
            <li>Very easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>However, they break very easily.  </li>
            <li>These are very easy to use &amp; to carry.</li>
            <li>My hair curls very easily</li>
            <li>Most of my hair fits in these, sometimes I have to do two rounds of curls to get all of my hair, but that&#x27;s OK!</li>
            <li>When you get good with the curler pins it should be fine.</li>
            <li>I love them , just put , take out and go, very quickly make my hair look beautiful, will buy 2 more , for mum and sister :)</li>
            <li>These rollers are the best to add super quick curls and bounce.</li>
            <li>So if you want really good, long-lasting curls, let it heat up for 2 or 3 minutes (rather than 90 seconds, which is warm, but not hot) or experiment for your own best results.</li>
            <li>I bought some rollers like this years ago and absolutely love them, so I was very excited to find these on amazon!</li>
            <li>Work great, no difficulty, easy to use, quick, fast, efficient - bottom line - have a great hair day!</li>
            <li>The pins tuck into their own pocket inside the cute case.  </li>
            <li>I bought these to replace my awesome but really old Remington Travel rollers.</li>
            <li>If I can find something to secure the rollers they will be good, otherwise they are headed for the garbage.</li>
            <li>These work great and heat up instantly, definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t warm real quickly</li>
            <li>These are a GREAT set, very much worth the money.  </li>
            <li>love full size set but for travel to conserve space these work great.</li>
            <li>do work great to keep them right</li>
            <li>Also I have very fine hair with body</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and don&#x27;t need a lot of heat.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and the curlers</li>
            <li>but it is still running strong!</li>
            <li>absolutely LOVE these rollers because first, they are rubber type with metal clips which holds hair perfectly and distributing heat precisely.</li>
            <li>Great little rollers... perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li>I loved the compact size of the product as I will be doing a TON of traveling, and loved how quickly they got hot and, as I said before, positively loved the results.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I bought this with the hope that I will finally be able to make my hair look nice without going to the salon.</li>
            <li>Heats very fast, super compact wonderful for travel and affordable for ceramic with quality of Remington.  </li>
            <li>It is not expensive and does a great job on your hair.</li>
            <li>Great size, don&#x27;t get too hot to handle.  </li>
            <li>But for this price, $5 per year, I was pretty darn happy with it.  </li>
            <li>works great, curlers get hot.</li>
            <li>Didnt get as hot as I wished they would, but they do curl great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I purchased these hot setters.</li>
            <li>Be sure they are pushed all the way into the heating element before plugging in; they are perfect heat and easy to handle -- no burns on the fingers and pretty easy to roll.</li>
            <li>I can take more heat than most people), they are very easy to use, they stay put.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also very light and compact.</li>
            <li>since i bought the clips they stay very secure for a lot longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>THEY ARE NICE AND EASY TO TRAVEL WITH,  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this product would be good for travel or even keeping in my office for quick styling.  </li>
            <li>Warm up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are good sizes and they heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li>The curlers - heat up quickly, help you get a good, long-lasting curl.</li>
            <li>They heat up very quickly which is nice.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to enter into the world of hot rolling or get some travel rollers, this is great, if you want more than that, get a better set.</li>
            <li>I emailed the company about the problem, and to their credit, they immediately sent new clips that fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>They are SO GOOD - light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>but it comes with its own which work fine.</li>
            <li>but the med size stays in great while the large ones fall out no matter what I do.</li>
            <li>Great for travel have had a set for over 15 years and time for a new one!!</li>
            <li>If your looking for good quality and affordable hot ceramic rollers, I would recommend these!</li>
            <li>I think they are more like large and medium, but they do a great job of curling my shoulder length, layered hair.  </li>
            <li>They work great &amp; so fast with the perfect amount of rollers for mid length fine hair!</li>
            <li>Just be sure to apply the curlers in the direction that you want your  hair to go.</li>
            <li>I have used these Remington curlers for many years and was always satisfied and would purchase them about once every two years.  </li>
            <li>Meanwhile has anyone else found a better set of curlers?</li>
            <li>I love the rollers lock the curls in place</li>
            <li>Found out it was my error and now I love them</li>
            <li>I spend more time chasing the curlers and hooks around my bathroom than anything else.  </li>
            <li>I like this better than a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I recently took these with me to Costa Rica and they worked marvelously.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>He also offered to send me better clips.</li>
            <li>Love the size.</li>
            <li>However, it has been more than 30 days now, and the clips still have not arrived.  </li>
            <li>I love the product.   </li>
            <li>Great for me I am always in a hurry to get ready and go.  </li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>but I guess I should of known most of the time \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The compact hot rollers arrived in perfect condition and fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>so they fit nicely in a weekend bag, but they&#x27;ll also fit nicely in my overcrowded bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went with the Remington.  </li>
            <li>I had researched for a while, before buying this set and did not find anything better for my needs.</li>
            <li>They are fabulous!</li>
            <li>Seriously, I love these curlers and as someone who is dependent on rollers to style my hair, I put a lot of thought into the brands I purchase.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have purchased the hair setter for myself and my sister since I have had this setter for many years and love it.  </li>
            <li>However, the clips on the larger rollers spring off the roller, and fly across the room!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should get 30 or 20 rollers.</li>
            <li>This Remington Compact Rollers give more curls and works better with shorter hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love it if they came in 1-1/4 and 1-1/2\\&quot; rollers</li>
            <li>but i was able to make the 10 rollers work.  </li>
            <li>These are fantastic!</li>
            <li>I just love how compact they are.</li>
            <li>Got so many split ends which never was an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>these have become my favorite beauty item.</li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>Love these ceramic curlers, couldn&#x27;t ask for anything to heat any quicker and they can do the job.  </li>
            <li>I love how compact it is</li>
            <li>I have a set with clips that cover each roller and those work much better.</li>
            <li>They are ceramic rollers WITHOUT the velvet flocking that so many rollers seem to have.  </li>
            <li>I love the pins for these curlers, too.</li>
            <li>--The overall size is perfect.  </li>
            <li>They worked flawlessly on 220v with only a plug adapter.  </li>
            <li>Either way - good curlers without a way to fasten them aren&#x27;t worth anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;d love to see it on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Either way - good curlers without a way to fasten them aren&#x27;t worth anything.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;d love to see it on YouTube.  </li>
            <li>Buying curlers was much more of a chore than it should have been, I think.</li>
            <li>The pins are straight, not curved, and do fly out of the roller.  </li>
            <li>But when I read that they are so much better than using a curling iron all the time I figured I would give them a try.  </li>
            <li>Love the curlers.</li>
            <li>Yes, I could use 2-4 more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is that It&#x27;s &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m glad to have it</li>
            <li>I love these rollers.  </li>
            <li>The size is perfect for traveling, the rollers work if you have enough scaffolding</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I love the case they come in.</li>
            <li>I love this set of rollers.  </li>
            <li>Great product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately I only wanted curlers for the crown part of my head for volume, which these work PERFECTLY</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I like the travel size for sure.</li>
            <li>If you have shorter or thinner hair this will work better than thicker and/or longer hair.</li>
            <li>Just make sure all your rollers are fully plugged in. :)</li>
            <li>I felt I needed more rollers and decided the buy the biggest rated ones.&lt;br /&gt;SOrry</li>
            <li>but it does not do the work unless you are light haired!</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a second set so that I could have more of the medium-size rollers, and this set works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Now its my favorite.  </li>
            <li>and I wouldnt be able to take my bulky set.</li>
            <li>I believe this is a quality-control issue, so I will start off by saying I am pleased with the size of the rollers and the case.</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel, and great for thick hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better off packing my curling iron.</li>
            <li>These are ok.</li>
            <li>they take up minimum space on a shelf or countertop, which I love.  </li>
            <li>I would love these rollers if they would just stay in my hair.  </li>
            <li>LIKE MANY DO...</li>
            <li>maybe 2 or 3 more rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More like lukewarm rollers.</li>
            <li>Sets hair better then most rollers (and I have tried many).</li>
            <li>This hair setter is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love the fact the you don&#x27;t get a bunch of rollers that you never use...</li>
            <li>so I thought it would be better than they were based off that.</li>
            <li>It is truly dual voltage (though not labelled) and I have been them in many countries without any problem.</li>
            <li>Love  the travel size</li>
            <li>that I have had more time to try the rollers I am finding  </li>
            <li>Wish it came with better clips.</li>
            <li>I love them -</li>
            <li>They fit nicely in luggage without taking up space.  </li>
            <li>I really love these.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many sets of curlers in my life, but never any that did this.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need some more practice.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>I love these curlers.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of the size of this product.</li>
            <li>This  portable electric hairsetter works well, but could be designed better.  </li>
            <li>Today I&#x27;m tossing my babybliss rollers and purchasing two more sets to use at home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll purchase these again if i need to, and I&#x27;ve recommended these to many friends.</li>
            <li>The results when I took them out was ok.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re OK.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t understand why Remington is not supplying UK/Europe market with appropriate goods.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Produces a better curl than a curling iron</li>
            <li>After looking at many, many reviews and many price ranges, I settled on these.</li>
            <li>If there were maybe one or two more rollers of each size, I wouldn&#x27;t have to re-use any to finish all my hair.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews I decided on these travel rollers.  </li>
            <li>I love using these.  </li>
            <li>Love this item take everywhere, packs and travels well hold curls for days.</li>
            <li>The curls are just fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that the set is travel-sized, so I can take it with me everywhere</li>
            <li>We love that curlers are in two sizes.</li>
            <li>E more manageable for all thpes of hair.</li>
            <li>so it is ok.</li>
            <li>comact for travel, heat up fast, and great curls...</li>
            <li>what could be better.  </li>
            <li>I had a set just like this one many years ago.</li>
            <li>I love it and so does my daughters.  </li>
            <li>Looking for better set.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that these would be great</li>
            <li>Charge more and people who want quality will pay.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this compact set of rollers.</li>
            <li>Compact size is great for travel and the 90 second warm up time is amazing.</li>
            <li>These are okay.  </li>
            <li>and I love these.</li>
            <li>I have had these wonderful curlers before and this was the only place I could buy them.</li>
            <li>love size</li>
            <li>The clips keep coming out no matter how many ways I try to attach them, then the rollers fall out.</li>
            <li>They travel well and behave fabulously!</li>
            <li>My favorite set of rollers that I use at home and when traveling.  </li>
            <li>The larger size roller is perfect.  </li>
            <li>clips - they are not the best but the claw clips take up extra space.</li>
            <li>After seeing that these were the top selling curlers on Amazon, I thought why not give them a whirl.</li>
            <li>now seem to work better.  </li>
            <li>If you but this also by better clips to hold the rollers in.</li>
            <li>I travel a lot for work, and have never regretted using part of my precious carry-on suitcase space to bring these curlers with me.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t roll them all the way to my head, so i can get a looser curl, but overall i&#x27;m happy with the results and my hair has a curl all day!!!</li>
            <li>Very compact, and if you don&#x27;t need a lot of rollers, a great choice.  </li>
            <li>Two sizes of rollers for more definition of  curls.  </li>
            <li>I just wish there were a couple more rollers...</li>
            <li>Love these ....really like the compactness of these rollers ...great for travel</li>
            <li>I just wish there were 2 or 4 more.</li>
            <li>A curling iron works better but is more time consuming.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully it worked better for the person I gave it to.</li>
            <li>If anyone has any advice I&#x27;d sure appreciate it.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to figure those out</li>
            <li>These did not meet my wife&#x27;s expectations but they may well be more a result of her lofty expectations rather than the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>To top it off, I was going to return them but found out that amazon would charge me almost $6 in shipping.</li>
            <li>I love using these.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need more rollers than this comes</li>
            <li>take top of hair</li>
            <li>The more you brush, the more you kill the curls.</li>
            <li>but the curls never held for more than 20 mins.</li>
            <li>Wish there were 2 more curlers in the pack, but I guess that is the point of &#x27;compact&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair with people asking me how to do it.  </li>
            <li>I can get the rollers to work, but I have to re roll most of them</li>
            <li>how safely I thought they were packed.</li>
            <li>An outstanding purchase.</li>
            <li>But  I want more biggest roller.  </li>
            <li>I Love these Hair curlers.</li>
            <li>1- There aren&#x27;t many of them</li>
            <li>the&lt;br /&gt;older version are so much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did a practice</li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>I bought some clips at the drugstore to use instead and love these.</li>
            <li>The red rollers are the perfect size for that</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they would work better on longer or thicker hair</li>
            <li>And for the love of me I cannot keep the pins on the rollers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love these</li>
            <li>I like the red size best</li>
            <li>The curlers are heavier than most, but heat well.  </li>
            <li>I think most would be</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok to touch (</li>
            <li>These rollers are perfect, not only in size, but also in the quality and the curls in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I saw the great reviews on here and thought that these would be good to try because it was only a $15 investment.</li>
            <li>I think I need rollers w/ more &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; or teeth.  </li>
            <li>so I can use them :)</li>
            <li>Maybe I just need more practice?</li>
            <li>The relatively smooth design is nice and hair grips</li>
            <li>but I was able to wave it with these rollers.</li>
            <li>Sounds a pain I know, but I really do love these rollers and the convenient travel size.</li>
            <li>At most (for me)</li>
            <li>A rating of 3.5 would be more like it</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>so glad to have found this replacement.  </li>
            <li>Better use clips bought separately.</li>
            <li>Even better, my curls hold WITHOUT hairspray for 5-8 hours with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I do have longer hair though, so I had to purchase a second set to get the best out of the curlers.</li>
            <li>Good, right?  </li>
            <li>The clips have good storage pockets (there are two sizes of clips, so you have to use the right pocket).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have   a wax core that keeps the rollers hot and the perfect amount of rollers, 5 large and 5 medium.  </li>
            <li>My 13 year old granddaughter loved it!  </li>
            <li>Great for travel- lightweight and small case is ideal.  </li>
            <li>These are great, light weight &amp; fast heating!</li>
            <li>This particular model caused the clips to fly off</li>
            <li>It curls my hair instantly &amp; gives nice beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>I had the Remington H1022 for 8 or 10 years - a long time - and it is the perfect product - flocked, lightweight curlers that stay in hair, heat up but don&#x27;t burn fingers, heats fast, very nice zip cover</li>
            <li>They get super hot and create beautiful curls in a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li>Love the product otherwise-heats quickly, curls nicely.</li>
            <li>The packaging was very nice and they certainly would have been easy to pack when traveling</li>
            <li>These rollers are pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The super compact size makes them easy to store under my sink, and they really do a great job of heating up quickly and curling my hair.</li>
            <li>They were nice, full and held up well.</li>
            <li>you are spending like $20 on a set of hot rollers and you get a good deal for your money.</li>
            <li>The rollers get good and hot</li>
            <li>sister told me about these hot rollers when I loved her hair.</li>
            <li>need too tweak the timing of how long I leave them in, but very impressed with how well this works.</li>
            <li>Wish these had worked for me, as I love the compact size and I have fine hair, so I don&#x27;t need as many curlers.</li>
            <li>Gets warm quickly and stays hot for a good curl.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these in the mail when they came!</li>
            <li>For some reason, in this new set the clips fly off and will not hold the rollers in at all.  </li>
            <li>There are more rollers in all and the clips can be stored easily with the rollers, as compared to the Conair.  </li>
            <li>They work quick and the curl was amazing.</li>
            <li>Lightweight for travel and easy to use. :)</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly and I am really pleased with it.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and make a nice curl.  </li>
            <li>I think I could easily use all 10 for fuller body and a more evenly distributed style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice and compact, heats up quickly, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>These work quickly and are so nice and compact.</li>
            <li>can see this set being a nice ADDITION to a larger set; or maybe good for people with shorter and/or very fine hair.</li>
            <li>With better clips, these rollers would be fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they will be fine in Europe with just an adapter plug.</li>
            <li>I love the curls it leaves in my shoulder-length, fine hair . . .</li>
            <li>They did heat fine, but you do have to make sure you clip them onto their holders.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other sets of curlers in my life, and these are the best on the market today.      </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love to do my hair, but these you plug in and they heat up so quickly!  </li>
            <li>The sides stay cool, so very easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I have an older set purchased from Target and the clips fit great</li>
            <li>What a great set of 10 electric curlers, complete with coated pins...</li>
            <li>I have an old set if these that have worked great for years.  </li>
            <li>which really is most important.    </li>
            <li>Really, a great value and great product all around!just too small for the curlers.  </li>
            <li>Rollers placed vertically are more secure than rollers placed horizontally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>Give GREAT CURL and SOFT.  </li>
            <li>I love these, they make my hair look smooth and</li>
            <li>These rollers are a smooth texture and give my hair a more defined, bouncy volume.  </li>
            <li>I would have expected better quality rollers after 20 years!!!!!!</li>
            <li>you will be happy you did and get lots of body and soft curl.</li>
            <li>I set up my station, talk to the photographer, prep the models hair, by the time I&#x27;m ready for my rollers, they&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>but I got gorgeous, magazine-quality, voluminous curls that stayed the whole night through (</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping and Good Packaging.</li>
            <li>In general I&#x27;m really happy with how quickly the curlers heat and produce a really nice curl that lasts.</li>
            <li>It is a whole new science for me, but they&#x27;ve made my hair look great!</li>
            <li>This hairsetter is very compact for all it holds and warms up quickly, and does a great job giving my hair a controlled curl.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive a travel size set of rollers that would free up my luggage.  </li>
            <li>Right after I took them out, it looked nice</li>
            <li>I loved that these curlers are compact, heat up fast and came with clips that don&#x27;t leave a kink in fine hair.  </li>
            <li>so I had to wait longer but other than that, excellent travel curler set.</li>
            <li>IF YOU DONT ARRANGE THEM CORRECTLY, BUT OTHER THAN THIS, EXCELLENT PRODUCT</li>
            <li>These are perfect in this cute little case.</li>
            <li>Compared with what we used to have in the way of electric curlers, these are compact and sweet!  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;d rather stick with hot tools curlers-they work so much better!  </li>
            <li>I bought these based on other reviews and am very happy.</li>
            <li>Going to order a second set.......that good!</li>
            <li>Why make such cheap, flimsy clips for a very good product?</li>
            <li>They are now hot - quickly - and I find them great for traveling - just the right size!</li>
            <li>They are easy to bring along to the pageants.</li>

            <li>The rollers are easy to handle.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve easily  traveled with me on my every trip.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>THEY ARE EASY TO PUT IN...</li>
            <li>They are easy to pack and are lightweight.</li>

            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy for travel and works just right.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was really easy..</li>
            <li>These curlers are extremely easy to use and each curler has a rubber body to help stay put in your hair.</li>
            <li>The soft exterior is a good idea for travel; I just wish the curlers were more user-friendly.</li>
            <li>I bought these two years ago and they are still going strong.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the device works perfectly, and I think would be good for chin length thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have not used this product yet, but I have a similiar one to it and liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>They are particularly great for fine hair, and these have better clips than the last set I bought.  </li>

            <li>They are good for travel, but they don&#x27;t get super hot.</li>
            <li>The second set had more that worked but did not get very warm, and one did not work.  </li>
            <li>The travel roller set is very light - weight and it heats quickly.</li>
            <li>I have fine, easy to curl hair</li>
            <li>The first time I used them I let them warm up for 3-4 minutes before I used them, and they did nothing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no difficulty with the wire pins, and they slide into position nicely, holding the rollers exactly where I place them.  </li>

            <li>It travels pretty nicely.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews of hot rollers before settling on this product, and I&#x27;m thrilled with the outcome.  </li>
            <li>Someone else commented that you need to be sure the rollers are \\&quot;plugged\\&quot; into the post, and that is true-</li>
            <li>and they also get nice and hot.  </li>
            <li>Kept them on my hair for only 10 minutes and got beautiful waves.</li>
            <li>I rarely have time (or want to spend time) fussing with my hair, and these rollers are the perfect way to make my flat, fine hair seem bouncier and fuller.  </li>
            <li>Close to a near perfect hair setter particularly for travel.</li>
            <li>I have medium length, fine hair</li>
            <li>It serves the purpose fine.</li>
            <li>--The size of the rollers is just fine.  </li>
            <li>could&#x27;ve used another couple rollers, but for travel the number of rollers is just fine.    </li>
            <li>Bring plenty of these curler sets in for them to use (no need to plug them in or heat them up - that part works fine).  </li>
            <li>and I replace them - even though they&#x27;re still working fine).  </li>
            <li>and I replace them - even though they&#x27;re still working fine).  </li>
            <li>They heated up fine</li>
            <li>My hair is plentiful but fine</li>
            <li>I have used hot rollers for many, many years.</li>
            <li>The product is fine for curling your hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the type of clips that come with it, so I bought the plastic pinch type for myself, however they do work fine.</li>
            <li>I had purchased the separate clip ons, however the ones that come with the package work just fine.</li>
            <li>get nice and hot and curls come out smooth and shiny,</li>
            <li>The curlers stay in just fine, in spite of my fine hair.</li>
            <li>The curlers heat up fine.  </li>
            <li>my hair is chin length, I have alot of hair but its fine</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just too fine</li>
            <li>Seller and delivery fine though</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I have some phenominal clips that I got with a hairsetter years ago, so I didn&#x27;t use the clips that came with the hairsetter as those types of clips have never worked well with my fine hair.</li>
            <li>they work fine.  </li>
            <li>I figured out that was because I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>i have fine hair that won&#x27;t hold curl....</li>
            <li>(I have fine hair with layers, so it&#x27;s a struggle to get the longer and shorter pieces to all stay secured)&lt;br /&gt;Pins</li>
            <li>and they worked fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s in layers; it&#x27;s finely textured but there&#x27;s a lot of it-</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, but it is fine, and these do not work.</li>
            <li>The small footprint is great, and everything else is good.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and lots of it..</li>
            <li>The clip fits perfectly and holds when pushed in that slightly depressed area.</li>
            <li>The smalles ones are fine though.</li>
            <li>I have lots of fine hair, as well.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t stay in fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying that they are for everyone, but if you have shoulder length fine hair</li>
            <li>The clips hold fine..</li>
            <li>I have to do hair quickly!</li>
            <li>They do heat up quick!  </li>
            <li>It sure is convenient and compact but doesn&#x27;t heat up all that well and not as quickly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>These heat up quickly and hair seems to hold curl longer and better.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find this replacement since I found that the rollers heat up quickly and hold the waves I am looking for.  </li>
            <li>I love how compact these rollers are, and how quickly they heat up.</li>
            <li>, these don&#x27;t snag your hair when you try to take them out - worthy alone of a five star rating!  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of a compact set I can toss in my suitcase, but the rollers don&#x27;t get very hot and the pins don&#x27;t hold them in place.</li>
            <li>The black clips fit perfectly and held the rollers in my hair.</li>
            <li>Hold the curlers on the edges as the middles get very hot!  </li>
            <li>Otherwiase works well and is very fast!!</li>
            <li>(-and it helps I have very good skin and carefully applied make-up...</li>
            <li>The size is wonderful, easy to travel with, gets hot enough and sets my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>This is not an accurate description.</li>
            <li>I like that the set isn&#x27;t huge, so</li>
            <li>I was worried about the flocked rollers, but I liked them better than my old version.</li>
            <li>and I did not  want a huge set.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not rolling what I believe to be a huge amount of hair either.</li>
            <li>I would suggest to the company to make their clips about an inch longer and it would fit all hair types.</li>
            <li>I put up with it because the results are so fantastic.  </li>
            <li>While compact, light weight and small-sized for travel</li>
            <li>They fit no problem.  </li>
            <li>The smooth curlers never get tangled or rip your hair.  </li>
            <li>Plastic spring clips are available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Shipping speed was fantastic.</li>
            <li>The set is also dual voltage, which is important for me for overseas travel.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t fit that well.</li>
            <li>In any event, the overall size of the case is great.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on my bathroom counter and will easily fit in my gym bag.  </li>
            <li>While I have a larger set for home, these are great for when I travel.  </li>
            <li>Metal clips do not hold my hair securely so I literally have to stay still if I want to get any curls.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The ends of the rollers are perfectly comfortable to the touch, and I never burn my fingertips like some rollers</li>
            <li>I then spray with another mist of anti-humidity hairspray, bend forward at the waist, and lightly tousle my hair at the scalp.  </li>
            <li>The ends of the rollers are perfectly comfortable to the touch, and I never burn my fingertips like some rollers</li>
            <li>I then spray with another mist of anti-humidity hairspray, bend forward at the waist, and lightly tousle my hair at the scalp.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are rather smooth</li>
            <li>I know they are cheap.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe how well they work and at such a great price.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair to the shoulders, these honestly give me curls not just body.</li>
            <li>The primary benefit of this set is the convenience and space saving.  </li>
            <li>The ones from the 80&#x27;s were light, made out of plastic and heated with a metal plate.</li>
            <li>This set of curlers could easily fit in a medium size purse.     </li>
            <li>They will not go in all the way to hold the roller securely.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I like that it&#x27;s very compact and works nicely.  </li>
            <li>I thought that they were just cheap and going in the trash.</li>
            <li>Best to open the case and give the rollers a push on the top to make sure they are all properly seated on the heating elements.  </li>
            <li>I emailed Remington and they confirmed that this is not a dual-voltage product.  </li>
            <li>Overall this would have been a great product if it wasn&#x27;t for gravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They worked great for the last 10 years</li>
            <li>The surface of these rollers is really nice and soft (but not spongy) and I could tell a difference in how much more smooth my hair was after one use.  </li>
            <li>I will use these until they die, then happily replace them with something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using these on a recent month-long trip, I&#x27;m downgrading my rating to one star.</li>
            <li>Clips for the smaller rolls hold great.</li>
            <li>These are compact and light weight - travels well.  </li>
            <li>Can I have a set of clips that FIT sent to me?</li>
            <li>Once I opened them up they were extremely warm and really held the curls.  </li>
            <li>Rather than return these I will purchase a bunch of plastic hair clips and just clip the curler with them because they do heat fast and curl nicely.</li>
            <li>She liked it so much she wanted another as a replacement.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything to secure them , they  have a coating on them that makes them slide out</li>
            <li>I bought these online and assumed I was getting the same great product.</li>
            <li>I had another set (same brand) that came with clips that worked great which is why I ordered these.</li>
            <li>The product is great but smaller rollers for my hair!</li>
            <li>Compact and light.</li>
            <li>If I could find clips to fit</li>
            <li>The overall unit has a great compact size and shape.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I use the metal pins that came with them although they don&#x27;t hold as securely but don&#x27;t leave any crimp marks on hair and</li>
            <li>For some reason the clips didn&#x27;t fit correctly and would pop off as you were curling your hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, I could&#x27;ve done without the extra clips I ordered with them, the suck and their hold on the rollers aren&#x27;t that great at all.</li>
            <li>This set fit the bill nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but these are now part of my primary go-to hair style.</li>
            <li>I actually use them with no product and the curls hold great for about 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li>The size of the curlers and the overall packaging is great</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the clips because I bought a set that I use for every curler I have that holds really securely.</li>
            <li>The clip on things that come with the product to secure my hair doesn&#x27;t even do the job.</li>
            <li>I had to buy those huge claw clips to secure the rollers in.</li>
            <li>Results - great, until I gently brushed it.</li>
            <li>but they weren&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li>I do wish there was an indicator light to let you know that it is heating up</li>
            <li>The clips are a cheap cop-out and cause nothing but frustration when trying to use them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some for the last  twelves years , used all the time even great for traveling</li>
            <li>They would actually &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; off and fly across the room.  </li>
            <li>Makes great curls, I like that the rolls have two different sizes.</li>
            <li>I bought a set of my these for myself and liked them so much a friend asked to borrow them for a trip.  </li>
            <li>in a light travel case.  </li>
            <li>I travel all over the country on my Harley and this is going to be great when my hair is not pulled back in a bandana..</li>
            <li>I have been using hair rollers for close to 20 years to style my hair and have used so many different brands and am always in search of a good travel set.</li>
            <li>but I really wanted something more convenient and much more compact to travel with</li>
            <li>LOVED the bouncy curls with such an elegant view.</li>
            <li>They were good for travel when I had short hair, I could use these and they were just OK.  </li>
            <li>I was able to have the bouncy curly look or I wrapped my hair after using the rollers for a more straight look.</li>
            <li>I have thin, color-abused hair that sits just below my shoulders and these two sizes were perfect for creating a nice look.  </li>
            <li>Love how fast they heat up, but most of all the the curls.</li>
            <li>Need more practice, but overall it&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li>I had the old Remington travel rollers and loved them.  </li>
            <li>After 3 rollers, I found the angle that worked for me: I insert diagonally, cross wise, from the bottom of the roller up vs insert the pin from top down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary</li>
            <li>so far so good.  </li>
            <li>They get very hot very quickly Travel well- easy to pack in a weekender or backpack  </li>
            <li>Not only do they heat up quickly, they are really hot and my hair comes out perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The best part is the package is so small I can easily travel with them.</li>
            <li>Rollers do warm up quickly, without getting too hot.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I could really ask for any more than heated curlers being quick, easy, and compact!</li>
            <li>The price is right, they work well, and I love that they are so compact.</li>
            <li>I found that they heat up very quickly and the compact size it cool</li>
            <li>I had everything timed perfectly, got out of the shower, put the rollers on, got dressed, put a little make-up and get the rollers off and presto! perfect hairdo in less than 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  I contacted Remington to get them to send me clips that fit; they did indeed send 6 more large clips, but those still didn&#x27;t work with my roller set!  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair and these curlers work great.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty happy with these hot rollers, although it is the first time I have ever used somethiing like this.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li>The rollers heat up quickly and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and are an easy way to do my hair when I don&#x27;t want to straighten.</li>
            <li>Once you learn how to use the pins to clip the curlers into place, the process is quick, easy and painless.  </li>
            <li>Cons:  Because the rollers are smooth and not prickly, your fingers touch more surface area and they are HOT.</li>
            <li>This product heats up quickly, but hair slips off easily.  </li>
            <li>They heat up fairly quickly, and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>They heat up fast and are very easy to pack</li>
            <li>They are very easy to store which I like because sharing a bathroom with 5 others doesn&#x27;t leave much room for my stuff.</li>
            <li>My space is limited so this with the conair travel smart dryer will be awesome.  </li>
            <li>okay since it&#x27;s very straight</li>
            <li>Love its compact size, love how fast it heats, and love how gentle the rollers seem on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I blow dry straight the best I can, then curl.  </li>
            <li>I use the bigger curlers more than the smaller ones and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I love hot rollers and I have used them forever.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with my first</li>
            <li>Make sure the rollers are on the prong so it will get hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many sets of hot rollers since they came out</li>
            <li>Many hot roller sets have gone to funky plastic clips to hold the rollers in place, or have changed the shapes to oval rollers.  </li>
            <li>This is a replacement set for some Remington hot curlers I owned for many years.</li>
            <li>Remarkably 10 rollers is just enough.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for about 16 dollars and have to admit that I would probably pay even more because I like them so much!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how many hot roller sets on the market no longer provide storage for their corresponding clips or</li>
            <li>Although the set was small and perfect for travel, I could not get the pins to stay on the rollers.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW</li>
            <li>instead of the original pins?  </li>
            <li>I had to replace my hot curlers more than five years ago.</li>
            <li>but I need rollers that can stay hot for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>looked them up, sure they no longer made this exact model, because I would be in a panic if one day, eventually, they were no longer working.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I bought these because of the compact size.</li>
            <li>These small, compact curlers work perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li>I love this simple, economic and great roller set...</li>
            <li>They do not get too hot, I was able to touch them without burning my fingers.</li>
            <li>weren&#x27;t worth bringing home!</li>
            <li>I bought my original set at Walgreen.  </li>
            <li>However, I had to take off a star since they changed the clips from the original design.</li>
            <li>Unlike my original hairsetter, this one has no place to tuck in  the cord to keep it neat and not sprawled all over the counter or drawer when not in use.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I ordered this based on reviews but so disapponted when I received.</li>
            <li>I love these hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited for them to come.</li>
            <li>I bought the first one many years ago and was devistated when one of my kids accidentally threw some of my rollers away.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, so this small kit is just perfect.</li>
            <li>Its been SO many years since I used hot rollers and they haven&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li>I love this rollers sooo much!</li>
            <li>I love these... so much!  </li>
            <li>They are small and compact so perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>Es rápido y super fácil de usar, super recomendada.&lt;br /&gt;Perfecto para viajar porque tiene los dos voltajes y super pequen;o paquete :)</li>
            <li>I was looking for a small set for home and travel, and these are perfect!</li>
            <li>The surface of the rollers is kind of rubberized, so they grip the hair well; better, actually, than the smooth set I use in the salon.</li>
            <li>I have 4 inch long hair and the clips pop off the rollers and fly across the room.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why they can&#x27;t make better hot rollers.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get as hot as some sets that I&#x27;ve owned, but I&#x27;m glad they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This has got to be designed for people with super fine hair.</li>
            <li>I was excited at the portability of this, and it is portable...</li>
            <li>This product is worth buying!</li>
            <li>This is a nice size for travel and the case itself is soft-sided, not a hard plastic shell</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and stick straight.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s get very hot and great for travel nice and small</li>
            <li>They do get hot quickly and my curls came out very smooth.</li>
            <li>These are awesome and curl my very thick, very straight hair quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with this product, i gave few sets to my friends, they are really satisfied.</li>
            <li>Yes, you can set your entire head with 10 rollers but 2 more would have been nice.</li>
            <li>I love the compactness of this set; the curlers heat up very quickly and stay hot; the set is small, easy and lightweight to travel with; the curlers are perfect for my shoulder-length hair; and it&#x27;s very dependable and affordable.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I found the hassles to be worthwhite as I&#x27;m able to give my hair the kind of waves that have never before been possible-</li>
            <li>Just enough rollers to get a good &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; when traveling light.</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll have to get another set, and add the large to my first set, then give the second set with all mediums to my friend that has shorter hair... perfect plan.</li>
            <li>This product wins on price, packaging, portability, and the cool ends that make the rollers easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>The new model is as good as the old one, the curlers heat up very quickly and they are easy to put in the hair.  </li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;m done cleaning or cooking I take the rollers down and my hair is good to go!  </li>
            <li>These are so easy to use and heat up well and are just the right size for me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Carol</li>
            <li>I love the design and how easy they are to pack, but they are also good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>My hair never holds a curl for very long and I was able to have my hair curly all through Easter service and lunch after!!  </li>
            <li>The x-large are more the size of (large)</li>
            <li>the large are more the size of (medium )...</li>
            <li>The large is more like a medium to me.  </li>
            <li>I do love the curlers, but the clips that come with the item for the large curlers do not stay - even without any hair they push off the curler.  </li>
            <li>I love that these are portable and you can throw them in any bag (backpack, large purse or travel bag) and take them with you.  </li>
            <li>really love the outcome of everyone&#x27;s large bouncy curls)</li>
            <li>Followed all the tips suggested by others in the comments, but these were nothing special.</li>
            <li>Had to order special clips.</li>
            <li>The price is right, too!</li>
            <li>My curls were just the right amount of bounce and shiny as well!  </li>
            <li>They are a super compact, travel friendly set--</li>
            <li>love these curlers they get hot quickly and can be reheated quickly when needed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size for a full head of hair, to add volume and curl, quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>in all - compact, ten rollers, does not feel scalding hot but gives a great curl.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Advantages: small size is great for using at home and traveling, don&#x27;t need more than the 10 rollers to curl all of your hair</li>
            <li>Well with this product, I now have beautiful curls that would last the whole</li>
            <li>Love them, does not burn your fingers, doesn&#x27;t hurt your hair, or cause damage to hit, my husband loves the way the curls look, I have a set of my own (probably need another one for myself because i have long hair), this was a gift.  </li>
            <li>At this point I am ready to return them, after picking them up off the floor many times in a row.</li>
            <li>I like the compact design, thats about the only good thing I can say about these.  </li>
            <li>thanks to these hair rollers i no longer have a boyfriend, and most of my remaining hair is severly damaged.</li>
            <li>I had a set of these rollers for years, and loved them and finally wore them out.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing I have to say about this product is that it&#x27;s dual voltage.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find enough good things to say about these rollers.</li>
            <li>If my hair grows much longer and if I need more rollers, I&#x27;ll just buy another set of these.  </li>
            <li>These have some kind of rubberized surface, does not hold nearly as well as the flocked rollers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that the voltage worked and that it heats up really fast, but I can&#x27;t stand those metal holders.</li>
            <li>I am mystified how people gave good reviews on this product...what on earth did they do with the tiny rollers?</li>
            <li>My mother used to joke that one must suffer to be beautiful, but this torture is not worth the outcome.  </li>
            <li>Ideal for travel or just everyday</li>
            <li>EVEN IF YOU TAKE THEM OUT BEFORE THEY ARE COMPLETELY COOL HAIR</li>
            <li>I did get a nice soft curl &amp; bounce with what heat I did get.</li>
            <li>Works like the old time Clairol ceramic hairsetters - nice curls.</li>
            <li>but the point was to have two full kits.  </li>
            <li>I immediately bought this set because I missed it so much :)</li>
            <li>These are good overall</li>
            <li>If you have short hair and get a set that works properly it would be a good deal for you the case and pin holder compartment is a good functional concept.</li>
            <li>There should be a &#x27;cool&#x27; spot to hold them while you are putting them in your hair</li>
            <li>End caps are cool.</li>
            <li>I leave them in my hair until they cool</li>
            <li>Two stars only because the concept is a good one</li>
            <li>I  brought clips from my full set at home to try and they &#x27;helped&#x27;, but still did not hold well.  </li>
            <li>With technology, you figure that rollers would become better not worse.</li>
            <li>so a good product with all the components working properly is possible.  </li>
            <li>My sweet husband just gave this set to me for Christmas</li>
            <li>UNTIL CURLERS FEEL MOSTLY COOL ON YOUR HEAD.</li>
            <li>When they are cool, take the rollers out.</li>
            <li>I waited about 10-12 minutes to take them out after I finished putting in all of them, until the majority of them were cool.</li>
            <li>They heat up very fast and are easy to pack around.</li>
            <li>I have had other hot rollers and these are far and away superior and great price to boot.</li>
            <li>I have a large set of Remington hot rollers and love them, so I figured this small set would be perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>They also slip off pretty easily ,and dont stay in place well.</li>
            <li>Rollers are not too hot to the touch, which makes them easy to use.</li>
            <li>I use this on short hair and it does a nice job - heats up quickly, easy on my hair and works quickly.  </li>
            <li>and the &amp;#34;pins&amp;#34; for the large rollers were longer (as they were originally!).  </li>
            <li>I have used hot rollers for many years and love the wax core rollers that really heat up and stay hot.</li>
            <li>My only issue is the clips for the large rollers don&#x27;t stay on and fly across the bathroom.</li>
            <li>May still look for a similar one with the 10 large but this was a great buy and deal.</li>
            <li>I really wish they made a larger set of this exact type of rollers, including jumbo sized ones - it would be the ideal for home use.</li>
            <li>The only good I would say about it is that the clips fit pretty well</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size to just add a little curl to my hair and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
            <li>Good rollers, some didn&#x27;t clip in very well in my medium length layers but the long layers were ok.</li>
            <li>Finally - I know one of the most important feature in a hot roller is how well it stays secured in your hair, and that can differ significantly based on hair type; these work phenomenally for me (the combination of the rubberized texture of the roller, and the type of pin included).  </li>
            <li>The first time I used them they worked fine.</li>
            <li>Its not too hot for my fine</li>
            <li>These rollers heat up fine -- but they get so hot</li>
            <li>You will get smooth nice curls when used properly.</li>
            <li>This is a great size and heats up quickly, but the roller clips for the big rollers don&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
            <li>This product also curls hair quickly, so be en garde,</li>
            <li>These heat up quickly</li>
            <li>I have used these rollers (same brand) for many many years.  </li>
            <li>It was also quickly delivered.</li>
            <li>If you have to use the additional rollers, they heat up quickly also when you place them on the heating tray.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who needs a quick set on the go setter I am purchasing another one for our motorhome</li>
            <li>The rollers heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Heats quickly</li>
            <li>They work as advertised, just expect to let them heat up longer than the stated \\&quot;quick curl\\&quot; time.</li>
            <li>I bought my latest set when even though they didn&#x27;t take up my challenge (see last review) they introduced j-clips that addressed my complaints (as well as many on here).  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, but gets hotter the longer you leave</li>
            <li>so it might be a challenge for very short hair (a curling iron is best for short hair anyway),</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d rather pay more and get a decent product.</li>
            <li>i love travel size rollers.&lt;br /&gt;i replace my older remington rollers from 2001 with the updated version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this as a \\&quot;quick fix\\&quot; for my hair.  </li>
            <li>They heat up quick.</li>
            <li>Heat quickly.</li>
            <li>Buyer be aware: You may fare better with flock-covered hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>Quick heating up - does not burn hair.</li>
            <li>QUICK  </li>
            <li>Heats quickly.  </li>
            <li>Heats quickly.</li>
            <li>All That Quick Curl Travel Hair Setter]]</li>
            <li>I keep one (combined) set in my office to give myself a quick hair</li>
            <li>But, I used an additional product,  Conair Super Clips, to keep the rollers in place 2 resolve the issue.</li>
            <li>All and all I like this product, and I can&#x27;t wait for the next big event to make my hair look great!</li>
            <li>Just plug them up and they heat quickly.</li>
            <li>super convienient</li>
            <li>I had to buy the Conair super clips.  </li>
            <li>The quick curl rolls and the claims keep falling off of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, and it is my first experience with hot roller.  </li>
            <li>It does heat quickly but not as quick as it seems to advertise.</li>
            <li>It cme quickly and works so well.  </li>
            <li>Since this is my first experience with hot rollers, it took more time than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>My daughter tried it and was amazed at how quick curled or waved her hair.</li>
            <li>This is correct; they work well for medium to longer hair, heat up quickly, and don&#x27;t leave &amp;#34;pin marks&amp;#34; on the hair.  </li>
            <li>Unit heats quickly.</li>
            <li>Heat up really quick.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and are compact.</li>
            <li>They heat up quick</li>
            <li>/&gt;Order was quick arriving in three days</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find these only to find out who the clips don&#x27;t fit the model!!</li>
            <li>They work well and heat up quickly.</li>
            <li>heat quickly and the curls</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and curls stay.</li>
            <li>I love this roller kit perfect for travel/every day, compact and easy to store and the rollers and clips do not leave odd kinks in ones hair like other types of clips and rollers do.  </li>
            <li>packaging is also great - the small, compact set easily fits into my carry-on suitcase or gym bag.  </li>
            <li>Once I pushed them all down, they heated quickly and worked great.</li>
            <li>first of all, the rubber curler with these types of curlers are a huge mistake.  </li>
            <li>They did not get very hot and did not work in my hair.  </li>
            <li>so they could get very hot.  </li>
            <li>These heat up very fast and curl in just minutes!  </li>
            <li>They do get very hot.</li>
            <li>Also, the rollers are VERY hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Does not get very hot, I think.</li>
            <li>The price is great and the compact size would fit so much better in my luggage, but they don&#x27;t get hot enough in comparison to my regular curlers (Vidal Sassoon VS321).</li>
            <li>I had my first set for ~5 years before replacing the case when it started taking longer to heat up and never reached a hot enough maximum temperature although the rollers themselves were still in great condition.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it looks to be a nice product even though I wasn&#x27;t able to try it out.</li>
            <li>The wire clips do not hold the rollers well and can get very hot.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is a nice travel set, and I like them in general.</li>
            <li>They barely even get warm.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t get very hot no matter</li>
            <li>Gave 2 stars because they get really hot and fit neatly in a suitcase.</li>
            <li>Please note, they do get VERY hot, so it may be beneficial to use a glove (as one would with a curling wand)</li>
            <li>This set packs up easily in the suitcase, gives tight, cute curls, and is easy to use!</li>
            <li>Packing is petite and can easily travel in carry on luggage or a large purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the small &amp; large size rollers are excellent.  </li>
            <li>The rollers heat up quickly and stay hot enough to get a good curl.  </li>
            <li>They are better for your hair than the 80&#x27;s hot curlers because they get warm enough to get the job done but not scorching hot which causes your hair to fry.     </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, especially for the great price.</li>
            <li>To just get some curl in your long straight hair that you then put up on top of your head (me), they are ok!</li>
            <li>Other than these two design problems, this is a great little hairsetter that holds up well and works very nicely.  </li>
            <li>They heat up quite fast and are easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>but it was really fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>I hope you will love these hot rollers as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>I hope you will love these hot rollers as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>You have to &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; your curling option ( at least I did) because I am used to using alot  more rollers, but for a weekend get-a-way, these were nice to have!</li>
            <li>My hair is super straight and fine so that may be part of the problem.</li>
            <li>The rollers may be too small for those with curlier hair, but if your hair is straight it is perfect.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy yo use.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly, is compact, and curls really well.  </li>
            <li>work well and are the perfect size for the small bag that you take on a trip..would recommend these ,thanks</li>
            <li>They heat up fast and are compact and easy to pack.</li>
            <li>They heat up fast and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have super fine, straight as a stick hair with no body</li>
            <li>Easy to use and fast.  </li>
            <li>rollers were easy to handle, and the rubbery texture kept them from sliding too much through my hair.</li>
            <li>And the curls are SO PRETTY, and they stay!</li>
            <li>These Remington Ceramic rollers give me exactly the kinds of curls I&#x27;ve been hoping for!  </li>
            <li>they definitely do their job and - with a healthy dose of hair spray - the curls hold!</li>
            <li>The waves you get are just effortlessly pretty!</li>
            <li>When we use these hot rollers on their hair though, there are curls for hours!  </li>
            <li>They are more like the traditional hot rollers which I love.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars is because i wish it brought more rollers!</li>
            <li>I bought these curlers because, as a frequent traveler, the unit is light and easily packable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>definitely hot enuf to curl your hair, but not so hot that you can&#x27;t easily handle them.</li>
            <li>They heat up so quickly and give my hair such a nice curl.</li>
            <li>The rollers heat up quickly and with just the right amount of heat.  </li>
            <li>I have super bouncy curls right now.</li>
            <li>Rollers reach a high temperature quite quickly and are easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I have very baby fine hair cut into a bob.  </li>
            <li>They heat up really well, curl very well, and they are so light and easy to pack.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, warm up fast and the curls last!  </li>
            <li>You need to make sure when you replace the curlers that they push down securely on the spot to make sure they warm properly.</li>
            <li>I took the advice of one reviewer and bought a second set so that I could mix the sizes and that works great because they all fit on any of the heating units...and the price was still less than some of the more pricey roller choices.  </li>
            <li>Since it does heat up so quickly (and so much), I often leave the top open while heating to allow the top of the rollers to stay somewhat cooler, and easier to remove.</li>
            <li>They take up little space and do a great job.  </li>
            <li>Still this is a great little set with the biggest bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>Once I take out the curlers I comb out, tease a little, use hairspray and whammo...a great look</li>
            <li>This a great little roller set.  </li>
            <li>I was able to make the 10 rollers work for my entire head of fine hair.</li>
            <li>The pins won&#x27;t stay in, and I bought some clips specially made for hot rollers and those don&#x27;t keep the rollers in either.</li>
            <li>They are amazing, they heat nicely even though they take a while (learned that one the hard way-</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how much \\&quot;longer\\&quot; is, but because my hair is hard to curl, I let them heat up for 10 minutes, and I get excellent results every time!    </li>
            <li>Great set of curlers for travel or everyday - with clips that match the curlers</li>
            <li>One aspect I really like it the smooth surface of the roller</li>
            <li>I do wish there were just a few more rollers, but I was able to make what was available work.  </li>
            <li>A &#x27;ready&#x27; light might be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They pack real real well.</li>
            <li>The clips do not fit the curlers, and fly out of my hair.</li>
            <li>however U get your money worth</li>
            <li>they absorbed.</li>
            <li>The second time I used them I let them warm up for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these rollers by Remington before for many years, &amp; because they were worn, old and beat up</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I find it best to allow the rollers to heat for approximately 5 minutes minimum, despite the manufacturer suggestion of 90 seconds.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it to buy two of these instead of one set of something else).</li>
            <li>It is quite economical</li>
            <li>and I found the curl to be lovely -- soft and natual looking.</li>
            <li>Not the absolute best solution for thick hair, but curls hold for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>I was able to use my old clips, since the clips included</li>
            <li>I also own a set and have had them for several years travelling with me to the office, gym and around the world.  </li>
            <li>However, I decided to persevere, and the perseverence was definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I saved the posts from my old set.</li>
            <li>The aggravation with the clips just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I own these and left them at my vacation home.</li>
            <li>If I could redesign the case, I would eliminate the clear top, which cracks eventually (but, for the price, who cares?)</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The fact that the ends stay cool is a plus since they do get quite hot.</li>
            <li>After taking them out(after about 15 minutes) I had nice volume and big curls.....</li>
            <li>I finally decided to buy my own.  </li>
            <li>I see MUCH more rubber/plastic on the ends (like the old ones.)  </li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re cost effective enough that you could purchase two sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I honestly didn&#x27;t think these would be enough to curl all of my hair at once.  </li>
            <li>The first criticism is partially true.</li>
            <li>She borrowed mine several times before I bought her a set of her own.  </li>
            <li>Really need about 4 more if you have much hair.</li>
            <li>The pins popped right off the first time I tried to use them and curlers went flying!</li>
            <li>My old set of these worked perfectly, so I bought a new set of the same exact thing.  </li>
            <li>This product is terrific -easy to use, quick heating and a perfect size for travel - just as effective as any larger, more expensive types.</li>
            <li>I had hot roller for many years, so I decided to purchase new one.</li>
            <li>The rollers heat up relatively quickly and stay warm for a long time.   </li>
            <li>The set is small and compact and heats up quickly, thus is great for both home and travel.  </li>
            <li>I am not that fond of the clips, like many other reviewers, but they are ok for travel.</li>
            <li>others don&#x27;t like other people stated in their reviews but, to be safe, I always make sure that they are pushed all the way into the heating device while heating</li>
            <li>Gets hot quick.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also a super reasonable price!</li>
            <li>It heats up pretty quickly and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>Conair Hot Roller Super Clips]].</li>
            <li>it is SUPER hot and it touched my ear and burned it.</li>
            <li>The set heats quickly and rollers are indeed hot.</li>
            <li>but, if you are used to a super hot curler then these may not be for you.</li>
            <li>I wish they were a larger diameter, but they heat very quickly and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>I saved the clips from the older rollers that finally fell apart after years of good service.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, the rollers do get hot for making great curls, if you can keep the clips in, and don&#x27;t mind getting a little bit burned in the process.</li>
            <li>Unlike the original curlers (like Clairol&#x27;s from the 70s and 80s), these tend to fall out, even without much hair on them.  </li>
            <li>Price is right...</li>
            <li>What is the point of being the right size if they don not work?  </li>
            <li>I would say the 90 seconds is right about on.  </li>
            <li>However, the price is right and the item arrived before I knew it.  </li>
            <li>There is a nanosecond between &#x27;just right&#x27; and &#x27;melt your hair&#x27;, and no temp control.</li>
            <li>They are just the right number of curlers for me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the pins are not sized right for them or something.  </li>
            <li>4 stars  cause everyone was right</li>
            <li>exactly right so that it stays in.  </li>
            <li>This is just the right size.  </li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>It heats right up in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>So, all in all, the 1 star reviewers were right.</li>
            <li>If I tweak it just right</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t made in the right size to hold the rollers.  </li>
            <li>These are just the right amount and pack well for travelling.</li>
            <li>so it slides right out.  </li>
            <li>The curls came right</li>
            <li>The size was right</li>
            <li>its the one right by the plug connection...threw the box away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used electric rollers for years and find that five large rollers give me just the right amount of curl and body and lasts all day-- except with these rollers!  </li>
            <li>If it looks just right, spritz it with hairspray, let it set for 5 min, and then run your fingers through your hair/flip your head over/brush it.</li>
            <li>No matter what size the roller, it just slid right out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of curlers ...</li>
            <li>Its great for a traveling set, but for everyday, they are a real PAIN!</li>
            <li>They heat up in 10 minutes, they get warm enough, but not so hot that you can smell your hair cooking.  </li>
            <li>The older set had a velcro holder for the cord to fit into -</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for:  small footprint in my suitcase, gets hot quickly, works great.  </li>
            <li>Conair SPC10X Super Clips, 10 Count]] which hold more securely but have to be careful or they leave crimp marks.</li>
            <li>but, they do warm hot enough for my hair needs</li>
            <li>The rollers do not offer uniform heat, some do not even get hot, only slightly warm.</li>
            <li>But I liked these rollers so much, I actually bought a 2nd set &amp; use these at home over the 5 other sets of rollers I own!!</li>
            <li>On that note, beside the roller being on a little small side it does get the job done, curls up the hair pretty nice just have to let it heat up about 15 minutes NOT in 90 seconds which was directed on the box.overall its a perfect size to pack and go with you to travel with.</li>
            <li>Traveled with it the first time and it heated up fast and curls stayed in for days!!</li>
            <li>found the best results from using these hot rollers were if (similar to other users)</li>
            <li>This is my first time using hot rollers ever!</li>
            <li>I curl my hair more than any other style and love hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>While it may sound bizarre for a person like me to want to use hot rollers in their naturally curly hair, I do have a logical reason.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased two new sets, because I have dropped the others so much that the ends are broke off most of them.  </li>
            <li>They just aren&#x27;t very large.</li>
            <li>The clips for the smaller black curlers work perfectly.</li>
            <li>The curlers get super hot, but not too hot</li>
            <li>The curlers do heat up pretty quickly but they are too hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Got the new ones since I was going to Europe and wanted the dual voltage - that feature worked fine.</li>
            <li>They get hot enough and are in many ways comparable to any full set.  </li>
            <li>There was no mention on the advertisement of the fact that that the power point connection on this item is only suitable for US electrical</li>
            <li>In defense of the rollers, most people apparently didn&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
            <li>Great for traveling or for small places.</li>
            <li>It is small compact and great for traveling.</li>
            <li>They work well and give my long hair nice curls at the ends.</li>
            <li>I now use these rollers all the time instead of the original large set because these create a more lovely, lasting curl and they take up less bathroom counter space :)</li>
            <li>I have super straight asian hair, so this product is amazing enough that it&#x27;s able to curl my hair in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>So if you are careful not to let them heat longer than the 90 seconds or 2 minutes at most they are fine.  </li>
            <li>This made the curlers completely unusable, since the large curlers are the ones I would use the most.</li>
            <li>great little roller set for home and travel,doesn&#x27;t take up too much space when packing either.</li>
            <li>took me a little longer because there isn&#x27;t enough but it&#x27;s perfect for travelling.</li>
            <li>* as many other reviewers have pointed out the larger red rollers do not stay and fly off easily.</li>
            <li>but the large ones do not stay!</li>
            <li>If you do NOT have short, coarse, thick hair like I do, then there are many redeeming qualities: cute, compact, fast-heating (and re-heating) rollers - perfect for travel or daily use - doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
            <li>Heats  up quickly and does the job very well.</li>
            <li>The set heats quickly and the rollers really hold the heat.  </li>
            <li>This would be a perfect compact set if only the curlers were not so heavy.</li>
            <li>And the soft storage bag makes it easy pack up and store around the house or in a carry-on bag.    </li>
            <li>Thus, the 3 star review (really more 2.5 for the faulty pins because the set&#x27;s only halfway useful without fully working pins).</li>
            <li>They heat quickly and seem gentle on the hair.  </li>
            <li>I liked them so much I purchased a second set.</li>
            <li>This item is great for travel and has the same heating results as my regular size hot rollers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and doesn&#x27;t get super hot, so I&#x27;m not as worried about heat damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>do heat up quickly, and are fairly reasonable to handle (they aren&#x27;t TOO hot where I felt I might burn my fingers while rolling my hair).</li>
            <li>They fall out of your hair so easily, the pins will not stay in, and one set is not enough for a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.  </li>
            <li>Pros: the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Doubt I will use very much.  </li>
            <li>and it is chin length and very straight.</li>
            <li>I love this little compact rollers, like others I wish it had more large rollers</li>
            <li>Takes a long time to heat and rollers don&#x27;t stay in very easily.  </li>
            <li>They do the job, are super compact, travel well between different regions (110 and 220 volts), and easy to use...</li>
            <li>but if you are used to using hot rollers, you will like this setter very much.</li>
            <li>This went much faster (for me) than using any other kind of hair appliance, and I suppose if you wanted to save time, they&#x27;re cost effective enough that you could purchase two sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new set of hot rollers that wouldn&#x27;t take up too much space and would be easy to pack in a suitcase to take with me.</li>
            <li>The small rollers are great but the clips for the large rollers do not stay in and the roller slides out of my hair in seconds.</li>
            <li>These new ones, the large horseshoe clips don&#x27;t fit the large rollers!</li>
            <li>These little rollers were just what I wanted --- perfect sized for medium to long hair, and the case is all set up for travel.</li>
            <li>This are good little hot rollers for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you need some curl to try these out.&lt;br /&gt;These will definitely give your hair some added volume and the curl stays in place.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy and nice compact portable item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The metal clips work just fine with my fine hair- if they feel too loose, then bend the metal to tighten them.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s why I put more hair in than just 2\\&quot;, which brings me to my other \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; which is that these are referred to as jumbo &amp; super jumbo (or large and super large, don&#x27;t recall right now) but trust me,</li>
            <li>First time user with the rollers</li>
            <li>They would work much better if only they would stay in.  </li>
            <li>They were hot in a matter of minutes and kept my hair curly even in Costa Rica&#x27;s humid weather.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy two sets of these, and I&#x27;m glad I did because I definitely need both of them.  </li>
            <li>I suppose this is something that happens a lot with hot roller sets &amp; needs to be perfected.</li>
            <li>First thing I do, before the model gets into my chair... plug the rollers in.</li>
            <li>HOT*</li>
            <li>but not too hot (which, I have burned my fingers a lot, so</li>
            <li>I was willing to pay the price to get exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>5 out of 10 rollers didn&#x27;t get hot.   </li>
            <li>so I will need to buy 2 or 3 more sets, but I would only buy more if they are actually jumbo sized as stated.</li>
            <li>Plus they were SO hot against my scalp</li>
            <li>I already have a set of these hot rollers, but after using then while on a business trip, I&#x27;m ordering another set to use at home.  </li>
            <li>I have never used hot curlers before</li>
            <li>I thought the somewhat smaller size of the curlers would give me too \\&quot;cute-</li>
            <li>Most definitely!</li>
            <li>However, I decided to go with a smaller one because I just need some volume on top of my hair.  </li>
            <li>the way when I tried to use them for the first time</li>
            <li>After reading all of the reviews on Amazon, I decided on these hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t find anything with those exact sizes.  </li>
            <li>It took 30+ minutes for them to be too hot to touch.</li>
            <li>and and it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are three reasons I purchased these hot rollers:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li>Most people will use only one set, so the weight should not be an issue.  </li>
            <li>Most people will use only one set, so the weight should not be an issue.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough how much I love these curlers.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t even get hot.  </li>
            <li>the first time, I reviewed them as 5-stars.  </li>
            <li>Also, the top plastic on the second set became brittle and has cracked.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that the first set did that.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t believe how fast they heat up!</li>
            <li>After buying first set, i ran to buy another since my hair is medium length.</li>
            <li>I like this hot roller set</li>
            <li>I needed  larger rollers and more of them.</li>
            <li>I wanted hot curlers that could replace my mother&#x27;s set of hot curlers from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>They get so hot..</li>
            <li>The rollers don&#x27;t get so hot that you can&#x27;t handle them.  </li>
            <li>Your hair slips off, which defeats the purpose of rolling it in the first place.</li>
            <li>Also, the rollers became too hot to touch.</li>
            <li>These issues made rolling my hair a much more time consuming process than necessary.</li>
            <li>I use hot rollers every day .</li>
            <li>For a travel set or for an extension to your bigger set, sure.</li>
            <li>I put one roller in and slip on the loop, put another roller in and the first roller loop pops off.</li>
            <li>I love this set, and recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have the space for a big box of rollers.  </li>
            <li>While first using this product, clips would not hold rollers in place.  </li>
            <li>Rollers also don&#x27;t seem to have enough gripping texture.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who uses hot curlers.</li>
            <li>However the most recent set I purchased about a month ago, the clips won&#x27;t stay in to save my life.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I would change, is to add 2-4 more rollers.</li>
            <li>But I love that this set comes with traditional setting pins, not clips.</li>
            <li>It got hot, my hair curled</li>
            <li>I have bought a similar set 6-7 years ago in Sweden and I have been more that content.</li>
            <li>It is as exellent as my first set exept for one thing.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend these hot rollers.</li>
            <li>the most recent purchase will be my travel set.  </li>
            <li>These are wonderful - since they are package into such a small package.</li>
            <li>So these are my first hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>: The first two posts do not get hot.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>and they get a bit hot in there.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like 5 medium rollers and 5 slightly bigger medium rollers.</li>
            <li>I love these, I&#x27;ve purchased over 20 different hot rollers and these are the best/perfect.</li>
            <li>This went to goodwill the first day I used it.</li>
            <li>old roller kit&#x27;s clips fit these</li>
            <li>Well, I was just touching the outside of the container for the curlers.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife as a stocking stuffer (at her request) to replace the one she&#x27;d pretty well worn out.  </li>
            <li>Bought these for an out-of-state interview and put them to use the first time the morning of said interview.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a hot curlers user, not a hot-iron type person.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Remington!</li>
            <li>I have never used hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I usd to have hot rollers as a kid and missed them</li>
            <li>I went to Italy this summer for a month and knew I needed hot rollers to take with me.</li>
            <li>It only takes a minute or so with the curlers in, to get the look you will love.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have any extra I would order more.</li>
            <li>Once the clips are in though, they work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I bought this set yesterday, and used it for the first time this morning.  </li>
            <li>They are very compact, and will be useful in our motorhome.</li>
            <li>I had the first set for 3-4 years.</li>
            <li>I put the 5 big ones around head on top layer of hair.</li>
            <li>this is my second set in the last 15 years, really hold up well and great for traveling</li>
            <li>They get pretty hot which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, so I have no complaints!</li>
            <li>These rollers get HOT and can burn your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>I bought these curlers years ago at a local mass retailer, and have been in love with them ever since.  </li>
            <li>This was my first foray into hot rollers and not knowing how well they would work for my hair type, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on a set.  </li>
            <li>At some point, I may upgrade now that I know that the concept of hot rollers works with my hair but for now, I find the pros outweigh the cons</li>
            <li>Can totally see hauling these on many trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not count on them being hot in 90 seconds.  </li>
            <li>One thing I do not like is that the rollers are so hot it burns my fingers to use them.  </li>
            <li>Have ended up with them being my go-to hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>I may by the hair clip style &#x27;pins&#x27; to hold them as I have never been able to get the handle of the traditional ones.  </li>
            <li>Disclaimer:  have never tried hot rollers before</li>
            <li>I use all rollers each time and sometimes need several more rollers, thus I take first ones out , reheat (sometimes) and use where needed.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure they were heating up enough for me.  </li>
            <li>Funny what you get used to.  </li>
            <li>You plug them in - - in the morning and in 10 - 15 minutes they are plenty hot.  </li>
            <li>I also love that they heat up in a really short time.  </li>
            <li>but hot rollers are not the way to go...</li>
            <li>okay - the smaller rollers.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly hot within minutes of being plugged in.</li>
            <li>Totally surprised by this product, am glad I picked it up for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Also not as damaging as hot irons</li>
            <li>set comes with those funky wire hot roller pin things to keep them in place.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a traveler and you use hot rollers on your hair, then you won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li>They are hot</li>
            <li>Please put more of a grip back on your clips!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the reasonable price objectionable either!</li>
            <li>A couple months ago my 1980-something hot rollers died.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers wanted more rollers, but overall they looked good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>here and showed me her travel hot rollers.</li>
            <li>They heat up so fast!</li>
            <li>I like these brand because they get really hot.</li>
            <li>and i was only able to curl 3/4 of my hair.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the curls only lasted 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These rollers do hot hold well in your hair and it doesn&#x27;t hold the curls well.</li>
            <li>(I removed the clips before I got started, since I wasn&#x27;t sure how hot they&#x27;d get next to the rollers).</li>
            <li>You will have to factor in the time, energy, and expense to buy additional hot roller clips or use that don&#x27;t shoot off the roller 3 seconds after putting them in.</li>
            <li>I love them because they only take 90 seconds to heat up.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve had experience with hot rollers</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d recommend them to everyone looking to purchase some hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product (unless you have super, fine hair that won&#x27;t hold a curl).</li>
            <li>If the roller is hot on your neck, tuck some tissue or TP between the roller and your neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, just wrapping my hair up in the curlers causes it to start to hurt, just from the weight of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never used hot rollers in my life.  </li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;You need to physically wind your hair around these rollers as there aren&#x27;t many teeth or any Velcro to hold your hair to the rollers.</li>
            <li>I may buy a 2nd set, so I have even more to use if my hair gets longer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li>but the sides don&#x27;t get hot) and you just roll your hair, attach the clips to hold it in place and go do something else while</li>
            <li>EXACTLY what I wanted.</li>
            <li>However, I need more rollers and will probably order some larger ones to go with these.</li>
            <li>They get so hot they burn your fingers when rolling your hair and the pins do not stay in.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra money on something better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, perhaps I just don&#x27;t know how to use the gadget correctly, but personally I have a lot better luck with velcro rollers.  </li>
            <li>These rollers were nice and hot within a few minutes and my fingers were kept happily cool by keeping them on the tips of the rollers as I put them in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I had used this roller set a few years ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li>This look is good for everyday.  </li>
            <li>I still love these little convenient sets of rollers - easy to travel with, but will have to look for another one</li>
            <li>My hair is long and very fine.</li>
            <li>But these are quite minor complaints and along with the super compact size and the very affordable price, I am glad to overlook these issues.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just that my hair takes a curl fairly easily or because it&#x27;s not too long, but I only have to leave these in my hair for about 5-10 minutes and my hair will be nicely curled.  </li>
            <li>Even better, the package is SUPER small and LIGHT.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t say in the manual in how much time do they reach the max heat, which for rebel hair like mine is very important info, so i just let them heat up for like 5 min and then unplug one at a time and let them do their job for as long as i have time to let them on, first time in 15 minutes i was a curly queen!</li>
            <li>I can use the 4 big curlers on my under hair and the other 4 smaller ones on the top, let them sit while I do my makeup and hello beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>, I felt it was time for a new set, so I went with my tried and true Remington brand.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and just the right size for travel.</li>
            <li>I have longer hair and a ton of it, so I just used the curlers on the top and used a regular large barrel curler for the rest.  </li>
            <li>Although I do enjoy wearing my hair in its natural state, sometimes I want large &amp;#34;glamorous&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;These really are nice--they heat fast, get evenly hot, don&#x27;t leave a crimp in the hair, don&#x27;t take up a lot of space, and aren&#x27;t a ton of money!</li>
            <li>Extremely compact and effective.</li>
            <li>May work better if you leave them in much longer, but they stay hot only for 15 minutes</li>
            <li>You DO have to let it warm up longer than advertised but other than that they work as promised.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t curl my hair, they got warm but not hot.</li>
            <li>and, when I took them down, I swear my hair looked like I belonged on the Grand Ole&#x27; Opry stage!  </li>
            <li>A few more grips on the roller itself would make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Not as big as expected but easy to use and super cute</li>
            <li>Like I said, I never had much success with anything else that&#x27;s supposed to curl your hair but, with these, not only are they fast and easy, they curl my hair without an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had good luck with hot rollers in the past</li>
            <li>I left this at my mother&#x27;s house after my last trip so they would never again take up good space in my luggage.  </li>
            <li>My last set were wearing out, so I bought these suckers because they were the best of the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But at least I know it&#x27;s good quality and won&#x27;t damage your hair so much, so it&#x27;s worth a try~</li>
            <li>Would be an excellent product for someone with thin natural hair,</li>
            <li>Only negative part is that rollers connectors are clip type and they have to be inserted into their slots perfectly or they will not make connection to heat --</li>
            <li>NEED TO BUY MORE NOT ENOUGH FOR WHOLE HEAD.</li>
            <li>But most troublesome issue was that they left off the velcro cord storage compartment, which made it much easier to travel with.  </li>
            <li>I am a hairstylist, and I have a large set of hot rollers in the salon that I use all the time.</li>
            <li>, that is so much faster than any other hair curler, but my curls though they look great, they barely hold for one hour</li>
            <li>There are only 10 rollers - good for the compact design, but if you have longer or thicker hair you&#x27;re going to have to roll part of your hair, wait for the rollers to cool, then roll the other part.</li>
            <li>I have the same problems mentioned by many of the one-star reviewers - the clips are too short for the roller, the roller&#x27;s surface can&#x27;t handle my fine hair, etc.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and get more hot than my previous rollers did, which I like.  </li>
            <li>I will still give a good rating just because I knew there was very little of a chance that my hair would hold the curls if any at all.</li>
            <li>The product is fine for average hair, but, as I suspected, they don&#x27;t stay in my fine hair.</li>
            <li>On the positive side,  they heat up well and</li>
            <li>Bought these for a trip based on positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I was content with the product it gets really hot and doesn&#x27;t take much to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>and it heats up pretty fast.</li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t get this product in England any more, so my wife insists on getting this product sent over from the U.S.A.  because she obviously prefers it to the current ones available in U.K.</li>
            <li>I have not used hot rollers since high school (in the 60&#x27;s!)</li>
            <li>I have a set of flock hot curlers I like very well</li>
            <li>THEY GET HOT FAST...</li>
            <li>I really should have reviewed these when I first bought them in fall of 2012.  </li>
            <li>and they get hot fast.</li>
            <li>The rollers really heat up and are hot to hold.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this to anybody who need to replace hot roller.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get all the rollers in my long hair so the number of rollers is sufficient.</li>
            <li>They heat fast and get hot.  </li>
            <li>I first thought that I was putting to much hair on each curler.</li>
            <li>They heat up pretty fast, like in 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>I thought this small, compact set would be good for traveling</li>
            <li>I still love the rollers, they heat up great, and are the perfect size, it just that this time the little plastic finishing tips on the end of the pins have pretty much all fallen off already in the short time that I have had these:-( It is frustrating as this had happened to my original set, it just took a longer time for that to happen, and when you try to use them now, the pins pull your hair and scrape your scalp, so I ended up having to use my butterfly clamp clips instead which work because it&#x27;s fine for at home, but when you travel would not be convenient, because you don&#x27;t want to travel with too much bulk, so I&#x27;ll have to buy some more pins now.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly, has 2 sizes of rollers, 5 each, the rollers are smooth for less tangling, and the unit never has to leave the pouch.</li>
            <li>The curlers are great but the clips are difficult to use on clean hair.</li>
            <li>Luckily the heat sets the curl quick and my frustration is short lived.</li>
            <li>I can set my hair perfect and tight in the roller, but as soon as I put the clip in, they slouch down an inch, and my ends fall out.</li>
            <li>Great price, light weight, easy to work with (even with my long, thick hair), quick dry</li>
            <li>I have a car-inverter for my laptop and figured I could get a nice, little set of hot rollers I could plug in once in a while and make myself look a little bit more presentable!  </li>
            <li>My only thing is is that the pins that hold the rollers in your hair are easy to lose.</li>
            <li>I was less than thrilled with these rollers.</li>
            <li>The results were not much different than my curling iron and not as easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much that I&#x27;m using it regularly on my long, below-the-shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>I never got any to stay in long enough to know if they give a good curl.</li>
            <li>I had been using a similar one for several years and liked in very much.</li>
            <li>However noted; all of the rollers need to be large.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve preferred just large curlers</li>
            <li>I should have realized large was not jumbo.</li>
            <li>I prefer the metal u shaped clips but the large ones don&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li>I started with the large curlers, rolled one in, and used the clip.</li>
            <li>I like the large rollers and my daughter</li>
            <li>I also purchased two of these so that I could put the large rollers all in one.  </li>
            <li>The product description says 5 large and 5 X large rollers.</li>
            <li>The medium rollers should be replaced by large rollers.</li>
            <li>This product was advertized as having 5 large and 5 x large rollers.  </li>
            <li>I just wish that you could have either all large size or all medium size.  </li>
            <li>My three stars are based largely on the price of these curlers and their convenience for travel.</li>
            <li>The large rollers don&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
            <li>I just wish the large rollers would stay in so they could curl my hair nicer.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 sets so that I could get all large and combined them with one set of all large.  </li>
            <li>so I could have all large rollers.</li>
            <li>, the rod holder pics do NOT stay on the large rollers.</li>
            <li>BUT -- I purchased two sets and moved all the large rollers to one travel pack for my &#x27;travel&#x27; suitcase   </li>
            <li>10 large rollers and this would have been a 5 star for me.</li>
            <li>it says large and medium in product description...</li>
            <li>so I bought large jaw clips to hold them in place.  </li>
            <li>Product was described as 5 large &amp; 5 medium rollers.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy these if you are looking for a large roller.</li>
            <li>but I gave it three stars because the large curlers do not stay in your hair.</li>
            <li>, they say large rollers</li>
            <li>but they are not that large at all.</li>
            <li>I  can&#x27;t be certain of that</li>
            <li>The brand name of the clips is Sta-Rite and a size large</li>
            <li>is what is needed to keep the large rollers in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heat up fast and are not damaging to hair if you don&#x27;t let them heat for too long, which has a small learning curve to perfect for your particular hair.</li>
            <li>so I use 2 picks (some left overs from my old hot roller set) per roller to hold them on top of my head.</li>
            <li>Curlers get nice and hot, however I cannot get the clips to stay on, especially the larger rollers!</li>
            <li>it heats up very fast, it takes a little practice to use the U shape pins but it gets very easy after a couple of times.</li>
            <li>I might have to see if I can find a jumbo size now for more of a loose wave.</li>
            <li>I had one set that broke in less than a year, then because I liked the product so much</li>
            <li>These curlers heat up very quickly and can get quite hot, depending on how long they&#x27;re plugged in.  </li>
            <li>I always get two because I need the large rollers, so I take the large ones from one set to make a whole set of large ones.  </li>
            <li>I am going back to my Conair traveling set (12 rollers including 8 large) which works fine.</li>
            <li>I discovered that the large clips work fine for the smaller medium rollers and don&#x27;t go flying.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;ve ever used in many other sets of hot rollers....</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fairly fine hair, was concerned that 8 rollers would not be enough.</li>
            <li>I traveled with them recently to the UK and they worked fine with the adapter.</li>
            <li>so i have never tried other products to  compare this with.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that: I LOVE my hot rollers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t heat quickly, and when they get hot enough to start using, they are too hot to handle.</li>
            <li>Also, these rollers didn&#x27;t all heat up...only some...and they never got as hot as the older set I have.</li>
            <li>I have an older model of these Hot Rollers and</li>
            <li>Wonderful hair rollers for loose, bouncy curls on medium length thick hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the advice of a friend, I scrounged around and found a bunch of &amp;#34;butterfly clips&amp;#34; (large) to hold them into my hair.  </li>
            <li>but really does not curl my hair like my large one does</li>
            <li>I like the tidy little case it comes in.</li>
            <li>I have medium-length fine straight hair: I need only hair body and some curl and sheen to my hair (I cannot use hairspray).</li>
            <li>If you have very thick hair, they work great</li>
            <li>I wonder if they make a flat iron that is as easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is probably not going to be a good product for hard to curl hair.</li>
            <li>My son loves his Tommy Hawk Wastlands game - Thanks, always reliable and great products to choose from.</li>
            <li>These hit up really fast and travel well for business trips without taking too much space.</li>
            <li>Or use both sets together and roll my whole head -</li>
            <li>The Ionic ceramic really works.</li>
            <li>But I was really looking for Jumbo.  </li>
            <li>My 2 daughters want their straight hair curly - fast.</li>
            <li>I was looking into buying the Conair travel set and really wanted to buy it</li>
            <li>They really solved a problem that I had had with needing to set my hair while traveling.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very inexpensive but still. .</li>
            <li>This makes it very convenient for travel as it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in your luggage.</li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these.</li>
            <li>They heat up relatively fast also.</li>
            <li>The set is very portable and contains five \\&quot;extra-large\\&quot; and five \\&quot;large\\&quot; rollers.  </li>
            <li>I really like the clips that came with them too.  </li>
            <li>The hype is for real.</li>
            <li>Very luke-warm.    </li>
            <li>They do it and very well.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the clips don&#x27;t fit the rollers all that well.</li>
            <li>They heat up fast.</li>
            <li>They heat up fast, and curl my hair fast too.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space in my bathroom or suitcase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact</li>
            <li>Had borrowed them from a friend and really lied them.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you want to do waves, add volume, or curl straight ends</li>
            <li>These curlers heat up so fast</li>
            <li>But, they work very well on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately my hair needs only a couple minutes to achieve the look I want, so I could just stand there and wait, without moving.</li>
            <li>is my challenge to whomever in Remingtion aisre now responsible for these...</li>
            <li>They curl really well, really</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>If Remington really stood for service and had any character they would have NEVER produced these curlers.</li>
            <li>Takes  alittle getting used to, but they heat up fast and are gentle on  my hair.</li>
            <li>The material the rollers are coated with cause hair to slip so much as you try to pin that I gave up after a couple uses - they now sit abandoned.  </li>
            <li>It would be a feat to curl my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The curlers heat up fast.</li>
            <li>It is very compact and lightweight.</li>
            <li>The kit is very portable.  </li>
            <li>This set is very convenient, not too bulky.</li>
            <li>These curlers really do the job and don&#x27;t take up a lot of space.  </li>
            <li>So in summary if you had straight hair I would think these curlers would not stay in your hair very well</li>
            <li>I really like this hairsetter.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair</li>
            <li>Rollers heat up &amp; are ready to use in about 2-3 minutes like the product claims.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth noting that the instructions outline the warm-up time as 90 seconds for a soft curl and longer for a stronger hold.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I heated them longer than I could get more definite curls, but the messy curls was what I wanted. )</li>
            <li>I was really hoping these would be an asset &amp; give me the bounce &amp; body I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The set is compact and doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the vanity or in my luggage.  </li>
            <li>curls look very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wear my hair shoulder-length instead of the very &amp;#34;old</li>
            <li>will be ready when you are.</li>
            <li>They do heat up fast.  </li>
            <li>I figured even if I didn&#x27;t like them much, they could still do for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I bought these because I see the amazing curl hot rollers can give, and how long that curl can last.</li>
            <li>My husband watched me try to get ready and couldn&#x27;t believe it as the pins LITERALLY flew out of my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought the curlers for my sister, who didn&#x27;t have nearly as much luck.</li>
            <li>It heats up in a minute and the rubberized rollers stay in my hair very well.  </li>
            <li>Heat fast.</li>
            <li>Would not reccomend for someone who wants to use often.</li>
            <li>Very compact</li>
            <li>Very compact</li>
            <li>The heat up fast, travel well and the stay put.</li>
            <li>THEY DO HEAT UP FAST...</li>
            <li>Sometimes the pins slip out if you have too much hair on the roller.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Very unusable rollers pin.</li>
            <li>The rollers do work well and are reasonably priced</li>
            <li>The pins hold the hair in place very well.</li>
            <li>No matter how much hair I put in roller.</li>
            <li>/&gt;  - very compact size&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m at home or getting ready for a non-work occasion, I&#x27;ll often leave in a bit longer to get tighter curls.    </li>
            <li>it is ready whenever I am.  </li>
            <li>Returning would cost about as much as cost of rollers.</li>
            <li>aren&#x27;t very effect at securing rollers-</li>
            <li>It is very compact and light-weight.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The heat fast and curl my hair.</li>
            <li>they heat up fast and work well.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and compact.</li>
            <li>Did not curl my hair very well at all.</li>
            <li>WORKS VERY</li>
            <li>YOU WOULD HAVE TO SET HAIR AGAIN TO GET WHOLE HEAD DONE.</li>
            <li>And the rollers heat up well and fast.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I recommend it Highly!</li>
            <li>Heat fast and thoroughly every time.  </li>
            <li>I almost always use a curling iron on my hair-it&#x27;s easier and much faster for what I do.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a travel set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clips do not work very well.  </li>
            <li>They will work much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>- it isn&#x27;t bent in as much.)  </li>
            <li>There is really nothing on the curler to grip</li>
            <li>I use these while getting ready for work and now have  a prettier pony tail at the hospital.  </li>
            <li>really like the design of this set of curlers.  </li>
            <li>I would really like them to make a set like this using jumbo size rollers.....</li>
            <li>and they hold very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, my hair is much longer now</li>
            <li>they do heat up fast and the meatal tabs are hardcore.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these.</li>
            <li>biggest problem I had was that 3 of the prongs just don&#x27;t heat at all, so the product was straight up defective.</li>
            <li>i could roll my whole head in 4 minutes</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I bought them for a trip and they packed real well.  </li>
            <li>And so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>They stay in very well.</li>
            <li>None of the clips for the larger size rollers would actually fit on the rollers, let alone keep them in my hair.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t stay in my hair using the provided metal clips.</li>
            <li>heats up fast and very compact</li>
            <li>I took the clips from the 1960s set to see if the longer clips would help, and they worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I really like the convenience of the rollers and the way my hair looks after use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that they are very portable though.</li>
            <li>I should say,that does not heat up much..</li>
            <li>Althought these were very inexpensive, do not purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep &#x27;em around for emergency back-up, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use them much if ever.</li>
            <li>After seeing so many people recommend hot rollers especially for hair that&#x27;s like mine, I decided to take a chance with hot rollers and decided to try this set since it&#x27;s smaller and not as pricey as others on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that if you&#x27;re having this issue, you might be putting too much hair around one roller.  </li>
            <li>The rollers set is nice and small for packing, but the clips won&#x27;t hold very well and the velcro closer tore the first time I opened it.  </li>
            <li>Heat up fast.</li>
            <li>so I was not expecting much.</li>
            <li>They heat up fast.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s very practical because after you put it on your hair you can apply makeup, get dresses etc</li>
            <li>but you are going to really have to cram a lot of hair on to each roller.</li>
            <li>They heat up fast.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how it works on straight hair.</li>
            <li>I had to return them as I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten much use out of them.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t get rid of this appliance on the first use was because I had full clips from another roller set that I could use in a pinch.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase and may consider buying a second set for when I use these at home.  </li>
            <li>This is the second same unit I own.  </li>
            <li>They claim to be &amp;#34;instant heat&amp;#34; and the instruction booklet says they&#x27;re hot enough to create a wavy effect within 90 seconds, although you can allow them to heat to the full temperature for tighter curls.</li>
            <li>The wife likes them, said they are kind of heavy, but will do.</li>
            <li>If you you have sent hair one set might be enough however if you even remotely have medium thickness of hair you will need to sets in order to get a good curl.</li>
            <li>I would really have loved to have a set with rollers at least twice the size.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and is hot enough to curl even straight hair.</li>
            <li>On the contrary, these were very easy to handle, and they produced soft, loose curls, which was the look I wanted.  </li>
            <li>The Remington rollers are light, the package is small and the curlers do heat very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I used the black ones first and did the sides of my face and the top layers of my hair.</li>
            <li>They heat fast and create long lasting curls, so you can&#x27;t ask for much more than that!</li>
            <li>The new ones that I purchased on Amazon work just as well as the first set I had.  </li>
            <li>My first set lasted over 20 years, decided it was time for a new set.</li>
            <li>I am a thrifty shopper, and this item was marked just right for me to buy.  </li>
            <li>I think it has to do with the fact that the curlers themselves are very short (probably to make them travel friendly); and the fact that the surface just wasn&#x27;t very grippy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the old fashioned metal clips; I instead use the claw-like plastic squeeze clips that came with an older hairsetter I have.     </li>
            <li>I have thick, shoulder-length, naturally curly hair (type 3a) but find I often need a more tame/professional look at work, and these do the trick (and also require MUCH less product to keep my hair looking nice, which is a huge benefit when traveling).  </li>
            <li>You have to get use to using the clamps but other than that I love them.  </li>
            <li>SEEMS TO CURL MUCH BETTER THAN ANY OTHER I&#x27;VE TRIED...</li>
            <li>They are excellent rollers, this is my third set but prior sets had 4 small rollers, which I must have.  </li>
            <li>I would like them to be more hot, I have lo turmed on like hours before I wear them to get just a little curl in my hair.</li>
            <li>The pins on this &amp;#34;latest&amp;#34; set are different from those on my original purchase-  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I love this thing</li>
            <li>My hair holds the curl better with these rollers than any other product I have used before.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and they get hot enough to make a decent surl</li>
            <li>They are great for traveling, very compact and there is no hard plastic cover to get broken in your bag.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with these, and the compact size should be very easy to travel with; at around 6&amp;#34; long, this case will probably take up less space in my suitcase than a single shoe.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with these, and the compact size should be very easy to travel with; at around 6&amp;#34; long, this case will probably take up less space in my suitcase than a single shoe.</li>
            <li>The only hot rollers that I have had success with were steam rollers (Caruso)....</li>
            <li>I have long, stick-straight, fine</li>
            <li>My hair is long and fine, never holds a curl even with a curling iron.</li>
            <li>But not for those of us that have thick straight and very healthy</li>
            <li>Through the years these have been great for shoulder length and even now when my hair is almost to the small of my back</li>
            <li>I like the small compact soft case, which is good for travel.  </li>
            <li>Fast forward to now, I order this one, which is the same roller set I used before, except the large clips that go with the red rollers DON&#x27;T FIT!  </li>
            <li>I tried using more curlers with less hair and the large rollers still fell out.  </li>
            <li>They heat up really fast, really high quality construction.  </li>
            <li>Further, you have to catch them at just the right moment when they are \\&quot;hot enough,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I am on a limited amount of time when using these at the gym before work and spend too much time trying to secure them.  </li>
            <li>The first couple of times I plugged them in only one side heated up; since then it has been working OK (but not as fast warming up as claimed) and I am always worried they are going to fail at any time because of my original experiences - I have a much older set of these rollers (same manufacturer) and they were/are far superior to these new ones.  </li>
            <li>They are the size of all hot curlers from the early 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Also, there is definitely not enough of them either for a full head of hair</li>
            <li>The only real complaints I have is that the clips are short so if, like me, you like to put more than the recommended amount (2\\&quot;) of your hair in each roller</li>
            <li>The small roller&#x27;s clips stay in place nicely.</li>
            <li>Using hot rollers changes my curl pattern from a long spiral-type curl to more of a big, bouncy and looser curl.  </li>
            <li>I travel frequently and have tried taking hot rollers and/or curling iron.</li>
            <li>So, small, efficient, effective.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the oversized metal clips, remembering them from years ago and an old Clairol hot roller set I used until it died</li>
            <li>This is a nice small kit that works for my needs.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Soft and Style Hot Roller Clamps and use them instead - no marks on my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a second set to leave in my suitcase full time.</li>
            <li>The size is very small and compact so that&#x27;s nice and the rollers get hot...</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, but I was looking for bigger rollers.</li>
            <li>Since it was humid and my hair is very fine and straight, the curl did not last long, but it did add body.  </li>
            <li>So really, other than the fact that I would like the set to be twice as large, I love them and give them a near two thumbs up.</li>
            <li>I make sure I push the curlers down to connect at the bottom when I put them away.  </li>
            <li>Make sure before you plug them in, that you push all of the rollers down</li>
            <li>Make sure you push them all down into the connection or you might have a curler or two that doesn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li>Gets hot in a hurry (and I do mean HOT) and couldn&#x27;t be more compact for traveling or storing in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>For everyday use, I use the Remington Pearl heated clip curlers, which I love, but the unit is really large.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be good for a little extra body when I needed it.  </li>
            <li>My other one has a great Velcro fastener on the outside back.  </li>
            <li>These hot rollers made a tight curl in my hair in just 20 minutes from start to finish (when they cooled and I removed them), which was easy for me to finger comb and rearrange into the looser look that I wanted.</li>
            <li>Once my hair is completely dry, I apply a heat-protectant spray, brush through, then a light coating of an anti-humidity hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Once my hair is completely dry, I apply a heat-protectant spray, brush through, then a light coating of an anti-humidity hairspray.  </li>
            <li>The clips that come with the kit do not work, as they pop off easily, and heating them took a lot longer than expected.</li>
            <li>The resultant curls are lumpy and unflattering compared to the previous flocked Remington curlers which I had enjoyed for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, the smaller sized rollers (black) stayed in perfectly, but no matter what I did, the larger ones (red) fell out.  </li>
            <li>I quickly searched on Amazon for the reviews and all the recent reviews were complaining about the clips not staying on the rollers.</li>
            <li>but my hair and rollers kept falling out particularly when doing sides of head.</li>
            <li>I plan on going directly to Remington to see if they can replace them with clips that fit the rollers properly.</li>
            <li>They produce a much more bouncier and longer lasting curl than a regular curling iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never had a problem with my older sets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several sets of these rollers over the years and they work well and heat quickly.  </li>
            <li>I do have some clamps that I use to keep my hair back, and that helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Therefore I recently  purchased a SECOND set in order to have more curlers.  </li>
            <li>By the time I use the first 10 rollers, the others are almost hot enough.  </li>
            <li>I had a similar set for many years, but the rollers appeared not to heat up as well over the last year.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky if they last an hr.</li>
            <li>I purchased an earlier version of this product in 2001 and was quite pleased with it, particularly the feature enabling international travel.  </li>
            <li>and the heat is decent.  </li>
            <li>Obviously, there are women out there with different hair than mine that love these</li>
            <li>Now I roller for the part in front of your ear on each side (you&#x27;ve used 5 rollers) and you have 2 for the top of the back, two for the bottom of the back.</li>
            <li>I am going to look for the clips from my old sets and see if the smaller ones will fit this set.  </li>
            <li>I have accidentally left it plugged in for 8 hours &amp; was sure I was doomed &amp; it would not work again properly</li>
            <li>The older version heat up hotter .</li>
            <li>I replaced the clips with others from an older set I had.</li>
            <li>: They heat up at a decent rate.  </li>
            <li>These get plenty hot enough to curl my hair without being so hot</li>
            <li>They do heat up quickly, but are constantly falling out of my hair.</li>
            <li>I switched the red pin with the other longer pin (over 1/2 inch more), the roller is held right at the desire location on my hair.    </li>
            <li>I love these rollers they are vey practical, heat up fast and very convenient to travel with I use the at home too since they take up very little counter space</li>
            <li>As I said, I have FINE hair and 10 rollers is still not quite enough for my whole head, a dozen at least would have been much better.    </li>
            <li>Everything about the new ones is fine except the metal roller holders are shaped differently from the old ones.</li>
            <li>They come in a small and compact case and heat up quickly and are very very hot!</li>
            <li>and I only use the large rollers, but even then, it created really pronounced curls (which I don&#x27;t really like too much).</li>
            <li>but all in all it does get very hot (not enough to burn you, unless you touch the metal parts).</li>
            <li>Portable, heats quickly, ordered more large size rollers for my hairstyle, works great except pins are slightly small with thick hair...and larger pins are are too big for the rollers I have.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and really hold the heat a long time.</li>
            <li>I have super straight, long hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>and they came highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>These rollers are compact yet high heat.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!if you wanted to save time</li>
            <li>I have some larger clips from a different set, and they seem to hold the curlers better, but I will probably still get some jaw clips to hold them more firmly in place.  </li>
            <li>, I figure it&#x27;s not hot enough... or need some kind of hair spray...</li>
            <li>I end up with large wavy frizz-free curls that are manageable, soft, and hold all day.  </li>
            <li>The cover is compact and very easy to travel with and stuff in that small space in the drawer.</li>
            <li>It is small and very easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried out the rollers yet as I live in the UK and will need to change the plug, but if they&#x27;re anything like the previous (black)set of Remington rollers that I&#x27;ve been using for years, they will be fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not being able to buy these in the UK at all (despite them being dual voltage)</li>
            <li>but there are not enough rollers to do my whole head at once!!  </li>
            <li>I was actually surprised that these worked so well!!  </li>
            <li>This cute little item is a livesaver for traveling.  </li>
            <li>These are just like the last Remington hot roller curlers I had!</li>
            <li>I love these little travel rollers.</li>
            <li>The pin-style clips might be a little fiddly for some (not my favorite)</li>
            <li>I love the little pockets on the inside of the case for the clips</li>
            <li>I thought from the pic that five of the rollers were large, but they&#x27;re more like medium and small.  </li>
            <li>I use hot curlers to tame my naturally curly hair and need extra large for the top layer of hair and large for the bottom.</li>
            <li>I will use my older version and donate the new ones.</li>
            <li>Even though curls were very defined when I took rollers out, they relaxed after an hour into just soft waves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s colorful and you&#x27;re not likely to leave it behind in a hotel room,  bright as it is.  </li>
            <li>old clips have about 1&amp;#34; of rubber/plastic on the straight end and about 3/4&amp;#34; on the bent end.  </li>
            <li>This is the reason I gave it two stars &amp; not one, when I talked to a representative in the product complaint department, he told me that they are aware of the issue and have started to make better clips.</li>
            <li>This Remington ceramic set got so hot that I could barely stand to touch them to wind up my hair.  </li>
            <li>Too hot to use with bare</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used curlers with clips before, but I feel like for my hair (since it&#x27;s so heavy) it would hold better.</li>
            <li>Although I really like the compactness of these hot rollers, I thought I would have to send them back because there was no way they would stay in my hair.  </li>
            <li>A useful travel size for emergency use only.</li>
            <li>These are ok, I had a lot of trouble with the medium rollers.</li>
            <li>They got hot surprisingly fast and the compact size of the unit fits into a suitcase as well as the last corner not in use on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>and they were so hot I could barely stand to roll my hair.  </li>
            <li>YES they will curl your hair, (though I am sure there are a few exceptions).</li>
            <li>Perfect for my hair, African American female with past shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy (not in a good way) hair cut in a modern Sassoon bob, longer on the sides &amp; shorter in the back.</li>
            <li>Before using the rollers, I wash my hair and allow it to dry naturally, while occasionally brushing it to discourage my own natural curls from forming.  </li>
            <li>The edges on the top and bottom don&#x27;t get hot, so you&#x27;re less likely so singe</li>
            <li>I really wish they would go back to the old design of the old clips as these clips do not hold like the old design of the original clips.  </li>
            <li>I agree with the other fine hair people...</li>
            <li>Small enough to fit easily into suitcase.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not hard to curl and these just do not do it for me.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for large rollers to smooth out my hair, instead they make tight curls.</li>
            <li>They are defective, so it is highly recommended that you buy other clips to secure these to your head - you should not have to do this, but I recommend you do.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased a different set at a local store, but amazon reviews prompted me to set those aside and order these instead because they heat very quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought super clips from amazon which work very well to prevent slipping.</li>
            <li>Since the rollers do not have any teeth they just slip right out of your hair before you can put the next one in.  </li>
            <li>This baffles me; the large rollers are not that large, actually they are medium.</li>
            <li>The rollers are just the right size and there are just enough!  </li>
            <li>Either I&#x27;m not using the right spray/gel product or the disulfide bonds in my curls just gave up against the fight against asian hair.</li>
            <li>just the right amount of curlers for  me and not too big to pack for a trip...</li>
            <li>Everything that you need is right inside the case so there&#x27;s no big chance of you losing the pins.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little heavy, so if you have thick hair,  secure the curlers the best you can do avoid them from falling out.</li>
            <li>They really heat up quickly and are ready to go in less than a minute.  </li>
            <li>day!&lt;br /&gt;It is super easy to use, it takes no time to heat and a few minutes to roll and 10 mins later Violla!!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair &amp; even with putting my usual styling products in before using these hot rollers</li>
            <li>issue i have is that the large pin holder could be better fitted for thick hair.</li>
            <li>post.&lt;br /&gt;These are suitable to use in Europe as they are dual voltage , it states that on the box.&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be some confusion with some reviews saying they are not suitable for use in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I am an older woman with fine, thin hair - these have been a true lifesaver - easy to use - clipped carefully in place (which you would do with ANY hot roller product IF you have thin, fine hair like mine!)  </li>
            <li>The little case is not as nice as the one for my last set</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d previously had a set of 5 travel rollers (rollers were the same size as the large rollers here) that took up more space in my suitcase than this.</li>
            <li>But, they seemed an option: a head full of longer loose curls.</li>
            <li>so I had to get new ones.  </li>
            <li>They can still be used, but I wanted to get new ones.  </li>
            <li>They promised to send new clips, and told me it would take 7-10 days to get them.  </li>
            <li>I replaced them with some new ones from a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>I ordered a new set for a vacation home and can&#x27;t keep any of the rollers in my hair.  </li>
            <li>the new one does not.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now on the hunt for a new set.</li>
            <li>so now will either try a new brand or looking for rollers with clamps</li>
            <li>have had these for about three years and they are still like new...</li>
            <li>She looked on Amazon and found a new one.</li>
            <li>That the reason why I bought two new sets from you.</li>
            <li>CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THESE&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I like the new styling options they give me.</li>
            <li>I ordered a new set.  </li>
            <li>The new clips have just a dot of rubber/plastic on the ends.  </li>
            <li>The new version continually fall out of my hair</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a picture of the old clips (that work) and the new clips (that don&#x27;t!)</li>
            <li>My old clips from an older Remington set do work on these new curlers.</li>
            <li>But won&#x27;t buy a second set if  Remington does not send me a new set of clips that fit the red rollers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really too bad because the size would make them ideal for travel.</li>
            <li>Also, the red clips that go with the larger curlers don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>I have a few old clips thst work; and once I get some more, I&#x27;ll be happier with this set.</li>
            <li>I threw them out rather than carry them all the way back home and try to find clips to fit (which actually defeats the purpose of the travel ease</li>
            <li>I wish the rollers were a little larger in size - the large and medium size described seem more like small-medium and medium, but they get the job done.  </li>
            <li>I put my new rollers in, put the new clips in and by the time I&#x27;d put the 3rd roller in, the first roller fell out.  </li>
            <li>It heats down quickly which my curling iron dose NOT!</li>
            <li>I have a very old Remington set that works well.</li>
            <li>It not only is small enough to fit into your suitcase but the heat emitted from the unit provides a quality \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; to hair and also more body (believe it or not).</li>
            <li>Heats very fast, and it is simple to use.</li>
            <li>My hair was fried while dyeing it, and these curlers make my hair feel very soft.  </li>
            <li>However it was just that my (very old) curlers were so well used they were burning my fingers my head and my hair.</li>
            <li>to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder-length, very straight, fine, and color-treated (lightened) hair, which is hard to curl.</li>
            <li>These were easy enough to put in but they didn&#x27;t hold curls for long at all.</li>
            <li>I received it for Christmas and quickly discovered that the negative reviews were all true.  </li>
            <li>I have an older similar set by Remington with large plastic butterfly type clips that went in another separate holder.  </li>
            <li>Had my first one 2 years just got the 2nd one to make rolling my hair up for a stage production quicker.</li>
            <li>They are more like medium and small.</li>
            <li>The clips arrived yesterday, and they are exactly the same as the defective too-small clips that came with the product!  </li>
            <li>If these rolls were slightly bigger and all one size, it would have given it a higher rating.</li>
            <li>As I started the second curler, the first on fell out.</li>
            <li>Completely unusable!</li>
            <li>They are so small and compact that you will love the amount of space it saves.</li>
            <li>I used hot rollers every day for years but stopped when I cut my hair short.  </li>
            <li>but it is a complete pain to use - buy something else!</li>
            <li>all the same size..that get hot..but not THAT hot.....</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wanting it solely for travel, then this might (reiterate, might) be something to consider, but if you&#x27;re wanting something to actually curl your hair, spend another $15 and get a larger set (more rollers) and one that has actual clips to hold the rollers in place rather than pieces of wire.</li>
            <li>Then I touched a different roller and it was hot.  </li>
            <li>This product seemed to work okay at first but the pins for the red rollers are too small.  </li>
            <li>I know the metal wire is not terribly expensive to make these pins and am mystified why Remington does not return to a longer pin so they will actually stay in the hair.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected...keep it simple....</li>
            <li>I have used different hot rollers for 40 years, but like this</li>
            <li>so when I put in one roller &amp; reach for a second one the first one falls out.</li>
            <li>This is the second set purchased as the first set worked so well</li>
            <li>The rollers that DO heat up are hot enough to curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Going back to my hot comb.</li>
            <li>By the time you are rolling the third one, the first one is popping out.</li>
            <li>I have tried several times and tried putting product in my hair first.</li>
            <li>I left the curlers in my hair for about 10 minutes and my hair was very curly!</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave this two stars is because the rollers do get hot and will create curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Short and crisp (used 15 days)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Medium size rollers take a little more time to heat up, but not any major issue.</li>
            <li>to get hot enough to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>they actually worked and in a very short amount of time, and even though it was my first time using hot rollers</li>
            <li>The only thing I can think of against these hot rollers is that the pics tend to fall out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say more like small and medium.</li>
            <li>They did get hot enough just don&#x27;t stay in.</li>
            <li>I have purchased numerous hot roller sets of all types for years.  </li>
            <li>In my experience the flocked rollers, which are the type customarily sold now, do not get hot enough.  </li>
            <li>The curlers in this product are better described as medium and small, so they are a challenge for longer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not scorching on the fingers to handle but hot enough to get hair to the curliness that is wanted.</li>
            <li>so maybe other ethnicity-types will have different (i.e., better) results from using these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Exactly the same until you get to the bent end</li>
            <li>clips to secure are small to handle and made of metal, so they can get warm to the touch if left in hair due to heat of curler.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li>In fact, the first try, I left them in about 20 minutes while I applied my makeup</li>
            <li>These rollers do not get hot enough to use.  </li>
            <li>So I did the underneath portions of my hair first, left the rollers in for about 40 minutes, and then repeated with the crown sections of my hair.</li>
            <li>These do not get hot enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered these hot rollers several times.</li>
            <li>I have the exact same ones from the 90s</li>
            <li>My last Remington rollers I bought over a decade ago and still use them just purchased this one to travel with and excited for my next trip</li>
            <li>I use the smaller rollers for the top of my hair and the larger for big curls in the under layers.  </li>
            <li>They look good but just too small for my long hair!!</li>
            <li>They are so compact, they are easy to take along and at home take little space.  </li>
            <li>The main difference between the two is that this one (Remington) has made room for both sizes to heat up together whereas the one I owned before was only capable of heating up five curlers at a time</li>
            <li>Seriously not 5 seconds later the clips would shoot straight off the roller like a rocket.</li>
            <li>Every day that I use it, I have one lock of hair that is nearly straight because that particular roller didn&#x27;t heat up properly.</li>
            <li>I like these curlers, but you have to use them with curler clips (the grey, claw-like ones), or else your hair is likely to get fuzzy if it is fine.</li>
            <li>The plusses are:  takes up very little room on bathroom countertop, gets hot fast, (be careful with your pinkies), holds hair in curler well, and so more hair can be placed in each curler.</li>
            <li>These small clips fit inside the case with rollers and my opinion &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; better than the butterfly clips - also takes less packing</li>
            <li>You can put them on the roller while in your hair and actually watch them slowly move off the roller until they are far enough off to fly to the floor.  </li>
            <li>When I purchased the second set, I placed all the large rollers in new case.  </li>
            <li>I have Asian straight but not thick hair and was going to like these rolls but ...</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit well no matter how small the amount of hair wrapped around the curlers and pop off if you so much as breath.</li>
            <li>so now I have to use the clips from my previous set which do fit.  </li>
            <li>They work, but it&#x27;s probably not a good idea to get heated rollers if you don&#x27;t really know how to use them :).</li>
            <li>these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, just plug in, in a few moments</li>
            <li>The rollers heat up quickly and are hot enough, not like some roller sets that never heat up enough to give lasting curls.</li>
            <li>This little set works just fine.    </li>
            <li>it takes up little space, its quick heating (but not too hot to touch) &amp; efficient...&amp; it gives my long thin blonde hair a beautiful curl...</li>
            <li>It will usually not hold a curl unless heat is near scorching.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these curlers would get hot enough to have an effect on an asian women&#x27;s naturally straight hair.     </li>
            <li>The first time I used them, I just put them back in enough that they were &amp;#34;in.&amp;#34; The next time I used the rollers they would not get hot!  </li>
            <li>All in all I highly recommend these, they travel really really well, super compact, take very little room.</li>
            <li>I bought a new set recently and really don&#x27;t like the clips that came with the rollers.  </li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair and then use these to add a fantastic curl prior to going out.  </li>
            <li>You will be able to use half of the rollers, as the clips for the larger rollers don&#x27;t hold them in place.  </li>
            <li>but there are just as many of the smaller, black rollers...leaving you with the need to roll,</li>
            <li>Make sure that the curlers are completely pressed down into their individual heating socket.  </li>
            <li>Or if you are lucky enough to get 4 of them in, suddenly they all pop out.</li>
            <li>However, you do have to roll them tightly and secure the pins, which are color-coded to the color of the roller.</li>
            <li>From a very old and long gone set of hot rollers from about 1980, I have TWO metal pins.  </li>
            <li>I give this set 4 stars, because I expected large rollers to be really large, but they are not.</li>
            <li>Middle of rollers are very hot and can burn if rollers are heated for longer than ten minutes.  </li>
            <li>But the description says 5 large/ 5 extra large.</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;super\\&quot; are just regular large curlers...same size as every \\&quot;large\\</li>
            <li>the large clips don&#x27;t hold the larger roller in your hair ..</li>
            <li>I emailed the company and received an email back telling me to return them to a certain address, from Brian.  </li>
            <li>I want all large curls or all smaller curls.</li>
            <li>I purchased these rollers to use while on vacation because my &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; set is too large and fragile to travel.</li>
            <li>I only use the large ones.</li>
            <li>The large n medium rollers are not as big as I thought.</li>
            <li>I saved the large rollers from my fist set for use with my second set.  </li>
            <li>The large pins do not hold the larger rollers in place.</li>
            <li>The rollers are smaller than one would think for large rollers but from reading reviews</li>
            <li>The clips that hold the large curlers in place pop off constantly.</li>
            <li>can I get the extra large / jumbo size.</li>
            <li>so I would have enough large rollers to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I might need the second set for more tight curls.  </li>
            <li>I incorporated all the large ones into one unit and the same for the medium size rollers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; little curls instead of smooth body.</li>
            <li>The holders fit neatly into a couple little pockets inside.</li>
            <li>The other concern I have is that it takes more than a few minutes for the rollers to get really hot.  </li>
            <li>In my other hairsetter, the pocket is on the outside of the cover, making access much easier and keeping the metal clips cool to the touch.  </li>
            <li>They really don&#x27;t get hot enough to do what I want them to do, and one set of them gets much hotter than the other.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are very gentle, but even still, the curls HOLD all day long</li>
            <li>This little sucker packs a great punch, and contrary to what some people say the rollers worked perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rated this a 3 because I hardly use them and its takes me a while to get situated in my hair, Im better off using a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I was worried that the metal pins would be hard to use, but I found the hold was actually much better than that of the plastic claw clips I was used</li>
            <li>I went straight to the Remington site to order the \\&quot;extra\\&quot; large curlers as replacements, but they arrived and are the same size as the larger ones already included in the set.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of hard to put them on, especially if you have never done your hair before.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t look good just air dried or blown dry, it must be styled or flat ironed.  </li>
            <li>I had an older version of this and wanted a new and second pair</li>
            <li>Why would a company sell something that they clearly did not test??</li>
            <li>I had an old big set of rollers that I got rid of because these are so much nicer</li>
            <li>Of course, my old set was ruined because I forgot about them, so I won&#x27;t complain too much about that last one.  </li>
            <li>I never had this problem with my old Remington heated curlers.  </li>
            <li>Until I figure out what to do, I&#x27;m making do by holding my head very still and only putting two curlers in at a time.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not going to hurt so much when I pass them on to a local Battered Women&#x27;s shelter.</li>
            <li>I am using ancient, old, longer pins from days gone by.  </li>
            <li>, they don&#x27;t burn my skin like my old heated curlers, and don&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional hair stylist</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try contacting the company to see if they have any of the old pin/clips, which worked just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted enough rollers to do my whole head.   </li>
            <li>Really like how hot this product gets- curls last a long time.  </li>
            <li>but like them so far.</li>
            <li>The pins are really wimpy and do not hold the curlers well enough in place - one star off for that.</li>
            <li>I wish I hadn&#x27;t gotten rid of the old clips.</li>
            <li>After I fixed that problem, it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>The set is compact and portable for travel, and the soft case has pockets for storing the wire pins.  </li>
            <li>Instead of using these clips I use some from an old roller set to avoid this issue.</li>
            <li>However, this set is considerably faster than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I wouldnt recommend these to someone hoping to do a lot of hair as i don&#x27;t have very much as far as density or coarseness and</li>
            <li>but now I have so much hair I needed to get a second set in order to roll it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a 15 year old Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li>Going to order foam covered ones with actual clips that hold the whole roller in place.</li>
            <li>I do have this set that is 30 yrs old and wanted to replace it&lt;</li>
            <li>I would rather prefer clips like the conair one offers.</li>
            <li>Another thing that I preferred about my old set is that the cover included an attached Velcro loop that you could use to gather your cord so it doesn&#x27;t dangle while not being used.  </li>
            <li>People think I have a natural curl.  </li>
            <li>The red ones not so much.</li>
            <li>I have regular rollers that are much easier to handle.  </li>
            <li>and I have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I wanted the old Clairol electric curlers and this was the closest I could come to getting them.</li>
            <li>It is a constant annoyance, however, as the clips are popping out here and there and all over the place the whole while you&#x27;re wearing them.</li>
            <li>The clips in the picture are the old clip design, but that is not what is in the kit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, would recommend this product to anyone who likes to curl their hair frequently without the hassle of a curling iron and setting it in rollers for volume.</li>
            <li>This alone makes the product completely unusable.</li>
            <li>and I am completely upset.</li>
            <li>Wish I had kept the old one I bought twenty-five years ago.  </li>
            <li>I left them in while I finished getting ready so about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I purchased this set a couple of years ago based on one review that said the rollers were the closest one can get to the old Clariol rollers &amp;#34;your</li>
            <li>They take longer than my old set to heat up and turn off faster than I would like.  </li>
            <li>It is enough for my hair - 2 inches below shoulder and not thin nor thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clips that hold the roller in the hair are much too short.  </li>
            <li>They leave my hair looking professionally done.</li>
            <li>The only thing I really dislike is the type of clips they come with (u-shaped wire ones), they don&#x27;t hold my hair at all</li>
            <li>you made sure to heat them up for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I still had my old clips, used them and all was fine!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>If you have old rollers, try their clips.  </li>
            <li>They are really simple and my hair goes up fast, though for whatever reason my hair can&#x27;t keep the curl.</li>
            <li>so i have to use the old clips.</li>
            <li>Next time I go for a set that has butterfly clips or something, not thin metal bobby pin type things.</li>
            <li>I received these, I was pleasantly surprised by how compact they are.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I have saved clips from prior hot roller sets and have cobbled together a set of clips that do work rather than return a portable set with a small footprint that works well on a bathroom cabinet or stores well in a cabinet or suitcase.  </li>
            <li>is the color of bag old</li>
            <li>I packed the set for my early morning workout at the gym and they worked great.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>It gets hot fast, it has enough curlers for my long hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The package is well designed: the rollers &amp; metal pins all have a place in the soft plastic bag.</li>
            <li>I researched and found these travel size hot rollers and was shocked at how lovely, soft and full</li>
            <li>It happened to me several times, and not because I loaded too much hair on the curler.  </li>
            <li>I had to use pins from a 30 year old set.</li>
            <li>My mother had a set of these rollers that I tried out and completely fell in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use them anyway and get a soft curly look.</li>
            <li>These rollers are very well made and they last for years.  .</li>
            <li>Just wish there were a few more actual curlers.</li>
            <li>The size of the packaging is definitely convenient for travel, however the set could be improved by adding a few more rollers.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would like is for a few more curlers now that my hair is longer.  </li>
            <li>The only caution I would offer is to make sure each roller is firmly seated on its heating element or they won&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li>However, I was able to get all of my moderately thick, shoulder length hair rolled using just these 10 rollers.  </li>
            <li>I realized that one or two rollers were hot because I had pushed them down much more firmly into their sockets.</li>
            <li>They heat up very quickly and leave a long lasting curl (even if you leave them in just a short time).</li>
            <li>They heat up very quickly and leave a long lasting curl (even if you leave them in just a short time).</li>
            <li>They fall out easily and the combo (5 small, 5 medium) just isn&#x27;t enough to curl your whole head - even with shorter hair (mine is just about chin length).</li>
            <li>I wish it could have been ordered with all large rollers, but It is small enough for carry-on luggage and works just fine.</li>
            <li>When I finally got it right and left them in my hair for about 20 minutes, I was ecstatic because my hair looked like I just stepped off a cover magazine.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and left this in for the full 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Curlers heat quickly and stay heated long enough to curl hair.</li>
            <li>But it is small and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>small, and easy to pack.</li>
            <li>The unit is small and easily packable.    </li>
            <li>They are small and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Small, compact, easy to store and travel with&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the small, travel aspect of this set, but they are not as easy to use and put in because of the way they are structured.  </li>
            <li>I like this unit because it is small and easy to store and pack.  </li>
            <li>The size is small, fantastic for traveling, very portable &amp; a space saver for those who don&#x27;t have much storage room in their home.&lt;br /&gt;You just plug the bag in &amp; wait 90 sec.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for a way to tame my fine strands without damaging them, and these rollers are a God send.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Negatives for me: No on/off switch; the clips popped off several times, and I wasn&#x27;t putting too much hair on them or using the wrong clips; too many large and not-so-medium rollers; no small rollers.  </li>
            <li>and I do my very thick hair (shoulder blade length) by rolling it into large sections (back and sides in smaller rollers, top in large rollers).  </li>
            <li>You cannot leave them on as long as other rollers unless you really want super curly hair.</li>
            <li>The only way to use the new set of curlers is with my very old clips.  </li>
            <li>(if only I could find all the clips that came with it), but the standard 20 curlers are not enough for a full head of hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, I was barely able to secure even small sections of my thick hair with these clips.</li>
            <li>They are harder to use than I expected -- they don&#x27;t hold my hair tight enough to really set the curl, but they are good for touch-ups...</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and have been using a travel set of 5 extra large rollers from Conair for years, and I never knew what I was missing by using such an old-school setter.    </li>
            <li>At first I thought the curlers would be too small, but they make my hair smooth, shiny with loose, natural curls.  </li>
            <li>I have very long, thick straight hair and wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d get any results, but these rollers did the trick.  </li>
            <li>The small ones work fine</li>
            <li>This purchase was a replacement for the exact same model I bought 20 years ago and lost in a recent move.  </li>
            <li>This not only created a flatter overall look, but the hot rollers were now sending heat to my forehead instead of my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is my second set of this particular brand.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t get rid of this appliance on the first use was because I had some extra time where I could do this.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave  this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because the first set I bought tends to have issues with all of the rollers heating up at the same time.  </li>
            <li>THEY GET REALLY HOT IN A VERY SHORT TIME, AND THE ONLY THING THAT I DONT LIKE IS THAT THEY TEND TO FALL OFF</li>
            <li>The majority of the pins,- mainly the ones with red tops- glides of the curlers causing them to fall off.</li>
            <li>Curlers don&#x27;t get hot enough for the hair to actually hold a curl, and the clips don&#x27;t stay put.  </li>
            <li>They keep &#x27;popping&#x27; off particularly on the red rollers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cushion on roller is slightly rubberized and holds hair super well.  </li>
            <li>I could barely fit all my hair in the 10 rollers and my hair is pretty thin.</li>
            <li>Roll first bang section, then second, then back (which should be the crown of your head).</li>
            <li>I left these in for 15 minutes the first time if did it, and my hair was waaay (too) curly and it lasted for over 24 until the next time I washed it.</li>
            <li>I do wish this product had an option to have all large rollers for long hair.</li>
            <li>Rolled easily, but the clips left a little to be desired, the rolls kept flopping around, but that may have been user-error.</li>
            <li>I like using curlers since it cuts down the amount of time spent curling (vs. curling iron), but I would say I still get better results from a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I can only use 5 of each size and then take them out to use with the other rollers when the first set is ready.</li>
            <li>As to the second complaint, I have very fine hair, but these rollers stayed in my hair without any problem.</li>
            <li>The massive draw back us that the clips don&#x27;t fit the rollers properly and they constantly fall out.</li>
            <li>I am still trying to figure out how to use the clips but overall I would highly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I really only wanted the large red rollers, so I bought 2 sets and will trade out the black rollers - the case can hold all 10 red rollers just fine.  </li>
            <li>They are compact for travel and are not very heavy.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and stay warm enough to curl your hair but not fry your fingers, and I like the compact storage bag/heating base, but I would rather buy a set that comes with better clips already than have to spend $10 or more on clips that will not become dangerous projectiles without warning.</li>
            <li>you have to be sure to push the rollers down pretty hard onto the electrical component</li>
            <li>I needed something small for travel and these seemed to fit the bill</li>
            <li>However, the posts to secure the rollers are too small.</li>
            <li>However, I have discovered after some testing back and forth, that I can achieve the same with a straight iron as far as curls....</li>
            <li>I keep these rollers in my &#x27;travel&#x27; suitcase as I&#x27;m often on the road -- compact and do the trick (I have long straight hair and use the rollers for body and curl)      --</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work well for my long medium thickness hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I used them, I spent a lot of time picking them up off the floor and trying to hold them in place with the included wire holders.  </li>
            <li>but 30 minutes later my hair was pretty flat again.</li>
            <li>My first set lasted about 10 years, I never really thought about it until the case got crummy.  </li>
            <li>Only good for short, thin hair.</li>
            <li>The pins provided are not tight enough to hold the rollers as securely as I&#x27;d like, but a few minutes with a pair of pliers took care of that.    </li>
            <li>The edges of the curlers are not super hot, so use is easier, but the center is definitely hot enough to really set my hair well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend purchasing an additional set of extra large curlers if you are used to bigger curls.</li>
            <li>The first few times the curlers did not get very hot, but after a few uses they will get hot enough to watch your fingers.</li>
            <li>This location makes them somewhat hard to pull out easily .</li>
            <li>Secondly, make sure all the curlers are pushed securely to the bottom of the base, because if they aren&#x27;t, they won&#x27;t get hot at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is probably not going to be a good product for hard to curl hair.er than a few hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one of these heat roller sets for years, and the heating elements finally gave out, so I ordered a new set.  </li>
            <li>I bought these because I was living in Europe at the time but came back home to the US often and also knew I would be returning to live again permanently one day.</li>
            <li>A couple heating elements are finally going out which is why I had to order the new version.  </li>
            <li>Flocking also seems to act like Velcro to my hair, whereby the smooth-surface rollers like these are much easier to remove without tangling my very long hair.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the poster \\&quot;sweatpea\\&quot; for her tip to buy a 2nd set and use all one size (the larger).</li>
            <li>Not that expensive, heat up for real in 2 minutes, won&#x27;t burn you and lovely compact packaging.</li>
            <li>However, to keep a big, bouncy curl for a long time, you need hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>After wrestling with them a few days, I finally gave up and just bought some cheap bearclaw clips to hold the curlers in place instead of using the pins.</li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder length, medium thickness and slightly wavy, so it holds well when I curl or straighten it; I rarely encounter hair dryers, curling irons, or curlers that won&#x27;t do something.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint would be the pins used to hold them in, but I think that&#x27;s more user error and lack of practice rather than the pins themselves.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t keep the pins in the slots buy carry them separately in a plastic baggie just because I&#x27;m too impatient to fit them back in the slots.</li>
            <li>but if you have thick hair like me, the clips spring off Better for smaller sections of hair or thinner hair</li>
            <li>maybe I didn&#x27;t read the instructions completely but one needs to make sure the curlers are pushed down tight in the case.</li>
            <li>Also, the large rollers are not very large.</li>
            <li>Plan a little extra in your styling time schedule to allow them to cool COMPLETELY -</li>
            <li>/&gt;There would likely not be enough rollers in this set for anyone with longer hair, or thicker hair, than my own, although they heat quickly enough that I think anyone with long/thick hair could easily do half, put them back into the case to reheat, and do the other side without too much fuss.</li>
            <li>This travel size hairsetter is exactly what I was looking for and similar to the Vidal Sassoon one I had purchased years earlier and needed to replace (both curlers are the same size too).</li>
            <li>I should have been able to figure the last part out, but I was hopeful as the overall dimension was about what I wanted for my small suitcase.  </li>
            <li>As far as I know, this is the only small heat roller set available and the size was the determining factor in my purchase:  </li>
            <li>I found it took longer, maybe that was due to being the first time??</li>
            <li>- I barely even notice they&#x27;re in my bag!</li>
            <li>, I think the 90 second heating won&#x27;t quite be hot enough to make lasting curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably end up buying a second pack of rollers just because my hair is getting a little longer but its worth it!</li>
            <li>The curlers dont seem to get very hot, because you can touch them, but it really only takes about 90 seconds to heat up, and i only left in my hair for less than 10 minutes, and the result is a very tight curl. :-)</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for your Farrah Fawcett wings and curls, the black curlers will be just right for you if you can get them to stay in your hair...</li>
            <li>I purchased this same item several years ago and my old one was wearing out, so ordered a new one to take on my 3 week vacation.  </li>
            <li>However, right now it is pretty useless and stressful trying to get ready.</li>
            <li>I like that they are compact because, unlike other sets, they don&#x27;t have bulky cases that would take up far too much space in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Trouble is the clips in this set are different than my original set and will not hold any of the rollers in.</li>
            <li>It worked well on my thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Remington needs to solve the clip problem or it has made a good product that will be rejected by buyers due to poor quality control - not design.  </li>
            <li>I wrote a scathing review a week ago because the large clips didn&#x27;t fit the large rollers.</li>
            <li>I live in dry climate and old rollers frying my hair.  </li>
            <li>These curlers take a little longer to heat than advertised but are worth the wait.</li>
            <li>medium size curlers are small and I have fine short hair.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; is more like a medium and the &amp;#34; meduim&amp;#34;  is a small!!</li>
            <li>It is very small, doesn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair, and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>The rollers we not large, let alone x large.  </li>
            <li>My old set, which was essentially the same, but red and green,  held my hair just fine.  </li>
            <li>Too bad, a great product until it breaks.</li>
            <li>The rollers are too heavy to stay in with the flimsy pins, the pins won&#x27;t fit around rollers with HAIR on them, and you constantly have to fight to get the rollers back on their \\&quot;plugs\\&quot; in the case.</li>
            <li>I went back to my old Remington Care Setter -</li>
            <li>for example, asian hair or natural stick-straight hair.</li>
            <li>I probably just need to take some time and practice using them, but they just didn&#x27;t wow me enough to even do that.</li>
            <li>These curlers get extremely hot when left too long in their container because the heat does not turn on and off to regulate the temperature to keep it at the same heat range.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are marked dual voltage on the bottom, but I have only used them here.</li>
            <li>I feel there&#x27;s a real goods description problem here, these are advertised internationally and are totally unfit for international purpose.</li>
            <li>I ended up using the hooks from my old Remington set, that were larger.  </li>
            <li>I use the larger rollers at the crown of my head, and the smaller ones on the shorter hair at the side and in the back; for the small rollers, I put more hair in them so the curls don&#x27;t end up like ringlets.</li>
            <li>The rubber surface of the roller is grabby and you can&#x27;t twist the roller to drag the hair ends into a straight alignment, so you end up wrapping the hair around the roller, ringlet-style.  </li>
            <li>O.o hair (</li>
            <li>(I have shoulder-length hair), curls the hair in big soft waves</li>
            <li>I threw my old (!) rusted steam roller set away.  </li>
            <li>like them so much bought second set for use in extra bath and third to travel with.</li>
            <li>I have too much hair for only 10 rollers especially since 5 of them are smaller.</li>
            <li>Because of my natural wave, I only had to keep them in my hair for 5-7</li>
            <li>Take me back to the old days where things worked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the rollers worked for me (heating time 10 minutes as the 90 second heat up suggestion isn&#x27;t hot enough, not by a long shot.  </li>
            <li>The shape of the clips is just a fraction different from the old ones and has tiny red tips instead of the larger red tips on the first set.</li>
            <li>not as expected.. been trying it out but doesnt work on my hair.. doesnt even become hot enough to hold curl</li>
            <li>They worked better that time but still not great.  </li>
            <li>these rollers are okay, but not great.</li>
            <li>I had to let each roller cool for a few seconds before using it, and re-roll several sections of hair because the rollers kept falling out.</li>
            <li>but if you have really thick hair or long hair you might want to go with a set that has more curlers.</li>
            <li>The clips are not made to fit the rollers and slowly work themselves away until they eventually shoot off the roller</li>
            <li>I was unable to source any kind of adaptor for this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are not enough rollers for my hair; which while it is thick, it only grazes the top of my shoulders.</li>
            <li>liked the compactness of the design and portability but it failed in doing the job we bought it for</li>
            <li>They dont heat up all too much, which is good if your hair is thin, but I have thick hair</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t realize they weren&#x27;t down all the way at first).</li>
            <li>After contacting Remington a second time, they finally shipped new clips.  </li>
            <li>I have short and thick hair and the clips did not hold nor were they easy to handle.</li>
            <li>but if I&#x27;m lucky I get a few hours of extra curls before they fall out.</li>
            <li>I was a little surprised when they said large and medium on the roller size...</li>
            <li>Also, there are always 1 or 2 curlers that stay less than &#x27;tepid&#x27; and never do get hot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the exact same issue as a number of other reviewers here.  </li>
            <li>I have longer hair (the longest it&#x27;s ever been, 6-7 inches past my shoulders) and needed something that could style my hair quickly and help w the frizz.</li>
            <li>If the curlers are not heating up, but sure that they are connecting properly at the base (check that the prongs are properly aligned and press the curler down to ensure a good connection).</li>
            <li>have long thing straight hair and it fell short to curl my entire head in one</li>
            <li>some reviews said these don&#x27;t get hot, not true in my case</li>
            <li>Guess I expected &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34; to be a bit bigger... rollers look more like Medium and Small to me, but I&#x27;m not a roller expert.  </li>
            <li>time when getting ready for work or other appointments.</li>
            <li>It was a hot mess.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my trip to Europe, thinking they would be very small for me to pack lightly.</li>
            <li>I can get most of my hair with one round, but usually have to re-use a couple of curlers to complete the job as I have quite a bit of hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to the larger hot curlers that only give your hair a bend but no real curl.  </li>
            <li>I have very straight and pretty thin hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy quick and the curls last about 6 hours in thick long heavy hair.</li>
            <li>But, for the hot, humid summer I was looking for lower maintenance, less damage to my hair &amp; a way not subject my hair to a lot of flat ironing.</li>
            <li>These get hot very quickly, but it is sometimes hard to get them to go on the small connector to reheat them.</li>
            <li>BUT I will never buy these again because the clips do not fit the large rollers!</li>
            <li>you only need 3-5 mins, it become really hot...and the curls last very long.</li>
            <li>- so straight that even when I blow dry with mousse, my hair still ends up dead straight.  </li>
            <li>so far these are the same only thing that has changes</li>
            <li>Setter\\&quot; for almost 10 years, so after the poor things couldn&#x27;t give any more, I decided to buy the same brand.</li>
            <li>The bottom of the bag contains an electrical base to which the ceramic rollers connect, so you have to make sure that each roller is securely plugged in.  </li>
            <li>I rarely rate anything a 1 star, but these are a total waste of your money.</li>
            <li>Of the 5 red clips, only 2 fit, the other ones were constantly coming loose causing the rollers to fall out of my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The curlers do not get very hot, and they are very heavy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get the metal clips on the rollers right, and usually I just use the plastic clips I have for my hair, you know, the ones with teeth that come in different colors, and they work fine.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot to the touch and burns your fingers a little.</li>
            <li>Also the plastic smell was a little unbearable at first.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe this little set of hot rollers worked as well as it did.</li>
            <li>First looking at this, I thought \\&quot;there&#x27;s no way this little thing can work</li>
            <li>I can stack them on top of each other on my bathroom counter and they hardly take up any room.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these for years, but recently I ordered a new set and found that the clips, especially the ones for the larger red rollers, do not hold the rollers in place even for the two minutes</li>
            <li>i love the little pouch, which is quite compact and less bulky than alternative versions of hot rollers, but they are VERY heavy, which is something to consider if you will be traveling by air, and need to watch weight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to hot rollers, but I&#x27;m not very happy with this set.</li>
            <li>and despite it being very long, I have a really hard time keeping the rolls in place, they fall easily.</li>
            <li>i am asian, so my hair is extremely reluctant to hold any shape beside straight.</li>
            <li>Listen to the other reviews --- they dont heat evenly and the clips for the red rollers dont stay in so they pop out as I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>Gave my first away to a friend who didn&#x27;t mind my few strands in it.  </li>
            <li>Small but powerful.</li>
            <li>but I like to extend the heating time a few minutes to get them really hot.  </li>
            <li>I was reluctant for years to try hot rollers because I was figured they&#x27;d be a waste of money.  </li>
            <li>so I used less hair on the large rollers, to no avail, they still fell out.</li>
            <li>However, they have changed the clips slightly and the large rollers DO NOT STAY IN.  </li>
            <li>The only down fall to this product is the rollers dont get hot enough.</li>
            <li>First, the pins for the larger rollers are not sized correctly, and they pop out no matter how little hair you put in the roller.  </li>
            <li>Second set, first set a little sturdier</li>
            <li>The ten curlers easily cover my long and thick hair.</li>
            <li>My only problem with this one is that the u shaped hooks that keep your hair on the roller - is not very wide.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this set to replace a set of old wax core rollers I had, which came in a large, hard plastic case that had bare metal rods on which to heat them, and plastic clips that had to be stored separately from the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love that the design is simple red and black, and takes up very little space.</li>
            <li>I find that these (compared to the R. Pearl unit) need to heat up a little longer, stay in my hair a little longer, and (obviously) there are far fewer curlers, so maybe this unit is not great for everyday use, but it is an excellent choice for travel!</li>
            <li>I wish all 10 rollers were the large ones as I don&#x27;t like a tight curl.</li>
            <li>Not sure if they were the right ones</li>
            <li>I will preface my review by a description of my hair:  very, very long (to my hips) with natural spiral curls (Type 3A/B, for those who care).  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect since I have very long, thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li>if you would rather not worry about one of your rollers falling out while you are running around your hotel room getting ready - get the claw clips and pack one less pair of shoes</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready in less then a minute.</li>
            <li>I accidentally figured out that the clips go into the very end of the curlers where there&#x27;s a slight depression.</li>
            <li>The clips barely keep the roller in place, despite starting at the middle of the shaft, tucking the ends, then rolling up to head, the ends always seem to fall out.</li>
            <li>Another thing, they get very hot and are hard to hold onto when putting in hair.</li>
            <li>As long as you make sure that they are seated completely on the base, they heat fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Heats quickly and stays in well in thick hair.</li>
            <li>set is too heavy, rollers are made of hard rubber and are so heavy that fall right out of my hair and won&#x27;t say in with the pins, the cord sticks out the back with no velcro holder just hangs out, the top does not zip so the rollers and pins can fall out.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly long (middle of my back) thick, but fine hair....</li>
            <li>These rollers only stay hot for a few minutes as they do not have posts that heat the entire roller.</li>
            <li>The heat up quickly, hold hair well and the 10 rollers are enough for even my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this as I travel frequently and needed a portable hot roller set, but these were, frankly, terrible.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are a little heavy, but even with my fine hair, I do not count that as a pro or a con as it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Imagine my disappointment when I started looking and realized that most new sets have a u shape indent to the curlers so the heating element rests against the curler rather than the curler having a hole in the middle that slides over a post.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very thick, yet fine (middle eastern hair).</li>
            <li>It does not warm up very hot, so you have to keep putting the rollers back in the bag and waiting.</li>
            <li>well on fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>The rollers do get hot enough but the wire clips are not strong enough to hold in the larger curlers.......I would not buy these again</li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t matter how little hair or much you put around the curler.</li>
            <li>Very compact case, takes little room on bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>otherwise you&#x27;ll find that some rollers are a little cooler and not heated as much as the others.</li>
            <li>The little clips that hold the rollers to your hair don&#x27;t stay clipped very well.  </li>
            <li>The image is kind of deceiving: the rollers are actually very small and the entire package is quite small as well.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length layed hair which is somewhat fine and and at at first I was afraid that the large rollers were going to be too small.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are fine for short, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>The fact that you don&#x27;t have the outer layer covered means with a clip means it will cool down your hair faster which means if you want tight curls, it won&#x27;t happen and 3.</li>
            <li>Are there no women who work at Remington that can try out these designs - who thinks it is a good idea to have heavy hard rubber curlers held in your hair with little pins?  </li>
            <li>I am a mixed african america and native indian female so my hair is very thick and somewhat in between coarse and fine.</li>
            <li>For some unknown reason they have shortened the clips on the larger curlers (red) and as other reviewers have mentioned, you put one in and by the time you are on the second curl the first one is sliding off your head ...</li>
            <li>I blow dry and flat iron my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have average, Irish hair and this does not get high enough to do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>the attached photo, you can see how the clip for the small black roller fits just fine.  </li>

            <li> Great for travel too.</li>
            <li> I did purchase plastic roller clips separately as the metal ones that came with the rollers sometimes would fly off.  </li>
            <li> A great buy.</li>
            <li> Had these for almost a year now and they still work great.</li>
            <li> The curlers are great, but I have slippery hair and probably should have purchased flocked rollers.  </li>
            <li> but they are just okay--nothing great.</li>
            <li> great product.</li>
            <li> This product works just great and the assortment of sizes works well for me.</li>
            <li> Hey, the price was great</li>

            <li> Great rollers at a great price.  </li>
            <li> LOL  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too great.</li>
            <li> This item arrived in a timely manner and was in great shape.  </li>

            <li> She has used it and was happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> like the fact that it was dual voltage, this makes it great to travel with as i dont have to bother about converters.</li>
            <li> These are a great size for travel, but that is about it.  </li>
            <li> It works really great on my hair.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a great purchase all the way around.</li>
            <li> The ones for the medium curlers are great.</li>
            <li> they still work great.  </li>
            <li> I almost gave up on these curlers because the clips do spring out and fly across the room - then the curlers fall.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> but the rollers give great curls.</li>
            <li> Really great product for the price.  </li>

            <li> This set is very nice.  </li>
            <li> Of the ones that do heat up, they do not heat up very warm.  </li>

            <li> Anyway, it is still a great set &amp; a good price too, so just be prepared if you get them to deal with replacing the pins.</li>
            <li> I find it best to wait a couple of minutes after removing all the rollers before I start touching my curls.  </li>

            <li> I love this set, it is absolutely perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> After spending the day at the beach, the rollers gave me nice curls after blow drying my hair!</li>

            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased, with the outcome.</li>
            <li> The grips at the end are very safe from the heat, and the heat on the curlers isn&#x27;t skin-burning.</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with it.  </li>

            <li> My hair had PERFECT large curl.</li>
            <li> the curls are amazing.</li>
            <li> I am going to look for clips that fit and keep them because they are dual voltage and worked great in Ireland with an adapter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that they fit, so I can take one set when I travel.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> have this handy hair setter.  </li>
            <li> wavy voluminous gorgeous sexy hip hair...</li>
            <li> and these are as good as any and better than a lot of them out there.</li>
            <li> Nice compact set but</li>
            <li> (before some fell out on their own).</li>
            <li> I really liked the \\&quot;travel pack\\&quot; design</li>
            <li> liked the size - just what I wanted for travel.  </li>
            <li> These are amazingly effective for the size of the set.</li>
            <li> I could not WAIT to get a set of my own.  </li>
            <li> So decided to buy my own.</li>
            <li> They are a nice compact size for travel.</li>
            <li> These curlers do not get tangled in my hair, and the resulting curls are nicely formed.  </li>
            <li> These curlers do not get tangled in my hair, and the resulting curls are nicely formed.  </li>
            <li> Nice for travel..small..compact..convenient.</li>
            <li> The newer set doesn&#x27;t seem quite as nice.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with this product , which arrived promptly , and before scheduled  date and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> My friend saw my set and bought a set of her own.  </li>
            <li> I also liked its compact design for use in travel.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled my reliable rollers are still available.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rubber sleeves on the rollers are kind to my super-fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have always liked the rollers (and remington products)</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a friend who has beautiful long hair and she told me they worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> They heat up nicely though.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if there were a couple of spare clips included in the event you miss one.</li>
            <li> Nice purchase.</li>
            <li> I am now loving this set.</li>
            <li> Compact, heats up well, nice travel kit</li>
            <li> but I have another kind that I use with them instead.</li>
            <li> The pins do not work you need to buy your own clips  </li>
            <li> so I am thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li> I had a nice curl though that lasted maybe an hour with lots of spray.</li>
            <li> so I take them out while still warm.</li>
            <li> I ALSO BROUGHT MY OWN SEPARATE HAIR CLIPS.</li>
            <li> To be honest, at this point I was fed up with the search</li>
            <li> It has 10 rollers and and heats up fast and is perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> travel really well and perfect size!</li>
            <li> The product would be excellent if they could fix this, as this makes them very time consuming and aggravating for her to use.</li>
            <li> The product is nicely designed and packaged but the rollers wouldn&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice inexpensive set.</li>
            <li> Rollers didn&#x27;t burn my hair, they created nice curls.</li>
            <li> I ended up using my own clam clips.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up much room, so it&#x27;s perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li> they work okay, but not as good as I would hope that they would.</li>
            <li> These rollers are compact and a nice size for medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> I seam to have some problems with one of the rolls getting warm</li>
            <li> : They come with their own clips.  </li>
            <li> They are the metal kind</li>
            <li> Even with my two sets, I feel like they&#x27;re the perfect size and don&#x27;t take up much space at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I got home from work Monday, it had already arrived, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> Nice compact size for traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> keep their heat for about 10-15 min, so do curl nicely &amp; also impart shine &amp; bounce.</li>
            <li> I have to start saying that I don&#x27;t own, and never did, a curling iron.</li>
            <li> and I got nice curls with</li>
            <li> It comes out with some nice curls and volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> liked the result</li>
            <li> A nice size assortment, but the clips DO NOT work.</li>
            <li> I love love love these curlers!!</li>
            <li> These are easy to use, quick to heat up and perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and simplifies my morning, however, I have fine hair VERY FINE HAIR and will need to seek something that will hold my hair.</li>
            <li> I have bought and tried many travel hot rollers, and these are the best.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful for my very fine and straight hair.  </li>
            <li> That aside, these Remington ceramic rollers are a quality product that will add body, shine and a curl to your tresses without damaging them, they are safe to use every day (I use them almost every day and my hair is very healthy).  </li>
            <li> My full set is by Remington and works great.  </li>
            <li> I think these curlers are brilliant - my first lot lasted 10 years (used every day).  </li>
            <li> Well, my desperation, in wanting a new hairstyle immediately, got the best of me</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m very happy with Cutie (my name for my new curlers.</li>
            <li> These heat up quickly and make great curls</li>
            <li> Great size for quick curls.  </li>
            <li> Heats quickly, travels well, and curls great.</li>
            <li> For a quick fix - as opposed to a permanent - this is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m super happy with this product.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly, the leave great curls.</li>
            <li> Very easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> However, they break very easily.  </li>
            <li> These are very easy to use &amp; to carry.</li>
            <li> My hair curls very easily</li>
            <li> Most of my hair fits in these, sometimes I have to do two rounds of curls to get all of my hair, but that&#x27;s OK!</li>
            <li> When you get good with the curler pins it should be fine.</li>
            <li> I love them , just put , take out and go, very quickly make my hair look beautiful, will buy 2 more , for mum and sister :)</li>
            <li> These rollers are the best to add super quick curls and bounce.</li>
            <li> So if you want really good, long-lasting curls, let it heat up for 2 or 3 minutes (rather than 90 seconds, which is warm, but not hot) or experiment for your own best results.</li>
            <li> I bought some rollers like this years ago and absolutely love them, so I was very excited to find these on amazon!</li>
            <li> Work great, no difficulty, easy to use, quick, fast, efficient - bottom line - have a great hair day!</li>
            <li> The pins tuck into their own pocket inside the cute case.  </li>
            <li> I bought these to replace my awesome but really old Remington Travel rollers.</li>
            <li> If I can find something to secure the rollers they will be good, otherwise they are headed for the garbage.</li>
            <li> These work great and heat up instantly, definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t warm real quickly</li>
            <li> These are a GREAT set, very much worth the money.  </li>
            <li> love full size set but for travel to conserve space these work great.</li>
            <li> do work great to keep them right</li>
            <li> Also I have very fine hair with body</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and don&#x27;t need a lot of heat.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and the curlers</li>
            <li> but it is still running strong!</li>
            <li> absolutely LOVE these rollers because first, they are rubber type with metal clips which holds hair perfectly and distributing heat precisely.</li>
            <li> Great little rollers... perfect for travel.  </li>
            <li> I loved the compact size of the product as I will be doing a TON of traveling, and loved how quickly they got hot and, as I said before, positively loved the results.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so I bought this with the hope that I will finally be able to make my hair look nice without going to the salon.</li>
            <li> Heats very fast, super compact wonderful for travel and affordable for ceramic with quality of Remington.  </li>
            <li> It is not expensive and does a great job on your hair.</li>
            <li> Great size, don&#x27;t get too hot to handle.  </li>
            <li> But for this price, $5 per year, I was pretty darn happy with it.  </li>
            <li> works great, curlers get hot.</li>
            <li> Didnt get as hot as I wished they would, but they do curl great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I purchased these hot setters.</li>
            <li> Be sure they are pushed all the way into the heating element before plugging in; they are perfect heat and easy to handle -- no burns on the fingers and pretty easy to roll.</li>
            <li> I can take more heat than most people), they are very easy to use, they stay put.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also very light and compact.</li>
            <li> since i bought the clips they stay very secure for a lot longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> THEY ARE NICE AND EASY TO TRAVEL WITH,  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would be good for travel or even keeping in my office for quick styling.  </li>
            <li> Warm up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are good sizes and they heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li> The curlers - heat up quickly, help you get a good, long-lasting curl.</li>
            <li> They heat up very quickly which is nice.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to enter into the world of hot rolling or get some travel rollers, this is great, if you want more than that, get a better set.</li>
            <li> I emailed the company about the problem, and to their credit, they immediately sent new clips that fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> They are SO GOOD - light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> but it comes with its own which work fine.</li>
            <li> but the med size stays in great while the large ones fall out no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> Great for travel have had a set for over 15 years and time for a new one!!</li>
            <li> If your looking for good quality and affordable hot ceramic rollers, I would recommend these!</li>
            <li> I think they are more like large and medium, but they do a great job of curling my shoulder length, layered hair.  </li>
            <li> They work great &amp; so fast with the perfect amount of rollers for mid length fine hair!</li>
            <li> Just be sure to apply the curlers in the direction that you want your  hair to go.</li>
            <li> I have used these Remington curlers for many years and was always satisfied and would purchase them about once every two years.  </li>
            <li> Meanwhile has anyone else found a better set of curlers?</li>
            <li> I love the rollers lock the curls in place</li>
            <li> Found out it was my error and now I love them</li>
            <li> I spend more time chasing the curlers and hooks around my bathroom than anything else.  </li>
            <li> I like this better than a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I recently took these with me to Costa Rica and they worked marvelously.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> He also offered to send me better clips.</li>
            <li> Love the size.</li>
            <li> However, it has been more than 30 days now, and the clips still have not arrived.  </li>
            <li> I love the product.   </li>
            <li> Great for me I am always in a hurry to get ready and go.  </li>
            <li> Love these.  </li>
            <li> but I guess I should of known most of the time \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The compact hot rollers arrived in perfect condition and fast delivery!  </li>
            <li> so they fit nicely in a weekend bag, but they&#x27;ll also fit nicely in my overcrowded bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I went with the Remington.  </li>
            <li> I had researched for a while, before buying this set and did not find anything better for my needs.</li>
            <li> They are fabulous!</li>
            <li> Seriously, I love these curlers and as someone who is dependent on rollers to style my hair, I put a lot of thought into the brands I purchase.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the hair setter for myself and my sister since I have had this setter for many years and love it.  </li>
            <li> However, the clips on the larger rollers spring off the roller, and fly across the room!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should get 30 or 20 rollers.</li>
            <li> This Remington Compact Rollers give more curls and works better with shorter hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love it if they came in 1-1/4 and 1-1/2\\&quot; rollers</li>
            <li> but i was able to make the 10 rollers work.  </li>
            <li> These are fantastic!</li>
            <li> I just love how compact they are.</li>
            <li> Got so many split ends which never was an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> these have become my favorite beauty item.</li>
            <li> I love this set.</li>
            <li> Love these ceramic curlers, couldn&#x27;t ask for anything to heat any quicker and they can do the job.  </li>
            <li> I love how compact it is</li>
            <li> I have a set with clips that cover each roller and those work much better.</li>
            <li> They are ceramic rollers WITHOUT the velvet flocking that so many rollers seem to have.  </li>
            <li> I love the pins for these curlers, too.</li>
            <li> --The overall size is perfect.  </li>
            <li> They worked flawlessly on 220v with only a plug adapter.  </li>
            <li> Either way - good curlers without a way to fasten them aren&#x27;t worth anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;d love to see it on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Either way - good curlers without a way to fasten them aren&#x27;t worth anything.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;d love to see it on YouTube.  </li>
            <li> Buying curlers was much more of a chore than it should have been, I think.</li>
            <li> The pins are straight, not curved, and do fly out of the roller.  </li>
            <li> But when I read that they are so much better than using a curling iron all the time I figured I would give them a try.  </li>
            <li> Love the curlers.</li>
            <li> Yes, I could use 2-4 more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is that It&#x27;s &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m glad to have it</li>
            <li> I love these rollers.  </li>
            <li> The size is perfect for traveling, the rollers work if you have enough scaffolding</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I love the case they come in.</li>
            <li> I love this set of rollers.  </li>
            <li> Great product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately I only wanted curlers for the crown part of my head for volume, which these work PERFECTLY</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I like the travel size for sure.</li>
            <li> If you have shorter or thinner hair this will work better than thicker and/or longer hair.</li>
            <li> Just make sure all your rollers are fully plugged in. :)</li>
            <li> I felt I needed more rollers and decided the buy the biggest rated ones.&lt;br /&gt;SOrry</li>
            <li> but it does not do the work unless you are light haired!</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a second set so that I could have more of the medium-size rollers, and this set works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Now its my favorite.  </li>
            <li> and I wouldnt be able to take my bulky set.</li>
            <li> I believe this is a quality-control issue, so I will start off by saying I am pleased with the size of the rollers and the case.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel, and great for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m better off packing my curling iron.</li>
            <li> These are ok.</li>
            <li> they take up minimum space on a shelf or countertop, which I love.  </li>
            <li> I would love these rollers if they would just stay in my hair.  </li>
            <li> LIKE MANY DO...</li>
            <li> maybe 2 or 3 more rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More like lukewarm rollers.</li>
            <li> Sets hair better then most rollers (and I have tried many).</li>
            <li> This hair setter is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love the fact the you don&#x27;t get a bunch of rollers that you never use...</li>
            <li> so I thought it would be better than they were based off that.</li>
            <li> It is truly dual voltage (though not labelled) and I have been them in many countries without any problem.</li>
            <li> Love  the travel size</li>
            <li> that I have had more time to try the rollers I am finding  </li>
            <li> Wish it came with better clips.</li>
            <li> I love them -</li>
            <li> They fit nicely in luggage without taking up space.  </li>
            <li> I really love these.  </li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many sets of curlers in my life, but never any that did this.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need some more practice.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> Love them.  </li>
            <li> I love these curlers.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of the size of this product.</li>
            <li> This  portable electric hairsetter works well, but could be designed better.  </li>
            <li> Today I&#x27;m tossing my babybliss rollers and purchasing two more sets to use at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll purchase these again if i need to, and I&#x27;ve recommended these to many friends.</li>
            <li> The results when I took them out was ok.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re OK.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t understand why Remington is not supplying UK/Europe market with appropriate goods.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Produces a better curl than a curling iron</li>
            <li> After looking at many, many reviews and many price ranges, I settled on these.</li>
            <li> If there were maybe one or two more rollers of each size, I wouldn&#x27;t have to re-use any to finish all my hair.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I decided on these travel rollers.  </li>
            <li> I love using these.  </li>
            <li> Love this item take everywhere, packs and travels well hold curls for days.</li>
            <li> The curls are just fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that the set is travel-sized, so I can take it with me everywhere</li>
            <li> We love that curlers are in two sizes.</li>
            <li> E more manageable for all thpes of hair.</li>
            <li> so it is ok.</li>
            <li> comact for travel, heat up fast, and great curls...</li>
            <li> what could be better.  </li>
            <li> I had a set just like this one many years ago.</li>
            <li> I love it and so does my daughters.  </li>
            <li> Looking for better set.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that these would be great</li>
            <li> Charge more and people who want quality will pay.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this compact set of rollers.</li>
            <li> Compact size is great for travel and the 90 second warm up time is amazing.</li>
            <li> These are okay.  </li>
            <li> and I love these.</li>
            <li> I have had these wonderful curlers before and this was the only place I could buy them.</li>
            <li> love size</li>
            <li> The clips keep coming out no matter how many ways I try to attach them, then the rollers fall out.</li>
            <li> They travel well and behave fabulously!</li>
            <li> My favorite set of rollers that I use at home and when traveling.  </li>
            <li> The larger size roller is perfect.  </li>
            <li> clips - they are not the best but the claw clips take up extra space.</li>
            <li> After seeing that these were the top selling curlers on Amazon, I thought why not give them a whirl.</li>
            <li> now seem to work better.  </li>
            <li> If you but this also by better clips to hold the rollers in.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot for work, and have never regretted using part of my precious carry-on suitcase space to bring these curlers with me.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t roll them all the way to my head, so i can get a looser curl, but overall i&#x27;m happy with the results and my hair has a curl all day!!!</li>
            <li> Very compact, and if you don&#x27;t need a lot of rollers, a great choice.  </li>
            <li> Two sizes of rollers for more definition of  curls.  </li>
            <li> I just wish there were a couple more rollers...</li>
            <li> Love these ....really like the compactness of these rollers ...great for travel</li>
            <li> I just wish there were 2 or 4 more.</li>
            <li> A curling iron works better but is more time consuming.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it worked better for the person I gave it to.</li>
            <li> If anyone has any advice I&#x27;d sure appreciate it.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to figure those out</li>
            <li> These did not meet my wife&#x27;s expectations but they may well be more a result of her lofty expectations rather than the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> To top it off, I was going to return them but found out that amazon would charge me almost $6 in shipping.</li>
            <li> I love using these.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need more rollers than this comes</li>
            <li> take top of hair</li>
            <li> The more you brush, the more you kill the curls.</li>
            <li> but the curls never held for more than 20 mins.</li>
            <li> Wish there were 2 more curlers in the pack, but I guess that is the point of &#x27;compact&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my hair with people asking me how to do it.  </li>
            <li> I can get the rollers to work, but I have to re roll most of them</li>
            <li> how safely I thought they were packed.</li>
            <li> An outstanding purchase.</li>
            <li> But  I want more biggest roller.  </li>
            <li> I Love these Hair curlers.</li>
            <li> 1- There aren&#x27;t many of them</li>
            <li> the&lt;br /&gt;older version are so much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did a practice</li>
            <li> I love this set.</li>
            <li> I bought some clips at the drugstore to use instead and love these.</li>
            <li> The red rollers are the perfect size for that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they would work better on longer or thicker hair</li>
            <li> And for the love of me I cannot keep the pins on the rollers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love these</li>
            <li> I like the red size best</li>
            <li> The curlers are heavier than most, but heat well.  </li>
            <li> I think most would be</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok to touch (</li>
            <li> These rollers are perfect, not only in size, but also in the quality and the curls in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I saw the great reviews on here and thought that these would be good to try because it was only a $15 investment.</li>
            <li> I think I need rollers w/ more &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; or teeth.  </li>
            <li> so I can use them :)</li>
            <li> Maybe I just need more practice?</li>
            <li> The relatively smooth design is nice and hair grips</li>
            <li> but I was able to wave it with these rollers.</li>
            <li> Sounds a pain I know, but I really do love these rollers and the convenient travel size.</li>
            <li> At most (for me)</li>
            <li> A rating of 3.5 would be more like it</li>
            <li> I love these</li>
            <li> so glad to have found this replacement.  </li>
            <li> Better use clips bought separately.</li>
            <li> Even better, my curls hold WITHOUT hairspray for 5-8 hours with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I do have longer hair though, so I had to purchase a second set to get the best out of the curlers.</li>
            <li> Good, right?  </li>
            <li> The clips have good storage pockets (there are two sizes of clips, so you have to use the right pocket).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have   a wax core that keeps the rollers hot and the perfect amount of rollers, 5 large and 5 medium.  </li>
            <li> My 13 year old granddaughter loved it!  </li>
            <li> Great for travel- lightweight and small case is ideal.  </li>
            <li> These are great, light weight &amp; fast heating!</li>
            <li> This particular model caused the clips to fly off</li>
            <li> It curls my hair instantly &amp; gives nice beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> I had the Remington H1022 for 8 or 10 years - a long time - and it is the perfect product - flocked, lightweight curlers that stay in hair, heat up but don&#x27;t burn fingers, heats fast, very nice zip cover</li>
            <li> They get super hot and create beautiful curls in a matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li> Love the product otherwise-heats quickly, curls nicely.</li>
            <li> The packaging was very nice and they certainly would have been easy to pack when traveling</li>
            <li> These rollers are pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The super compact size makes them easy to store under my sink, and they really do a great job of heating up quickly and curling my hair.</li>
            <li> They were nice, full and held up well.</li>
            <li> you are spending like $20 on a set of hot rollers and you get a good deal for your money.</li>
            <li> The rollers get good and hot</li>
            <li> sister told me about these hot rollers when I loved her hair.</li>
            <li> need too tweak the timing of how long I leave them in, but very impressed with how well this works.</li>
            <li> Wish these had worked for me, as I love the compact size and I have fine hair, so I don&#x27;t need as many curlers.</li>
            <li> Gets warm quickly and stays hot for a good curl.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these in the mail when they came!</li>
            <li> For some reason, in this new set the clips fly off and will not hold the rollers in at all.  </li>
            <li> There are more rollers in all and the clips can be stored easily with the rollers, as compared to the Conair.  </li>
            <li> They work quick and the curl was amazing.</li>
            <li> Lightweight for travel and easy to use. :)</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly and I am really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and make a nice curl.  </li>
            <li> I think I could easily use all 10 for fuller body and a more evenly distributed style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice and compact, heats up quickly, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> These work quickly and are so nice and compact.</li>
            <li> can see this set being a nice ADDITION to a larger set; or maybe good for people with shorter and/or very fine hair.</li>
            <li> With better clips, these rollers would be fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they will be fine in Europe with just an adapter plug.</li>
            <li> I love the curls it leaves in my shoulder-length, fine hair . . .</li>
            <li> They did heat fine, but you do have to make sure you clip them onto their holders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other sets of curlers in my life, and these are the best on the market today.      </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love to do my hair, but these you plug in and they heat up so quickly!  </li>
            <li> The sides stay cool, so very easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I have an older set purchased from Target and the clips fit great</li>
            <li> What a great set of 10 electric curlers, complete with coated pins...</li>
            <li> I have an old set if these that have worked great for years.  </li>
            <li> which really is most important.    </li>
            <li> Really, a great value and great product all around!just too small for the curlers.  </li>
            <li> Rollers placed vertically are more secure than rollers placed horizontally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> Give GREAT CURL and SOFT.  </li>
            <li> I love these, they make my hair look smooth and</li>
            <li> These rollers are a smooth texture and give my hair a more defined, bouncy volume.  </li>
            <li> I would have expected better quality rollers after 20 years!!!!!!</li>
            <li> you will be happy you did and get lots of body and soft curl.</li>
            <li> I set up my station, talk to the photographer, prep the models hair, by the time I&#x27;m ready for my rollers, they&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> but I got gorgeous, magazine-quality, voluminous curls that stayed the whole night through (</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping and Good Packaging.</li>
            <li> In general I&#x27;m really happy with how quickly the curlers heat and produce a really nice curl that lasts.</li>
            <li> It is a whole new science for me, but they&#x27;ve made my hair look great!</li>
            <li> This hairsetter is very compact for all it holds and warms up quickly, and does a great job giving my hair a controlled curl.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive a travel size set of rollers that would free up my luggage.  </li>
            <li> Right after I took them out, it looked nice</li>
            <li> I loved that these curlers are compact, heat up fast and came with clips that don&#x27;t leave a kink in fine hair.  </li>
            <li> so I had to wait longer but other than that, excellent travel curler set.</li>
            <li> IF YOU DONT ARRANGE THEM CORRECTLY, BUT OTHER THAN THIS, EXCELLENT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> These are perfect in this cute little case.</li>
            <li> Compared with what we used to have in the way of electric curlers, these are compact and sweet!  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;d rather stick with hot tools curlers-they work so much better!  </li>
            <li> I bought these based on other reviews and am very happy.</li>
            <li> Going to order a second set.......that good!</li>
            <li> Why make such cheap, flimsy clips for a very good product?</li>
            <li> They are now hot - quickly - and I find them great for traveling - just the right size!</li>
            <li> They are easy to bring along to the pageants.</li>
            <li> Easy to put in, Easy to take out and</li>
            <li> Its compact design fits easily in a suitcase or bag.   </li>
            <li> Easy to pack.</li>
            <li> The rollers are easy to handle.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve easily  traveled with me on my every trip.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (And my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl easily.)  </li>
            <li> THEY ARE EASY TO PUT IN...</li>
            <li> They are easy to pack and are lightweight.</li>
            <li> Warms, curls and fits in suitcase easily.  </li>
            <li> She has always wanted something easy to use and compact.  </li>
            <li> Rollers stay in place easily with the pins provided&lt;br</li>
            <li> These heated up within 5 minutes and went in easily once I figured out the metal hooks.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> always easy to get hair to get on to rollers without kinking</li>
            <li> They are easy to use, and applying hairspray immediately after removal ensures a curl that lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> My hair curls easily, as does one of my daughters.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy for travel and works just right.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was really easy..</li>
            <li> These curlers are extremely easy to use and each curler has a rubber body to help stay put in your hair.</li>
            <li> The soft exterior is a good idea for travel; I just wish the curlers were more user-friendly.</li>
            <li> I bought these two years ago and they are still going strong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the device works perfectly, and I think would be good for chin length thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product yet, but I have a similiar one to it and liked it very much.  </li>
            <li> They are particularly great for fine hair, and these have better clips than the last set I bought.  </li>
            <li> They are particularly great for fine hair, and these have better clips than the last set I bought.  </li>
            <li> They are good for travel, but they don&#x27;t get super hot.</li>
            <li> The second set had more that worked but did not get very warm, and one did not work.  </li>
            <li> The travel roller set is very light - weight and it heats quickly.</li>
            <li> I have fine, easy to curl hair</li>
            <li> The first time I used them I let them warm up for 3-4 minutes before I used them, and they did nothing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no difficulty with the wire pins, and they slide into position nicely, holding the rollers exactly where I place them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no difficulty with the wire pins, and they slide into position nicely, holding the rollers exactly where I place them.  </li>
            <li> It travels pretty nicely.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews of hot rollers before settling on this product, and I&#x27;m thrilled with the outcome.  </li>
            <li> Someone else commented that you need to be sure the rollers are \\&quot;plugged\\&quot; into the post, and that is true-</li>
            <li> and they also get nice and hot.  </li>
            <li> Kept them on my hair for only 10 minutes and got beautiful waves.</li>
            <li> I rarely have time (or want to spend time) fussing with my hair, and these rollers are the perfect way to make my flat, fine hair seem bouncier and fuller.  </li>
            <li> Close to a near perfect hair setter particularly for travel.</li>
            <li> I have medium length, fine hair</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose fine.</li>
            <li> --The size of the rollers is just fine.  </li>
            <li> could&#x27;ve used another couple rollers, but for travel the number of rollers is just fine.    </li>
            <li> Bring plenty of these curler sets in for them to use (no need to plug them in or heat them up - that part works fine).  </li>
            <li> and I replace them - even though they&#x27;re still working fine).  </li>
            <li> and I replace them - even though they&#x27;re still working fine).  </li>
            <li> They heated up fine</li>
            <li> My hair is plentiful but fine</li>
            <li> I have used hot rollers for many, many years.</li>
            <li> The product is fine for curling your hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the type of clips that come with it, so I bought the plastic pinch type for myself, however they do work fine.</li>
            <li> I had purchased the separate clip ons, however the ones that come with the package work just fine.</li>
            <li> get nice and hot and curls come out smooth and shiny,</li>
            <li> The curlers stay in just fine, in spite of my fine hair.</li>
            <li> The curlers heat up fine.  </li>
            <li> my hair is chin length, I have alot of hair but its fine</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just too fine</li>
            <li> Seller and delivery fine though</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> I have some phenominal clips that I got with a hairsetter years ago, so I didn&#x27;t use the clips that came with the hairsetter as those types of clips have never worked well with my fine hair.</li>
            <li> they work fine.  </li>
            <li> I figured out that was because I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> i have fine hair that won&#x27;t hold curl....</li>
            <li> (I have fine hair with layers, so it&#x27;s a struggle to get the longer and shorter pieces to all stay secured)&lt;br /&gt;Pins</li>
            <li> and they worked fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in layers; it&#x27;s finely textured but there&#x27;s a lot of it-</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, but it is fine, and these do not work.</li>
            <li> The small footprint is great, and everything else is good.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and lots of it..</li>
            <li> The clip fits perfectly and holds when pushed in that slightly depressed area.</li>
            <li> The smalles ones are fine though.</li>
            <li> I have lots of fine hair, as well.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t stay in fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying that they are for everyone, but if you have shoulder length fine hair</li>
            <li> The clips hold fine..</li>
            <li> I have to do hair quickly!</li>
            <li> They do heat up quick!  </li>
            <li> It sure is convenient and compact but doesn&#x27;t heat up all that well and not as quickly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> These heat up quickly and hair seems to hold curl longer and better.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to find this replacement since I found that the rollers heat up quickly and hold the waves I am looking for.  </li>
            <li> I love how compact these rollers are, and how quickly they heat up.</li>
            <li> , these don&#x27;t snag your hair when you try to take them out - worthy alone of a five star rating!  </li>
            <li> I love the idea of a compact set I can toss in my suitcase, but the rollers don&#x27;t get very hot and the pins don&#x27;t hold them in place.</li>
            <li> The black clips fit perfectly and held the rollers in my hair.</li>
            <li> Hold the curlers on the edges as the middles get very hot!  </li>
            <li> Otherwiase works well and is very fast!!</li>
            <li> (-and it helps I have very good skin and carefully applied make-up...</li>
            <li> The size is wonderful, easy to travel with, gets hot enough and sets my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> This is not an accurate description.</li>
            <li> I like that the set isn&#x27;t huge, so</li>
            <li> I was worried about the flocked rollers, but I liked them better than my old version.</li>
            <li> and I did not  want a huge set.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not rolling what I believe to be a huge amount of hair either.</li>
            <li> I would suggest to the company to make their clips about an inch longer and it would fit all hair types.</li>
            <li> I put up with it because the results are so fantastic.  </li>
            <li> While compact, light weight and small-sized for travel</li>
            <li> They fit no problem.  </li>
            <li> The smooth curlers never get tangled or rip your hair.  </li>
            <li> Plastic spring clips are available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Shipping speed was fantastic.</li>
            <li> The set is also dual voltage, which is important for me for overseas travel.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t fit that well.</li>
            <li> In any event, the overall size of the case is great.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on my bathroom counter and will easily fit in my gym bag.  </li>
            <li> While I have a larger set for home, these are great for when I travel.  </li>
            <li> Metal clips do not hold my hair securely so I literally have to stay still if I want to get any curls.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The ends of the rollers are perfectly comfortable to the touch, and I never burn my fingertips like some rollers</li>
            <li> I then spray with another mist of anti-humidity hairspray, bend forward at the waist, and lightly tousle my hair at the scalp.  </li>
            <li> The ends of the rollers are perfectly comfortable to the touch, and I never burn my fingertips like some rollers</li>
            <li> I then spray with another mist of anti-humidity hairspray, bend forward at the waist, and lightly tousle my hair at the scalp.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are rather smooth</li>
            <li> I know they are cheap.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe how well they work and at such a great price.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair to the shoulders, these honestly give me curls not just body.</li>
            <li> The primary benefit of this set is the convenience and space saving.  </li>
            <li> The ones from the 80&#x27;s were light, made out of plastic and heated with a metal plate.</li>
            <li> This set of curlers could easily fit in a medium size purse.     </li>
            <li> They will not go in all the way to hold the roller securely.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I like that it&#x27;s very compact and works nicely.  </li>
            <li> I thought that they were just cheap and going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Best to open the case and give the rollers a push on the top to make sure they are all properly seated on the heating elements.  </li>
            <li> I emailed Remington and they confirmed that this is not a dual-voltage product.  </li>
            <li> Overall this would have been a great product if it wasn&#x27;t for gravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They worked great for the last 10 years</li>
            <li> The surface of these rollers is really nice and soft (but not spongy) and I could tell a difference in how much more smooth my hair was after one use.  </li>
            <li> I will use these until they die, then happily replace them with something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using these on a recent month-long trip, I&#x27;m downgrading my rating to one star.</li>
            <li> Clips for the smaller rolls hold great.</li>
            <li> These are compact and light weight - travels well.  </li>
            <li> Can I have a set of clips that FIT sent to me?</li>
            <li> Once I opened them up they were extremely warm and really held the curls.  </li>
            <li> Rather than return these I will purchase a bunch of plastic hair clips and just clip the curler with them because they do heat fast and curl nicely.</li>
            <li> She liked it so much she wanted another as a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to secure them , they  have a coating on them that makes them slide out</li>
            <li> I bought these online and assumed I was getting the same great product.</li>
            <li> I had another set (same brand) that came with clips that worked great which is why I ordered these.</li>
            <li> The product is great but smaller rollers for my hair!</li>
            <li> Compact and light.</li>
            <li> If I could find clips to fit</li>
            <li> The overall unit has a great compact size and shape.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I use the metal pins that came with them although they don&#x27;t hold as securely but don&#x27;t leave any crimp marks on hair and</li>
            <li> For some reason the clips didn&#x27;t fit correctly and would pop off as you were curling your hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, I could&#x27;ve done without the extra clips I ordered with them, the suck and their hold on the rollers aren&#x27;t that great at all.</li>
            <li> This set fit the bill nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but these are now part of my primary go-to hair style.</li>
            <li> I actually use them with no product and the curls hold great for about 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li> The size of the curlers and the overall packaging is great</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the clips because I bought a set that I use for every curler I have that holds really securely.</li>
            <li> The clip on things that come with the product to secure my hair doesn&#x27;t even do the job.</li>
            <li> I had to buy those huge claw clips to secure the rollers in.</li>
            <li> Results - great, until I gently brushed it.</li>
            <li> but they weren&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li> I do wish there was an indicator light to let you know that it is heating up</li>
            <li> The clips are a cheap cop-out and cause nothing but frustration when trying to use them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some for the last  twelves years , used all the time even great for traveling</li>
            <li> They would actually &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; off and fly across the room.  </li>
            <li> Makes great curls, I like that the rolls have two different sizes.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of my these for myself and liked them so much a friend asked to borrow them for a trip.  </li>
            <li> in a light travel case.  </li>
            <li> I travel all over the country on my Harley and this is going to be great when my hair is not pulled back in a bandana..</li>
            <li> I have been using hair rollers for close to 20 years to style my hair and have used so many different brands and am always in search of a good travel set.</li>
            <li> but I really wanted something more convenient and much more compact to travel with</li>
            <li> LOVED the bouncy curls with such an elegant view.</li>
            <li> They were good for travel when I had short hair, I could use these and they were just OK.  </li>
            <li> I was able to have the bouncy curly look or I wrapped my hair after using the rollers for a more straight look.</li>
            <li> I have thin, color-abused hair that sits just below my shoulders and these two sizes were perfect for creating a nice look.  </li>
            <li> Love how fast they heat up, but most of all the the curls.</li>
            <li> Need more practice, but overall it&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li> I had the old Remington travel rollers and loved them.  </li>
            <li> After 3 rollers, I found the angle that worked for me: I insert diagonally, cross wise, from the bottom of the roller up vs insert the pin from top down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary</li>
            <li> so far so good.  </li>
            <li> They get very hot very quickly Travel well- easy to pack in a weekender or backpack  </li>
            <li> Not only do they heat up quickly, they are really hot and my hair comes out perfectly.  </li>
            <li> The best part is the package is so small I can easily travel with them.</li>
            <li> Rollers do warm up quickly, without getting too hot.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could really ask for any more than heated curlers being quick, easy, and compact!</li>
            <li> The price is right, they work well, and I love that they are so compact.</li>
            <li> I found that they heat up very quickly and the compact size it cool</li>
            <li> I had everything timed perfectly, got out of the shower, put the rollers on, got dressed, put a little make-up and get the rollers off and presto! perfect hairdo in less than 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  I contacted Remington to get them to send me clips that fit; they did indeed send 6 more large clips, but those still didn&#x27;t work with my roller set!  </li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair and these curlers work great.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty happy with these hot rollers, although it is the first time I have ever used somethiing like this.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li> The rollers heat up quickly and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and are an easy way to do my hair when I don&#x27;t want to straighten.</li>
            <li> Once you learn how to use the pins to clip the curlers into place, the process is quick, easy and painless.  </li>
            <li> Cons:  Because the rollers are smooth and not prickly, your fingers touch more surface area and they are HOT.</li>
            <li> This product heats up quickly, but hair slips off easily.  </li>
            <li> They heat up fairly quickly, and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> They heat up fast and are very easy to pack</li>
            <li> They are very easy to store which I like because sharing a bathroom with 5 others doesn&#x27;t leave much room for my stuff.</li>
            <li> My space is limited so this with the conair travel smart dryer will be awesome.  </li>
            <li> okay since it&#x27;s very straight</li>
            <li> Love its compact size, love how fast it heats, and love how gentle the rollers seem on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry straight the best I can, then curl.  </li>
            <li> I use the bigger curlers more than the smaller ones and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love hot rollers and I have used them forever.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with my first</li>
            <li> Make sure the rollers are on the prong so it will get hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many sets of hot rollers since they came out</li>
            <li> Many hot roller sets have gone to funky plastic clips to hold the rollers in place, or have changed the shapes to oval rollers.  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement set for some Remington hot curlers I owned for many years.</li>
            <li> Remarkably 10 rollers is just enough.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for about 16 dollars and have to admit that I would probably pay even more because I like them so much!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how many hot roller sets on the market no longer provide storage for their corresponding clips or</li>
            <li> Although the set was small and perfect for travel, I could not get the pins to stay on the rollers.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW</li>
            <li> instead of the original pins?  </li>
            <li> I had to replace my hot curlers more than five years ago.</li>
            <li> but I need rollers that can stay hot for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> looked them up, sure they no longer made this exact model, because I would be in a panic if one day, eventually, they were no longer working.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I bought these because of the compact size.</li>
            <li> These small, compact curlers work perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li> I love this simple, economic and great roller set...</li>
            <li> They do not get too hot, I was able to touch them without burning my fingers.</li>
            <li> weren&#x27;t worth bringing home!</li>
            <li> I bought my original set at Walgreen.  </li>
            <li> However, I had to take off a star since they changed the clips from the original design.</li>
            <li> Unlike my original hairsetter, this one has no place to tuck in  the cord to keep it neat and not sprawled all over the counter or drawer when not in use.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I ordered this based on reviews but so disapponted when I received.</li>
            <li> I love these hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited for them to come.</li>
            <li> I bought the first one many years ago and was devistated when one of my kids accidentally threw some of my rollers away.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, so this small kit is just perfect.</li>
            <li> Its been SO many years since I used hot rollers and they haven&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li> I love this rollers sooo much!</li>
            <li> I love these... so much!  </li>
            <li> They are small and compact so perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Es rápido y super fácil de usar, super recomendada.&lt;br /&gt;Perfecto para viajar porque tiene los dos voltajes y super pequen;o paquete :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small set for home and travel, and these are perfect!</li>
            <li> The surface of the rollers is kind of rubberized, so they grip the hair well; better, actually, than the smooth set I use in the salon.</li>
            <li> I have 4 inch long hair and the clips pop off the rollers and fly across the room.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they can&#x27;t make better hot rollers.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get as hot as some sets that I&#x27;ve owned, but I&#x27;m glad they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This has got to be designed for people with super fine hair.</li>
            <li> I was excited at the portability of this, and it is portable...</li>
            <li> This product is worth buying!</li>
            <li> This is a nice size for travel and the case itself is soft-sided, not a hard plastic shell</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and stick straight.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s get very hot and great for travel nice and small</li>
            <li> They do get hot quickly and my curls came out very smooth.</li>
            <li> These are awesome and curl my very thick, very straight hair quite nicely.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with this product, i gave few sets to my friends, they are really satisfied.</li>
            <li> Yes, you can set your entire head with 10 rollers but 2 more would have been nice.</li>
            <li> I love the compactness of this set; the curlers heat up very quickly and stay hot; the set is small, easy and lightweight to travel with; the curlers are perfect for my shoulder-length hair; and it&#x27;s very dependable and affordable.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I found the hassles to be worthwhite as I&#x27;m able to give my hair the kind of waves that have never before been possible-</li>
            <li> Just enough rollers to get a good &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; when traveling light.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll have to get another set, and add the large to my first set, then give the second set with all mediums to my friend that has shorter hair... perfect plan.</li>
            <li> This product wins on price, packaging, portability, and the cool ends that make the rollers easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> The new model is as good as the old one, the curlers heat up very quickly and they are easy to put in the hair.  </li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;m done cleaning or cooking I take the rollers down and my hair is good to go!  </li>
            <li> These are so easy to use and heat up well and are just the right size for me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Carol</li>
            <li> I love the design and how easy they are to pack, but they are also good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> My hair never holds a curl for very long and I was able to have my hair curly all through Easter service and lunch after!!  </li>
            <li> The x-large are more the size of (large)</li>
            <li> the large are more the size of (medium )...</li>
            <li> The large is more like a medium to me.  </li>
            <li> I do love the curlers, but the clips that come with the item for the large curlers do not stay - even without any hair they push off the curler.  </li>
            <li> I love that these are portable and you can throw them in any bag (backpack, large purse or travel bag) and take them with you.  </li>
            <li> really love the outcome of everyone&#x27;s large bouncy curls)</li>
            <li> Followed all the tips suggested by others in the comments, but these were nothing special.</li>
            <li> Had to order special clips.</li>
            <li> The price is right, too!</li>
            <li> My curls were just the right amount of bounce and shiny as well!  </li>
            <li> They are a super compact, travel friendly set--</li>
            <li> love these curlers they get hot quickly and can be reheated quickly when needed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size for a full head of hair, to add volume and curl, quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> in all - compact, ten rollers, does not feel scalding hot but gives a great curl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Advantages: small size is great for using at home and traveling, don&#x27;t need more than the 10 rollers to curl all of your hair</li>
            <li> Well with this product, I now have beautiful curls that would last the whole</li>
            <li> Love them, does not burn your fingers, doesn&#x27;t hurt your hair, or cause damage to hit, my husband loves the way the curls look, I have a set of my own (probably need another one for myself because i have long hair), this was a gift.  </li>
            <li> At this point I am ready to return them, after picking them up off the floor many times in a row.</li>
            <li> I like the compact design, thats about the only good thing I can say about these.  </li>
            <li> thanks to these hair rollers i no longer have a boyfriend, and most of my remaining hair is severly damaged.</li>
            <li> I had a set of these rollers for years, and loved them and finally wore them out.  </li>
            <li> The only good thing I have to say about this product is that it&#x27;s dual voltage.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find enough good things to say about these rollers.</li>
            <li> If my hair grows much longer and if I need more rollers, I&#x27;ll just buy another set of these.  </li>
            <li> These have some kind of rubberized surface, does not hold nearly as well as the flocked rollers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that the voltage worked and that it heats up really fast, but I can&#x27;t stand those metal holders.</li>
            <li> I am mystified how people gave good reviews on this product...what on earth did they do with the tiny rollers?</li>
            <li> My mother used to joke that one must suffer to be beautiful, but this torture is not worth the outcome.  </li>
            <li> Ideal for travel or just everyday</li>
            <li> EVEN IF YOU TAKE THEM OUT BEFORE THEY ARE COMPLETELY COOL HAIR</li>
            <li> I did get a nice soft curl &amp; bounce with what heat I did get.</li>
            <li> Works like the old time Clairol ceramic hairsetters - nice curls.</li>
            <li> but the point was to have two full kits.  </li>
            <li> I immediately bought this set because I missed it so much :)</li>
            <li> These are good overall</li>
            <li> If you have short hair and get a set that works properly it would be a good deal for you the case and pin holder compartment is a good functional concept.</li>
            <li> There should be a &#x27;cool&#x27; spot to hold them while you are putting them in your hair</li>
            <li> End caps are cool.</li>
            <li> I leave them in my hair until they cool</li>
            <li> Two stars only because the concept is a good one</li>
            <li> I  brought clips from my full set at home to try and they &#x27;helped&#x27;, but still did not hold well.  </li>
            <li> With technology, you figure that rollers would become better not worse.</li>
            <li> so a good product with all the components working properly is possible.  </li>
            <li> My sweet husband just gave this set to me for Christmas</li>
            <li> UNTIL CURLERS FEEL MOSTLY COOL ON YOUR HEAD.</li>
            <li> When they are cool, take the rollers out.</li>
            <li> I waited about 10-12 minutes to take them out after I finished putting in all of them, until the majority of them were cool.</li>
            <li> They heat up very fast and are easy to pack around.</li>
            <li> I have had other hot rollers and these are far and away superior and great price to boot.</li>
            <li> I have a large set of Remington hot rollers and love them, so I figured this small set would be perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> They also slip off pretty easily ,and dont stay in place well.</li>
            <li> Rollers are not too hot to the touch, which makes them easy to use.</li>
            <li> I use this on short hair and it does a nice job - heats up quickly, easy on my hair and works quickly.  </li>
            <li> and the &amp;#34;pins&amp;#34; for the large rollers were longer (as they were originally!).  </li>
            <li> I have used hot rollers for many years and love the wax core rollers that really heat up and stay hot.</li>
            <li> My only issue is the clips for the large rollers don&#x27;t stay on and fly across the bathroom.</li>
            <li> May still look for a similar one with the 10 large but this was a great buy and deal.</li>
            <li> I really wish they made a larger set of this exact type of rollers, including jumbo sized ones - it would be the ideal for home use.</li>
            <li> The only good I would say about it is that the clips fit pretty well</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size to just add a little curl to my hair and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
            <li> Good rollers, some didn&#x27;t clip in very well in my medium length layers but the long layers were ok.</li>
            <li> Finally - I know one of the most important feature in a hot roller is how well it stays secured in your hair, and that can differ significantly based on hair type; these work phenomenally for me (the combination of the rubberized texture of the roller, and the type of pin included).  </li>
            <li> The first time I used them they worked fine.</li>
            <li> Its not too hot for my fine</li>
            <li> These rollers heat up fine -- but they get so hot</li>
            <li> You will get smooth nice curls when used properly.</li>
            <li> This is a great size and heats up quickly, but the roller clips for the big rollers don&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
            <li> This product also curls hair quickly, so be en garde,</li>
            <li> These heat up quickly</li>
            <li> I have used these rollers (same brand) for many many years.  </li>
            <li> It was also quickly delivered.</li>
            <li> If you have to use the additional rollers, they heat up quickly also when you place them on the heating tray.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who needs a quick set on the go setter I am purchasing another one for our motorhome</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li> Heats quickly</li>
            <li> They work as advertised, just expect to let them heat up longer than the stated \\&quot;quick curl\\&quot; time.</li>
            <li> I bought my latest set when even though they didn&#x27;t take up my challenge (see last review) they introduced j-clips that addressed my complaints (as well as many on here).  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, but gets hotter the longer you leave</li>
            <li> so it might be a challenge for very short hair (a curling iron is best for short hair anyway),</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d rather pay more and get a decent product.</li>
            <li> i love travel size rollers.&lt;br /&gt;i replace my older remington rollers from 2001 with the updated version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this as a \\&quot;quick fix\\&quot; for my hair.  </li>
            <li> They heat up quick.</li>
            <li> Heat quickly.</li>
            <li> Buyer be aware: You may fare better with flock-covered hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> Quick heating up - does not burn hair.</li>
            <li> QUICK  </li>
            <li> Heats quickly.  </li>
            <li> Heats quickly.</li>
            <li> All That Quick Curl Travel Hair Setter]]</li>
            <li> I keep one (combined) set in my office to give myself a quick hair</li>
            <li> But, I used an additional product,  Conair Super Clips, to keep the rollers in place 2 resolve the issue.</li>
            <li> All and all I like this product, and I can&#x27;t wait for the next big event to make my hair look great!</li>
            <li> Just plug them up and they heat quickly.</li>
            <li> super convienient</li>
            <li> I had to buy the Conair super clips.  </li>
            <li> The quick curl rolls and the claims keep falling off of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, and it is my first experience with hot roller.  </li>
            <li> It does heat quickly but not as quick as it seems to advertise.</li>
            <li> It cme quickly and works so well.  </li>
            <li> Since this is my first experience with hot rollers, it took more time than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> My daughter tried it and was amazed at how quick curled or waved her hair.</li>
            <li> This is correct; they work well for medium to longer hair, heat up quickly, and don&#x27;t leave &amp;#34;pin marks&amp;#34; on the hair.  </li>
            <li> Unit heats quickly.</li>
            <li> Heat up really quick.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and are compact.</li>
            <li> They heat up quick</li>
            <li> /&gt;Order was quick arriving in three days</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find these only to find out who the clips don&#x27;t fit the model!!</li>
            <li> They work well and heat up quickly.</li>
            <li> heat quickly and the curls</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and curls stay.</li>
            <li> I love this roller kit perfect for travel/every day, compact and easy to store and the rollers and clips do not leave odd kinks in ones hair like other types of clips and rollers do.  </li>
            <li> packaging is also great - the small, compact set easily fits into my carry-on suitcase or gym bag.  </li>
            <li> Once I pushed them all down, they heated quickly and worked great.</li>
            <li> first of all, the rubber curler with these types of curlers are a huge mistake.  </li>
            <li> They did not get very hot and did not work in my hair.  </li>
            <li> so they could get very hot.  </li>
            <li> These heat up very fast and curl in just minutes!  </li>
            <li> They do get very hot.</li>
            <li> Also, the rollers are VERY hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Does not get very hot, I think.</li>
            <li> The price is great and the compact size would fit so much better in my luggage, but they don&#x27;t get hot enough in comparison to my regular curlers (Vidal Sassoon VS321).</li>
            <li> I had my first set for ~5 years before replacing the case when it started taking longer to heat up and never reached a hot enough maximum temperature although the rollers themselves were still in great condition.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it looks to be a nice product even though I wasn&#x27;t able to try it out.</li>
            <li> The wire clips do not hold the rollers well and can get very hot.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is a nice travel set, and I like them in general.</li>
            <li> They barely even get warm.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t get very hot no matter</li>
            <li> Gave 2 stars because they get really hot and fit neatly in a suitcase.</li>
            <li> Please note, they do get VERY hot, so it may be beneficial to use a glove (as one would with a curling wand)</li>
            <li> This set packs up easily in the suitcase, gives tight, cute curls, and is easy to use!</li>
            <li> Packing is petite and can easily travel in carry on luggage or a large purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the small &amp; large size rollers are excellent.  </li>
            <li> The rollers heat up quickly and stay hot enough to get a good curl.  </li>
            <li> They are better for your hair than the 80&#x27;s hot curlers because they get warm enough to get the job done but not scorching hot which causes your hair to fry.     </li>
            <li> Highly recommended, especially for the great price.</li>
            <li> To just get some curl in your long straight hair that you then put up on top of your head (me), they are ok!</li>
            <li> Other than these two design problems, this is a great little hairsetter that holds up well and works very nicely.  </li>
            <li> They heat up quite fast and are easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> but it was really fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> I hope you will love these hot rollers as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> I hope you will love these hot rollers as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> You have to &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; your curling option ( at least I did) because I am used to using alot  more rollers, but for a weekend get-a-way, these were nice to have!</li>
            <li> My hair is super straight and fine so that may be part of the problem.</li>
            <li> The rollers may be too small for those with curlier hair, but if your hair is straight it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy yo use.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly, is compact, and curls really well.  </li>
            <li> work well and are the perfect size for the small bag that you take on a trip..would recommend these ,thanks</li>
            <li> They heat up fast and are compact and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> They heat up fast and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have super fine, straight as a stick hair with no body</li>
            <li> Easy to use and fast.  </li>
            <li> rollers were easy to handle, and the rubbery texture kept them from sliding too much through my hair.</li>
            <li> And the curls are SO PRETTY, and they stay!</li>
            <li> These Remington Ceramic rollers give me exactly the kinds of curls I&#x27;ve been hoping for!  </li>
            <li> they definitely do their job and - with a healthy dose of hair spray - the curls hold!</li>
            <li> The waves you get are just effortlessly pretty!</li>
            <li> When we use these hot rollers on their hair though, there are curls for hours!  </li>
            <li> They are more like the traditional hot rollers which I love.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars is because i wish it brought more rollers!</li>
            <li> I bought these curlers because, as a frequent traveler, the unit is light and easily packable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> definitely hot enuf to curl your hair, but not so hot that you can&#x27;t easily handle them.</li>
            <li> They heat up so quickly and give my hair such a nice curl.</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up quickly and with just the right amount of heat.  </li>
            <li> I have super bouncy curls right now.</li>
            <li> Rollers reach a high temperature quite quickly and are easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I have very baby fine hair cut into a bob.  </li>
            <li> They heat up really well, curl very well, and they are so light and easy to pack.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, warm up fast and the curls last!  </li>
            <li> You need to make sure when you replace the curlers that they push down securely on the spot to make sure they warm properly.</li>
            <li> I took the advice of one reviewer and bought a second set so that I could mix the sizes and that works great because they all fit on any of the heating units...and the price was still less than some of the more pricey roller choices.  </li>
            <li> Since it does heat up so quickly (and so much), I often leave the top open while heating to allow the top of the rollers to stay somewhat cooler, and easier to remove.</li>
            <li> They take up little space and do a great job.  </li>
            <li> Still this is a great little set with the biggest bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> Once I take out the curlers I comb out, tease a little, use hairspray and whammo...a great look</li>
            <li> This a great little roller set.  </li>
            <li> I was able to make the 10 rollers work for my entire head of fine hair.</li>
            <li> The pins won&#x27;t stay in, and I bought some clips specially made for hot rollers and those don&#x27;t keep the rollers in either.</li>
            <li> They are amazing, they heat nicely even though they take a while (learned that one the hard way-</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how much \\&quot;longer\\&quot; is, but because my hair is hard to curl, I let them heat up for 10 minutes, and I get excellent results every time!    </li>
            <li> Great set of curlers for travel or everyday - with clips that match the curlers</li>
            <li> One aspect I really like it the smooth surface of the roller</li>
            <li> I do wish there were just a few more rollers, but I was able to make what was available work.  </li>
            <li> A &#x27;ready&#x27; light might be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They pack real real well.</li>
            <li> The clips do not fit the curlers, and fly out of my hair.</li>
            <li> however U get your money worth</li>
            <li> they absorbed.</li>
            <li> The second time I used them I let them warm up for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these rollers by Remington before for many years, &amp; because they were worn, old and beat up</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I find it best to allow the rollers to heat for approximately 5 minutes minimum, despite the manufacturer suggestion of 90 seconds.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it to buy two of these instead of one set of something else).</li>
            <li> It is quite economical</li>
            <li> and I found the curl to be lovely -- soft and natual looking.</li>
            <li> Not the absolute best solution for thick hair, but curls hold for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I was able to use my old clips, since the clips included</li>
            <li> I also own a set and have had them for several years travelling with me to the office, gym and around the world.  </li>
            <li> However, I decided to persevere, and the perseverence was definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I saved the posts from my old set.</li>
            <li> The aggravation with the clips just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I own these and left them at my vacation home.</li>
            <li> If I could redesign the case, I would eliminate the clear top, which cracks eventually (but, for the price, who cares?)</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The fact that the ends stay cool is a plus since they do get quite hot.</li>
            <li> After taking them out(after about 15 minutes) I had nice volume and big curls.....</li>
            <li> I finally decided to buy my own.  </li>
            <li> I see MUCH more rubber/plastic on the ends (like the old ones.)  </li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re cost effective enough that you could purchase two sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I honestly didn&#x27;t think these would be enough to curl all of my hair at once.  </li>
            <li> The first criticism is partially true.</li>
            <li> She borrowed mine several times before I bought her a set of her own.  </li>
            <li> Really need about 4 more if you have much hair.</li>
            <li> The pins popped right off the first time I tried to use them and curlers went flying!</li>
            <li> My old set of these worked perfectly, so I bought a new set of the same exact thing.  </li>
            <li> This product is terrific -easy to use, quick heating and a perfect size for travel - just as effective as any larger, more expensive types.</li>
            <li> I had hot roller for many years, so I decided to purchase new one.</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up relatively quickly and stay warm for a long time.   </li>
            <li> The set is small and compact and heats up quickly, thus is great for both home and travel.  </li>
            <li> I am not that fond of the clips, like many other reviewers, but they are ok for travel.</li>
            <li> others don&#x27;t like other people stated in their reviews but, to be safe, I always make sure that they are pushed all the way into the heating device while heating</li>
            <li> Gets hot quick.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also a super reasonable price!</li>
            <li> It heats up pretty quickly and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Conair Hot Roller Super Clips]].</li>
            <li> it is SUPER hot and it touched my ear and burned it.</li>
            <li> The set heats quickly and rollers are indeed hot.</li>
            <li> but, if you are used to a super hot curler then these may not be for you.</li>
            <li> I wish they were a larger diameter, but they heat very quickly and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I saved the clips from the older rollers that finally fell apart after years of good service.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, the rollers do get hot for making great curls, if you can keep the clips in, and don&#x27;t mind getting a little bit burned in the process.</li>
            <li> Unlike the original curlers (like Clairol&#x27;s from the 70s and 80s), these tend to fall out, even without much hair on them.  </li>
            <li> Price is right...</li>
            <li> What is the point of being the right size if they don not work?  </li>
            <li> I would say the 90 seconds is right about on.  </li>
            <li> However, the price is right and the item arrived before I knew it.  </li>
            <li> There is a nanosecond between &#x27;just right&#x27; and &#x27;melt your hair&#x27;, and no temp control.</li>
            <li> They are just the right number of curlers for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the pins are not sized right for them or something.  </li>
            <li> 4 stars  cause everyone was right</li>
            <li> exactly right so that it stays in.  </li>
            <li> This is just the right size.  </li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> It heats right up in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> So, all in all, the 1 star reviewers were right.</li>
            <li> If I tweak it just right</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t made in the right size to hold the rollers.  </li>
            <li> These are just the right amount and pack well for travelling.</li>
            <li> so it slides right out.  </li>
            <li> The curls came right</li>
            <li> The size was right</li>
            <li> its the one right by the plug connection...threw the box away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric rollers for years and find that five large rollers give me just the right amount of curl and body and lasts all day-- except with these rollers!  </li>
            <li> If it looks just right, spritz it with hairspray, let it set for 5 min, and then run your fingers through your hair/flip your head over/brush it.</li>
            <li> No matter what size the roller, it just slid right out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of curlers ...</li>
            <li> Its great for a traveling set, but for everyday, they are a real PAIN!</li>
            <li> They heat up in 10 minutes, they get warm enough, but not so hot that you can smell your hair cooking.  </li>
            <li> The older set had a velcro holder for the cord to fit into -</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for:  small footprint in my suitcase, gets hot quickly, works great.  </li>
            <li> Conair SPC10X Super Clips, 10 Count]] which hold more securely but have to be careful or they leave crimp marks.</li>
            <li> but, they do warm hot enough for my hair needs</li>
            <li> The rollers do not offer uniform heat, some do not even get hot, only slightly warm.</li>
            <li> But I liked these rollers so much, I actually bought a 2nd set &amp; use these at home over the 5 other sets of rollers I own!!</li>
            <li> On that note, beside the roller being on a little small side it does get the job done, curls up the hair pretty nice just have to let it heat up about 15 minutes NOT in 90 seconds which was directed on the box.overall its a perfect size to pack and go with you to travel with.</li>
            <li> Traveled with it the first time and it heated up fast and curls stayed in for days!!</li>
            <li> found the best results from using these hot rollers were if (similar to other users)</li>
            <li> This is my first time using hot rollers ever!</li>
            <li> I curl my hair more than any other style and love hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> While it may sound bizarre for a person like me to want to use hot rollers in their naturally curly hair, I do have a logical reason.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased two new sets, because I have dropped the others so much that the ends are broke off most of them.  </li>
            <li> They just aren&#x27;t very large.</li>
            <li> The clips for the smaller black curlers work perfectly.</li>
            <li> The curlers get super hot, but not too hot</li>
            <li> The curlers do heat up pretty quickly but they are too hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Got the new ones since I was going to Europe and wanted the dual voltage - that feature worked fine.</li>
            <li> They get hot enough and are in many ways comparable to any full set.  </li>
            <li> There was no mention on the advertisement of the fact that that the power point connection on this item is only suitable for US electrical</li>
            <li> In defense of the rollers, most people apparently didn&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling or for small places.</li>
            <li> It is small compact and great for traveling.</li>
            <li> They work well and give my long hair nice curls at the ends.</li>
            <li> I now use these rollers all the time instead of the original large set because these create a more lovely, lasting curl and they take up less bathroom counter space :)</li>
            <li> I have super straight asian hair, so this product is amazing enough that it&#x27;s able to curl my hair in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> So if you are careful not to let them heat longer than the 90 seconds or 2 minutes at most they are fine.  </li>
            <li> This made the curlers completely unusable, since the large curlers are the ones I would use the most.</li>
            <li> great little roller set for home and travel,doesn&#x27;t take up too much space when packing either.</li>
            <li> took me a little longer because there isn&#x27;t enough but it&#x27;s perfect for travelling.</li>
            <li> * as many other reviewers have pointed out the larger red rollers do not stay and fly off easily.</li>
            <li> but the large ones do not stay!</li>
            <li> If you do NOT have short, coarse, thick hair like I do, then there are many redeeming qualities: cute, compact, fast-heating (and re-heating) rollers - perfect for travel or daily use - doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
            <li> Heats  up quickly and does the job very well.</li>
            <li> The set heats quickly and the rollers really hold the heat.  </li>
            <li> This would be a perfect compact set if only the curlers were not so heavy.</li>
            <li> And the soft storage bag makes it easy pack up and store around the house or in a carry-on bag.    </li>
            <li> Thus, the 3 star review (really more 2.5 for the faulty pins because the set&#x27;s only halfway useful without fully working pins).</li>
            <li> They heat quickly and seem gentle on the hair.  </li>
            <li> I liked them so much I purchased a second set.</li>
            <li> This item is great for travel and has the same heating results as my regular size hot rollers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and doesn&#x27;t get super hot, so I&#x27;m not as worried about heat damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> do heat up quickly, and are fairly reasonable to handle (they aren&#x27;t TOO hot where I felt I might burn my fingers while rolling my hair).</li>
            <li> They fall out of your hair so easily, the pins will not stay in, and one set is not enough for a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.  </li>
            <li> Pros: the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Doubt I will use very much.  </li>
            <li> and it is chin length and very straight.</li>
            <li> I love this little compact rollers, like others I wish it had more large rollers</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to heat and rollers don&#x27;t stay in very easily.  </li>
            <li> They do the job, are super compact, travel well between different regions (110 and 220 volts), and easy to use...</li>
            <li> but if you are used to using hot rollers, you will like this setter very much.</li>
            <li> This went much faster (for me) than using any other kind of hair appliance, and I suppose if you wanted to save time, they&#x27;re cost effective enough that you could purchase two sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new set of hot rollers that wouldn&#x27;t take up too much space and would be easy to pack in a suitcase to take with me.</li>
            <li> The small rollers are great but the clips for the large rollers do not stay in and the roller slides out of my hair in seconds.</li>
            <li> These new ones, the large horseshoe clips don&#x27;t fit the large rollers!</li>
            <li> These little rollers were just what I wanted --- perfect sized for medium to long hair, and the case is all set up for travel.</li>
            <li> This are good little hot rollers for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you need some curl to try these out.&lt;br /&gt;These will definitely give your hair some added volume and the curl stays in place.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy and nice compact portable item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The metal clips work just fine with my fine hair- if they feel too loose, then bend the metal to tighten them.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s why I put more hair in than just 2\\&quot;, which brings me to my other \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; which is that these are referred to as jumbo &amp; super jumbo (or large and super large, don&#x27;t recall right now) but trust me,</li>
            <li> First time user with the rollers</li>
            <li> They would work much better if only they would stay in.  </li>
            <li> They were hot in a matter of minutes and kept my hair curly even in Costa Rica&#x27;s humid weather.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy two sets of these, and I&#x27;m glad I did because I definitely need both of them.  </li>
            <li> I suppose this is something that happens a lot with hot roller sets &amp; needs to be perfected.</li>
            <li> First thing I do, before the model gets into my chair... plug the rollers in.</li>
            <li> HOT*</li>
            <li> but not too hot (which, I have burned my fingers a lot, so</li>
            <li> I was willing to pay the price to get exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> 5 out of 10 rollers didn&#x27;t get hot.   </li>
            <li> so I will need to buy 2 or 3 more sets, but I would only buy more if they are actually jumbo sized as stated.</li>
            <li> Plus they were SO hot against my scalp</li>
            <li> I already have a set of these hot rollers, but after using then while on a business trip, I&#x27;m ordering another set to use at home.  </li>
            <li> I have never used hot curlers before</li>
            <li> I thought the somewhat smaller size of the curlers would give me too \\&quot;cute-</li>
            <li> Most definitely!</li>
            <li> However, I decided to go with a smaller one because I just need some volume on top of my hair.  </li>
            <li> the way when I tried to use them for the first time</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews on Amazon, I decided on these hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t find anything with those exact sizes.  </li>
            <li> It took 30+ minutes for them to be too hot to touch.</li>
            <li> and and it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are three reasons I purchased these hot rollers:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li> Most people will use only one set, so the weight should not be an issue.  </li>
            <li> Most people will use only one set, so the weight should not be an issue.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say enough how much I love these curlers.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t even get hot.  </li>
            <li> the first time, I reviewed them as 5-stars.  </li>
            <li> Also, the top plastic on the second set became brittle and has cracked.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that the first set did that.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t believe how fast they heat up!</li>
            <li> After buying first set, i ran to buy another since my hair is medium length.</li>
            <li> I like this hot roller set</li>
            <li> I needed  larger rollers and more of them.</li>
            <li> I wanted hot curlers that could replace my mother&#x27;s set of hot curlers from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> They get so hot..</li>
            <li> The rollers don&#x27;t get so hot that you can&#x27;t handle them.  </li>
            <li> Your hair slips off, which defeats the purpose of rolling it in the first place.</li>
            <li> Also, the rollers became too hot to touch.</li>
            <li> These issues made rolling my hair a much more time consuming process than necessary.</li>
            <li> I use hot rollers every day .</li>
            <li> For a travel set or for an extension to your bigger set, sure.</li>
            <li> I put one roller in and slip on the loop, put another roller in and the first roller loop pops off.</li>
            <li> I love this set, and recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have the space for a big box of rollers.  </li>
            <li> While first using this product, clips would not hold rollers in place.  </li>
            <li> Rollers also don&#x27;t seem to have enough gripping texture.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who uses hot curlers.</li>
            <li> However the most recent set I purchased about a month ago, the clips won&#x27;t stay in to save my life.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I would change, is to add 2-4 more rollers.</li>
            <li> But I love that this set comes with traditional setting pins, not clips.</li>
            <li> It got hot, my hair curled</li>
            <li> I have bought a similar set 6-7 years ago in Sweden and I have been more that content.</li>
            <li> It is as exellent as my first set exept for one thing.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend these hot rollers.</li>
            <li> the most recent purchase will be my travel set.  </li>
            <li> These are wonderful - since they are package into such a small package.</li>
            <li> So these are my first hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> : The first two posts do not get hot.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> and they get a bit hot in there.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like 5 medium rollers and 5 slightly bigger medium rollers.</li>
            <li> I love these, I&#x27;ve purchased over 20 different hot rollers and these are the best/perfect.</li>
            <li> This went to goodwill the first day I used it.</li>
            <li> old roller kit&#x27;s clips fit these</li>
            <li> Well, I was just touching the outside of the container for the curlers.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife as a stocking stuffer (at her request) to replace the one she&#x27;d pretty well worn out.  </li>
            <li> Bought these for an out-of-state interview and put them to use the first time the morning of said interview.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a hot curlers user, not a hot-iron type person.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Remington!</li>
            <li> I have never used hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I usd to have hot rollers as a kid and missed them</li>
            <li> I went to Italy this summer for a month and knew I needed hot rollers to take with me.</li>
            <li> It only takes a minute or so with the curlers in, to get the look you will love.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have any extra I would order more.</li>
            <li> Once the clips are in though, they work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I bought this set yesterday, and used it for the first time this morning.  </li>
            <li> They are very compact, and will be useful in our motorhome.</li>
            <li> I had the first set for 3-4 years.</li>
            <li> I put the 5 big ones around head on top layer of hair.</li>
            <li> this is my second set in the last 15 years, really hold up well and great for traveling</li>
            <li> They get pretty hot which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, so I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> These rollers get HOT and can burn your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought these curlers years ago at a local mass retailer, and have been in love with them ever since.  </li>
            <li> This was my first foray into hot rollers and not knowing how well they would work for my hair type, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on a set.  </li>
            <li> At some point, I may upgrade now that I know that the concept of hot rollers works with my hair but for now, I find the pros outweigh the cons</li>
            <li> Can totally see hauling these on many trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not count on them being hot in 90 seconds.  </li>
            <li> One thing I do not like is that the rollers are so hot it burns my fingers to use them.  </li>
            <li> Have ended up with them being my go-to hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> I may by the hair clip style &#x27;pins&#x27; to hold them as I have never been able to get the handle of the traditional ones.  </li>
            <li> Disclaimer:  have never tried hot rollers before</li>
            <li> I use all rollers each time and sometimes need several more rollers, thus I take first ones out , reheat (sometimes) and use where needed.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure they were heating up enough for me.  </li>
            <li> Funny what you get used to.  </li>
            <li> You plug them in - - in the morning and in 10 - 15 minutes they are plenty hot.  </li>
            <li> I also love that they heat up in a really short time.  </li>
            <li> but hot rollers are not the way to go...</li>
            <li> okay - the smaller rollers.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly hot within minutes of being plugged in.</li>
            <li> Totally surprised by this product, am glad I picked it up for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Also not as damaging as hot irons</li>
            <li> set comes with those funky wire hot roller pin things to keep them in place.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a traveler and you use hot rollers on your hair, then you won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> They are hot</li>
            <li> Please put more of a grip back on your clips!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the reasonable price objectionable either!</li>
            <li> A couple months ago my 1980-something hot rollers died.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers wanted more rollers, but overall they looked good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> here and showed me her travel hot rollers.</li>
            <li> They heat up so fast!</li>
            <li> I like these brand because they get really hot.</li>
            <li> and i was only able to curl 3/4 of my hair.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the curls only lasted 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These rollers do hot hold well in your hair and it doesn&#x27;t hold the curls well.</li>
            <li> (I removed the clips before I got started, since I wasn&#x27;t sure how hot they&#x27;d get next to the rollers).</li>
            <li> You will have to factor in the time, energy, and expense to buy additional hot roller clips or use that don&#x27;t shoot off the roller 3 seconds after putting them in.</li>
            <li> I love them because they only take 90 seconds to heat up.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve had experience with hot rollers</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d recommend them to everyone looking to purchase some hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product (unless you have super, fine hair that won&#x27;t hold a curl).</li>
            <li> If the roller is hot on your neck, tuck some tissue or TP between the roller and your neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all, just wrapping my hair up in the curlers causes it to start to hurt, just from the weight of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used hot rollers in my life.  </li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;You need to physically wind your hair around these rollers as there aren&#x27;t many teeth or any Velcro to hold your hair to the rollers.</li>
            <li> I may buy a 2nd set, so I have even more to use if my hair gets longer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li> but the sides don&#x27;t get hot) and you just roll your hair, attach the clips to hold it in place and go do something else while</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what I wanted.</li>
            <li> However, I need more rollers and will probably order some larger ones to go with these.</li>
            <li> They get so hot they burn your fingers when rolling your hair and the pins do not stay in.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra money on something better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, perhaps I just don&#x27;t know how to use the gadget correctly, but personally I have a lot better luck with velcro rollers.  </li>
            <li> These rollers were nice and hot within a few minutes and my fingers were kept happily cool by keeping them on the tips of the rollers as I put them in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I had used this roller set a few years ago and loved it.  </li>
            <li> This look is good for everyday.  </li>
            <li> I still love these little convenient sets of rollers - easy to travel with, but will have to look for another one</li>
            <li> My hair is long and very fine.</li>
            <li> But these are quite minor complaints and along with the super compact size and the very affordable price, I am glad to overlook these issues.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just that my hair takes a curl fairly easily or because it&#x27;s not too long, but I only have to leave these in my hair for about 5-10 minutes and my hair will be nicely curled.  </li>
            <li> Even better, the package is SUPER small and LIGHT.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t say in the manual in how much time do they reach the max heat, which for rebel hair like mine is very important info, so i just let them heat up for like 5 min and then unplug one at a time and let them do their job for as long as i have time to let them on, first time in 15 minutes i was a curly queen!</li>
            <li> I can use the 4 big curlers on my under hair and the other 4 smaller ones on the top, let them sit while I do my makeup and hello beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> , I felt it was time for a new set, so I went with my tried and true Remington brand.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and just the right size for travel.</li>
            <li> I have longer hair and a ton of it, so I just used the curlers on the top and used a regular large barrel curler for the rest.  </li>
            <li> Although I do enjoy wearing my hair in its natural state, sometimes I want large &amp;#34;glamorous&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;These really are nice--they heat fast, get evenly hot, don&#x27;t leave a crimp in the hair, don&#x27;t take up a lot of space, and aren&#x27;t a ton of money!</li>
            <li> Extremely compact and effective.</li>
            <li> May work better if you leave them in much longer, but they stay hot only for 15 minutes</li>
            <li> You DO have to let it warm up longer than advertised but other than that they work as promised.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t curl my hair, they got warm but not hot.</li>
            <li> and, when I took them down, I swear my hair looked like I belonged on the Grand Ole&#x27; Opry stage!  </li>
            <li> A few more grips on the roller itself would make a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Not as big as expected but easy to use and super cute</li>
            <li> Like I said, I never had much success with anything else that&#x27;s supposed to curl your hair but, with these, not only are they fast and easy, they curl my hair without an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had good luck with hot rollers in the past</li>
            <li> I left this at my mother&#x27;s house after my last trip so they would never again take up good space in my luggage.  </li>
            <li> My last set were wearing out, so I bought these suckers because they were the best of the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But at least I know it&#x27;s good quality and won&#x27;t damage your hair so much, so it&#x27;s worth a try~</li>
            <li> Would be an excellent product for someone with thin natural hair,</li>
            <li> Only negative part is that rollers connectors are clip type and they have to be inserted into their slots perfectly or they will not make connection to heat --</li>
            <li> NEED TO BUY MORE NOT ENOUGH FOR WHOLE HEAD.</li>
            <li> But most troublesome issue was that they left off the velcro cord storage compartment, which made it much easier to travel with.  </li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist, and I have a large set of hot rollers in the salon that I use all the time.</li>
            <li> , that is so much faster than any other hair curler, but my curls though they look great, they barely hold for one hour</li>
            <li> There are only 10 rollers - good for the compact design, but if you have longer or thicker hair you&#x27;re going to have to roll part of your hair, wait for the rollers to cool, then roll the other part.</li>
            <li> I have the same problems mentioned by many of the one-star reviewers - the clips are too short for the roller, the roller&#x27;s surface can&#x27;t handle my fine hair, etc.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and get more hot than my previous rollers did, which I like.  </li>
            <li> I will still give a good rating just because I knew there was very little of a chance that my hair would hold the curls if any at all.</li>
            <li> The product is fine for average hair, but, as I suspected, they don&#x27;t stay in my fine hair.</li>
            <li> On the positive side,  they heat up well and</li>
            <li> Bought these for a trip based on positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I was content with the product it gets really hot and doesn&#x27;t take much to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> and it heats up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t get this product in England any more, so my wife insists on getting this product sent over from the U.S.A.  because she obviously prefers it to the current ones available in U.K.</li>
            <li> I have not used hot rollers since high school (in the 60&#x27;s!)</li>
            <li> I have a set of flock hot curlers I like very well</li>
            <li> THEY GET HOT FAST...</li>
            <li> I really should have reviewed these when I first bought them in fall of 2012.  </li>
            <li> and they get hot fast.</li>
            <li> The rollers really heat up and are hot to hold.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend this to anybody who need to replace hot roller.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get all the rollers in my long hair so the number of rollers is sufficient.</li>
            <li> They heat fast and get hot.  </li>
            <li> I first thought that I was putting to much hair on each curler.</li>
            <li> They heat up pretty fast, like in 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> I thought this small, compact set would be good for traveling</li>
            <li> I still love the rollers, they heat up great, and are the perfect size, it just that this time the little plastic finishing tips on the end of the pins have pretty much all fallen off already in the short time that I have had these:-( It is frustrating as this had happened to my original set, it just took a longer time for that to happen, and when you try to use them now, the pins pull your hair and scrape your scalp, so I ended up having to use my butterfly clamp clips instead which work because it&#x27;s fine for at home, but when you travel would not be convenient, because you don&#x27;t want to travel with too much bulk, so I&#x27;ll have to buy some more pins now.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly, has 2 sizes of rollers, 5 each, the rollers are smooth for less tangling, and the unit never has to leave the pouch.</li>
            <li> The curlers are great but the clips are difficult to use on clean hair.</li>
            <li> Luckily the heat sets the curl quick and my frustration is short lived.</li>
            <li> I can set my hair perfect and tight in the roller, but as soon as I put the clip in, they slouch down an inch, and my ends fall out.</li>
            <li> Great price, light weight, easy to work with (even with my long, thick hair), quick dry</li>
            <li> I have a car-inverter for my laptop and figured I could get a nice, little set of hot rollers I could plug in once in a while and make myself look a little bit more presentable!  </li>
            <li> My only thing is is that the pins that hold the rollers in your hair are easy to lose.</li>
            <li> I was less than thrilled with these rollers.</li>
            <li> The results were not much different than my curling iron and not as easy to use.</li>
            <li> and I love it so much that I&#x27;m using it regularly on my long, below-the-shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I never got any to stay in long enough to know if they give a good curl.</li>
            <li> I had been using a similar one for several years and liked in very much.</li>
            <li> However noted; all of the rollers need to be large.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve preferred just large curlers</li>
            <li> I should have realized large was not jumbo.</li>
            <li> I prefer the metal u shaped clips but the large ones don&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> I started with the large curlers, rolled one in, and used the clip.</li>
            <li> I like the large rollers and my daughter</li>
            <li> I also purchased two of these so that I could put the large rollers all in one.  </li>
            <li> The product description says 5 large and 5 X large rollers.</li>
            <li> The medium rollers should be replaced by large rollers.</li>
            <li> This product was advertized as having 5 large and 5 x large rollers.  </li>
            <li> I just wish that you could have either all large size or all medium size.  </li>
            <li> My three stars are based largely on the price of these curlers and their convenience for travel.</li>
            <li> The large rollers don&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> I just wish the large rollers would stay in so they could curl my hair nicer.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 sets so that I could get all large and combined them with one set of all large.  </li>
            <li> so I could have all large rollers.</li>
            <li> , the rod holder pics do NOT stay on the large rollers.</li>
            <li> BUT -- I purchased two sets and moved all the large rollers to one travel pack for my &#x27;travel&#x27; suitcase   </li>
            <li> 10 large rollers and this would have been a 5 star for me.</li>
            <li> it says large and medium in product description...</li>
            <li> so I bought large jaw clips to hold them in place.  </li>
            <li> Product was described as 5 large &amp; 5 medium rollers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these if you are looking for a large roller.</li>
            <li> but I gave it three stars because the large curlers do not stay in your hair.</li>
            <li> , they say large rollers</li>
            <li> but they are not that large at all.</li>
            <li> I  can&#x27;t be certain of that</li>
            <li> The brand name of the clips is Sta-Rite and a size large</li>
            <li> is what is needed to keep the large rollers in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heat up fast and are not damaging to hair if you don&#x27;t let them heat for too long, which has a small learning curve to perfect for your particular hair.</li>
            <li> so I use 2 picks (some left overs from my old hot roller set) per roller to hold them on top of my head.</li>
            <li> Curlers get nice and hot, however I cannot get the clips to stay on, especially the larger rollers!</li>
            <li> it heats up very fast, it takes a little practice to use the U shape pins but it gets very easy after a couple of times.</li>
            <li> I might have to see if I can find a jumbo size now for more of a loose wave.</li>
            <li> I had one set that broke in less than a year, then because I liked the product so much</li>
            <li> These curlers heat up very quickly and can get quite hot, depending on how long they&#x27;re plugged in.  </li>
            <li> I always get two because I need the large rollers, so I take the large ones from one set to make a whole set of large ones.  </li>
            <li> I am going back to my Conair traveling set (12 rollers including 8 large) which works fine.</li>
            <li> I discovered that the large clips work fine for the smaller medium rollers and don&#x27;t go flying.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;ve ever used in many other sets of hot rollers....</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fairly fine hair, was concerned that 8 rollers would not be enough.</li>
            <li> I traveled with them recently to the UK and they worked fine with the adapter.</li>
            <li> so i have never tried other products to  compare this with.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that: I LOVE my hot rollers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t heat quickly, and when they get hot enough to start using, they are too hot to handle.</li>
            <li> Also, these rollers didn&#x27;t all heat up...only some...and they never got as hot as the older set I have.</li>
            <li> I have an older model of these Hot Rollers and</li>
            <li> Wonderful hair rollers for loose, bouncy curls on medium length thick hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the advice of a friend, I scrounged around and found a bunch of &amp;#34;butterfly clips&amp;#34; (large) to hold them into my hair.  </li>
            <li> but really does not curl my hair like my large one does</li>
            <li> I like the tidy little case it comes in.</li>
            <li> I have medium-length fine straight hair: I need only hair body and some curl and sheen to my hair (I cannot use hairspray).</li>
            <li> If you have very thick hair, they work great</li>
            <li> I wonder if they make a flat iron that is as easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is probably not going to be a good product for hard to curl hair.</li>
            <li> My son loves his Tommy Hawk Wastlands game - Thanks, always reliable and great products to choose from.</li>
            <li> These hit up really fast and travel well for business trips without taking too much space.</li>
            <li> Or use both sets together and roll my whole head -</li>
            <li> The Ionic ceramic really works.</li>
            <li> But I was really looking for Jumbo.  </li>
            <li> My 2 daughters want their straight hair curly - fast.</li>
            <li> I was looking into buying the Conair travel set and really wanted to buy it</li>
            <li> They really solved a problem that I had had with needing to set my hair while traveling.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very inexpensive but still. .</li>
            <li> This makes it very convenient for travel as it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in your luggage.</li>
            <li> Really works well.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these.</li>
            <li> They heat up relatively fast also.</li>
            <li> The set is very portable and contains five \\&quot;extra-large\\&quot; and five \\&quot;large\\&quot; rollers.  </li>
            <li> I really like the clips that came with them too.  </li>
            <li> The hype is for real.</li>
            <li> Very luke-warm.    </li>
            <li> They do it and very well.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the clips don&#x27;t fit the rollers all that well.</li>
            <li> They heat up fast.</li>
            <li> They heat up fast, and curl my hair fast too.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space in my bathroom or suitcase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact</li>
            <li> Had borrowed them from a friend and really lied them.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you want to do waves, add volume, or curl straight ends</li>
            <li> These curlers heat up so fast</li>
            <li> But, they work very well on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately my hair needs only a couple minutes to achieve the look I want, so I could just stand there and wait, without moving.</li>
            <li> is my challenge to whomever in Remingtion aisre now responsible for these...</li>
            <li> They curl really well, really</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> If Remington really stood for service and had any character they would have NEVER produced these curlers.</li>
            <li> Takes  alittle getting used to, but they heat up fast and are gentle on  my hair.</li>
            <li> The material the rollers are coated with cause hair to slip so much as you try to pin that I gave up after a couple uses - they now sit abandoned.  </li>
            <li> It would be a feat to curl my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The curlers heat up fast.</li>
            <li> It is very compact and lightweight.</li>
            <li> The kit is very portable.  </li>
            <li> This set is very convenient, not too bulky.</li>
            <li> These curlers really do the job and don&#x27;t take up a lot of space.  </li>
            <li> So in summary if you had straight hair I would think these curlers would not stay in your hair very well</li>
            <li> I really like this hairsetter.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair</li>
            <li> Rollers heat up &amp; are ready to use in about 2-3 minutes like the product claims.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth noting that the instructions outline the warm-up time as 90 seconds for a soft curl and longer for a stronger hold.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I heated them longer than I could get more definite curls, but the messy curls was what I wanted. )</li>
            <li> I was really hoping these would be an asset &amp; give me the bounce &amp; body I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The set is compact and doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the vanity or in my luggage.  </li>
            <li> curls look very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wear my hair shoulder-length instead of the very &amp;#34;old</li>
            <li> will be ready when you are.</li>
            <li> They do heat up fast.  </li>
            <li> I figured even if I didn&#x27;t like them much, they could still do for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I bought these because I see the amazing curl hot rollers can give, and how long that curl can last.</li>
            <li> My husband watched me try to get ready and couldn&#x27;t believe it as the pins LITERALLY flew out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the curlers for my sister, who didn&#x27;t have nearly as much luck.</li>
            <li> It heats up in a minute and the rubberized rollers stay in my hair very well.  </li>
            <li> Heat fast.</li>
            <li> Would not reccomend for someone who wants to use often.</li>
            <li> Very compact</li>
            <li> Very compact</li>
            <li> The heat up fast, travel well and the stay put.</li>
            <li> THEY DO HEAT UP FAST...</li>
            <li> Sometimes the pins slip out if you have too much hair on the roller.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Very unusable rollers pin.</li>
            <li> The rollers do work well and are reasonably priced</li>
            <li> The pins hold the hair in place very well.</li>
            <li> No matter how much hair I put in roller.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  - very compact size&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m at home or getting ready for a non-work occasion, I&#x27;ll often leave in a bit longer to get tighter curls.    </li>
            <li> it is ready whenever I am.  </li>
            <li> Returning would cost about as much as cost of rollers.</li>
            <li> aren&#x27;t very effect at securing rollers-</li>
            <li> It is very compact and light-weight.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The heat fast and curl my hair.</li>
            <li> they heat up fast and work well.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and compact.</li>
            <li> Did not curl my hair very well at all.</li>
            <li> WORKS VERY</li>
            <li> YOU WOULD HAVE TO SET HAIR AGAIN TO GET WHOLE HEAD DONE.</li>
            <li> And the rollers heat up well and fast.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I recommend it Highly!</li>
            <li> Heat fast and thoroughly every time.  </li>
            <li> I almost always use a curling iron on my hair-it&#x27;s easier and much faster for what I do.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a travel set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clips do not work very well.  </li>
            <li> They will work much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - it isn&#x27;t bent in as much.)  </li>
            <li> There is really nothing on the curler to grip</li>
            <li> I use these while getting ready for work and now have  a prettier pony tail at the hospital.  </li>
            <li> really like the design of this set of curlers.  </li>
            <li> I would really like them to make a set like this using jumbo size rollers.....</li>
            <li> and they hold very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, my hair is much longer now</li>
            <li> they do heat up fast and the meatal tabs are hardcore.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these.</li>
            <li> biggest problem I had was that 3 of the prongs just don&#x27;t heat at all, so the product was straight up defective.</li>
            <li> i could roll my whole head in 4 minutes</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought them for a trip and they packed real well.  </li>
            <li> And so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> They stay in very well.</li>
            <li> None of the clips for the larger size rollers would actually fit on the rollers, let alone keep them in my hair.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t stay in my hair using the provided metal clips.</li>
            <li> heats up fast and very compact</li>
            <li> I took the clips from the 1960s set to see if the longer clips would help, and they worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I really like the convenience of the rollers and the way my hair looks after use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that they are very portable though.</li>
            <li> I should say,that does not heat up much..</li>
            <li> Althought these were very inexpensive, do not purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep &#x27;em around for emergency back-up, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use them much if ever.</li>
            <li> After seeing so many people recommend hot rollers especially for hair that&#x27;s like mine, I decided to take a chance with hot rollers and decided to try this set since it&#x27;s smaller and not as pricey as others on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think that if you&#x27;re having this issue, you might be putting too much hair around one roller.  </li>
            <li> The rollers set is nice and small for packing, but the clips won&#x27;t hold very well and the velcro closer tore the first time I opened it.  </li>
            <li> Heat up fast.</li>
            <li> so I was not expecting much.</li>
            <li> They heat up fast.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s very practical because after you put it on your hair you can apply makeup, get dresses etc</li>
            <li> but you are going to really have to cram a lot of hair on to each roller.</li>
            <li> They heat up fast.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how it works on straight hair.</li>
            <li> I had to return them as I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten much use out of them.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t get rid of this appliance on the first use was because I had full clips from another roller set that I could use in a pinch.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase and may consider buying a second set for when I use these at home.  </li>
            <li> This is the second same unit I own.  </li>
            <li> They claim to be &amp;#34;instant heat&amp;#34; and the instruction booklet says they&#x27;re hot enough to create a wavy effect within 90 seconds, although you can allow them to heat to the full temperature for tighter curls.</li>
            <li> The wife likes them, said they are kind of heavy, but will do.</li>
            <li> If you you have sent hair one set might be enough however if you even remotely have medium thickness of hair you will need to sets in order to get a good curl.</li>
            <li> I would really have loved to have a set with rollers at least twice the size.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and is hot enough to curl even straight hair.</li>
            <li> On the contrary, these were very easy to handle, and they produced soft, loose curls, which was the look I wanted.  </li>
            <li> The Remington rollers are light, the package is small and the curlers do heat very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I used the black ones first and did the sides of my face and the top layers of my hair.</li>
            <li> They heat fast and create long lasting curls, so you can&#x27;t ask for much more than that!</li>
            <li> The new ones that I purchased on Amazon work just as well as the first set I had.  </li>
            <li> My first set lasted over 20 years, decided it was time for a new set.</li>
            <li> I am a thrifty shopper, and this item was marked just right for me to buy.  </li>
            <li> I think it has to do with the fact that the curlers themselves are very short (probably to make them travel friendly); and the fact that the surface just wasn&#x27;t very grippy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the old fashioned metal clips; I instead use the claw-like plastic squeeze clips that came with an older hairsetter I have.     </li>
            <li> I have thick, shoulder-length, naturally curly hair (type 3a) but find I often need a more tame/professional look at work, and these do the trick (and also require MUCH less product to keep my hair looking nice, which is a huge benefit when traveling).  </li>
            <li> You have to get use to using the clamps but other than that I love them.  </li>
            <li> SEEMS TO CURL MUCH BETTER THAN ANY OTHER I&#x27;VE TRIED...</li>
            <li> They are excellent rollers, this is my third set but prior sets had 4 small rollers, which I must have.  </li>
            <li> I would like them to be more hot, I have lo turmed on like hours before I wear them to get just a little curl in my hair.</li>
            <li> The pins on this &amp;#34;latest&amp;#34; set are different from those on my original purchase-  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I love this thing</li>
            <li> My hair holds the curl better with these rollers than any other product I have used before.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and they get hot enough to make a decent surl</li>
            <li> They are great for traveling, very compact and there is no hard plastic cover to get broken in your bag.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with these, and the compact size should be very easy to travel with; at around 6&amp;#34; long, this case will probably take up less space in my suitcase than a single shoe.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with these, and the compact size should be very easy to travel with; at around 6&amp;#34; long, this case will probably take up less space in my suitcase than a single shoe.</li>
            <li> The only hot rollers that I have had success with were steam rollers (Caruso)....</li>
            <li> I have long, stick-straight, fine</li>
            <li> My hair is long and fine, never holds a curl even with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> But not for those of us that have thick straight and very healthy</li>
            <li> Through the years these have been great for shoulder length and even now when my hair is almost to the small of my back</li>
            <li> I like the small compact soft case, which is good for travel.  </li>
            <li> Fast forward to now, I order this one, which is the same roller set I used before, except the large clips that go with the red rollers DON&#x27;T FIT!  </li>
            <li> I tried using more curlers with less hair and the large rollers still fell out.  </li>
            <li> They heat up really fast, really high quality construction.  </li>
            <li> Further, you have to catch them at just the right moment when they are \\&quot;hot enough,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am on a limited amount of time when using these at the gym before work and spend too much time trying to secure them.  </li>
            <li> The first couple of times I plugged them in only one side heated up; since then it has been working OK (but not as fast warming up as claimed) and I am always worried they are going to fail at any time because of my original experiences - I have a much older set of these rollers (same manufacturer) and they were/are far superior to these new ones.  </li>
            <li> They are the size of all hot curlers from the early 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Also, there is definitely not enough of them either for a full head of hair</li>
            <li> The only real complaints I have is that the clips are short so if, like me, you like to put more than the recommended amount (2\\&quot;) of your hair in each roller</li>
            <li> The small roller&#x27;s clips stay in place nicely.</li>
            <li> Using hot rollers changes my curl pattern from a long spiral-type curl to more of a big, bouncy and looser curl.  </li>
            <li> I travel frequently and have tried taking hot rollers and/or curling iron.</li>
            <li> So, small, efficient, effective.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the oversized metal clips, remembering them from years ago and an old Clairol hot roller set I used until it died</li>
            <li> This is a nice small kit that works for my needs.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Soft and Style Hot Roller Clamps and use them instead - no marks on my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a second set to leave in my suitcase full time.</li>
            <li> The size is very small and compact so that&#x27;s nice and the rollers get hot...</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but I was looking for bigger rollers.</li>
            <li> Since it was humid and my hair is very fine and straight, the curl did not last long, but it did add body.  </li>
            <li> So really, other than the fact that I would like the set to be twice as large, I love them and give them a near two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I make sure I push the curlers down to connect at the bottom when I put them away.  </li>
            <li> Make sure before you plug them in, that you push all of the rollers down</li>
            <li> Make sure you push them all down into the connection or you might have a curler or two that doesn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li> Gets hot in a hurry (and I do mean HOT) and couldn&#x27;t be more compact for traveling or storing in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> For everyday use, I use the Remington Pearl heated clip curlers, which I love, but the unit is really large.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be good for a little extra body when I needed it.  </li>
            <li> My other one has a great Velcro fastener on the outside back.  </li>
            <li> These hot rollers made a tight curl in my hair in just 20 minutes from start to finish (when they cooled and I removed them), which was easy for me to finger comb and rearrange into the looser look that I wanted.</li>
            <li> Once my hair is completely dry, I apply a heat-protectant spray, brush through, then a light coating of an anti-humidity hairspray.  </li>
            <li> Once my hair is completely dry, I apply a heat-protectant spray, brush through, then a light coating of an anti-humidity hairspray.  </li>
            <li> The clips that come with the kit do not work, as they pop off easily, and heating them took a lot longer than expected.</li>
            <li> The resultant curls are lumpy and unflattering compared to the previous flocked Remington curlers which I had enjoyed for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the smaller sized rollers (black) stayed in perfectly, but no matter what I did, the larger ones (red) fell out.  </li>
            <li> I quickly searched on Amazon for the reviews and all the recent reviews were complaining about the clips not staying on the rollers.</li>
            <li> but my hair and rollers kept falling out particularly when doing sides of head.</li>
            <li> I plan on going directly to Remington to see if they can replace them with clips that fit the rollers properly.</li>
            <li> They produce a much more bouncier and longer lasting curl than a regular curling iron.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with my older sets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several sets of these rollers over the years and they work well and heat quickly.  </li>
            <li> I do have some clamps that I use to keep my hair back, and that helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li> Therefore I recently  purchased a SECOND set in order to have more curlers.  </li>
            <li> By the time I use the first 10 rollers, the others are almost hot enough.  </li>
            <li> I had a similar set for many years, but the rollers appeared not to heat up as well over the last year.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky if they last an hr.</li>
            <li> I purchased an earlier version of this product in 2001 and was quite pleased with it, particularly the feature enabling international travel.  </li>
            <li> and the heat is decent.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, there are women out there with different hair than mine that love these</li>
            <li> Now I roller for the part in front of your ear on each side (you&#x27;ve used 5 rollers) and you have 2 for the top of the back, two for the bottom of the back.</li>
            <li> I am going to look for the clips from my old sets and see if the smaller ones will fit this set.  </li>
            <li> I have accidentally left it plugged in for 8 hours &amp; was sure I was doomed &amp; it would not work again properly</li>
            <li> The older version heat up hotter .</li>
            <li> I replaced the clips with others from an older set I had.</li>
            <li> : They heat up at a decent rate.  </li>
            <li> These get plenty hot enough to curl my hair without being so hot</li>
            <li> They do heat up quickly, but are constantly falling out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I switched the red pin with the other longer pin (over 1/2 inch more), the roller is held right at the desire location on my hair.    </li>
            <li> I love these rollers they are vey practical, heat up fast and very convenient to travel with I use the at home too since they take up very little counter space</li>
            <li> As I said, I have FINE hair and 10 rollers is still not quite enough for my whole head, a dozen at least would have been much better.    </li>
            <li> Everything about the new ones is fine except the metal roller holders are shaped differently from the old ones.</li>
            <li> They come in a small and compact case and heat up quickly and are very very hot!</li>
            <li> and I only use the large rollers, but even then, it created really pronounced curls (which I don&#x27;t really like too much).</li>
            <li> but all in all it does get very hot (not enough to burn you, unless you touch the metal parts).</li>
            <li> Portable, heats quickly, ordered more large size rollers for my hairstyle, works great except pins are slightly small with thick hair...and larger pins are are too big for the rollers I have.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and really hold the heat a long time.</li>
            <li> I have super straight, long hair</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> and they came highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These rollers are compact yet high heat.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!if you wanted to save time</li>
            <li> I have some larger clips from a different set, and they seem to hold the curlers better, but I will probably still get some jaw clips to hold them more firmly in place.  </li>
            <li> , I figure it&#x27;s not hot enough... or need some kind of hair spray...</li>
            <li> I end up with large wavy frizz-free curls that are manageable, soft, and hold all day.  </li>
            <li> The cover is compact and very easy to travel with and stuff in that small space in the drawer.</li>
            <li> It is small and very easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried out the rollers yet as I live in the UK and will need to change the plug, but if they&#x27;re anything like the previous (black)set of Remington rollers that I&#x27;ve been using for years, they will be fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not being able to buy these in the UK at all (despite them being dual voltage)</li>
            <li> but there are not enough rollers to do my whole head at once!!  </li>
            <li> I was actually surprised that these worked so well!!  </li>
            <li> This cute little item is a livesaver for traveling.  </li>
            <li> These are just like the last Remington hot roller curlers I had!</li>
            <li> I love these little travel rollers.</li>
            <li> The pin-style clips might be a little fiddly for some (not my favorite)</li>
            <li> I love the little pockets on the inside of the case for the clips</li>
            <li> I thought from the pic that five of the rollers were large, but they&#x27;re more like medium and small.  </li>
            <li> I use hot curlers to tame my naturally curly hair and need extra large for the top layer of hair and large for the bottom.</li>
            <li> I will use my older version and donate the new ones.</li>
            <li> Even though curls were very defined when I took rollers out, they relaxed after an hour into just soft waves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s colorful and you&#x27;re not likely to leave it behind in a hotel room,  bright as it is.  </li>
            <li> old clips have about 1&amp;#34; of rubber/plastic on the straight end and about 3/4&amp;#34; on the bent end.  </li>
            <li> This is the reason I gave it two stars &amp; not one, when I talked to a representative in the product complaint department, he told me that they are aware of the issue and have started to make better clips.</li>
            <li> This Remington ceramic set got so hot that I could barely stand to touch them to wind up my hair.  </li>
            <li> Too hot to use with bare</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used curlers with clips before, but I feel like for my hair (since it&#x27;s so heavy) it would hold better.</li>
            <li> Although I really like the compactness of these hot rollers, I thought I would have to send them back because there was no way they would stay in my hair.  </li>
            <li> A useful travel size for emergency use only.</li>
            <li> These are ok, I had a lot of trouble with the medium rollers.</li>
            <li> They got hot surprisingly fast and the compact size of the unit fits into a suitcase as well as the last corner not in use on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> and they were so hot I could barely stand to roll my hair.  </li>
            <li> YES they will curl your hair, (though I am sure there are a few exceptions).</li>
            <li> Perfect for my hair, African American female with past shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy (not in a good way) hair cut in a modern Sassoon bob, longer on the sides &amp; shorter in the back.</li>
            <li> Before using the rollers, I wash my hair and allow it to dry naturally, while occasionally brushing it to discourage my own natural curls from forming.  </li>
            <li> The edges on the top and bottom don&#x27;t get hot, so you&#x27;re less likely so singe</li>
            <li> I really wish they would go back to the old design of the old clips as these clips do not hold like the old design of the original clips.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other fine hair people...</li>
            <li> Small enough to fit easily into suitcase.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not hard to curl and these just do not do it for me.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for large rollers to smooth out my hair, instead they make tight curls.</li>
            <li> They are defective, so it is highly recommended that you buy other clips to secure these to your head - you should not have to do this, but I recommend you do.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased a different set at a local store, but amazon reviews prompted me to set those aside and order these instead because they heat very quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought super clips from amazon which work very well to prevent slipping.</li>
            <li> Since the rollers do not have any teeth they just slip right out of your hair before you can put the next one in.  </li>
            <li> This baffles me; the large rollers are not that large, actually they are medium.</li>
            <li> The rollers are just the right size and there are just enough!  </li>
            <li> Either I&#x27;m not using the right spray/gel product or the disulfide bonds in my curls just gave up against the fight against asian hair.</li>
            <li> just the right amount of curlers for  me and not too big to pack for a trip...</li>
            <li> Everything that you need is right inside the case so there&#x27;s no big chance of you losing the pins.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little heavy, so if you have thick hair,  secure the curlers the best you can do avoid them from falling out.</li>
            <li> They really heat up quickly and are ready to go in less than a minute.  </li>
            <li> day!&lt;br /&gt;It is super easy to use, it takes no time to heat and a few minutes to roll and 10 mins later Violla!!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair &amp; even with putting my usual styling products in before using these hot rollers</li>
            <li> issue i have is that the large pin holder could be better fitted for thick hair.</li>
            <li> post.&lt;br /&gt;These are suitable to use in Europe as they are dual voltage , it states that on the box.&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be some confusion with some reviews saying they are not suitable for use in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> I am an older woman with fine, thin hair - these have been a true lifesaver - easy to use - clipped carefully in place (which you would do with ANY hot roller product IF you have thin, fine hair like mine!)  </li>
            <li> The little case is not as nice as the one for my last set</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously had a set of 5 travel rollers (rollers were the same size as the large rollers here) that took up more space in my suitcase than this.</li>
            <li> But, they seemed an option: a head full of longer loose curls.</li>
            <li> so I had to get new ones.  </li>
            <li> They can still be used, but I wanted to get new ones.  </li>
            <li> They promised to send new clips, and told me it would take 7-10 days to get them.  </li>
            <li> I replaced them with some new ones from a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new set for a vacation home and can&#x27;t keep any of the rollers in my hair.  </li>
            <li> the new one does not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on the hunt for a new set.</li>
            <li> so now will either try a new brand or looking for rollers with clamps</li>
            <li> have had these for about three years and they are still like new...</li>
            <li> She looked on Amazon and found a new one.</li>
            <li> That the reason why I bought two new sets from you.</li>
            <li> CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THESE&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I like the new styling options they give me.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new set.  </li>
            <li> The new clips have just a dot of rubber/plastic on the ends.  </li>
            <li> The new version continually fall out of my hair</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a picture of the old clips (that work) and the new clips (that don&#x27;t!)</li>
            <li> My old clips from an older Remington set do work on these new curlers.</li>
            <li> But won&#x27;t buy a second set if  Remington does not send me a new set of clips that fit the red rollers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too bad because the size would make them ideal for travel.</li>
            <li> Also, the red clips that go with the larger curlers don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> I have a few old clips thst work; and once I get some more, I&#x27;ll be happier with this set.</li>
            <li> I threw them out rather than carry them all the way back home and try to find clips to fit (which actually defeats the purpose of the travel ease</li>
            <li> I wish the rollers were a little larger in size - the large and medium size described seem more like small-medium and medium, but they get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I put my new rollers in, put the new clips in and by the time I&#x27;d put the 3rd roller in, the first roller fell out.  </li>
            <li> It heats down quickly which my curling iron dose NOT!</li>
            <li> I have a very old Remington set that works well.</li>
            <li> It not only is small enough to fit into your suitcase but the heat emitted from the unit provides a quality \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; to hair and also more body (believe it or not).</li>
            <li> Heats very fast, and it is simple to use.</li>
            <li> My hair was fried while dyeing it, and these curlers make my hair feel very soft.  </li>
            <li> However it was just that my (very old) curlers were so well used they were burning my fingers my head and my hair.</li>
            <li> to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder-length, very straight, fine, and color-treated (lightened) hair, which is hard to curl.</li>
            <li> These were easy enough to put in but they didn&#x27;t hold curls for long at all.</li>
            <li> I received it for Christmas and quickly discovered that the negative reviews were all true.  </li>
            <li> I have an older similar set by Remington with large plastic butterfly type clips that went in another separate holder.  </li>
            <li> Had my first one 2 years just got the 2nd one to make rolling my hair up for a stage production quicker.</li>
            <li> They are more like medium and small.</li>
            <li> The clips arrived yesterday, and they are exactly the same as the defective too-small clips that came with the product!  </li>
            <li> If these rolls were slightly bigger and all one size, it would have given it a higher rating.</li>
            <li> As I started the second curler, the first on fell out.</li>
            <li> Completely unusable!</li>
            <li> They are so small and compact that you will love the amount of space it saves.</li>
            <li> I used hot rollers every day for years but stopped when I cut my hair short.  </li>
            <li> but it is a complete pain to use - buy something else!</li>
            <li> all the same size..that get hot..but not THAT hot.....</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wanting it solely for travel, then this might (reiterate, might) be something to consider, but if you&#x27;re wanting something to actually curl your hair, spend another $15 and get a larger set (more rollers) and one that has actual clips to hold the rollers in place rather than pieces of wire.</li>
            <li> Then I touched a different roller and it was hot.  </li>
            <li> This product seemed to work okay at first but the pins for the red rollers are too small.  </li>
            <li> I know the metal wire is not terribly expensive to make these pins and am mystified why Remington does not return to a longer pin so they will actually stay in the hair.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected...keep it simple....</li>
            <li> I have used different hot rollers for 40 years, but like this</li>
            <li> so when I put in one roller &amp; reach for a second one the first one falls out.</li>
            <li> This is the second set purchased as the first set worked so well</li>
            <li> The rollers that DO heat up are hot enough to curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Going back to my hot comb.</li>
            <li> By the time you are rolling the third one, the first one is popping out.</li>
            <li> I have tried several times and tried putting product in my hair first.</li>
            <li> I left the curlers in my hair for about 10 minutes and my hair was very curly!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this two stars is because the rollers do get hot and will create curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Short and crisp (used 15 days)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Medium size rollers take a little more time to heat up, but not any major issue.</li>
            <li> to get hot enough to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> they actually worked and in a very short amount of time, and even though it was my first time using hot rollers</li>
            <li> The only thing I can think of against these hot rollers is that the pics tend to fall out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say more like small and medium.</li>
            <li> They did get hot enough just don&#x27;t stay in.</li>
            <li> I have purchased numerous hot roller sets of all types for years.  </li>
            <li> In my experience the flocked rollers, which are the type customarily sold now, do not get hot enough.  </li>
            <li> The curlers in this product are better described as medium and small, so they are a challenge for longer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not scorching on the fingers to handle but hot enough to get hair to the curliness that is wanted.</li>
            <li> so maybe other ethnicity-types will have different (i.e., better) results from using these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Exactly the same until you get to the bent end</li>
            <li> clips to secure are small to handle and made of metal, so they can get warm to the touch if left in hair due to heat of curler.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li> In fact, the first try, I left them in about 20 minutes while I applied my makeup</li>
            <li> These rollers do not get hot enough to use.  </li>
            <li> So I did the underneath portions of my hair first, left the rollers in for about 40 minutes, and then repeated with the crown sections of my hair.</li>
            <li> These do not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these hot rollers several times.</li>
            <li> I have the exact same ones from the 90s</li>
            <li> My last Remington rollers I bought over a decade ago and still use them just purchased this one to travel with and excited for my next trip</li>
            <li> I use the smaller rollers for the top of my hair and the larger for big curls in the under layers.  </li>
            <li> They look good but just too small for my long hair!!</li>
            <li> They are so compact, they are easy to take along and at home take little space.  </li>
            <li> The main difference between the two is that this one (Remington) has made room for both sizes to heat up together whereas the one I owned before was only capable of heating up five curlers at a time</li>
            <li> Seriously not 5 seconds later the clips would shoot straight off the roller like a rocket.</li>
            <li> Every day that I use it, I have one lock of hair that is nearly straight because that particular roller didn&#x27;t heat up properly.</li>
            <li> I like these curlers, but you have to use them with curler clips (the grey, claw-like ones), or else your hair is likely to get fuzzy if it is fine.</li>
            <li> The plusses are:  takes up very little room on bathroom countertop, gets hot fast, (be careful with your pinkies), holds hair in curler well, and so more hair can be placed in each curler.</li>
            <li> These small clips fit inside the case with rollers and my opinion &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; better than the butterfly clips - also takes less packing</li>
            <li> You can put them on the roller while in your hair and actually watch them slowly move off the roller until they are far enough off to fly to the floor.  </li>
            <li> When I purchased the second set, I placed all the large rollers in new case.  </li>
            <li> I have Asian straight but not thick hair and was going to like these rolls but ...</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit well no matter how small the amount of hair wrapped around the curlers and pop off if you so much as breath.</li>
            <li> so now I have to use the clips from my previous set which do fit.  </li>
            <li> They work, but it&#x27;s probably not a good idea to get heated rollers if you don&#x27;t really know how to use them :).</li>
            <li> these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, just plug in, in a few moments</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up quickly and are hot enough, not like some roller sets that never heat up enough to give lasting curls.</li>
            <li> This little set works just fine.    </li>
            <li> it takes up little space, its quick heating (but not too hot to touch) &amp; efficient...&amp; it gives my long thin blonde hair a beautiful curl...</li>
            <li> It will usually not hold a curl unless heat is near scorching.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these curlers would get hot enough to have an effect on an asian women&#x27;s naturally straight hair.     </li>
            <li> The first time I used them, I just put them back in enough that they were &amp;#34;in.&amp;#34; The next time I used the rollers they would not get hot!  </li>
            <li> All in all I highly recommend these, they travel really really well, super compact, take very little room.</li>
            <li> I bought a new set recently and really don&#x27;t like the clips that came with the rollers.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair and then use these to add a fantastic curl prior to going out.  </li>
            <li> You will be able to use half of the rollers, as the clips for the larger rollers don&#x27;t hold them in place.  </li>
            <li> but there are just as many of the smaller, black rollers...leaving you with the need to roll,</li>
            <li> Make sure that the curlers are completely pressed down into their individual heating socket.  </li>
            <li> Or if you are lucky enough to get 4 of them in, suddenly they all pop out.</li>
            <li> However, you do have to roll them tightly and secure the pins, which are color-coded to the color of the roller.</li>
            <li> From a very old and long gone set of hot rollers from about 1980, I have TWO metal pins.  </li>
            <li> I give this set 4 stars, because I expected large rollers to be really large, but they are not.</li>
            <li> Middle of rollers are very hot and can burn if rollers are heated for longer than ten minutes.  </li>
            <li> But the description says 5 large/ 5 extra large.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;super\\&quot; are just regular large curlers...same size as every \\&quot;large\\</li>
            <li> the large clips don&#x27;t hold the larger roller in your hair ..</li>
            <li> I emailed the company and received an email back telling me to return them to a certain address, from Brian.  </li>
            <li> I want all large curls or all smaller curls.</li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers to use while on vacation because my &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; set is too large and fragile to travel.</li>
            <li> I only use the large ones.</li>
            <li> The large n medium rollers are not as big as I thought.</li>
            <li> I saved the large rollers from my fist set for use with my second set.  </li>
            <li> The large pins do not hold the larger rollers in place.</li>
            <li> The rollers are smaller than one would think for large rollers but from reading reviews</li>
            <li> The clips that hold the large curlers in place pop off constantly.</li>
            <li> can I get the extra large / jumbo size.</li>
            <li> so I would have enough large rollers to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I might need the second set for more tight curls.  </li>
            <li> I incorporated all the large ones into one unit and the same for the medium size rollers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; little curls instead of smooth body.</li>
            <li> The holders fit neatly into a couple little pockets inside.</li>
            <li> The other concern I have is that it takes more than a few minutes for the rollers to get really hot.  </li>
            <li> In my other hairsetter, the pocket is on the outside of the cover, making access much easier and keeping the metal clips cool to the touch.  </li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t get hot enough to do what I want them to do, and one set of them gets much hotter than the other.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are very gentle, but even still, the curls HOLD all day long</li>
            <li> This little sucker packs a great punch, and contrary to what some people say the rollers worked perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rated this a 3 because I hardly use them and its takes me a while to get situated in my hair, Im better off using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the metal pins would be hard to use, but I found the hold was actually much better than that of the plastic claw clips I was used</li>
            <li> I went straight to the Remington site to order the \\&quot;extra\\&quot; large curlers as replacements, but they arrived and are the same size as the larger ones already included in the set.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of hard to put them on, especially if you have never done your hair before.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t look good just air dried or blown dry, it must be styled or flat ironed.  </li>
            <li> I had an older version of this and wanted a new and second pair</li>
            <li> Why would a company sell something that they clearly did not test??</li>
            <li> I had an old big set of rollers that I got rid of because these are so much nicer</li>
            <li> Of course, my old set was ruined because I forgot about them, so I won&#x27;t complain too much about that last one.  </li>
            <li> I never had this problem with my old Remington heated curlers.  </li>
            <li> Until I figure out what to do, I&#x27;m making do by holding my head very still and only putting two curlers in at a time.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not going to hurt so much when I pass them on to a local Battered Women&#x27;s shelter.</li>
            <li> I am using ancient, old, longer pins from days gone by.  </li>
            <li> , they don&#x27;t burn my skin like my old heated curlers, and don&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional hair stylist</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try contacting the company to see if they have any of the old pin/clips, which worked just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted enough rollers to do my whole head.   </li>
            <li> Really like how hot this product gets- curls last a long time.  </li>
            <li> but like them so far.</li>
            <li> The pins are really wimpy and do not hold the curlers well enough in place - one star off for that.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t gotten rid of the old clips.</li>
            <li> After I fixed that problem, it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> The set is compact and portable for travel, and the soft case has pockets for storing the wire pins.  </li>
            <li> Instead of using these clips I use some from an old roller set to avoid this issue.</li>
            <li> However, this set is considerably faster than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend these to someone hoping to do a lot of hair as i don&#x27;t have very much as far as density or coarseness and</li>
            <li> but now I have so much hair I needed to get a second set in order to roll it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a 15 year old Vidal Sassoon.</li>
            <li> Going to order foam covered ones with actual clips that hold the whole roller in place.</li>
            <li> I do have this set that is 30 yrs old and wanted to replace it&lt;</li>
            <li> I would rather prefer clips like the conair one offers.</li>
            <li> Another thing that I preferred about my old set is that the cover included an attached Velcro loop that you could use to gather your cord so it doesn&#x27;t dangle while not being used.  </li>
            <li> People think I have a natural curl.  </li>
            <li> The red ones not so much.</li>
            <li> I have regular rollers that are much easier to handle.  </li>
            <li> and I have no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I wanted the old Clairol electric curlers and this was the closest I could come to getting them.</li>
            <li> It is a constant annoyance, however, as the clips are popping out here and there and all over the place the whole while you&#x27;re wearing them.</li>
            <li> The clips in the picture are the old clip design, but that is not what is in the kit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, would recommend this product to anyone who likes to curl their hair frequently without the hassle of a curling iron and setting it in rollers for volume.</li>
            <li> This alone makes the product completely unusable.</li>
            <li> and I am completely upset.</li>
            <li> Wish I had kept the old one I bought twenty-five years ago.  </li>
            <li> I left them in while I finished getting ready so about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set a couple of years ago based on one review that said the rollers were the closest one can get to the old Clariol rollers &amp;#34;your</li>
            <li> They take longer than my old set to heat up and turn off faster than I would like.  </li>
            <li> It is enough for my hair - 2 inches below shoulder and not thin nor thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clips that hold the roller in the hair are much too short.  </li>
            <li> They leave my hair looking professionally done.</li>
            <li> The only thing I really dislike is the type of clips they come with (u-shaped wire ones), they don&#x27;t hold my hair at all</li>
            <li> you made sure to heat them up for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I still had my old clips, used them and all was fine!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> If you have old rollers, try their clips.  </li>
            <li> They are really simple and my hair goes up fast, though for whatever reason my hair can&#x27;t keep the curl.</li>
            <li> so i have to use the old clips.</li>
            <li> Next time I go for a set that has butterfly clips or something, not thin metal bobby pin type things.</li>
            <li> I received these, I was pleasantly surprised by how compact they are.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I have saved clips from prior hot roller sets and have cobbled together a set of clips that do work rather than return a portable set with a small footprint that works well on a bathroom cabinet or stores well in a cabinet or suitcase.  </li>
            <li> is the color of bag old</li>
            <li> I packed the set for my early morning workout at the gym and they worked great.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> It gets hot fast, it has enough curlers for my long hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The package is well designed: the rollers &amp; metal pins all have a place in the soft plastic bag.</li>
            <li> I researched and found these travel size hot rollers and was shocked at how lovely, soft and full</li>
            <li> It happened to me several times, and not because I loaded too much hair on the curler.  </li>
            <li> I had to use pins from a 30 year old set.</li>
            <li> My mother had a set of these rollers that I tried out and completely fell in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use them anyway and get a soft curly look.</li>
            <li> These rollers are very well made and they last for years.  .</li>
            <li> Just wish there were a few more actual curlers.</li>
            <li> The size of the packaging is definitely convenient for travel, however the set could be improved by adding a few more rollers.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would like is for a few more curlers now that my hair is longer.  </li>
            <li> The only caution I would offer is to make sure each roller is firmly seated on its heating element or they won&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li> However, I was able to get all of my moderately thick, shoulder length hair rolled using just these 10 rollers.  </li>
            <li> I realized that one or two rollers were hot because I had pushed them down much more firmly into their sockets.</li>
            <li> They heat up very quickly and leave a long lasting curl (even if you leave them in just a short time).</li>
            <li> They heat up very quickly and leave a long lasting curl (even if you leave them in just a short time).</li>
            <li> They fall out easily and the combo (5 small, 5 medium) just isn&#x27;t enough to curl your whole head - even with shorter hair (mine is just about chin length).</li>
            <li> I wish it could have been ordered with all large rollers, but It is small enough for carry-on luggage and works just fine.</li>
            <li> When I finally got it right and left them in my hair for about 20 minutes, I was ecstatic because my hair looked like I just stepped off a cover magazine.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and left this in for the full 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Curlers heat quickly and stay heated long enough to curl hair.</li>
            <li> But it is small and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> small, and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> The unit is small and easily packable.    </li>
            <li> They are small and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Small, compact, easy to store and travel with&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the small, travel aspect of this set, but they are not as easy to use and put in because of the way they are structured.  </li>
            <li> I like this unit because it is small and easy to store and pack.  </li>
            <li> The size is small, fantastic for traveling, very portable &amp; a space saver for those who don&#x27;t have much storage room in their home.&lt;br /&gt;You just plug the bag in &amp; wait 90 sec.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for a way to tame my fine strands without damaging them, and these rollers are a God send.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Negatives for me: No on/off switch; the clips popped off several times, and I wasn&#x27;t putting too much hair on them or using the wrong clips; too many large and not-so-medium rollers; no small rollers.  </li>
            <li> and I do my very thick hair (shoulder blade length) by rolling it into large sections (back and sides in smaller rollers, top in large rollers).  </li>
            <li> You cannot leave them on as long as other rollers unless you really want super curly hair.</li>
            <li> The only way to use the new set of curlers is with my very old clips.  </li>
            <li> (if only I could find all the clips that came with it), but the standard 20 curlers are not enough for a full head of hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, I was barely able to secure even small sections of my thick hair with these clips.</li>
            <li> They are harder to use than I expected -- they don&#x27;t hold my hair tight enough to really set the curl, but they are good for touch-ups...</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and have been using a travel set of 5 extra large rollers from Conair for years, and I never knew what I was missing by using such an old-school setter.    </li>
            <li> At first I thought the curlers would be too small, but they make my hair smooth, shiny with loose, natural curls.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, thick straight hair and wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d get any results, but these rollers did the trick.  </li>
            <li> The small ones work fine</li>
            <li> This purchase was a replacement for the exact same model I bought 20 years ago and lost in a recent move.  </li>
            <li> This not only created a flatter overall look, but the hot rollers were now sending heat to my forehead instead of my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is my second set of this particular brand.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t get rid of this appliance on the first use was because I had some extra time where I could do this.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave  this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because the first set I bought tends to have issues with all of the rollers heating up at the same time.  </li>
            <li> THEY GET REALLY HOT IN A VERY SHORT TIME, AND THE ONLY THING THAT I DONT LIKE IS THAT THEY TEND TO FALL OFF</li>
            <li> The majority of the pins,- mainly the ones with red tops- glides of the curlers causing them to fall off.</li>
            <li> Curlers don&#x27;t get hot enough for the hair to actually hold a curl, and the clips don&#x27;t stay put.  </li>
            <li> They keep &#x27;popping&#x27; off particularly on the red rollers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cushion on roller is slightly rubberized and holds hair super well.  </li>
            <li> I could barely fit all my hair in the 10 rollers and my hair is pretty thin.</li>
            <li> Roll first bang section, then second, then back (which should be the crown of your head).</li>
            <li> I left these in for 15 minutes the first time if did it, and my hair was waaay (too) curly and it lasted for over 24 until the next time I washed it.</li>
            <li> I do wish this product had an option to have all large rollers for long hair.</li>
            <li> Rolled easily, but the clips left a little to be desired, the rolls kept flopping around, but that may have been user-error.</li>
            <li> I like using curlers since it cuts down the amount of time spent curling (vs. curling iron), but I would say I still get better results from a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I can only use 5 of each size and then take them out to use with the other rollers when the first set is ready.</li>
            <li> As to the second complaint, I have very fine hair, but these rollers stayed in my hair without any problem.</li>
            <li> The massive draw back us that the clips don&#x27;t fit the rollers properly and they constantly fall out.</li>
            <li> I am still trying to figure out how to use the clips but overall I would highly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really only wanted the large red rollers, so I bought 2 sets and will trade out the black rollers - the case can hold all 10 red rollers just fine.  </li>
            <li> They are compact for travel and are not very heavy.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and stay warm enough to curl your hair but not fry your fingers, and I like the compact storage bag/heating base, but I would rather buy a set that comes with better clips already than have to spend $10 or more on clips that will not become dangerous projectiles without warning.</li>
            <li> you have to be sure to push the rollers down pretty hard onto the electrical component</li>
            <li> I needed something small for travel and these seemed to fit the bill</li>
            <li> However, the posts to secure the rollers are too small.</li>
            <li> However, I have discovered after some testing back and forth, that I can achieve the same with a straight iron as far as curls....</li>
            <li> I keep these rollers in my &#x27;travel&#x27; suitcase as I&#x27;m often on the road -- compact and do the trick (I have long straight hair and use the rollers for body and curl)      --</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work well for my long medium thickness hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I used them, I spent a lot of time picking them up off the floor and trying to hold them in place with the included wire holders.  </li>
            <li> but 30 minutes later my hair was pretty flat again.</li>
            <li> My first set lasted about 10 years, I never really thought about it until the case got crummy.  </li>
            <li> Only good for short, thin hair.</li>
            <li> The pins provided are not tight enough to hold the rollers as securely as I&#x27;d like, but a few minutes with a pair of pliers took care of that.    </li>
            <li> The edges of the curlers are not super hot, so use is easier, but the center is definitely hot enough to really set my hair well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend purchasing an additional set of extra large curlers if you are used to bigger curls.</li>
            <li> The first few times the curlers did not get very hot, but after a few uses they will get hot enough to watch your fingers.</li>
            <li> This location makes them somewhat hard to pull out easily .</li>
            <li> Secondly, make sure all the curlers are pushed securely to the bottom of the base, because if they aren&#x27;t, they won&#x27;t get hot at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is probably not going to be a good product for hard to curl hair.er than a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these heat roller sets for years, and the heating elements finally gave out, so I ordered a new set.  </li>
            <li> I bought these because I was living in Europe at the time but came back home to the US often and also knew I would be returning to live again permanently one day.</li>
            <li> A couple heating elements are finally going out which is why I had to order the new version.  </li>
            <li> Flocking also seems to act like Velcro to my hair, whereby the smooth-surface rollers like these are much easier to remove without tangling my very long hair.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the poster \\&quot;sweatpea\\&quot; for her tip to buy a 2nd set and use all one size (the larger).</li>
            <li> Not that expensive, heat up for real in 2 minutes, won&#x27;t burn you and lovely compact packaging.</li>
            <li> However, to keep a big, bouncy curl for a long time, you need hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> After wrestling with them a few days, I finally gave up and just bought some cheap bearclaw clips to hold the curlers in place instead of using the pins.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, medium thickness and slightly wavy, so it holds well when I curl or straighten it; I rarely encounter hair dryers, curling irons, or curlers that won&#x27;t do something.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the pins used to hold them in, but I think that&#x27;s more user error and lack of practice rather than the pins themselves.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t keep the pins in the slots buy carry them separately in a plastic baggie just because I&#x27;m too impatient to fit them back in the slots.</li>
            <li> but if you have thick hair like me, the clips spring off Better for smaller sections of hair or thinner hair</li>
            <li> maybe I didn&#x27;t read the instructions completely but one needs to make sure the curlers are pushed down tight in the case.</li>
            <li> Also, the large rollers are not very large.</li>
            <li> Plan a little extra in your styling time schedule to allow them to cool COMPLETELY -</li>
            <li> /&gt;There would likely not be enough rollers in this set for anyone with longer hair, or thicker hair, than my own, although they heat quickly enough that I think anyone with long/thick hair could easily do half, put them back into the case to reheat, and do the other side without too much fuss.</li>
            <li> This travel size hairsetter is exactly what I was looking for and similar to the Vidal Sassoon one I had purchased years earlier and needed to replace (both curlers are the same size too).</li>
            <li> I should have been able to figure the last part out, but I was hopeful as the overall dimension was about what I wanted for my small suitcase.  </li>
            <li> As far as I know, this is the only small heat roller set available and the size was the determining factor in my purchase:  </li>
            <li> I found it took longer, maybe that was due to being the first time??</li>
            <li> - I barely even notice they&#x27;re in my bag!</li>
            <li> , I think the 90 second heating won&#x27;t quite be hot enough to make lasting curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably end up buying a second pack of rollers just because my hair is getting a little longer but its worth it!</li>
            <li> The curlers dont seem to get very hot, because you can touch them, but it really only takes about 90 seconds to heat up, and i only left in my hair for less than 10 minutes, and the result is a very tight curl. :-)</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for your Farrah Fawcett wings and curls, the black curlers will be just right for you if you can get them to stay in your hair...</li>
            <li> I purchased this same item several years ago and my old one was wearing out, so ordered a new one to take on my 3 week vacation.  </li>
            <li> However, right now it is pretty useless and stressful trying to get ready.</li>
            <li> I like that they are compact because, unlike other sets, they don&#x27;t have bulky cases that would take up far too much space in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Trouble is the clips in this set are different than my original set and will not hold any of the rollers in.</li>
            <li> It worked well on my thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Remington needs to solve the clip problem or it has made a good product that will be rejected by buyers due to poor quality control - not design.  </li>
            <li> I wrote a scathing review a week ago because the large clips didn&#x27;t fit the large rollers.</li>
            <li> I live in dry climate and old rollers frying my hair.  </li>
            <li> These curlers take a little longer to heat than advertised but are worth the wait.</li>
            <li> medium size curlers are small and I have fine short hair.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; is more like a medium and the &amp;#34; meduim&amp;#34;  is a small!!</li>
            <li> It is very small, doesn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair, and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> The rollers we not large, let alone x large.  </li>
            <li> My old set, which was essentially the same, but red and green,  held my hair just fine.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, a great product until it breaks.</li>
            <li> The rollers are too heavy to stay in with the flimsy pins, the pins won&#x27;t fit around rollers with HAIR on them, and you constantly have to fight to get the rollers back on their \\&quot;plugs\\&quot; in the case.</li>
            <li> I went back to my old Remington Care Setter -</li>
            <li> for example, asian hair or natural stick-straight hair.</li>
            <li> I probably just need to take some time and practice using them, but they just didn&#x27;t wow me enough to even do that.</li>
            <li> These curlers get extremely hot when left too long in their container because the heat does not turn on and off to regulate the temperature to keep it at the same heat range.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are marked dual voltage on the bottom, but I have only used them here.</li>
            <li> I feel there&#x27;s a real goods description problem here, these are advertised internationally and are totally unfit for international purpose.</li>
            <li> I ended up using the hooks from my old Remington set, that were larger.  </li>
            <li> I use the larger rollers at the crown of my head, and the smaller ones on the shorter hair at the side and in the back; for the small rollers, I put more hair in them so the curls don&#x27;t end up like ringlets.</li>
            <li> The rubber surface of the roller is grabby and you can&#x27;t twist the roller to drag the hair ends into a straight alignment, so you end up wrapping the hair around the roller, ringlet-style.  </li>
            <li> O.o hair (</li>
            <li> (I have shoulder-length hair), curls the hair in big soft waves</li>
            <li> I threw my old (!) rusted steam roller set away.  </li>
            <li> like them so much bought second set for use in extra bath and third to travel with.</li>
            <li> I have too much hair for only 10 rollers especially since 5 of them are smaller.</li>
            <li> Because of my natural wave, I only had to keep them in my hair for 5-7</li>
            <li> Take me back to the old days where things worked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the rollers worked for me (heating time 10 minutes as the 90 second heat up suggestion isn&#x27;t hot enough, not by a long shot.  </li>
            <li> The shape of the clips is just a fraction different from the old ones and has tiny red tips instead of the larger red tips on the first set.</li>
            <li> not as expected.. been trying it out but doesnt work on my hair.. doesnt even become hot enough to hold curl</li>
            <li> They worked better that time but still not great.  </li>
            <li> these rollers are okay, but not great.</li>
            <li> I had to let each roller cool for a few seconds before using it, and re-roll several sections of hair because the rollers kept falling out.</li>
            <li> but if you have really thick hair or long hair you might want to go with a set that has more curlers.</li>
            <li> The clips are not made to fit the rollers and slowly work themselves away until they eventually shoot off the roller</li>
            <li> I was unable to source any kind of adaptor for this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are not enough rollers for my hair; which while it is thick, it only grazes the top of my shoulders.</li>
            <li> liked the compactness of the design and portability but it failed in doing the job we bought it for</li>
            <li> They dont heat up all too much, which is good if your hair is thin, but I have thick hair</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t realize they weren&#x27;t down all the way at first).</li>
            <li> After contacting Remington a second time, they finally shipped new clips.  </li>
            <li> I have short and thick hair and the clips did not hold nor were they easy to handle.</li>
            <li> but if I&#x27;m lucky I get a few hours of extra curls before they fall out.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised when they said large and medium on the roller size...</li>
            <li> Also, there are always 1 or 2 curlers that stay less than &#x27;tepid&#x27; and never do get hot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the exact same issue as a number of other reviewers here.  </li>
            <li> I have longer hair (the longest it&#x27;s ever been, 6-7 inches past my shoulders) and needed something that could style my hair quickly and help w the frizz.</li>
            <li> If the curlers are not heating up, but sure that they are connecting properly at the base (check that the prongs are properly aligned and press the curler down to ensure a good connection).</li>
            <li> have long thing straight hair and it fell short to curl my entire head in one</li>
            <li> some reviews said these don&#x27;t get hot, not true in my case</li>
            <li> Guess I expected &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34; to be a bit bigger... rollers look more like Medium and Small to me, but I&#x27;m not a roller expert.  </li>
            <li> time when getting ready for work or other appointments.</li>
            <li> It was a hot mess.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my trip to Europe, thinking they would be very small for me to pack lightly.</li>
            <li> I can get most of my hair with one round, but usually have to re-use a couple of curlers to complete the job as I have quite a bit of hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the larger hot curlers that only give your hair a bend but no real curl.  </li>
            <li> I have very straight and pretty thin hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy quick and the curls last about 6 hours in thick long heavy hair.</li>
            <li> But, for the hot, humid summer I was looking for lower maintenance, less damage to my hair &amp; a way not subject my hair to a lot of flat ironing.</li>
            <li> These get hot very quickly, but it is sometimes hard to get them to go on the small connector to reheat them.</li>
            <li> BUT I will never buy these again because the clips do not fit the large rollers!</li>
            <li> you only need 3-5 mins, it become really hot...and the curls last very long.</li>
            <li> - so straight that even when I blow dry with mousse, my hair still ends up dead straight.  </li>
            <li> so far these are the same only thing that has changes</li>
            <li> Setter\\&quot; for almost 10 years, so after the poor things couldn&#x27;t give any more, I decided to buy the same brand.</li>
            <li> The bottom of the bag contains an electrical base to which the ceramic rollers connect, so you have to make sure that each roller is securely plugged in.  </li>
            <li> I rarely rate anything a 1 star, but these are a total waste of your money.</li>
            <li> Of the 5 red clips, only 2 fit, the other ones were constantly coming loose causing the rollers to fall out of my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The curlers do not get very hot, and they are very heavy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the metal clips on the rollers right, and usually I just use the plastic clips I have for my hair, you know, the ones with teeth that come in different colors, and they work fine.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot to the touch and burns your fingers a little.</li>
            <li> Also the plastic smell was a little unbearable at first.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe this little set of hot rollers worked as well as it did.</li>
            <li> First looking at this, I thought \\&quot;there&#x27;s no way this little thing can work</li>
            <li> I can stack them on top of each other on my bathroom counter and they hardly take up any room.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years, but recently I ordered a new set and found that the clips, especially the ones for the larger red rollers, do not hold the rollers in place even for the two minutes</li>
            <li> i love the little pouch, which is quite compact and less bulky than alternative versions of hot rollers, but they are VERY heavy, which is something to consider if you will be traveling by air, and need to watch weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to hot rollers, but I&#x27;m not very happy with this set.</li>
            <li> and despite it being very long, I have a really hard time keeping the rolls in place, they fall easily.</li>
            <li> i am asian, so my hair is extremely reluctant to hold any shape beside straight.</li>
            <li> Listen to the other reviews --- they dont heat evenly and the clips for the red rollers dont stay in so they pop out as I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> Gave my first away to a friend who didn&#x27;t mind my few strands in it.  </li>
            <li> Small but powerful.</li>
            <li> but I like to extend the heating time a few minutes to get them really hot.  </li>
            <li> I was reluctant for years to try hot rollers because I was figured they&#x27;d be a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> so I used less hair on the large rollers, to no avail, they still fell out.</li>
            <li> However, they have changed the clips slightly and the large rollers DO NOT STAY IN.  </li>
            <li> The only down fall to this product is the rollers dont get hot enough.</li>
            <li> First, the pins for the larger rollers are not sized correctly, and they pop out no matter how little hair you put in the roller.  </li>
            <li> Second set, first set a little sturdier</li>
            <li> The ten curlers easily cover my long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> My only problem with this one is that the u shaped hooks that keep your hair on the roller - is not very wide.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this set to replace a set of old wax core rollers I had, which came in a large, hard plastic case that had bare metal rods on which to heat them, and plastic clips that had to be stored separately from the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love that the design is simple red and black, and takes up very little space.</li>
            <li> I find that these (compared to the R. Pearl unit) need to heat up a little longer, stay in my hair a little longer, and (obviously) there are far fewer curlers, so maybe this unit is not great for everyday use, but it is an excellent choice for travel!</li>
            <li> I wish all 10 rollers were the large ones as I don&#x27;t like a tight curl.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they were the right ones</li>
            <li> I will preface my review by a description of my hair:  very, very long (to my hips) with natural spiral curls (Type 3A/B, for those who care).  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect since I have very long, thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li> if you would rather not worry about one of your rollers falling out while you are running around your hotel room getting ready - get the claw clips and pack one less pair of shoes</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ready in less then a minute.</li>
            <li> I accidentally figured out that the clips go into the very end of the curlers where there&#x27;s a slight depression.</li>
            <li> The clips barely keep the roller in place, despite starting at the middle of the shaft, tucking the ends, then rolling up to head, the ends always seem to fall out.</li>
            <li> Another thing, they get very hot and are hard to hold onto when putting in hair.</li>
            <li> As long as you make sure that they are seated completely on the base, they heat fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Heats quickly and stays in well in thick hair.</li>
            <li> set is too heavy, rollers are made of hard rubber and are so heavy that fall right out of my hair and won&#x27;t say in with the pins, the cord sticks out the back with no velcro holder just hangs out, the top does not zip so the rollers and pins can fall out.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly long (middle of my back) thick, but fine hair....</li>
            <li> These rollers only stay hot for a few minutes as they do not have posts that heat the entire roller.</li>
            <li> The heat up quickly, hold hair well and the 10 rollers are enough for even my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this as I travel frequently and needed a portable hot roller set, but these were, frankly, terrible.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are a little heavy, but even with my fine hair, I do not count that as a pro or a con as it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Imagine my disappointment when I started looking and realized that most new sets have a u shape indent to the curlers so the heating element rests against the curler rather than the curler having a hole in the middle that slides over a post.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, yet fine (middle eastern hair).</li>
            <li> It does not warm up very hot, so you have to keep putting the rollers back in the bag and waiting.</li>
            <li> well on fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> The rollers do get hot enough but the wire clips are not strong enough to hold in the larger curlers.......I would not buy these again</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t matter how little hair or much you put around the curler.</li>
            <li> Very compact case, takes little room on bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> otherwise you&#x27;ll find that some rollers are a little cooler and not heated as much as the others.</li>
            <li> The little clips that hold the rollers to your hair don&#x27;t stay clipped very well.  </li>
            <li> The image is kind of deceiving: the rollers are actually very small and the entire package is quite small as well.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length layed hair which is somewhat fine and and at at first I was afraid that the large rollers were going to be too small.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are fine for short, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> The fact that you don&#x27;t have the outer layer covered means with a clip means it will cool down your hair faster which means if you want tight curls, it won&#x27;t happen and 3.</li>
            <li> Are there no women who work at Remington that can try out these designs - who thinks it is a good idea to have heavy hard rubber curlers held in your hair with little pins?  </li>
            <li> I am a mixed african america and native indian female so my hair is very thick and somewhat in between coarse and fine.</li>
            <li> For some unknown reason they have shortened the clips on the larger curlers (red) and as other reviewers have mentioned, you put one in and by the time you are on the second curl the first one is sliding off your head ...</li>
            <li> I blow dry and flat iron my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have average, Irish hair and this does not get high enough to do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> the attached photo, you can see how the clip for the small black roller fits just fine.  </li>
            <li> She looks like a  sexy looking drag queen with those false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It stated 5 large rollers and 5 jumbo rollers - not true!</li>
            <li> I have thick super long hair.  </li>
            <li> I roll up a section of hair, stick the pin/clip on, and it slowly just slides right off.  </li>
            <li> Too bad because other than the fact that the clips won&#x27;t stay in this has always been a great product for the money.</li>
            <li> I even went back to my old electric rollers that were older and take longer to heat up -- but at least I don&#x27;t burn my fingers on them.  </li>
            <li> I have paid 5 times as much for hot rollers in the past and have never, ever worked as well as these little guys do!</li>
            <li> These little curlers make your hair really curly and last all day long.</li>
            <li> They were called extra large in the photo and description but are way too small for my hair and style.      </li>
            <li> They are inexpensive enough that I just bought 2 sets and combined to make one large and one small.</li>
            <li> The entire set is very compact, unlike the larger sets I usually use at home.  </li>
            <li> I have decided I really like them as besides body, they also give my hair a little curl on the bottom - or curve, depending on how long I keep them in.  </li>
            <li> One hour later my hair was flat again.</li>
            <li> im used to lasting all day falls flat after an hour.</li>
            <li> Decided to go with the Remington brand because my flat iron is the same brand</li>
            <li> For the pins, place the flat side next to your head.</li>
            <li> compact and good for travelling but disappointed as plug sockets unsuitable in UK and had to purchase separately universal plug (a further £6.99)</li>
            <li> Not only do you have to be absolutely sure that they&#x27;re seated exactly right on the metal rod, or they don&#x27;t heat up correctly, but the worst thing was that the metal clip part isn&#x27;t wide enough to secure the roller firmly</li>
            <li> I have moderately thick but fine hair down to mid back with long layers.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, the clips in the new set, that keep the rollers in the hair, are shorter than the old clips, and the rollers don&#x27;t stay in very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too bad because this set seems SO convenient and easy, but I think I might have to send it back.</li>
            <li> BUT I&#x27;d be much happier if the heat level were consistent instead of varying from use to use (frustrating!)</li>
            <li> If I had a whole bunch of hair or way past shoulder length, I&#x27;d probably invest in a second set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons?</li>
            <li> I had a similar Remington set that I inherited from my mother that had to be replaced when one of my kids knocked them into the toilet.  </li>
            <li> I even tried putting the small clips on the large roller....</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t decided whether I will keep the rollers as they are medium &amp; large and I need small &amp; medium.  </li>
            <li> the large rollers are on the small size.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just me, since I&#x27;ve never used hot rollers before, but every single time I roll up a little bit of hair then put this U shaped clip in, it pops out!  </li>
            <li> These rollers are too hot and too hard.  </li>
            <li> They are not enough for my entire head, but they heat quickly enough that when I remove the first few, they are heated again before I remove the last few.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very compact with two pockets for the two sizes of clips so it takes up very little room in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> The two sets take up less room on my counter than my old, larger set of rollers.</li>
            <li> As for the heating, I usually turn these on before I shower and dry my hair so that they are really hot</li>
            <li> They take up hardly any room at all in my suitcase and work so much better than my old heavy giant set that I&#x27;ve lugged along in the past.</li>
            <li> unfortunately the roller are not big enough and the pin doesnt hold your hair securely...</li>
            <li> After 2-3 hours I have almost straight hair (which usually doesn&#x27;t happen if I use Caruso sponge rolls)</li>
            <li> The clips work well in my hair, I would say my hair is average in thickness and have no trouble keeping the clips on the curlers.</li>
            <li> It is small and very portable.  </li>
            <li> Every brand of hot rollers seems to have at least one or two drawbacks.</li>
            <li> These two compact cases can be tucked into small spaces in your luggage and don&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well they would work for people with thin/fine hair, although I also used them once on a friend who has very fine/thin hair, and they worked well on her too.</li>
            <li> I noticed some reviewers complained some curlers didn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li> I bought this travel set of hot rollers in spite of some negative reviews stating 1)</li>
            <li> These have small, non-synchronous raised areas that don&#x27;t really grip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried blow drying and flat ironing</li>
            <li> Granted, I only created a long bob</li>
            <li> The only warning would be that if your hair is medium to long in length, you may wish to get 2 sets -- which is just what I am going to do now![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> And yes, they will curl your hair, if you can get them to stay in long enough.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay long enough to curl my hair at all.</li>
            <li> These may work on long hair, but they are totally ineffectual for shorter styles.</li>
            <li> I would suggest an acutal flat iron, wand, or curling irons.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried products and curling irons/ flat irons to curl it....</li>
            <li> They give my hair long lasting waves.  </li>
            <li> Had to curl with my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I bought two since one was not enough for my long hair.</li>
            <li> No auto shut off and apparently no temperature max.  </li>
            <li> how long I left them on.  </li>
            <li> but it fell flat after about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was away too long on vacation and could not send them back.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t need to stay in your hair for long to create bouncy curls, and they leave your hair shiny and bouncy with curls that last for hours.</li>
            <li> is 10 minutes long enough?</li>
            <li> I even tried to do tiny tendrils of only a tiny amount of hair and it still was not hot enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Having used these quite a bit for travel recently, I&#x27;ve found one quirk: the rollers can shake loose in the case and not heat up properly.  </li>
            <li> and I got what I wanted from these little red and  black hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I have used hot curlers for years with a similar style of clips; there should be no &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34; to using them.  </li>
            <li> You may need to take the curler out and let it sit for a minute or so until it cools down a bit so that you don&#x27;t burn a sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li> The reason for buying two is that with my hair (thick and coarse) there is no way that 5 large or five medium rollers are going to do it for my hairstyle.  </li>
            <li> The hard rollers are indeed like the old Clairol rollers, but I must be getting soft.  </li>
            <li> They last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> They have taken the place of my previous sets.own natural curls from forming.  </li>
            <li> They dont &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; the hair as the roller is slick, and there aren&#x27;t enough of them to do all my hair at once, so I either have to roll half of my hair and then put the rollers back in to get hot or use a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> This turned out to be one of those products that I wished I had spent more money on because the inexpensive route was the wrong way to go.</li>
            <li> On the larger curlers, they keep slipping off, so I am constantly readjusting them.</li>
            <li> long to heat/reheat&lt;br /&gt;Rollers don&#x27;t retain heat long enough to penetrate through hair</li>
            <li> and I know that these will last a long long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picking up clips and rollers out of the sink, off the floor, from the toilet . . .</li>
            <li> One landed in a hotel toilet.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I&#x27;d rather use toilet rollers than these.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try hot curlers, but they don&#x27;t work at all for my long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> , it hip ought I&#x27;d take a gamble,  I have very thick, somewhat coarse hair and these rollers just slip right out.  </li>
            <li> I am not a hair expert, I have only used a flat iron, do not even know how to blow dry my hair!</li>
            <li> I put this on my wish list after reading some of the positive reviews, and ignoring the negative ones.  </li>
            <li> It took me several tries to get my hair curled because I either didn&#x27;t heat the rollers long enough</li>
            <li> I had a set that last for years and decided to get a new set, the clips are too small to hold the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> They give me loose bouncy curls that last all day.</li>
            <li> After several combings, my hair finally settled down enough to leave the house and stayed wavy all day, even in Houston humidity!  </li>
            <li> Buy it for the family and pass it on down to the next teen in the group and for when that teen reaches</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being new to hot rollers, I&#x27;m not sure if my issues with getting rollers in place and securing them are going to be common to any set or not.</li>
            <li> Half the curlers didnt even heat up and the few that did were not hot enough to curl right.</li>
            <li> Not only is the process quicker using these rollers, but the curl stays all day and they don&#x27;t dry out my hair like the curling iron!  </li>
            <li> (I actually got mine on sale at Target, but the Amazon price is still less expensive), and having used Remington products for many years, trust they would be reliable.</li>
            <li> The reason I have two sets is I can keep all the big rollrs in one and the smaller ones in the other.</li>
            <li> Other travel sets only give you 5 rollers, which isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I am pleasantly surprised with this little set.  </li>
            <li> inspection, I saw that the red clips for the large red curlers were a little too small.</li>
            <li> I put some of them on tight and some not tight to test it out.</li>
            <li> This was a high quality product but the rollers where much to small for my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed by the clips, but after a while I figured out how to use them and they work great.</li>
            <li> I have all kinds of hairsetters - large, small, you name it - but this one beats them all!</li>
            <li> Work just as well as my huge expensive rollers that I use at home.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that I might need more rollers</li>
            <li> If you roll them to the scalp and slip the most awkward metal clips over the rollers and your hair, you will scorch your fingers and your scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typically satisfied with Remington products, but this is a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Pros:  Small, outside is soft fabric as it should be for travel  </li>
            <li> I did what another reviewer suggested and ordered two sets, combining all the larger rollers into one unit, but they&#x27;re still quite small and the result isn&#x27;t as natural as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> They are the medium sized rollers and just do not work with how long my hair is.</li>
            <li> The third time, I watched carefully and I could see the clip beginning to pull off of the roller almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Vey strange.</li>
            <li> Not enough for even my very loose shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> The large/x-large rollers are smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> wish I had done that a long time ago.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t leave them in as long for a softer curl.</li>
            <li> (I have fairly long hair, it is not that they are falling out for lack of hair to hold them).  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Remington travel rollers for a long time.</li>
            <li> I normally have a limp wavy type of hair so this was an improvement!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t take long to heat up.</li>
            <li> By the time you have four in and are trying to put a fifth in, the 3rd one is slipping out.  </li>
            <li> The curl seems to hold, but not hold all day long.  </li>
            <li> That is a minor problem.  </li>
            <li> Seconds after carefully rolling up the curler, the red clips will pop out and out goes the roller.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work well, no matter how long you let it heat or</li>
            <li> how long you leave the rollers in.</li>
            <li> These rollers are NOT for long silky hair.</li>
            <li> when it will stay in my hair long</li>
            <li> I have long hair and lots of it.</li>
            <li> Waited to long to return - just tossed them in the trash.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to heat ether.</li>
            <li> I bought one set for me and another for my dtr who has long hair.  </li>
            <li> I got a tiny bit of body out of them but no real curl whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It was a bit smaller than what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair.</li>
            <li> but it takes twice as long.</li>
            <li> my hair is long</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t wait long enough—</li>
            <li> They heated well, but my hair is too long</li>
            <li> Also, the medium rollers give really strange looking curls.</li>
            <li> When you force the clip onto the curler, it is stretched too wide into a V instead of closing back up, and begins to &amp;#34;back off&amp;#34; of the curler.</li>
            <li> I have relatively thick hair that is cut to my shoulders and these did absolutely nothing to curl it.</li>
            <li> The pin is not long enough to hold the hair tightly.</li>
            <li> Push the pun directly down in the middle of the roller, so the pin and roller form an X or cross.</li>
            <li> Pin up and take down when it has completely cooled down, last all day.</li>
            <li> But being able to use only half of the product is disappointing enough to justify the 2 star review.</li>
            <li> Only downside, is they are not large...</li>
            <li> My problem with them is that the clips provided are not large enough.  </li>
            <li> Another minor point was that I much preferred the previous casing that was white with a small blue printed pattern on it vs this red and black combination.  </li>
            <li> The unit heated up within a minute and a half, and only needed about 8-10 minutes in my hair (enough time to get dressed, and put on makeup).  </li>
            <li> I give it two stars instead of one because if you&#x27;re willing to spend three hours curling your hair in small half inch sections then indeed it does work....</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, and if you have hair as straight and uncooperative, or as long and thus &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; as mine, then simply buy at least 2 of these!</li>
            <li> I usually plug them in and go do something else for awhile, but that is probably the nature of the ceramic and safety concerns, this I can live with.</li>
            <li> Also, the curls they produced did not last as long as other rollers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t specify how long it takes them to reach that point, so I left them for 10 minutes while I did some other things.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She has long flowing hair, this style is a little more difficult to find.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts that the curlers would be able to create tight curls, but i was wrong.</li>
            <li> The absolutely most frustrating problem was that the clips would not fit the rollers properly; the clips would either not fit over the roller, or would pop off and the roller would fall out.</li>
            <li> The pins do not stay around the rollers and pop off very easily:(  I happen to have enough hair clips that I can use those to keep them in.</li>
            <li> So, I can only use the small rollers, and even with my chin length hair, 5 rollers is not enough, so this is going back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for years, and no matter which other ones I try, I always end up going back to these.</li>
            <li> The grooves in the rollers aren&#x27;t very deep, which means that your hair doesn&#x27;t hold to them as well as with other sets.  </li>
            <li> I just hope the product lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> However, I agree with other reviewers that the red clips don&#x27;t stay in!  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m going to buy other hair clips to use with the red curlers.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like they still were not hot enough.</li>
            <li> I even tried a different type of clip that has worked with all my other rollers.</li>
            <li> only reason I did not give 5 stars, was due to the number of rollers.  </li>
            <li> : These are definitely a portable set and if you plan to use these as a travel set, they are extremely compact.  </li>
            <li> There are some minuses, and for the uninitiated: Doesn&#x27;t work for short hair, and from reading other reviews, very long hair;  but</li>
            <li> very thick, straight hair and my hair actually holds the curl using this set.  </li>
            <li> Allowing for cooling time, I&#x27;ve been leaving the rollers in position for around 25-30 minutes, but again, I do have a lot of very long hair.  </li>
            <li> Allowing for cooling time, I&#x27;ve been leaving the rollers in position for around 25-30 minutes, but again, I do have a lot of very long hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had shoulder-length to VERY long hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> I have very long medium thickness hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair , but they worked for me</li>
            <li> and all i did was wash, dry my hair, but some heat protective product on it and put the rollers in.  </li>
            <li> My only reason for giving them 3/5 stars is that the clips for the red rollers do not fit.</li>
            <li> so I actually bought a second set and replaced the reds with the black rollers and only use the set of black rollers.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for people not familiar with rolling and setting their hair, in general.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a variety of curlers, curling wands, and curling irons over the years in attempts to style my otherwise very straight, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> but I used them every single day.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had a single clip fall out.  </li>
            <li> But Remington, THE BIG MINUS IS the little, bitty, short roller pins you include with the set!!  </li>
            <li> When it arrived I was surprised at how small the set is - about the size of a dollar bill.  </li>
            <li> Great...I have really long hair and was not sure if these would heat up enough to actually do the job.  </li>
            <li> like kind and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try creating loose curls.  </li>
            <li> They immediately begin to creep back until they fling themselves from the curler and curler begins a rapid slid down and off your head.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the clips -</li>
            <li> but when it came to actual use, this was a let down.  </li>
            <li> I bought TWO new ones since I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to steam rollers such as The Caruso hair setter that always worked for me in the past.</li>
            <li> I could only attempt to curl one half of my hair and it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the rollers would not get hot enough.</li>
            <li> The only flaw is the metal clips--the clips for the larger rollers are too small and do not stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> because mere moments later, they will become infernally hot.</li>
            <li> I used the full set of hot rollers years ago, but now only needed a few curlers and hated heating the big set up for a few&lt;</li>
            <li> For some reason the black curlers are hotter than the red.  </li>
            <li> So unless you have another option, I&#x27;d recommend only planning to use the 5 black ones.</li>
            <li> was black and this is red!</li>
            <li> : I think curlers went out of style a while back, (though they never should have because they are much less of a hassle than the curling iron)</li>
            <li> The clips hold the black rollers, but not the red ones at all.</li>
            <li> The previous reviews about the red clips not holding and literally flying off across the room are spot on.  </li>
            <li> Lucky for me they weren&#x27;t expensive</li>
            <li> I finally got my hair rolled up sort of, but it was a mess of hair sticking out all over.  </li>
            <li> and I went and purchased an expensive standard set of hot rollers and took those back in preference over these little guys.  </li>
            <li> you wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how long I left it there, but not too long</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, but it&#x27;s not super thick and ten curlers are enough for me, but someone with thick hair could certainly use two sets (trust me,</li>
            <li> key is to not wrap the hair too tight around the rollers.</li>
            <li> Personally, I thought this product was really difficult to wrap around my straight, slightly layered Asian hair.  </li>
            <li> I have moderately curly hair that gets a little unruly</li>
            <li> so that is not put away neatly in the little red case, which the picture does not show the cord.</li>
            <li> The clips could be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Also - for some reason, the clips for the red rollers don&#x27;t hold them in place even a little bit.  </li>
            <li> There are 10 curlers, 5 med and 5 a little larger (I think they measure 1\\&quot; and 1 1/4\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li> I took one look at this tiny little package and thought to myself, &amp;#34;No way this is going to work on my (below shoulder length) hair in Houston.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> so for those of you who are not familiar, here are some basic tips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lastly,  because I don&#x27;t have a problem with too little volume, this device made my hair a lot puffier than necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the whole thing is really tough and should wear well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t check the appliance out before I left and it turned out that the clips included to be used on the large rollers were not designed correctly and will not hold the rollers in place reliably.  </li>
            <li> A little harder to fasten curler to really short hair.</li>
            <li> will now be using these probably every other day, since that&#x27;s when I wash and re-blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and could not get by with 5 small rollers and 2 large ones.</li>
            <li> The only other slight problem is the heaviness of the curler.</li>
            <li> so I placed all the red in one and all the black in other.  </li>
            <li> The curlers are small and the plastic and rubber surfaces are so hot that it&#x27;s hard to hold onto the roller.</li>
            <li> As was suggested by a few other people, I purchased two sets and combined the larger rollers as a single set.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair (upper/middle back) and these rollers are too small and not jumbo like described.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the only negative I have to say is that the curls don&#x27;t last throughout the day even with hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have an old set - a couple of curlers had fallen on the floor and chipped so after at least 10 years</li>
            <li> I have long hair that reaches to the small of my back</li>
            <li> They heat unevenly and the pins for the larger rollers aren&#x27;t sized correctly so they pop out.</li>
            <li> They will not stay in your hair, even if you only put a few strands of hair in each roller.  </li>
            <li> I was therefore amazed when they arrived within just a few days, so I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This set has regular round rollers with metal clips.  </li>
            <li> I only leave them on for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not very many.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> AND IT DOES NOT REALLY CURL YOUR HAIR.  </li>
            <li> I have a similar set I purchased a few years ago,</li>
            <li> I have \\&quot;a lot of thin hair\\&quot; as my stylist puts it, and it&#x27;s pin straight</li>
            <li> It got a lot hotter a lot faster on 220V than at 110V which should be expected.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington rollers before with no issue and have a larger set I use everyday at home, but it was too bulky to carry overseas for 11 days.</li>
            <li> Maybe their QC department needs to look harder at this defect.</li>
            <li> Ten curlers is about 2 curlers too few for my hair - but i make do.</li>
            <li> but I still expected to get curl or additional body from these rollers.  </li>
            <li> I spent 18 days in Hawaii and California and used these rollers every day.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl the way I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not.</li>
            <li> Be careful.  </li>
            <li> AND THEY ARE TOO HEAVY FOR THE ACTUAL PIN</li>
            <li> The clips are way too narrow and short to catch your hair and have leverage against your scalp, also contributing to rollers falling out.  </li>
            <li> In fact that is the only feature I think they are missing, auto-off.  </li>
            <li> Then, be careful of the metal prong part on the roller that sits in the case...</li>
            <li> These are a piece of junk and a total waste of $.  </li>
            <li> The clips for the larger size curlers DO NOT FIT and will not stay in place.  </li>
            <li> I finally tried these, when I realized that they they are completely round and sit on a post.  </li>
            <li> so be careful with your fingers.  </li>
            <li> (what would be a Mohawk if you had one, but wide-</li>
            <li> like 2 inches wide) and separate into 3 sections.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no way these rollers would stay on my head.</li>
            <li> the do not hold well for my short hair because the rollers are a bit on the heavy side.  </li>
            <li> Look at the roller carefully before using it and the explanation makes sense.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> You may have to try this a few different times before you get your desired results.</li>
            <li> Not very please with my purchase.</li>
            <li> but you do need to experiment w/a few different angles to insert them.</li>
            <li> My hair kept on slipping off the roller.</li>
            <li> My hair is almost mid back andf really thick...</li>
            <li> Like I said, I have long, thick hair, so 5 small rollers doesn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> min.&lt;br /&gt;The ten rollers were enuf for my big thick head of hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So these were not a smart buy at all for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll echo the other negative reviews by saying that those clips are completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> (I have long hair with medium thickness and slight layering).  </li>
            <li> I have long hair that is slightly thin-ish.</li>
            <li> I have not purchased curlers in a long time, so I found it odd</li>
            <li> I usually leave them in about 5-10 minutes for medium to loose curls that last all day.  </li>
            <li> Only difference is they cost less and take up way less space.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, the clips absolutely do not hold the rollers.</li>
            <li> 4 stars given due to slipping and burning fingers.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long (middle of my back) and thin.  </li>
            <li> I had to use long bobby pins and even they didn&#x27;t keep the rollers tight.</li>
            <li> So I usually start with using rollers from the center, then move the end ones to the middle.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick or extra long hair you might want to buy two sets.</li>
            <li> I can not rave enough about these little gems!</li>
            <li> When I first plugged them in I was disappointed to find that some of them were hot and others weren&#x27;t; then I realized that some were not pushed all the way down on their little pegs.</li>
            <li> As I remove rollers from the ends first to try to use them, I can only get a couple before the other two are cold.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick stick straight asian hair, and all I have to do is prep my hair with mousse (I use Tresemme) and then roll these suckers in!</li>
            <li> Not really enough rollers for someone with thick or very long hair.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t want a tight curl, I didn&#x27;t leave them in my hair very long.  </li>
            <li> I was left chasing rollers around the floor and with straight hair with a little weird looking crinkle in it.</li>
            <li> I remove the base from the other case (it slips out easily), and use the 2nd case just for the spare rollers.  </li>
            <li> This set heats up extremely well, and yes it delivers what it says.</li>
            <li> That makes the curlers pretty useless, even if they heat well.  </li>
            <li> Even though other reviewers warned me, I ordered this set.</li>
            <li> i found extreme displeasure with this product.</li>
            <li> I have had the other two sets for 20+ years.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are the same, but the pins/clips that hold them in are too small.  </li>
            <li> The clips for the red rollers are too small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people are having such issue with the wire clips.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that the clips seem a bit small for the rollers.  </li>
            <li> it would also be a neat idea to have heated rollers covered in a softer coating other than rubber.  </li>
            <li> the pins are too small for the rollers and they pop outI have had the same type for years and never had this problem</li>
            <li> I first purchased a set of Revlon expensive curlers and they did nothing in her hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, this set was a complete disappointment for me; the CONS totally outweighed the PROS.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to take traveling.</li>
            <li> BTW, in spite of other comments, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the clips.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the clips do not hold the rollers due to the coating on the rollers.</li>
            <li> I took this on a trip to Italy since it was extremely lightweight and dual voltage.</li>
            <li> I felt like the rollers saved me time in regards to doing my hair, especially since I was in the water everyday of my 7 day vacation!</li>
            <li> I do have some trouble keeping the pins in my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be curled for long anyway.  </li>
            <li> Even &amp;#34;set the curl&amp;#34; like some other customers suggested.</li>
            <li> I would highly NOT recommend these!!</li>
            <li> Small number of rollers (only 10 total)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not have any problems with the clips, as other reviewers have noted.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> for longer hair past the shoulders I would suggest bigger rollers.</li>
            <li> Took it on a vacation due to the compact size.  </li>
            <li> other methods always fall out within the hour!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Big improvement on rollers I&#x27;ve tried and then ditched in the past.</li>
            <li> The one I got seems to be defective, but looking at a couple other reviews, it wasn&#x27;t just my set of clips.  </li>
            <li> and they have worked well for me in the past (same brand).</li>
            <li> The rollers, in my opinion, are actually 5 medium and 5 small rollers.</li>
            <li> The clips are too short or small.</li>
            <li> Of course every other set</li>
            <li> However,all the clips on both sets I bought recently are too small, pop off and ping around the room.  </li>
            <li> so two people are inconvenienced due to the ongoing clip problem.</li>
            <li> have used other travel rollers and never had this issue.</li>
            <li> Small enough to stash in my suitcase too!  </li>
            <li> HOLD because the clips won&#x27;t, reheat and reroll other sections.  </li>
            <li> For reference, my hair is layered and the longest layer reaches the small of my back.  </li>
            <li> I also, unlike other reviewers, didn&#x27;t have an issue with these clips and their holdability.  </li>
            <li> I took a star away for the lousy design of the clips and the fact that the end rollers don&#x27;t stay hot unless you move them around.  </li>
            <li> They are also small and compact so even if you have to to travel it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviews</li>
            <li> At first, I thought I was just putting them in wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smaller black clips did match the black curlers and would stay tight.</li>
            <li> The only flaw is that sometimes certain heating elements don&#x27;t work so I&#x27;ll have a cold roller and have to put it on a working one.</li>
            <li> So, they pop off and the roller falls out and there really is no fix for it except to put less hair in each roller.</li>
            <li> I can create several different styles from just a little bounce and shine, curly ponytail, or fluffy defined curls all over depending on the number of curlers, how long they set, and if I bother with curl holding gel (I hate the feel of hair spray so rarely use).  </li>
            <li> Even though I try to press down on the rollers, random ones do not get hot anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how they can get away with selling a product that just flat out does not work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m frustrated with this product and wish I&#x27;d sent it back right away.</li>
            <li> I would have accepted although the rollers are just too small for my hair &amp; there aren&#x27;t enough - I can do half of my hair with all of the rollers</li>
            <li> They kept slipping and made the whole experience very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical based on other reviews, but they worked really well.</li>
            <li> Sorry I took so long to replace my old ones!</li>
            <li> After 20 years of short hair, grew it out &amp; needed something to add a little finish when I have very little time.</li>
            <li> but when I take them out, I have to wait for them to heat up again before I can finish the other half of my hair.</li>
            <li> May need two sets if you have fuller hair... but even two sets of these would take up less space than one set of other rollers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blame them, it&#x27;s hard to keep asian hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;  hard to get last curlers off of stand&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Downside, 5 alligator clips use up more suitcase space than the stupid curlers do.</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t stay as long as a Marcel curl (not many things can...).</li>
            <li> My last set lasted for over five years (using them at least once a day).</li>
            <li> , my only complaint are the pins that hold them on.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re too small for long hair.</li>
            <li> I could not figure out the problem until I finally noticed (duh)</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the pins it comes with.</li>
            <li> Thought about returning it , but not worth paying hte return shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line:  If you decide to ignore the negative reviews and go for this, do yourself a favor and buy some roller clips in the same order.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the clips that come with, I didn&#x27;t feel they held</li>
            <li> The flocked or velvet-ish textured ones are NO good for naturally curly hair, they leave you with a fluffy look.  </li>
            <li> But that would be my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Is now inch past ear lobe and  and varies in length from 2-6 inches long.</li>
            <li> I find that the the curl from those rollers is not worth the effort and straightens almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> Do not get that hot, pins are difficult to use, rollers are heavy and do not stay in fine/thin hair.</li>
            <li> Not fun to find out on my cruise.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair- past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> Sadly (according to them) two of my daughters have straight, silky hair that doesn&#x27;t like to stay curled.</li>
            <li> For that reason, I rated an average 3-stars.</li>
            <li> These rollers are too heavy and small to roll hair properly.</li>
            <li> This is a big disappointment being that I used to be such a big fan.  </li>
            <li> If it were possible to give negative stars, this product deserves it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Because my hair is so long (past my waist)</li>
            <li> Make sure they are well-seated into the base.  </li>
            <li> It was slow to heat, but the grippers actually kept the hair on the roller.  </li>
            <li> but it takes me a few tries.</li>
            <li> These rollers actually put a &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; in my medium length, thick gray hair.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I personally have thick medium length and use these along with another set of Jumbo Rollers by Conair.</li>
            <li> My wife followed the instructions carefully, used the recommended clips for each roller, and after just a few seconds the clip would fall out and the roller would fall on the floor.</li>
            <li> terrible - I went by the reviews for those who absolutely loved it , what a joke.  </li>
            <li> I have hair to the middle of my back...fairly thick and curly.  </li>
            <li> I made sure to push them all the way down into the base, and they all heated perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers because the 1960s set of Kindness by Clairol (which still works) took too long to heat up, and they were very heavy.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully I have my old metal clips from my previous (broken) set.</li>
            <li> About my hair: Relatively thin, shoulder length, with a slight natural curl.  </li>
            <li> The roller falls down.  </li>
            <li> They never hold my hair and fall down.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;ll slip down a couple inches once I \\&quot;secure\\</li>
            <li> down on each roller till it snaps into place, then that will insure each roller will heat</li>
            <li> You have to PUSH the curler down on stem</li>
            <li> My mother asked me the other day if I&#x27;d gotten a hairweave!  </li>
            <li> Wish I had read the reviews about the clips on the red curlers not fitting!</li>
            <li> Be careful the clips spring out at a rapid rate!!</li>
            <li> As other reviews have said, yep the clips go flying out in all directions!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out and it&#x27;t at that awkward stage where it hits right below my shoulder.  </li>
            <li> The unit very compact for travel and heats quickly, but it&#x27;s difficult, almost impossible, to get the curlers to stay in my hair.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is, it&#x27;s a little hard to get the rollers on and off the clamps that heat and hold them in place inside the hairsetter.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, my wife has had trouble with the spring clips staying in her hair.</li>
            <li> The case is very small and compact, although the image here makes the case look much larger.  </li>
            <li> i have long long layered cut hair-lots if it-did small sections for rolls and the holders would NOT hold!!  </li>
            <li> and I was at first disappointed at the low level of heat  </li>
            <li> I saved the longer clips from my previous set and use both of them together.</li>
            <li> These slip out almost immediately, even after trying half the amount of hair for each roller they slipped.  </li>
            <li> These curlers do not curl your hair as quickly as my previous set so need to leave them in longer.</li>
            <li> And even though there were not many rollers for my waist length hair and rollers were small, I would&#x27;ve purchased two sets and used the larger rollers.</li>
            <li> They have taken the place of my previous sets.</li>
            <li> , I previously gave these curlers a very-high ranking.  </li>
            <li> previous reviews were correct when relating that the rollers were not held in place by the clips&lt;</li>
            <li> I had my previous version of the \\&quot;Remington</li>
            <li> This was never a problem with the previous set</li>
            <li> but in a black case.  </li>
            <li> and it takes up less space and takes much less time.  </li>
            <li> Even when I curled less hair around the roller, the clip would not hold the roller in, and I am returning the product.</li>
            <li> If you use 8-10 they give you curls, less you get waves and less just body.</li>
            <li> so I can have all black.</li>
            <li> You can get a bag of those for less than $5 bucks.</li>
            <li> The black ones seemed to work</li>
            <li> these rollers curled half of my hair.  </li>
            <li> and they have also slightly changed the clip shape.  </li>
            <li> Had to give it one star; couldn&#x27;t give it less.  </li>
            <li> When I roll up my hair which is shoulder length I have slightly burnt my finger tips from the heat.</li>
            <li> I do use the black ones for the shorter part of my hair.  </li>
            <li> If I could give them less than one star, I would.</li>
            <li> Within seconds of putting the large rollers in my hair, the clip flies out of my hair and ends up on the other side of the room...very frustrating to say the least!</li>
            <li> You do need to push the curlers down on the heating platform as they loosen a little.  </li>
            <li> The claim that the rollers heat up in 90 seconds is just not true.</li>
            <li> the clips are too small to even hold an empty roller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my hair since I was 12, and have used several roller sets for updos and this is one of two that is just no good.</li>
            <li> With long thick hair I have never had a problem with clips falling out after rolling.  </li>
            <li> My friend, who has thick, long hair, raved about these curlers.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and ordered two.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that would NEVER hold a curl before I found these.</li>
            <li> curlers have to be pushed down firmly into their sockets.</li>
            <li> So now, after using them, I close the &amp;#34;lid&amp;#34; and push them all down firmly with the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want a tight curl</li>
            <li> My curls are not too tight and hold all day.  </li>
            <li> Can wind-up hair tight</li>
            <li> If I need tight curls, I&#x27;ll use these rollers  guess.</li>
            <li> To my surprise I had a mass of tight curls!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you feel the curls are too tight, run your fingers through your hair/flip your head over/brush it.</li>
            <li> These rollers were too small and too slim for long thick hair, even though other reviews said otherwise.</li>
            <li> Because I have very long, thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and thick and the clasps will not hold the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> I can see how one could easily make the mistake of not pushing each roller correctly all the way into the base, therefore not heating the roller.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and even when I would roll just a small section of it up in one these within five to ten seconds</li>
            <li> They are essentially a single piece of thick wire (not an exaggeration) that is supposed to keep all your hair on the roller.</li>
            <li> after leaving the heated curlers in my hair for maybe 10 minutes, I take them out, scrunch in a little product, give it a spray &amp; voila...</li>
            <li> take a chance on the little EMI</li>
            <li> When there is even a little hair on the curler, the &amp;#34;backing off&amp;#34; happens almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I also like the little pouches for the wire clips.  </li>
            <li> You have to move a little bit when you do that.  </li>
            <li> The rollers heat up in their little case.  </li>
            <li> Those little metal pins do not hold the curlers in place, they fall out and while you try to catch the curler you burn yourself.</li>
            <li> You just leave them in the little plastic pack.</li>
            <li> The little metal things do not work at all.</li>
            <li> While these curlers are not the jumbo-size, they still do well in my volume-less hair to give me a little body.  </li>
            <li> Luv these little puppies.</li>
            <li> Just what I need for a little curl at home or when traveling.  </li>
            <li> I think ONE got a little warmish...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike other rollers I&#x27;ve purchased in the past</li>
            <li> This product must be very cheaply made and I am very disappointed that I spent any money on these rollers!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they managed it, but there is zero wasted space in this compact little curler set.  </li>
            <li> Heavy, hard to get them to stay in place and awkward, takes too long to work and the result doesn&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use these pins because I never have before, but after one use I got the hang of using them and really like them a lot.</li>
            <li> This is a big disappointment because I wanted the second pair</li>
            <li> but, if you were looking for something that heats up much quicker than that, these might be a disappointment to you.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the diameter of the rollers of the set are also relatively narrow, so they couldn&#x27;t have created the look</li>
            <li> I ended up being so dissatisfied that I left this roller set behind in the hotel.</li>
            <li> Remington, you&#x27;re dead to me.</li>
            <li> Clips do not fit curlers.</li>
            <li> I keep one set in my travel bag and one in my bathroom for everyday use.</li>
            <li> and so a few weeks ago a friend let me borrow her set for my birthday, just to see what they would do for my hair.  </li>
            <li> The rollers (which are fairly heavy) immediately fall out.</li>
            <li> I doubt my hair will hold up for longer than a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give this product a thumbs up for travel, but wouldn&#x27;t use them everyday.  </li>
            <li> Once the rollers are in place, all twenty of them from the two sets I bought, they are quite heavy.  </li>
            <li> Once the rollers are in place, all twenty of them from the two sets I bought, they are quite heavy.  </li>
            <li> I used it a few times</li>
            <li> Not only do the rollers fall out without warning, but it&#x27;s not uncommon for the clips to jettison across the room.</li>
            <li> Remington \\&quot;All That\\&quot; curlers are heavy, ceramic (or cermanic-like) and they come in a compact case.</li>
            <li> Just enough for thin medium length hair.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I have yet to have a problem with the curlers not heating up.</li>
            <li> of the reviews have mentioned that a few of the rollers wouldn&#x27;t heat up.  </li>
            <li> They heat unevenly.</li>
            <li> so I need just a few electric curlers.</li>
            <li> Would return, but I&#x27;ve used them a few times now.</li>
            <li> ( I might been impatient &amp; didn&#x27;t want to wait.....</li>
            <li> The clips do not fit the rollers, so they just spring out of the rolled hair.</li>
            <li> I have a set for home that I use everyday.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one so that I could keep one in my luggage for traveling and one at home for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> The pins that hold the rollers do not fit it and will not stay in your hair.  </li>
            <li> These clips are too narrow so that they all shoot off the rollers once put</li>
            <li> This wa a waste of money</li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t think the performance of the curlers aren&#x27;t to blame, I do think it can take a few practice runs to get used to these curlers.</li>
            <li> I sometimes had trouble getting the pins to hold the rollers in my hair.</li>
            <li> A waste of money but what can you expect for the price.</li>
            <li> The rollers heat unevenly.  </li>
            <li> and I can have my dried hair styled in literally 6-7 minutes and out the door.</li>
            <li> but I left them behind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rollers themselves are a bit heavy and prone to pull at hair if not put in</li>
            <li> These are way too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> Convenient size for everyday use and for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Biggest problem I had is they would not stay in your hair, they are heavy and</li>
            <li> wastes some time</li>
            <li> would hesitate about recommending these, as I will soon be replacing the set I purchased just a few months ago.</li>
            <li> but I use them everyday myself.  </li>
            <li> The clips do not fit the curlers</li>
            <li> The pins do not fit the rollers and pop out of your hair immediately.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them for everyday.</li>
            <li> There are a few \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; on the rollers &amp; the hair does hold, just wind your hair around the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;The metal clips work &amp;hold the hair in place</li>
            <li> If you have trouble using the pins, this set would probably work with clip style pins.</li>
            <li> I also felt they dried out my hair&lt;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s irritating but not enough for me to return them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they are heavy.</li>
            <li> my hair would spit them out because it was too heavy for the curler to hold.</li>
            <li> believe me this is a waste of time.</li>
            <li> It was not a huge investment</li>
            <li> I have to use in a small room because when they let loose, it is like a projectile and hard to find the pins ....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have this problem with the small, black curlers.  </li>
            <li> They are hot to the touch...and nearly impossible to hold while you are trying to put them in your hair.  </li>
            <li> sie\\&quot; of curls (as other reviews have complained about)</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few sets of these over the past few years and given them away as gifts.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are a little small.  </li>
            <li> a little too small.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t curl for very long, takes a while (at least 15 minutes) to heat up, have to leave in hair for at least 15 minutes&lt;</li>
            <li> Heats up quick enough, convenient size, BUT the clips that &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; the curlers on are awful!  </li>
            <li> BUT I NEED A FEW SMALL CLIPS  </li>
            <li> A small neat travellling  item,the rollers heat up within a few minutes and have efficient curling effect,</li>
            <li> My sister has long, thin hair and the  curls just wouldn&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li> She is also wearing the longest false eyelashes I have seen which is about 1.5 inches long.</li>
            <li> , the curlers are uncomfortable due to their hard rubber spikes, and those in the back tend to fall out of my hair onto the floor.</li>
            <li> I either can&#x27;t handle them, they burn my scalp, or result in  very tight, frizzy curls.</li>
            <li> Miserable experience when a hot roller hits your bare foot because the pins don&#x27;t hold.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed at how well this little hairsetter works!  </li>
            <li> It takes up very little room in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> The case is compact and they take up very little room in a suitcase.  </li>
            <li> Takes up very little room in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> It takes up very little room on my counter or in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> They take very little time to heat up (about two minutes).  </li>
            <li> My previous rollers also had the wire clips, so I wasn&#x27;t worried about that; however, these clips are VERY small and the clips for the larger-size rollers will NOT hold the roller in no matter what I do.</li>
            <li> The medium are small.</li>
            <li> I use it to do small jobs - like side curls or ends.  </li>
            <li> Not satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> (I have used curlers in the past where that hasn&#x27;t been the case).</li>
            <li> The small compact design allows my wife to take these anywhere and curl her hair while on vacation or even at work.</li>
            <li> I tried to return these rollers because they were not dual heat and too small.  </li>
            <li> And my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls even for a few hours!</li>
            <li> I needed a small roller set to take when I travel.  </li>
            <li> know every trick in the book for keeping these type of fasteners in - and these are just too small for the curlers.  </li>
            <li> clips are too small for rollers</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that this curlers past any tests regarding the Clips.</li>
            <li> Firstly..there are no large..just five medium...and five small ones that are too small to be of any use.  </li>
            <li> Small size</li>
            <li> This set is small and packs well, but I had problems with the set.</li>
            <li> so it usually doesn&#x27;t hold curl.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I would recommend them to everyone.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I started off thinking that I was doing something wrong, since the rollers would simply not stay in my hair and the pin would come flying off within a couple minutes of me placing it.  </li>
            <li> I used these rollers one time and the next day I plugged it in to heat up, but they were already broken!  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I just have to on this product.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is the rings are difficult to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Like the convenience of a small set of rollers.</li>
            <li> No more Conair for me.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if I would like the product,  </li>
            <li> These work, but they are heavy and do not hold thick hair into place well.</li>
            <li> I returned these rollers because they were too small for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, lightweight and I like how it curls my hair.  </li>
            <li> My wife has used this product in the past.</li>
            <li> This one has two small pockets on the inside of the front cover to store your clips for it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how small this set of rollers is.</li>
            <li> THEY WORK unbelievably WELL.  </li>
            <li> - however the clips were too small for the rollers</li>
            <li> Not many.</li>
            <li> what a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> The rollers are so slick they will not cling to the hair.</li>
            <li> They pop out shortly after rolling your hair.and as a result are totally useless.</li>
            <li> I can usually get it</li>
            <li> They are too small.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m now past the return period with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> They are so slick that they don&#x27;t catch the ends, and with my shoulder length hair, when I try to tighten them for rolling, they slip out.  </li>
            <li> The pins that hold them in your hair seemed to be too small and the rollers kept poping out.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something small and functional...</li>
            <li> not sure...</li>
            <li> This curler set replaced a small Conair jumbo set I have had for years before it tried to burn up.  </li>
            <li> medium&amp;#34; ones are actually small.  </li>
            <li> I have thick coarse, long hair, that is usually very difficult to curl.</li>
            <li> I would call them medium and small.  </li>
            <li> (They aren&#x27;t too small.)  </li>
            <li> Small size&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the clip, or the material the rollers have over them.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a trip, and I have ended up using them everyday since!</li>
            <li> I needed something compact and small that works and these do.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re meant to be heated inside the case, which has two small front pockets to hold the clips</li>
            <li> I will give the small one away.</li>
            <li> The traveling case - small, compact, lightweight.  </li>
            <li> didnt realize they were so small</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened to them, but the clips are either the wrong size or made differently</li>
            <li> Initially I bought a curling iron but that was difficult to use.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not completely sure of that.  </li>
            <li> I would have described them as small and medium size rollers.</li>
            <li> If someone doesn&#x27;t happen to have an extra set on hand....  very frustrating.</li>
            <li> and they work quite well to hold these very heavy rollers.  </li>
            <li> Made sense to me that the large rollers then needed larger clips and I found them on evil bay for a couple of bucks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused from the responses from other users whether or not it has dual voltage......</li>
            <li> Not a big deal but a little inconvenient</li>
            <li> Only downside is that the clips are awful, and do not hold for me, perhaps the weight of my hair is too much?  </li>
            <li> Clips don&#x27;t hold real tight but they do in a pinch.</li>
            <li> And while you&#x27;re working with a brush/comb with one hand trying to pop a roller out with the other hand is difficult too, because the rollers are too tight on the heating posts.  </li>
            <li> I have long, very thick hair!</li>
            <li> have medium length hair (down to my shoulders), and my hair is very thick.</li>
            <li> game as the clip flew out of your head after less than 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> have very thin long hair.</li>
            <li> The rollers were very small, they are small and medium sized.</li>
            <li> Very hard to keep on your head,quite heavy too, keeps falling off.</li>
            <li> Really hard to get the pins to stay sometimes.</li>
            <li> They are hard to align and keep in your hair.</li>
            <li> it is hard to keep the hair and the curlers together as there</li>
            <li> They tend to slip/fly off across the room making it hard to put them in.</li>
            <li> Hard to keep pins in.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to hold them and put them in.  </li>
            <li> Find roller holders don&#x27;t work too well  --- I would prefer something that wasn&#x27;t all a hard plastic to stay in your hair easier</li>
            <li> How hard can it be for the manufacturer to use a functional design?</li>
            <li> They do not take hardly any space at all.</li>
            <li> Way too hard to use.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because the reviews were so high on&lt;br</li>
            <li> and when I tried these on my friend (who has thick and hard to curl hair) it was a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> If I could give these negative stars, I would.  </li>
            <li> (the company that makes this product) and complained about the structure of this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  I contacted Remington by email in late November.  </li>
            <li> too late to return now.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them at least twice weekly all this time.</li>
            <li> The rollers are fantastic but the clips are awful.</li>
            <li> i guess it is to late</li>
            <li> Its too late for me to return them now, so I will be using hair clips instead.</li>
            <li> THIS SUCKS.</li>
            <li> I would need 4 sets to curl my hair, and my hair loses curl after an hour.</li>
            <li> but I use the plastic hair clips that stylists use to hold sections of your hair back while they&#x27;re cutting.  </li>
            <li> product sucks.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The clip slowly slides away from the curler until it pops/flies off, and the curler drops out of the hair.  </li>
            <li> but it was very frizzy and annoying.</li>
            <li> Leave in for 5 min for increased volume and 10-15 for CURLS, in my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair, but alot of it, and I struggle to keep the rollers in until I have the desired curl.</li>
            <li> The clips will dig into your poor scalp as well, and the way they hold the curlers, causes the already heavy curlers to pull at your hair.  </li>
            <li> The cross-clips are absolutely 100% worthless.</li>
            <li> The clips slowly slide off and go flying across the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this still curled it well.</li>
            <li> Now I have shoulder length, thick hair</li>
            <li> and I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and the hooks come off the roller.  </li>
            <li> I have thick medium/long hair</li>
            <li> You can watch it slowly slip out and drop to floor.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my hair is too thick</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these products work well with thick hair.</li>
            <li> have thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick shoulder-length hair</li>
            <li> The plus is they DO stay in my thick, unruly hair</li>
            <li> I do not have particularly thick hair</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re reading this and you&#x27;re a fellow tightwad with thick hair.....</li>
            <li> also found rollers difficult to keep in place, certainly not like ones I had some years</li>
            <li> Not very happy with these rollers.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I have long, VERY thick hair, and I assumed I would need at least two sets of rollers.</li>
            <li> The packaging is small, convenient and compact!</li>
            <li> I could not believe how small the case was for 12 curlers!</li>
            <li> Not sure why I ever got rid of it!  </li>
            <li> The small case is so convenient to take along with you and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space!</li>
            <li> Anyways after the curling iron failure,  found these curlers on amazon.</li>
            <li> If you have very thin hair, then I don&#x27;t know what to suggest other than returning them and finding another option.  </li>
            <li> Very small and compact.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, and left them at the last hotel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very small</li>
            <li> Would return but shipping gets expensive and not worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a very small, compact set.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Revlon, these are worthless with the new dots of rubber on the clips.  </li>
            <li> but I seriously need another set to cover my head.</li>
            <li> ridiculous.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thin that it&#x27;s hard to get it curled</li>
            <li> Because of that problem I am not using the rollers anymore and had a bad experience during my last trip.</li>
            <li> I only have 2 bad things about them that I can deal with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good at physics, but that doesn&#x27;t seem like it would work.</li>
            <li> they would slip out and the  compactness with cord is not good.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased these curlers, just putting them in my hair was painful.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the rollers were so heavy</li>
            <li> direct- and the sales rep didn&#x27;t mention that, which was annoying.)</li>
            <li> It was painful to leave them on while I applied makeup because they weigh down and pull your hair down!</li>
            <li> But the design is horrible and the clips slip right off.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in my Remington Ceramic Hot Rollers.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure all the curlers are pushed fully into the base since the heat transfers from the connection at the base of each curler.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in myself for buying these dang things when all the reviewers were only speaking the truth.</li>
            <li> Worst hot rollers ever.</li>
            <li> Negative 10 fits!  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to get the clip</li>
            <li> I hated when they went to a new cheaper version of clips that made you play the &amp;#34;find the clip and curler&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and have a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, so I ordered 2 packs</li>
            <li> I have very thick shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t straighten your hair before hand (even if you have bad frizz like me) because it makes it harder to re-curl.</li>
            <li> They are too thin and flimsy and slip off the curler within moments of putting them in.  </li>
            <li> , I had to give a poor review as flocked rollers have spoiled me.  </li>
            <li> I think they just needed to be \\&quot;broken in\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Seems like someone made a poor cost-cutting decision</li>
            <li> Seems like someone made a poor cost-cutting decision</li>
            <li> Using this was a highly frustrating experience.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> which was frustrating.</li>
            <li> Not happy with product.  </li>
            <li> Thin</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and</li>
            <li> For international travel, I use just one base.</li>
            <li> I thought the reviewers who complained about his were silly because I had a set</li>
            <li> Alas, not my face.</li>
            <li> Worse, the clips flew around like lost birds, and I had to spend a lot of time searching for them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had, the plastic lid has cracked and broken off with repeated suitcase usage no matter</li>
            <li> It is so frustrating.  </li>
            <li> hair is thin and frizzy</li>
            <li> Then I started taking them out in the approximate order</li>
            <li> One of the clips flew behind my radiator.</li>
            <li> Since I have relatively thin hair, 10 rollers does the trick.  </li>
            <li> but then my hair is thin.  </li>
            <li> These rollers are so slippery and rubbery that it was nearly impossible to roll that one half.  </li>
            <li> They are ridiculously compact(great for travel!)</li>
            <li> But the new ones are absolutely horrible.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the clips are terrible!!  </li>
            <li> Two of the prongs on one side and one of the prongs on the other no longer heat the rollers, which is inconvenient and disappointing.</li>
            <li> It was incredibly frustrating, needless to say..</li>
            <li> This set is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the breakdown of rollers themselves is not ideal for someone looking for additional body and bounce.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers that the curler clips are worthless</li>
            <li> I did check that I was clicking the curler into the prong base, but no dice; it wasn&#x27;t the curler itself because I heated them successfully on other prongs.</li>
            <li> I got very frustrated and ended up flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> Too bad Remington doesn&#x27;t &#x27;t sell small rollers separately.</li>
            <li> I threw these in the trash because I was so mad that I had to go out to a function with my hair not done thanks to these awful rollers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and am sending it back immediately.</li>
            <li> This is just a bad design for hair like mine (thick, shoulder length).  </li>
            <li> These rollers are useless.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t ever be sorry if you get these.</li>
            <li> The 2nd one was terrible. .</li>
            <li> clips are practically useless.</li>
            <li> useless.</li>
            <li> Did you send me wrong model?  </li>
            <li> The metal clips that come with the set are relatively useless.  </li>
            <li> I hear that this sucker was compact, but I was shocked when i saw the teeny amazon box show up today.  </li>
            <li> I have a difficult time getting these to stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> The pins are the wrong size and must be defective.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately they did not work for me.</li>
            <li> unit is useless in UK as it cannot be connected to electrical power points.</li>
            <li> There is the tiniest bit of rubber tip now which is useless to hold the clip on the curler.</li>
            <li> Without the clips, these curlers are really useless</li>
            <li> The pins are useless and do not do any work.</li>
            <li> Just seems like the wrong sizes were sent.  </li>
            <li> Remington --- fix your poorly designed product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> wrong I was.  </li>
            <li> I think that they are a better/stronger metal too but have no way of knowing because they are useless.  </li>
            <li> It is useless.</li>
            <li> Useless .</li>
            <li> They have also moved the clip pockets to the front of the holder to reduce heating of the clips which could be uncomfortable to handle.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I gave one of these sets as a gift</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my hair will still not hold a curl, and it&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault; I&#x27;ve been trying to get my hair to hold a curl since I could curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they are not convenient to travel with.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, Remington...</li>
            <li> Very frustrating and makes them useless.</li>
            <li> The clips are very poorly designed and do not hold the rollers in place.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> It was very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I guess my hair is very thin-</li>
            <li> Very frustrating experience.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> so I have to give it a very poor rating and review.</li>
            <li> Now I have a spare base and case, and a bunch of small rollers that I add in sometimes.</li>
            <li> So disappointed that this company is not standing behind its product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a random bad one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A bit disappointing.  </li>
            <li> curlers were a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The rest were cold to lukewarm.</li>
            <li> The edges of the rollers are cold to the touch, and won&#x27;t burn your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is infuriating.</li>
            <li> Horrible, for a &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; set, the rollers are heavy.</li>
            <li> but these rollers drive me crazy.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get all crazy brushing through it, tousle with your fingers.</li>
            <li> Would have given it a lower rating but cutting the product some slack because it could be my hair that is the problem.</li>
            <li> After having remington travel  rollers for twenty years l do find these disappointing one thing they have a two pip pluge,and the clips do not grip the hair.</li>
            <li> Product deemed useless!</li>
            <li> Sorry I had to give this set 1 star!  </li>
            <li> Was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed!</li>
            <li> And the stupid PINS to hold your hair in place are so silly.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> The roller had a rubber type finish that your hair does not grab onto and they are very difficult to roll.</li>
            <li> very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The clips that come with the rollers make it very difficult to keep the rollers in at all.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to roll the hair around them....</li>
            <li> all day- nearly impossible to do otherwise!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is impossible to use.</li>
            <li> My bad...</li>
            <li> Too bad Remington doesn&#x27;t offer it this way, but if they can sell two sets instead of one I guess they have no incentive.  </li>
            <li> Really bad</li>
            <li> it was a bad buy  </li>
            <li> Roll these bad boys in your hair, go do your makeup</li>
            <li> of the bad clips.........</li>
            <li> If your hair is bad at holding curls...</li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> bad.</li>
            <li> I am so frustrated with these roller clips, hooks, loops, whatever they are called.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Extremely disappointed and frustrated</li>
            <li> I really hate these rollers - very frustrating as they fall out the minute you put them in - I had forgotten I had already written this!  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately they were terrible!</li>
            <li> I found this set to be virtually unusable and was extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> But the clips spring off the rollers and the rollers fall out of your hair. :-(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had neither and am quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> These just didn&#x27;t work on my hair :(</li>
            <li> I used hair spray as well. :(</li>

            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This product was very disappointing.  </li>

            <li> Very frustrating!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These rollers are useless. They heat unevenly and the pins for the larger rollers aren&#x27;t sized correctly so they pop out. Off to the trash they go.</li>
            <li> impressive package. Extremely compact and effective. Heats  up quickly and does the job very well.</li>
            <li> The worst thing I ever bought!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t hold a curl.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed and frustrated</li>
            <li> These curlers take a little longer to heat than advertised but are worth the wait. Just be sure to apply the curlers in the direction that you want your  hair to go.A  excellent addition  to my hair arsenal. You will get smooth nice curls when used properly.</li>
            <li> This product is terrific -easy to use, quick heating and a perfect size for travel - just as effective as any larger, more expensive types.</li>
            <li> I have used these Remington curlers for many years and was always satisfied and would purchase them about once every two years.  For some unknown reason they have shortened the clips on the larger curlers (red) and as other reviewers have mentioned, you put one in and by the time you are on the second curl the first one is sliding off your head ... and then you need to search all over the floor to find the clip!  What used to be the best curler set I could find are now a source of frustration.  Also, there are always 1 or 2 curlers that stay less than &#x27;tepid&#x27; and never do get hot.  I wish Remington would read these complaints and make the necessary changes.  Meanwhile has anyone else found a better set of curlers?</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for Asian hair.</li>
            <li> Awful! The pins do not stay in place, they are popping out as soon as your wrap your hair around them. The &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; is more like a medium and the &amp;#34; meduim&amp;#34;  is a small!! Buy something else, I will be going back to my Conair</li>
            <li> These rollers do not work at all for short hair!  The videos on Youtube for short hair show a girl with hair below her shoulders, i don&#x27;t consider that short hair.  The clips are very poorly designed and do not hold the rollers in place.  Since the rollers do not have any teeth they just slip right out of your hair before you can put the next one in.  what a piece of *^%$# product!</li>
            <li> I like using curlers since it cuts down the amount of time spent curling (vs. curling iron), but I would say I still get better results from a curling iron.  They are nice and compact and travel well though!</li>
            <li> I was content with the product it gets really hot and doesn&#x27;t take much to curl my hair. I am a mixed african america and native indian female so my hair is very thick and somewhat in between coarse and fine. I love the rollers lock the curls in place and it heats up pretty fast. The storage its in could use alittle upgrade its not plastic at all however U get your money worth</li>
            <li> This is a great size and heats up quickly, but the roller clips for the big rollers don&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
            <li> This baffles me; the large rollers are not that large, actually they are medium. The medium are small. This set heats up extremely well, and yes it delivers what it says. However noted; all of the rollers need to be large. Guess I&#x27;ll have to get another set, and add the large to my first set, then give the second set with all mediums to my friend that has shorter hair... perfect plan.</li>
            <li> These hit up really fast and travel well for business trips without taking too much space. Plus, according to my boyfriend, I have supermodel hair after using these! Always a plus!</li>
            <li> I have short and thick hair and the clips did not hold nor were they easy to handle.</li>
            <li> First time user with the rollers and I was at first disappointed at the low level of heat  they absorbed. Found out it was my error and now I love them</li>
            <li> I use it to do small jobs - like side curls or ends.  Or use both sets together and roll my whole head - I have waist length hair.  It DOESN&amp;#34;T tangle.  The Ionic ceramic really works. Highly recommend.  Had my first one 2 years just got the 2nd one to make rolling my hair up for a stage production quicker.</li>
            <li> Awesome, easy to use!</li>
            <li> If I could give these negative stars, I would.  These are the worst electric curlers I have ever purchased.  They will not stay in your hair, even if you only put a few strands of hair in each roller.  I spend more time chasing the curlers and hooks around my bathroom than anything else.  Worst purchase I have ever made.</li>
            <li> I have had a set of these rollers for literal decades.  The curlers are just fine and heat perfectly.  The problem is the clips. NONE of the clips hold the curlers in place!!!  The clip slowly slides away from the curler until it pops/flies off, and the curler drops out of the hair.  That makes the curlers pretty useless, even if they heat well.  The only way to use the new set of curlers is with my very old clips.  If someone doesn&#x27;t happen to have an extra set on hand....  very frustrating.</li>
            <li> They would work much better if only they would stay in.  A few more grips on the roller itself would make a huge difference.  At this point I am ready to return them, after picking them up off the floor many times in a row.</li>
            <li> This purchase was a replacement for the exact same model I bought 20 years ago and lost in a recent move.  The new model is as good as the old one, the curlers heat up very quickly and they are easy to put in the hair.  I would give this product a 5 star rating except the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; clips are terrible!!!  They do not hold the curlers on your head!  They are too thin and flimsy and slip off the curler within moments of putting them in.  I never had this problem with my old Remington heated curlers.  Until I figure out what to do, I&#x27;m making do by holding my head very still and only putting two curlers in at a time.  Why make such cheap, flimsy clips for a very good product?</li>
            <li> Even though other reviewers warned me, I ordered this set. Wow. Hate &#x27;em. They don&#x27;t heat quickly, and when they get hot enough to start using, they are too hot to handle. Lucky for me they weren&#x27;t expensive so it&#x27;s not going to hurt so much when I pass them on to a local Battered Women&#x27;s shelter.</li>
            <li> I like this better than a curling iron.  It&#x27;s actually faster!  It takes up very little room in my suitcase. It heats down quickly which my curling iron dose NOT!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried out the rollers yet as I live in the UK and will need to change the plug, but if they&#x27;re anything like the previous (black)set of Remington rollers that I&#x27;ve been using for years, they will be fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not being able to buy these in the UK at all (despite them being dual voltage) I ordered them from Amazon in the US, expecting they would take weeks to arrive.  I was therefore amazed when they arrived within just a few days, so I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This is just a great set of rollers.  I have very long, thick straight hair and wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d get any results, but these rollers did the trick.  They heat up quite fast and are easy to use.  They&#x27;re also very light and compact.</li>
            <li> I love these curlers! I recently took these with me to Costa Rica and they worked marvelously. They were hot in a matter of minutes and kept my hair curly even in Costa Rica&#x27;s humid weather. My only gripe is that I like my hair with big, bouncy curls so I didn&#x27;t use the smaller curlers. I would&#x27;ve preferred just large curlers so I had to wait longer but other than that, excellent travel curler set.</li>
            <li> But I was really looking for Jumbo.  I already had some this size.  My bad... I should have realized large was not jumbo.</li>
            <li> This is my second set of Remington H-1015 hair setters. Gave my first away to a friend who didn&#x27;t mind my few strands in it.  Anyway, I use it all the time, not just for traveling.  The plusses are:  takes up very little room on bathroom countertop, gets hot fast, (be careful with your pinkies), holds hair in curler well, and so more hair can be placed in each curler. Since it does heat up so quickly (and so much), I often leave the top open while heating to allow the top of the rollers to stay somewhat cooler, and easier to remove. This product also curls hair quickly, so be en garde, unless the Shirley Temple look is your thing.&lt;br /&gt; There are some minuses, and for the uninitiated: Doesn&#x27;t work for short hair, and from reading other reviews, very long hair;  but HEY GIRLS there are tons of stylers out there with hugh rollers that I can never use!!! This one is MINE! When my hair has been cut too short, I&#x27;ve just suffered. But Remington, THE BIG MINUS IS the little, bitty, short roller pins you include with the set!!  They just do not work.  They will not keep the curlers in my hair!  I am using ancient, old, longer pins from days gone by.  Please make longer pins again so I will not have to buy them on ebay! Otherwise your product has a love affair with my hair!</li>
            <li> THEY ARE NICE AND EASY TO TRAVEL WITH,  BUT I NEED A FEW SMALL CLIPS  CAN YOU GET THOSE SEPERATE??&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THEM</li>
            <li> Traveled with it the first time and it heated up fast and curls stayed in for days!! Won&#x27;t leave home without it!! Love the product!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these curlers yet. I ordered them for traveling because the ones I have at home are too bulky. But the description says 5 large/ 5 extra large. This is not an accurate description. They are more like medium and small. I use hot curlers to tame my naturally curly hair and need extra large for the top layer of hair and large for the bottom. I can tell these are going to give me those \\&quot;cutesy\\&quot; little curls instead of smooth body. They are the size of all hot curlers from the early 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This item is great for travel and has the same heating results as my regular size hot rollers. Great product!</li>
            <li> This travel size hairsetter is exactly what I was looking for and similar to the Vidal Sassoon one I had purchased years earlier and needed to replace (both curlers are the same size too). The main difference between the two is that this one (Remington) has made room for both sizes to heat up together whereas the one I owned before was only capable of heating up five curlers at a time so you had to do it in stages. The only drawback to this one is they made the metal clip length too short that holds the curler in place so if you have thicker hair they don&#x27;t want to stay on as well. I saved the longer clips from my previous set and use both of them together. This works perfectly. I would suggest to the company to make their clips about an inch longer and it would fit all hair types. This hairsetter is very compact for all it holds and warms up quickly, and does a great job giving my hair a controlled curl. I use the bigger curlers more than the smaller ones and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible product. My hair has never looked better. My mother asked me the other day if I&#x27;d gotten a hairweave!  (I haven&#x27;t)  She didn&#x27;t believe me when I said no. These heat up quickly, they don&#x27;t burn my skin like my old heated curlers, and don&#x27;t damage my hair. The best part is the package is so small I can easily travel with them. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because of the clips. On the larger curlers, they keep slipping off, so I am constantly readjusting them. I put up with it because the results are so fantastic.  I&#x27;ve put away my curling iron.</li>
            <li> My 2 daughters want their straight hair curly - fast. This does the trick. Just wish there were a few more actual curlers.</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t get this product in England any more, so my wife insists on getting this product sent over from the U.S.A.  because she obviously prefers it to the current ones available in U.K.</li>
            <li> I love hot rollers and I have used them forever. The set I bought TEN YEARS ago finally crapped out on me so I had to get new ones.  Because I have very long, thick hair I decided to buy two sets of these, and I&#x27;m glad I did because I definitely need both of them.  I like the compact design, thats about the only good thing I can say about these.  My previous rollers also had the wire clips, so I wasn&#x27;t worried about that; however, these clips are VERY small and the clips for the larger-size rollers will NOT hold the roller in no matter what I do. The directions say they heat up in 90 seconds - oh no they don&#x27;t.  The first time I used them I let them warm up for 3-4 minutes before I used them, and they did nothing.  The second time I used them I let them warm up for about 30 minutes. They worked better that time but still not great.  They really don&#x27;t get hot enough to do what I want them to do, and one set of them gets much hotter than the other.  My hair had curl but it was very frizzy and annoying. I will be returning both sets of these.</li>
            <li> I was looking into buying the Conair travel set and really wanted to buy it so I could style my hair with the rollers immediately so I went to Walmart instead of buying it on Amazon. They ended up not having the Conair at the store but they did have this Remington set. I quickly searched on Amazon for the reviews and all the recent reviews were complaining about the clips not staying on the rollers. Well, my desperation, in wanting a new hairstyle immediately, got the best of me and I ended up purchasing this travel set. WARNING: the clips DO NOT stay on the rollers. I am so disappointed in myself for buying these dang things when all the reviewers were only speaking the truth. But stubborn me had to try them out for myself. It took me 40 MINUTES to do my hair this morning because I couldn&#x27;t just put the clips in, I had to hold the rollers in place. When I did use the clips I would roll my hair around the roller, clip it, &amp; remove my hand. Seriously not 5 seconds later the clips would shoot straight off the roller like a rocket. After the fourth time this happened I got on the phone &amp; called 1-800-392-6544 (the company that makes this product) and complained about the structure of this product. This is the reason I gave it two stars &amp; not one, when I talked to a representative in the product complaint department, he told me that they are aware of the issue and have started to make better clips. He also offered to send me better clips. I would have accepted although the rollers are just too small for my hair &amp; there aren&#x27;t enough - I can do half of my hair with all of the rollers but when I take them out, I have to wait for them to heat up again before I can finish the other half of my hair. I&#x27;m sure this is great for traveling but for day-to-day use, it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I bought this set of rollers for travel and they are just what I wanted.  The entire set is very compact, unlike the larger sets I usually use at home.  They get hot enough and are in many ways comparable to any full set.  I would recommend these to those who travel.  They really solved a problem that I had had with needing to set my hair while traveling.</li>
            <li> i found extreme displeasure with this product. apon incertion of the rollers, i was severly burned.i decided to forgo the pain and use them anyways.however when i took them out,my hair was crispy and not curled at all.it looked like a rats nest. thanks to these hair rollers i no longer have a boyfriend, and most of my remaining hair is severly damaged.</li>
            <li> the clips don&#x27;t hold ... they pop off</li>
            <li> While compact, light weight and small-sized for travel, I had to give a poor review as flocked rollers have spoiled me.  This Remington ceramic set got so hot that I could barely stand to touch them to wind up my hair.  Also the smoother ceramic surface meant that the rollers did not grasp the hair strands as they are wound.  And the clips weren&#x27;t enough to keep the rollers in place and they flopped.  This not only created a flatter overall look, but the hot rollers were now sending heat to my forehead instead of my hair.  In addition, the diameter of the rollers of the set are also relatively narrow, so they couldn&#x27;t have created the look I was after anyway.  I should have been able to figure the last part out, but I was hopeful as the overall dimension was about what I wanted for my small suitcase.  I ended up being so dissatisfied that I left this roller set behind in the hotel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these rollers by Remington before for many years, &amp; because they were worn, old and beat up, I felt it was time for a new set, so I went with my tried and true Remington brand. I still love the rollers, they heat up great, and are the perfect size, it just that this time the little plastic finishing tips on the end of the pins have pretty much all fallen off already in the short time that I have had these:-( It is frustrating as this had happened to my original set, it just took a longer time for that to happen, and when you try to use them now, the pins pull your hair and scrape your scalp, so I ended up having to use my butterfly clamp clips instead which work because it&#x27;s fine for at home, but when you travel would not be convenient, because you don&#x27;t want to travel with too much bulk, so I&#x27;ll have to buy some more pins now. I suppose this is something that happens a lot with hot roller sets &amp; needs to be perfected. Anyway, it is still a great set &amp; a good price too, so just be prepared if you get them to deal with replacing the pins.</li>
            <li> I had my eyes on these rollers for a while and they came highly recommended but unfortunately they were terrible! I have medium length, fine hair yet these clips couldn&#x27;t stay in place or hold the weight of the roller. It was incredibly frustrating, needless to say.. item was returned.</li>
            <li> I have used these rollers (same brand) for many many years.  I just purchased two new sets, because I have dropped the others so much that the ends are broke off most of them.  They can still be used, but I wanted to get new ones.  They simply never wear out.  I have had the other two sets for 20+ years.  I always get two because I need the large rollers, so I take the large ones from one set to make a whole set of large ones.  They are so inexpensive that it&#x27;s not a problem to do this.  You won&#x27;t ever be sorry if you get these.</li>
            <li> Love the size. Can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li> Wish these had worked for me, as I love the compact size and I have fine hair, so I don&#x27;t need as many curlers. However, only 4 of the 10 rollers heated up- the remaining six didn&#x27;t.  Remington, you&#x27;re dead to me.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product, i gave few sets to my friends, they are really satisfied. you only need 3-5 mins, it become really hot...and the curls last very long. unfortunately the roller are not big enough and the pin doesnt hold your hair securely...i suggest to use another hair clip which is also from remington.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional hair stylist and I do a lot of photo shoots on set. I have to do hair quickly! If I can shave off time and have the make up artist do her/his job while I&#x27;m doing my job, that means I can be on set for a shorter amount of time. Time &#x3D; Money in this industry and these rollers are a life saver. First thing I do, before the model gets into my chair... plug the rollers in. I set up my station, talk to the photographer, prep the models hair, by the time I&#x27;m ready for my rollers, they&#x27;re good to go. They get *HOT* but not too hot (which, I have burned my fingers a lot, so I can take more heat than most people), they are very easy to use, they stay put. While they&#x27;re setting the hair, the make up person does their job. And I just finish up within minutes after they&#x27;re done! And the curls are SO PRETTY, and they stay! They won&#x27;t stay as long as a Marcel curl (not many things can...).</li>
            <li> I had a set of these rollers for years, and loved them and finally wore them out.  I ordered a second set and I&#x27;m so bummed!.  The rollers are the same, but the pins/clips that hold them in are too small.  I roll up a section of hair, stick the pin/clip on, and it slowly just slides right off.  I&#x27;m going to try contacting the company to see if they have any of the old pin/clips, which worked just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I contacted Remington by email in late November.  They promised to send new clips, and told me it would take 7-10 days to get them.  However, it has been more than 30 days now, and the clips still have not arrived.  So disappointed that this company is not standing behind its product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECOND UPDATE: After contacting Remington a second time, they finally shipped new clips.  The clips arrived yesterday, and they are exactly the same as the defective too-small clips that came with the product!  At this point, I don&#x27;t seem to have any options except to return the curlers to Amazon, and look for curlers from a different company.</li>
            <li> for medium length hair there arent enough curlers. They also slip off pretty easily ,and dont stay in place well.</li>
            <li> I love the product.   Use it every day.  The size can&#x27;t be beat for travel. But I needed 10 X-Large rollers, so I bought two Travel setters and in one container put all the X-large rollers.  They fit no problem.  Too bad Remington doesn&#x27;t offer it this way, but if they can sell two sets instead of one I guess they have no incentive.  I was willing to pay the price to get exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product if you are planning to use it in countries with 220v output. This is not dual voltage and you&#x27;d have to use a converter. I&#x27;m very disappointed and am sending it back immediately.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with my first All That hair setter I bought this one to leave at my Dad&#x27;s house so I and others staying at my Dad&#x27;s have this handy hair setter.  It only takes two minutes to heat up.  Great for me I am always in a hurry to get ready and go.  The smooth curlers never get tangled or rip your hair.  Another plus is it does not take up a lot of space.  It is not expensive and does a great job on your hair.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the size of the rollers.  The x-large are more the size of (large) the large are more the size of (medium )...I have very baby fine hair cut into a bob.  These rollers do not stay in even with clips that I purchased extra...On the positive side,  they heat up well and what curlers I could keep in made a wonderful curl, if you are trying for curls.</li>
            <li> Love these.  Small but powerful. I have clips i use when at home but it comes with its own which work fine. Gets hot quick. Make sure the rollers are on the prong so it will get hot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 5-star product with 1-2 star metal hair clips.  The clips don&#x27;t hold to the hair and the rollers continuously fall out.  Remington used to sell this product with snap over plastic clips.  I saved the clips from the older rollers that finally fell apart after years of good service.  Plastic spring clips are available on Amazon.  Great for home or travel. Buy the product, toss the metal clips, and use plastic spring loaded clips.</li>
            <li> I ordered 1 and it worked so well I ordered another.  I wanted enough rollers to do my whole head.   The 2nd one was terrible. . ..5 out of 10 rollers didn&#x27;t get hot.   They&#x27;re very inexpensive but still. . ..they should work.</li>
            <li> these rollers are okay, but not great. I have long hair (upper/middle back) and these rollers are too small and not jumbo like described. They are the medium sized rollers and just do not work with how long my hair is. Also, there is definitely not enough of them either for a full head of hair so I will need to buy 2 or 3 more sets, but I would only buy more if they are actually jumbo sized as stated. Only good for short, thin hair.</li>
            <li> What a great set of 10 electric curlers, complete with coated pins...it takes up little space, its quick heating (but not too hot to touch) &amp; efficient...&amp; it gives my long thin blonde hair a beautiful curl...after leaving the heated curlers in my hair for maybe 10 minutes, I take them out, scrunch in a little product, give it a spray &amp; voila...wavy voluminous gorgeous sexy hip hair...take a chance on the little EMI...happy I did.</li>
            <li> Clips do not fit curlers. They fall out.</li>
            <li> The image is kind of deceiving: the rollers are actually very small and the entire package is quite small as well. This makes it very convenient for travel as it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in your luggage. They do get hot quickly and my curls came out very smooth. It only took about 20 minutes to get medium-tight curls. If these rolls were slightly bigger and all one size, it would have given it a higher rating. For the price and for the convenience, it&#x27;s definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the poster \\&quot;sweatpea\\&quot; for her tip to buy a 2nd set and use all one size (the larger). Really works well. I&#x27;ve used many sets of hot rollers since they came out and these are as good as any and better than a lot of them out there. They do not tangle in my hair at all, the edges are just different in heat enough that I can handle them without ever feeling like my fingers are going to burn. The only real complaints I have is that the clips are short so if, like me, you like to put more than the recommended amount (2\\&quot;) of your hair in each roller then you will have to spend time &amp; effort messing with re-setting the clip. I don&#x27;t want a tight curl so that&#x27;s why I put more hair in than just 2\\&quot;, which brings me to my other \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; which is that these are referred to as jumbo &amp; super jumbo (or large and super large, don&#x27;t recall right now) but trust me, the \\&quot;super\\&quot; are just regular large curlers...same size as every \\&quot;large\\&quot; I&#x27;ve ever used in many other sets of hot rollers.... All in all I highly recommend these, they travel really really well, super compact, take very little room. Price is right... I also recommend the company I got them through here on Amazon which is Shaver Outlet...both sets I ordered arrived within a couple days for no extra money.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.</li>
            <li> They are great,I have a problem with curling my hair, with Remington rollers it takes just minutes and my hair have great curls. It was also quickly delivered. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Nice compact set but the large clips don&#x27;t hold the larger roller in your hair .. I prefer the metal u shaped clips but the large ones don&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these. I had purchased a different set at a local store, but amazon reviews prompted me to set those aside and order these instead because they heat very quickly. I plugged them in--they heated in about 10 minutes--and then started to roll  my hair. I started with the large curlers, rolled one in, and used the clip. As I started the second curler, the first on fell out. I finished the second, and it fell out almost immediately. The third time, I watched carefully and I could see the clip beginning to pull off of the roller almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon inspection, I saw that the red clips for the large red curlers were a little too small. When you force the clip onto the curler, it is stretched too wide into a V instead of closing back up, and begins to &amp;#34;back off&amp;#34; of the curler. When there is even a little hair on the curler, the &amp;#34;backing off&amp;#34; happens almost immediately. I tried bending the clip wider, but it wasn&#x27;t the correct shape then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller black clips did match the black curlers and would stay tight. But the larger clips would not. This made the curlers completely unusable, since the large curlers are the ones I would use the most. I have written to Remington to ask for a fix, but have not heard from them yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched the web to see if anyone had similar problems, but could not find anything about it.</li>
            <li> These curlers are just perfect for travel and also for home use.  They take up little space and do a great job.  They heat up relatively fast also. I take them on all my trips, even to Europe.</li>
            <li> Really like how hot this product gets- curls last a long time.  Great for travel- lightweight and small case is ideal.  Wish the rollers were bigger in size.  Shipping speed was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I like these rollers alot.  It&#x27;s the perfect size to just add a little curl to my hair and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  I haven&#x27;t travelled with them yet, but the case is sturdy and should travel good.  On my set, it seems like the back row, which is the larger curlers, heats up faster than the front.  It takes about 10 minutes to heat enough to roll my hair.  I would recommend these for anyone who just wants to add a few curls.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair &amp; even with putting my usual styling products in before using these hot rollers I was very disappointed in them. I could not get them to stay in my hair anyway I tried, they kept falling out. Plus they were SO hot against my scalp I couldn&#x27;t stand it &amp; just ended up taking them out (before some fell out on their own). I really liked the \\&quot;travel pack\\&quot; design but I guess I should of known most of the time \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;. I&#x27;m going back to steam rollers such as The Caruso hair setter that always worked for me in the past.</li>
            <li> They did not get very hot and did not work in my hair.  I could only attempt to curl one half of my hair and it didn&#x27;t work.  Not satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> This hair curler set was just what I was looking for.  It curls well and can be used for travel.</li>
            <li> Work well. Really hard to get the pins to stay sometimes.</li>
            <li> The compact hot rollers arrived in perfect condition and fast delivery!  Love Amazon!  saves on gas and stress with shopping store to store.</li>
            <li> I think the product is compact they definetly curled my hair.  I think the clip things could use some work.  maybe I just don&#x27;t know what I am doing with these things.</li>
            <li> The Remington travel set is great.  Many hot roller sets have gone to funky plastic clips to hold the rollers in place, or have changed the shapes to oval rollers.  This set has regular round rollers with metal clips.  They have   a wax core that keeps the rollers hot and the perfect amount of rollers, 5 large and 5 medium.  I keep one set in my travel bag and one in my bathroom for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I already have a set of these hot rollers, but after using then while on a business trip, I&#x27;m ordering another set to use at home.  They heat up in about 5 minutes.  The set is very portable and contains five \\&quot;extra-large\\&quot; and five \\&quot;large\\&quot; rollers.  I think they are more like large and medium, but they do a great job of curling my shoulder length, layered hair.  I really like the clips that came with them too.  Once my hair is set, the rollers stay put until I take them out.  I usually leave them in about 5-10 minutes for medium to loose curls that last all day.  The set is compact too so they fit nicely in a weekend bag, but they&#x27;ll also fit nicely in my overcrowded bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> The clips for the red rollers are too small. Within seconds the clip flies across the room causing the roller to fall to the floor. Completely unusable!</li>
            <li> Bought these for a trip based on positive reviews. I LOVE LOVE LOVE them. Not that expensive, heat up for real in 2 minutes, won&#x27;t burn you and lovely compact packaging. The hype is for real. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The only good thing I have to say about this product is that it&#x27;s dual voltage.  Rollers won&#x27;t stay in my hair.  When I get them to stay the clips won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of the rollers.   They are perfect for anyone that does not use over 10 rollers at a time.   The case is compact and they take up very little room in a suitcase.  My last set lasted for over five years (using them at least once a day).</li>
            <li> I like the curls it does at times. The clips it comes with fall out occasionally.</li>
            <li> liked the size - just what I wanted for travel.  Great except they do not heat up well.  What is the point of being the right size if they don not work?  Very luke-warm.    The above was my ORIGIONAL review.  I think they just needed to be \\&quot;broken in\\&quot;. They are now hot - quickly - and I find them great for traveling - just the right size!</li>
            <li> When purchasing travel rollers I debated between the Conair Jumbo Rollers Instant Heat Travel Hairsetter and these.  In the end I&#x27;m glad I went with the Remington.  There are more rollers in all and the clips can be stored easily with the rollers, as compared to the Conair.  When it arrived I was surprised at how small the set is - about the size of a dollar bill.  Perfect for my carry on.  They do heat up quick!  I would say the 90 seconds is right about on.  My only complaint is the clips are terrible!!  They do not stay put.  With long thick hair I have never had a problem with clips falling out after rolling.  These slip out almost immediately, even after trying half the amount of hair for each roller they slipped.  It&#x27;s as if the clips were not made to have extra room for the hair (if that makes sense) just the roller.  Luckily the heat sets the curl quick and my frustration is short lived.</li>
            <li> These are amazingly effective for the size of the set. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect since I have very long, thick, fine hair. I didn&#x27;t know if there would be enough rollers for the job. They do it and very well.</li>
            <li> I have never used hot curlers before and so a few weeks ago a friend let me borrow her set for my birthday, just to see what they would do for my hair.  I have longer hair and a ton of it, so I just used the curlers on the top and used a regular large barrel curler for the rest.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVED the results.  I thought the somewhat smaller size of the curlers would give me too \\&quot;cute-sie\\&quot; of curls (as other reviews have complained about) but I got gorgeous, magazine-quality, voluminous curls that stayed the whole night through (and heck, they still looked good in the morning!).  I could not WAIT to get a set of my own.  I loved the compact size of the product as I will be doing a TON of traveling, and loved how quickly they got hot and, as I said before, positively loved the results.  Can&#x27;t wait to get mine in the mail and start playing with them some more!!</li>
            <li> These curlers do not curl your hair as quickly as my previous set so need to leave them in longer. Still getting use to them but like them so far.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement set for some Remington hot curlers I owned for many years. The first few times the curlers did not get very hot, but after a few uses they will get hot enough to watch your fingers. The pins are really wimpy and do not hold the curlers well enough in place - one star off for that. I replaced them with some new ones from a beauty supply store. The set is also dual voltage, which is important for me for overseas travel. They are compact for travel and are not very heavy. Would I buy them again? Most definitely! I had researched for a while, before buying this set and did not find anything better for my needs.</li>
            <li> I have an old set if these that have worked great for years.  I ordered a new set for a vacation home and can&#x27;t keep any of the rollers in my hair.  They fly off all over the place.  Very frustrating and makes them useless.</li>
            <li> The compact size is wonderful and the rollers heat up very quickly.  However, dissapointed in the clips for the rollers...they do not hold in place, the curlers drop out in seconds.  I am looking for clamp style clips to replace them.</li>
            <li> I have been using hair rollers for close to 20 years to style my hair and have used so many different brands and am always in search of a good travel set. I found out about these by looking at a couple online reviews. They are fabulous! I wish I would have found out about these sooner. They heat up quickly and really hold the heat a long time. They are so small and compact that you will love the amount of space it saves. I took them with me to Europe and had no issues using them with a plug adapter. I would recommend purchasing an additional set of extra large curlers if you are used to bigger curls. Remember to buy an additional set of clips for them, also. (They aren&#x27;t included- if you purchase from Remington direct- and the sales rep didn&#x27;t mention that, which was annoying.) I did not have any issues with the clips; they stayed in my hair with no problems. If you have to use the additional rollers, they heat up quickly also when you place them on the heating tray. (I have used curlers in the past where that hasn&#x27;t been the case). Seriously, I love these curlers and as someone who is dependent on rollers to style my hair, I put a lot of thought into the brands I purchase. Definitely a good buy!</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s small/portable &amp; good to travel with. It serves the purpose fine. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the clips don&#x27;t fit the rollers all that well. They stay in place...they don&#x27;t slide off...but they don&#x27;t fit that well.</li>
            <li> I just bought this set and you cant beat the price. They heat up fast. Remarkably 10 rollers is just enough. Compact. Love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find enough good things to say about these rollers. I have searched high and low for a way to tame my fine strands without damaging them, and these rollers are a God send.  They heat up in 10 minutes, they get warm enough, but not so hot that you can smell your hair cooking.  The rollers are very gentle, but even still, the curls HOLD all day long which really is most important.    The size of the packaging is definitely convenient for travel, however the set could be improved by adding a few more rollers.  As I said, I have FINE hair and 10 rollers is still not quite enough for my whole head, a dozen at least would have been much better.    That aside, these Remington ceramic rollers are a quality product that will add body, shine and a curl to your tresses without damaging them, they are safe to use every day (I use them almost every day and my hair is very healthy).  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these heat roller sets for years, and the heating elements finally gave out, so I ordered a new set.  Sadly, the clips in the new set, that keep the rollers in the hair, are shorter than the old clips, and the rollers don&#x27;t stay in very well. I wish I hadn&#x27;t gotten rid of the old clips.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great set of rollers.  It&#x27;s just the right size for a full head of hair, to add volume and curl, quickly and easily.  They heat up fast, and curl my hair fast too.  I only leave them on for a few minutes.  I like that the set isn&#x27;t huge, so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space in my bathroom or suitcase.</li>
            <li> The small compact design allows my wife to take these anywhere and curl her hair while on vacation or even at work. Yes, she wears the curlers at work sometimes. She is so ghetto.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the hair setter for myself and my sister since I have had this setter for many years and love it.  It heats up fast and so easy to use.  I recommend it to anyone who needs a quick set on the go setter I am purchasing another one for our motorhome so I will have one there too.</li>
            <li> These rollers are compact and heat up rapidly, and hold the heat well. However, the clips on the larger rollers spring off the roller, and fly across the room! I still haven&#x27;t found one of them. The rollers (which are fairly heavy) immediately fall out. The small roller&#x27;s clips stay in place nicely. So, I can only use the small rollers, and even with my chin length hair, 5 rollers is not enough, so this is going back. If the clips had stayed in place, this would be a 5 star rating. But being able to use only half of the product is disappointing enough to justify the 2 star review.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and have a lot of it.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should get 30 or 20 rollers. However, I decided to go with a smaller one because I just need some volume on top of my hair.  To my surprise I can roll all my hair with these 10 rollers!  My hair length is about collar bone.  If my hair grows much longer and if I need more rollers, I&#x27;ll just buy another set of these.  I paid $14 for a set at Target.  Target has them as &amp;quot;Curl Envy&amp;quot; with the same model number.&lt;br /&gt;By the way when I tried to use them for the first time, I noticed that a couple of rollers were not heating up.  When I take a closer look, I found them just sitting on the plugs.  All rollers need to be snapped into the plugs in order to heat up.  After I fixed that problem, it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/4/2016&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back and forth with this set and Babyliss Jumbo Roller Set.  Babyliss Jumbo Rollers gives waves and blow-dried look. This Remington Compact Rollers give more curls and works better with shorter hair.  However, the Remington rollers are not flocked (note covered with fabric) so they could get very hot.  I unplug the set when I start putting the rollers on.  Still this is a great little set with the biggest bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> I just received these rollers today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try them out.  I used hot rollers every day for years but stopped when I cut my hair short.  I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out and it&#x27;t at that awkward stage where it hits right below my shoulder.  I&#x27;ve tried blow drying and flat ironing but my hair just keeps flipping, and not in a good way. I had good luck with hot rollers in the past so I figured I&#x27;d try them again.  After reading all of the reviews on Amazon, I decided on these hot rollers.  Yes, they are a little small.  I&#x27;d love it if they came in 1-1/4 and 1-1/2\\&quot; rollers but I couldn&#x27;t find anything with those exact sizes.  In any event, the overall size of the case is great.  It&#x27;s very compact so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on my bathroom counter and will easily fit in my gym bag.  I also like the little pouches for the wire clips.  The rollers heat up quickly.  I was afraid that I might need more rollers but i was able to make the 10 rollers work.  Granted, I only created a long bob but it was really fast and easy.  I&#x27;m not sure why people are having such issue with the wire clips.  Perhaps I&#x27;m just used to using them but I had no problem keeping the rollers in place.  I can&#x27;t wait to try creating loose curls.  All in all, a great purchase at a great price.</li>
            <li> I tried to return these rollers because they were not dual heat and too small.  They were called extra large in the photo and description but are way too small for my hair and style.      I emailed the company and received an email back telling me to return them to a certain address, from Brian.  I did, but a day or two later got a call from UPS saying that they refused them.      What gives??  I would not order from this company again!</li>
            <li> I purchased these several months ago after reading reviews for several different sets of curlers.  These are fantastic! The heat up quickly, hold hair well and the 10 rollers are enough for even my thick hair.  While I have a larger set for home, these are great for when I travel.  They even worked with a voltage converter when I was recently out of the country.  The pins tuck into their own pocket inside the cute case.  I purchased these for about 16 dollars and have to admit that I would probably pay even more because I like them so much!  Tip: Hold the curlers on the edges as the middles get very hot!  Leave in for 5 min for increased volume and 10-15 for CURLS, in my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Bought these for traveling. Had borrowed them from a friend and really lied them. So decided to buy my own. The first time I used them they worked fine. The second time I could not keep the curlers in.....they kept popping off. Vey strange. They heat up well and size is perfect for traveling. I probably got a defective set.</li>
            <li> After 20 years of short hair, grew it out &amp; needed something to add a little finish when I have very little time. These rollers are just great! I have a lot of fairly fine hair, was concerned that 8 rollers would not be enough. Eight were plenty! Lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and stick straight. It will usually not hold a curl unless heat is near scorching. And even ones I leave in overnight don&#x27;t work. The only hot rollers that I have had success with were steam rollers (Caruso)....but I really wanted something more convenient and much more compact to travel with so I tried these...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like these badly! I just love how compact they are. And even though there were not many rollers for my waist length hair and rollers were small, I would&#x27;ve purchased two sets and used the larger rollers. Unfortunately the rollers would not get hot enough. After 10 minutes I could still wrap my hand around a roller with ease. It took 30+ minutes for them to be too hot to touch. This became an even bigger problem when I struggled with the metal pins it came with because I never used those before. I had to Google the proper way to use them and found out I was doing it correctly but my hair and rollers kept falling out particularly when doing sides of head. I would have to reheat rollers and start over, only for rollers to take forever to reheat. Ugh. I gave up and just wound up using alligator clips to hold in place and that worked out very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Super compact fits in purse/gym bag&lt;br /&gt;Good price...around $15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Too long to heat/reheat&lt;br /&gt;Rollers don&#x27;t retain heat long enough to penetrate through hair&lt;br /&gt;Metal pins horrible...Instructions don&#x27;t give tips on how to utilize those either&lt;br /&gt;Have to buy alligator clips instead&lt;br /&gt;Rollers heavier than others&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;If you want to do waves, add volume, or curl straight ends I think this works well. I was able to make the 10 rollers work for my entire head of fine hair. I left them in until they cooled. Even though curls were very defined when I took rollers out, they relaxed after an hour into just soft waves. This happened even when I used a smaller section of hair. I doubt my hair will hold up for longer than a few hours. This is probably not going to be a good product for hard to curl hair.er than a few hours. This is probably not going to be a good product for hard to curl hair.</li>
            <li> I have Asian straight but not thick hair and was going to like these rolls but ...&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Heats quickly&lt;br /&gt;- The bag helps to keep everything in order&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Too hot to use with bare fingers.&lt;br /&gt;- Not enough for even my very loose shoulder length hair&lt;br /&gt;- Metal clips always pop out and I have to find them on the floor or in the sink or elsewhere&lt;br /&gt;- Metal clips do not hold my hair securely so I literally have to stay still if I want to get any curls.&lt;br /&gt;- They damage my hair a LOT. Got so many split ends which never was an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;- And my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls even for a few hours! After 2-3 hours I have almost straight hair (which usually doesn&#x27;t happen if I use Caruso sponge rolls)</li>
            <li> I travel several times a year and these are perfect to travel with but, I use them every day! They work better than my expensive rollers. The rollers in the set have  two sizes... I like the large rollers and my daughter likes the smaller rollers so I purchased two sets and we traded rollers, so we are both happy!</li>
            <li> I bought and returned these. The clips would not stay in place and literally shot across the room every time I tried to roll my hair. With better clips, these rollers would be fine. They heat up quickly and stay warm enough to curl your hair but not fry your fingers, and I like the compact storage bag/heating base, but I would rather buy a set that comes with better clips already than have to spend $10 or more on clips that will not become dangerous projectiles without warning.</li>
            <li> Oh my- these have become my favorite beauty item. They need a bit of time to heat up, may e 5 minutes</li>
            <li> this are great for travel and heat well</li>
            <li> I have been looking everywhere for this and it was here all the time. I love this set. Its not too hot for my fine and and it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love these ceramic curlers, couldn&#x27;t ask for anything to heat any quicker and they can do the job.  My son loves his Tommy Hawk Wastlands game - Thanks, always reliable and great products to choose from.</li>
            <li> These curlers heat up so fast and they work great. I love how compact it is, I bring them with me on every trip.</li>
            <li> They are a nice compact size for travel. They work as advertised, just expect to let them heat up longer than the stated \\&quot;quick curl\\&quot; time.</li>
            <li> I needed a small roller set to take when I travel.  These heat up quickly and make great curls, my only complaint are the pins that hold them on.  It take a bit of working with each one so they stay on.  I&#x27;ll give this product a thumbs up for travel, but wouldn&#x27;t use them everyday.  I have a set with clips that cover each roller and those work much better.</li>
            <li> Great price, light weight, easy to work with (even with my long, thick hair), quick dry</li>
            <li> I will preface my review by a description of my hair:  very, very long (to my hips) with natural spiral curls (Type 3A/B, for those who care).  While it may sound bizarre for a person like me to want to use hot rollers in their naturally curly hair, I do have a logical reason.  Using hot rollers changes my curl pattern from a long spiral-type curl to more of a big, bouncy and looser curl.  Although I do enjoy wearing my hair in its natural state, sometimes I want large &amp;#34;glamorous&amp;#34; curls instead.  These Remington Ceramic rollers give me exactly the kinds of curls I&#x27;ve been hoping for!  Since I do have quite a bit of hair, I knew that one set of these rollers would not be enough.  I saw them at Target, and purchased the only two sets in stock, and for basically the same price as Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three reasons I purchased these hot rollers:&lt;br /&gt;1.  They are ceramic rollers WITHOUT the velvet flocking that so many rollers seem to have.  My hair does not hold curl when I use flocked rollers.  Flocking also seems to act like Velcro to my hair, whereby the smooth-surface rollers like these are much easier to remove without tangling my very long hair.&lt;br /&gt;2.  These rollers come with the U-shaped wire pins instead of those dreadful butterfly clips.  The wire pins never crease my hair, whereas butterfly clips inevitably do.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The set is compact and portable for travel, and the soft case has pockets for storing the wire pins.  I&#x27;m amazed at how many hot roller sets on the market no longer provide storage for their corresponding clips or pins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the rollers, there are ten in a set.  The five larger rollers are 1.25&amp;#34; in diameter, and the five smaller rollers are 1&amp;#34; in diameter.  I find it best to allow the rollers to heat for approximately 5 minutes minimum, despite the manufacturer suggestion of 90 seconds.  Before using the rollers, I wash my hair and allow it to dry naturally, while occasionally brushing it to discourage my own natural curls from forming.  Once my hair is completely dry, I apply a heat-protectant spray, brush through, then a light coating of an anti-humidity hairspray.  Around my face and on the crown of my head, I use all of the smaller rollers from both sets I purchased.  For the remainder of my hair on the sides and back, I use all of the larger rollers from both sets.  The ends of the rollers are perfectly comfortable to the touch, and I never burn my fingertips like some rollers can cause.  I&#x27;ve had no difficulty with the wire pins, and they slide into position nicely, holding the rollers exactly where I place them.  Once the rollers are in place, all twenty of them from the two sets I bought, they are quite heavy.  Most people will use only one set, so the weight should not be an issue.  Allowing for cooling time, I&#x27;ve been leaving the rollers in position for around 25-30 minutes, but again, I do have a lot of very long hair.  After the rollers have cooled, I begin unwinding.  These curlers do not get tangled in my hair, and the resulting curls are nicely formed.  I find it best to wait a couple of minutes after removing all the rollers before I start touching my curls.  I then spray with another mist of anti-humidity hairspray, bend forward at the waist, and lightly tousle my hair at the scalp.  The curls loosen up a bit, and I&#x27;m left with healthy-looking hair that requires no further styling.  The curls last into the next day!  I hope you will love these hot rollers as much as I do.

            <li> I also purchased two of these so that I could put the large rollers all in one.  I have shoulder length layed hair which is somewhat fine and and at at first I was afraid that the large rollers were going to be too small.  But, they work very well on my hair.  The set heats quickly and the rollers really hold the heat.  My curls are not too tight and hold all day.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Although the set was small and perfect for travel, I could not get the pins to stay on the rollers. Even after putting the smallest amount of hair around the roller...the pins still popped off and the roller fell off my head.</li>
            <li> I love love love these curlers!! The packaging is small, convenient and compact! The curlers get super hot, but not too hot (I haven&#x27;t burnt my fingers on these at all). I love the pins for these curlers, too. I was afraid to use these pins because I never have before, but after one use I got the hang of using them and really like them a lot. Also, the curler sizes are perfect! I just can&#x27;t say enough how much I love these curlers. They&#x27;re also a super reasonable price! I have very long hair, but it&#x27;s not super thick and ten curlers are enough for me, but someone with thick hair could certainly use two sets (trust me, it&#x27;s worth it to buy two of these instead of one set of something else). I definitely recommend these!</li>
            <li> I left this at my mother&#x27;s house after my last trip so they would never again take up good space in my luggage.  Cons:  --Two of the rollers never heated. Tried them on different posts. Never.  --The clips are practically useless. Fortunately my hair needs only a couple minutes to achieve the look I want, so I could just stand there and wait, without moving. The hardest part was keeping one roller in while rolling another. You have to move a little bit when you do that.  Pros:  --The overall size is perfect.  --The size of the rollers is just fine.  --I could&#x27;ve used another couple rollers, but for travel the number of rollers is just fine.    Summary: Remington, fix those clips and improve your quality control, and I&#x27;ll buy another one.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my wife for a recent European trip.  They worked flawlessly on 220v with only a plug adapter.  She has continued to use them since our return home instead of her larger set.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointing.  It sure is convenient and compact but doesn&#x27;t heat up all that well and not as quickly as advertised.  It is quite economical but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love these!!! Only flaw? It doesn&#x27;t say in the manual in how much time do they reach the max heat, which for rebel hair like mine is very important info, so i just let them heat up for like 5 min and then unplug one at a time and let them do their job for as long as i have time to let them on, first time in 15 minutes i was a curly queen! Love it!!</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t even get hot.  Really bad</li>
            <li> They were horrible and I returned them. The clips that come with the kit do not work, as they pop off easily, and heating them took a lot longer than expected. Find something else to buy.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  Took them back because the clips kept coming out.</li>
            <li> Nice for travel..small..compact..convenient.</li>
            <li> I love these rollers, they heat up quickly and produce excellent results. The only flaw is the metal clips--the clips for the larger rollers are too small and do not stay in my hair. Within seconds of putting the large rollers in my hair, the clip flies out of my hair and ends up on the other side of the room...very frustrating to say the least! Instead of using these clips I use some from an old roller set to avoid this issue.</li>
            <li> Great size for quick curls.  The only issue I have is that the clips seem a bit small for the rollers.  I don&#x27;t have thick hair, but alot of it, and I struggle to keep the rollers in until I have the desired curl.</li>
            <li> Alright - I&#x27;m on about my sixth set of these.... the first time, I reviewed them as 5-stars.  The last time I reviewed them as 1-star - because they had changed their clips.  I loved that these curlers are compact, heat up fast and came with clips that don&#x27;t leave a kink in fine hair.  I hated when they went to a new cheaper version of clips that made you play the &amp;#34;find the clip and curler&amp;#34; game as the clip flew out of your head after less than 2 minutes.  I bought my latest set when even though they didn&#x27;t take up my challenge (see last review) they introduced j-clips that addressed my complaints (as well as many on here).  I would actually give these a 10-star rating now.  Great set of curlers for travel or everyday - with clips that match the curlers performance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I previously gave these curlers a very-high ranking.  I&#x27;ve used them for years, and no matter which other ones I try, I always end up going back to these. I just bought another replacement set.... and since these, because of a change in the clips, are no longer the same product, I am adjusting my review accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my challenge to whomever in Remingtion aisre now responsible for these... Gather up some women in your company and go into a meeting room. Bring plenty of these curler sets in for them to use (no need to plug them in or heat them up - that part works fine).  Now, have them curl their hair in them, if you can get 5 woman who can keep all these in their hair with the provided fasteners for 5 minutes I&#x27;ll adjust this review again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the great part, if my experience is a sample,they won&#x27;t just fall out or not hold -they will FLY out. Pins will jettison themselves across the room and under pieces of furniture, curlers will go rolling across the floor, and as they pick people scramble for pins and curlers, the rest of them will do the same. I call it the &amp;#34;Chase a curler game&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know every trick in the book for keeping these type of fasteners in - and these are just too small for the curlers.  Seems like someone made a poor cost-cutting decision or you aren&#x27;t getting the fasteners you were promised. Either way - good curlers without a way to fasten them aren&#x27;t worth anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you pick up the challenge - I&#x27;d love to see it on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned a couple of sets of these. (They tend to look worn out from regular use every couple of years and I replace them - even though they&#x27;re still working fine).  In fact, I bought one set just to keep in my travel bag - and replaced my regular &amp;#34;big home set&amp;#34; with these, as well.  They heat up very quickly and leave a long lasting curl (even if you leave them in just a short time). They are particularly great for fine hair, and these have better clips than the last set I bought.

            <li> I purchased this hairsetter for travel and I love it so much that I&#x27;m using it regularly on my long, below-the-shoulder length hair. It heats up quickly, but gets hotter the longer you leave it plugged in. So if you want really good, long-lasting curls, let it heat up for 2 or 3 minutes (rather than 90 seconds, which is warm, but not hot) or experiment for your own best results. The rollers are rather smooth so it might be a challenge for very short hair (a curling iron is best for short hair anyway), but if you are used to using hot rollers, you will like this setter very much. It&#x27;s also very compact with two pockets for the two sizes of clips so it takes up very little room in your suitcase. Left me enough room for my regular sized ionic hair dryer!</li>
            <li> The product description says 5 large and 5 X large rollers. The rollers were very small, they are small and medium sized. Returning it.</li>
            <li> Curlers heat quickly and stay heated long enough to curl hair. This is my second set of this particular brand. The newer set doesn&#x27;t seem quite as nice. The older set had a velcro holder for the cord to fit into - the new one does not. Also, the top plastic on the second set became brittle and has cracked. I don&#x27;t think that the first set did that.</li>
            <li> clips do not stay on the roller even when there is no hair on the roller. They just fly off. useless. Gave as a gift. too late to return now.</li>
            <li> Buying curlers was much more of a chore than it should have been, I think. My last set were wearing out, so I bought these suckers because they were the best of the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The edges on the top and bottom don&#x27;t get hot, so you&#x27;re less likely so singe your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;- They curl really well, really fast.&lt;br /&gt;- Price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- There&#x27;s not very many.&lt;br /&gt;- The holders like to slip off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any way you look at it, these are really awesome for the price.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for:  small footprint in my suitcase, gets hot quickly, works great.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The best thing about these is that by ordering them from Amazon I can return them easily.  They heated up fine but they will not hold the hair and the pins are terrible.  I&#x27;ve had several sets of electric rollers so I&#x27;m no novice.  My full set is by Remington and works great.  That&#x27;s why I thought this travel size would be perfect for my trip.  These have some kind of rubberized surface, does not hold nearly as well as the flocked rollers.  The pins are straight, not curved, and do fly out of the roller.  I know they are cheap.  But I&#x27;d rather pay more and get a decent product.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased these electric rollers and they are compact, heat in 90 seconds,&lt;br /&gt;work well on fine thin hair. Highly recommend if you need some curl to try these out.&lt;br /&gt;These will definitely give your hair some added volume and the curl stays in place.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy and nice compact portable item.</li>
            <li> clips are too small for rollers so they keep popping off...makes larger rollers unusable.</li>
            <li> The pins don&#x27;t hold well every time. I have very thick hair, so I ordered 2 packs and I still have hair leftover. I&#x27;ve never used curlers with clips before, but I feel like for my hair (since it&#x27;s so heavy) it would hold better. I still use these often though and they curl well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy mine from here, I got mine like 2-3 years ago. They are amazing, they heat nicely even though they take a while (learned that one the hard way- junior prom,my hair was not done when I took the curlers out!) They&#x27;re a little heavy, so if you have thick hair,  secure the curlers the best you can do avoid them from falling out.</li>
            <li> Pros- Great product, great price! Very small and compact. You won&#x27;t believe how fast they heat up! I can&#x27;t travel with out them now. I have encouraged my mom to buy a set.  Cons- The large/x-large rollers are smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> 1. The pin is not long enough to hold the hair tightly. The roller falls down.  I switched the red pin with the other longer pin (over 1/2 inch more), the roller is held right at the desire location on my hair.    2. Is this a dual voltage unit as of its advertising?  I read the use and care guide, and I only found 120 volts.  Did you send me wrong model?  3. Can you exchange the one with dual voltage?  4. Can you give me longer pin? instead of the original pins?  Thank you very much.  Best regards,    Your customer.</li>
            <li> I have not used hot rollers since high school (in the 60&#x27;s!) and I was hesitant. But when I read that they are so much better than using a curling iron all the time I figured I would give them a try.  I needed something small for travel and these seemed to fit the bill and they do! The price is right, too! Be sure they are pushed all the way into the heating element before plugging in; they are perfect heat and easy to handle -- no burns on the fingers and pretty easy to roll. My hair is plentiful but fine and I found the curl to be lovely -- soft and natual looking. The only warning would be that if your hair is medium to long in length, you may wish to get 2 sets -- which is just what I am going to do now![[ASIN:B000EPJNMW Remington H-1015 Ceramic Compact]]</li>
            <li> i love travel size rollers.&lt;br /&gt;i replace my older remington rollers from 2001 with the updated version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only issue i have is that the large pin holder could be better fitted for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with this product , which arrived promptly , and before scheduled  date and is reasonably priced. A small neat travellling  item,the rollers heat up within a few minutes and have efficient curling effect, -although I would prefer the rollers to have been all tha same size  and have discarded the smaller ones,  it would also be a neat idea to have heated rollers covered in a softer coating other than rubber.  Otherwise - very good.. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a \\&quot;quick fix\\&quot; for my hair.  I am amazed at how well this little hairsetter works!  It&#x27;s perfect in every way for my mid-length, medium-thick hair.  You do need to let it heat up longer than the 90 seconds it says in the product description.  I let it heat for about 10 minutes and I get excellent, long-lasting waves.</li>
            <li> The pins do not stay around the rollers and pop off very easily:(  I happen to have enough hair clips that I can use those to keep them in.</li>
            <li> Great size, don&#x27;t get too hot to handle.  Not the absolute best solution for thick hair, but curls hold for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I have used hot rollers for many, many years. Never been great at using curling irons. I travel frequently and have tried taking hot rollers and/or curling iron. Even have purchased travel hot rollers in the past. These are the best curlers I have ever purchased. I cannot believe how well they work and at such a great price. I have paid 5 times as much for hot rollers in the past and have never, ever worked as well as these little guys do! I get the best curls I have ever had. I have straight hair to the shoulders, these honestly give me curls not just body. The clips work well in my hair, I would say my hair is average in thickness and have no trouble keeping the clips on the curlers. These heat up very fast and curl in just minutes!  I bought a second set in case I want all large curls or all smaller curls. Great product!</li>
            <li> Wish I had read the reviews about the clips on the red curlers not fitting! Love the curlers. I would have given these a perfect score. Yes, I could use 2-4 more. But won&#x27;t buy a second set if  Remington does not send me a new set of clips that fit the red rollers.</li>
            <li> The primary benefit of this set is the convenience and space saving.  The rollers heat up in their little case.  They do take longer to heat fully than the advertised 90 seconds, so I plug them in 5 minutes before I want to use.  Like the others, I find the curlers smaller in diameter than I was hoping for, but they seem to work anyway.  I went straight to the Remington site to order the \\&quot;extra\\&quot; large curlers as replacements, but they arrived and are the same size as the larger ones already included in the set.  The metal clips that come with the set are relatively useless.  Order the white plastic ones separately on amazon.  I would recommend this set.</li>
            <li> the pins are too small for the rollers and they pop outI have had the same type for years and never had this problem</li>
            <li> Why would a company sell something that they clearly did not test?? If Remington really stood for service and had any character they would have NEVER produced these curlers. The clips literally pop off of my head. They will not stay in your hair. I doesn&#x27;t matter how little hair or much you put around the curler. I can&#x27;t believe that this curlers past any tests regarding the Clips. Very disappointing, should be recalled!!</li>
            <li> absolutely LOVE these rollers because first, they are rubber type with metal clips which holds hair perfectly and distributing heat precisely. After buying first set, i ran to buy another since my hair is medium length. LOVED the bouncy curls with such an elegant view.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent travel hot roller set -- compact and does the job well.  I had to order clips to hold them in place.  The first time I used them, I spent a lot of time picking them up off the floor and trying to hold them in place with the included wire holders.  Don&#x27;t even think of ordering them without the plastic clips.</li>
            <li> These little rollers were just what I wanted --- perfect sized for medium to long hair, and the case is all set up for travel. The only thing is, it&#x27;s a little hard to get the rollers on and off the clamps that heat and hold them in place inside the hairsetter. Takes  alittle getting used to, but they heat up fast and are gentle on  my hair.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times and I only use the large rollers, but even then, it created really pronounced curls (which I don&#x27;t really like too much). I brought this with me to Japan and used it once there too. It travels pretty nicely. I&#x27;m glad that the voltage worked and that it heats up really fast, but I can&#x27;t stand those metal holders. They are hard to align and keep in your hair. I prefer using my curling iron to this, but it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
            <li> this is a great product.. Good for travelling and can use in THAILAND..also in asia too..</li>
            <li> Heats up quick enough, convenient size, BUT the clips that &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; the curlers on are awful!  They don&#x27;t fit well no matter how small the amount of hair wrapped around the curlers and pop off if you so much as breath.</li>
            <li> I like this hot roller set but it has its draw backs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set is a terrific compact size. Yes, you can set your entire head with 10 rollers but 2 more would have been nice. I like the size of the rollers, in my opinion, the two diameters both fall in the medium range. The claim that the rollers heat up in 90 seconds is just not true. However, this set is considerably faster than others I&#x27;ve used. My biggest complaint? The clips are too short. Not only do the rollers fall out without warning, but it&#x27;s not uncommon for the clips to jettison across the room. Rollers placed vertically are more secure than rollers placed horizontally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update March 2012:&lt;br /&gt;I found longer clips at Sally Beauty Supply that work with these rollers.</li>
            <li> The product is fine for curling your hair. It gets really hot to the touch and burns your fingers a little. Also not too great for longer hair. I needed  larger rollers and more of them. But it is small and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> As far as I know, this is the only small heat roller set available and the size was the determining factor in my purchase:  I take it when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that It&#x27;s &amp;#34;good enough&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m glad to have it BUT I&#x27;d be much happier if the heat level were consistent instead of varying from use to use (frustrating!) and the &amp;#34;pins&amp;#34; for the large rollers were longer (as they were originally!).  However, the price is right and the item arrived before I knew it.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> These rollers are the best to add super quick curls and bounce. They pack great for traveling and easy to store. I have three sets to do all my hair in one five minute session. Save to use.</li>
            <li> These curlers are great for traveling-lighweight, easy to use. You have to &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; your curling option ( at least I did) because I am used to using alot  more rollers, but for a weekend get-a-way, these were nice to have!</li>
            <li> I love these rollers.  They heat up really well, curl very well, and they are so light and easy to pack.  I have purchased a few sets of these over the past few years and given them away as gifts.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awful product - who designed this?  The rollers are too heavy to stay in with the flimsy pins, the pins won&#x27;t fit around rollers with HAIR on them, and you constantly have to fight to get the rollers back on their \\&quot;plugs\\&quot; in the case. The size is perfect for traveling, the rollers work if you have enough scaffolding but it is a complete pain to use - buy something else!</li>
            <li> The material the rollers are coated with cause hair to slip so much as you try to pin that I gave up after a couple uses - they now sit abandoned.  I went back to my old Remington Care Setter - it has a velvet like fuzz on the roller that seems to help the hair cling to it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my daughter. I love them. They work quick and the curl was amazing. I first purchased a set of Revlon expensive curlers and they did nothing in her hair. Ordered these because of a recommendation from a friend and I am so happy I did. They heat up quick. They are easy to bring along to the pageants. Easy to put in, Easy to take out and the curls are amazing. I ordered 2 sets and plan on ordering a third because we always seem to be one curler short.</li>
            <li> You have to get use to using the clamps but other than that I love them.  I love the case they come in.</li>
            <li> I love this set of rollers.  They heat up quickly and the set contains the perfect number of rollers.  I have very thick, straight hair and my hair actually holds the curl using this set.  They are great for traveling, very compact and there is no hard plastic cover to get broken in your bag.  My friend saw my set and bought a set of her own.  Great product and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I hear that this sucker was compact, but I was shocked when i saw the teeny amazon box show up today.  This little sucker packs a great punch, and contrary to what some people say the rollers worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers themselves are textured with something and the clips that came with the set do work great to keep them right where I put them (fine/normal hair texture).  I wouldnt recommend these to someone hoping to do a lot of hair as i don&#x27;t have very much as far as density or coarseness and It would be a feat to curl my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately I only wanted curlers for the crown part of my head for volume, which these work PERFECTLY for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the design is simple red and black, and takes up very little space. Simplicity is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and needed compact curlers to toss in my suitcase. These are great for that. Heat quickly. Curl well. So, small, efficient, effective. Good, right?  Yes, if you can manage to wind the curler without burning your fingers. Yes, if after blistering your index finger, you can keep the stupid roller on your head. My hair is super straight and fine so that may be part of the problem. There is a nanosecond between &#x27;just right&#x27; and &#x27;melt your hair&#x27;, and no temp control. Not even an On/Off switch. Plug/unplug only. Also, the red clips that go with the larger curlers don&#x27;t fit. They immediately begin to creep back until they fling themselves from the curler and curler begins a rapid slid down and off your head. This morning is a Saturday. I am away from home and on my way to work. Two not so great things. Today, after a mini meltdown, I threw all the red clips away. Felt good.  Used what hair clips I had with me, which work well, by the way. (You know those alligator clips you use when you twist and snatch your hair up and off your neck.) wish I had done that a long time ago. Downside, 5 alligator clips use up more suitcase space than the stupid curlers do. Gotta go to work now.</li>
            <li> I wanted hot curlers that could replace my mother&#x27;s set of hot curlers from the 80&#x27;s. The ones from the 80&#x27;s were light, made out of plastic and heated with a metal plate. The plastic curlers sat on a metal rack and actual water was inside the curler.     Remington \\&quot;All That\\&quot; curlers are heavy, ceramic (or cermanic-like) and they come in a compact case. I would reccommend Remington curlers but not to everyone.     Pros-   I could not believe how small the case was for 12 curlers! I love it. This set of curlers could easily fit in a medium size purse.     I prefer the metal pins (that come in this kit and in my mom&#x27;s 80&#x27;s curlers), over the plastic clips. The plastic clips sometimes leave fringe marks in your hair.     The curlers heat up fast. They are better for your hair than the 80&#x27;s hot curlers because they get warm enough to get the job done but not scorching hot which causes your hair to fry.     With that said..   I would not recommend these curlers for ALL hair types... for example, asian hair or natural stick-straight hair. I don&#x27;t think these curlers would get hot enough to have an effect on an asian women&#x27;s naturally straight hair.     Cons-   The only other slight problem is the heaviness of the curler. If you have never used curlers before, you will have a hell of a time figuring out how to get the curlers to stay in your hair. It gets easier with practice.</li>
            <li> I have all kinds of hairsetters - large, small, you name it - but this one beats them all! Gets hot in a hurry (and I do mean HOT) and couldn&#x27;t be more compact for traveling or storing in the bathroom. I&#x27;m not crazy about the old fashioned metal clips; I instead use the claw-like plastic squeeze clips that came with an older hairsetter I have.     If you need a hairsetter, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this one! It is a really great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my hot curlers more than five years ago. I bought these because I was living in Europe at the time but came back home to the US often and also knew I would be returning to live again permanently one day. These do not require a transformer for either voltage. It does require a simple inexpensive plug adapter for European current. It is very compact and lightweight. Very easy to travel with. The curlers are smallish and I prefer a larger curl so I don&#x27;t leave them in as long for a softer curl. I do wish they made a set with larger curlers too.</li>
            <li> they definitely do their job and - with a healthy dose of hair spray - the curls hold! i am asian, so my hair is extremely reluctant to hold any shape beside straight. these guys do the trick. i would buy two packs. one doesn&#x27;t have enough rollers. the pouch is ultra compact and travels well. great product the its price!</li>
            <li> Dreadful hair rollers.  Firstly..there are no large..just five medium...and five small ones that are too small to be of any use.  They get so hot..that you have to turn it off for five mins to handle them.  I have fine hair so they burned my scalp.  Why oh why is it not possible to buy even eight medium rollers..all the same size..that get hot..but not THAT hot.....that you can travel the world with...????  I am mystified how people gave good reviews on this product...what on earth did they do with the tiny rollers?</li>
            <li> I have a set of flock hot curlers I like very well (if only I could find all the clips that came with it), but the standard 20 curlers are not enough for a full head of hair.  I bought this hoping to supplement what I had.  I also liked its compact design for use in travel.  I didn&#x27;t mind the oversized metal clips, remembering them from years ago and an old Clairol hot roller set I used until it died and I cut my hair in a wash and go style.    However--This set is not at all satisfactory.  The hard rollers are indeed like the old Clairol rollers, but I must be getting soft.  These rollers are too hot and too hard.  If you roll them to the scalp and slip the most awkward metal clips over the rollers and your hair, you will scorch your fingers and your scalp. The clips will dig into your poor scalp as well, and the way they hold the curlers, causes the already heavy curlers to pull at your hair.  My mother used to joke that one must suffer to be beautiful, but this torture is not worth the outcome.  Buyer be aware: You may fare better with flock-covered hot rollers.  Just invest in a lot of spare hair clips to replace the disappearing roller clips that come with it.   Pros: the price is very reasonable.  The kit is very portable.  The package is quite packable (compact).  It&#x27;s colorful and you&#x27;re not likely to leave it behind in a hotel room,  bright as it is.  Cons: You will want to. And whoever takes it home with them will pass it along after one use. Probably to someone they don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I like the travel size for sure. They heat up quickly and they get hot enough to make a decent surl BUT I will never buy these again because the clips do not fit the large rollers! At all. They will not go in all the way to hold the roller securely. Buy another set.</li>
            <li> I have used hot rollers for many years and love the wax core rollers that really heat up and stay hot. My set died and I tried these after reading the reviews. Not for me. These rollers only stay hot for a few minutes as they do not have posts that heat the entire roller. Also, I was barely able to secure even small sections of my thick hair with these clips. I found the flap on the case would not stay open and I had to open it every time I went to grab a roller. Maybe they work for finer hair but I need rollers that can stay hot for more than 5 minutes. Returning them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m typically satisfied with Remington products, but this is a disappointment.  PROS:   1. Its compact design fits easily in a suitcase or bag.   2. The rollers heat up relatively quickly and stay warm for a long time.   3. The rollers don&#x27;t get so hot that you can&#x27;t handle them.  CONS:   1. The cross-clips are absolutely 100% worthless. They are essentially a single piece of thick wire (not an exaggeration) that is supposed to keep all your hair on the roller. I&#x27;m not good at physics, but that doesn&#x27;t seem like it would work. Your hair slips off, which defeats the purpose of rolling it in the first place. The only reason I didn&#x27;t get rid of this appliance on the first use was because I had full clips from another roller set that I could use in a pinch.  2. There are only 10 rollers - good for the compact design, but if you have longer or thicker hair you&#x27;re going to have to roll part of your hair, wait for the rollers to cool, then roll the other part. The only reason I didn&#x27;t get rid of this appliance on the first use was because I had some extra time where I could do this.  3. The grooves in the rollers aren&#x27;t very deep, which means that your hair doesn&#x27;t hold to them as well as with other sets.  VERDICT: If you&#x27;re wanting it solely for travel, then this might (reiterate, might) be something to consider, but if you&#x27;re wanting something to actually curl your hair, spend another $15 and get a larger set (more rollers) and one that has actual clips to hold the rollers in place rather than pieces of wire. If you have shorter or thinner hair this will work better than thicker and/or longer hair. Overall, this set was a complete disappointment for me; the CONS totally outweighed the PROS. Using this was a highly frustrating experience.</li>
            <li> I had a set that last for years and decided to get a new set, the clips are too small to hold the rollers in place. They keep popping off.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT SIZE AND ATTRACTIVE AND EASY TO USE BUT . . .  IT DOES NOT HEAT WELL AND IT DOES NOT REALLY CURL YOUR HAIR.  VERY DISAPPOINTED SO I RETURNED IT AND BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE WHICH IS A GREAT TRAVEL SIZE BY CONAIR</li>
            <li> Easy to use, warm up fast and the curls last!  Just make sure all your rollers are fully plugged in. :)</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel and at home.  Had my last set for 10 years. Easy to pack. They last a very long time.  they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> I bought these curlers because, as a frequent traveler, the unit is light and easily packable.&lt;br /&gt;BUT, the curlers are uncomfortable due to their hard rubber spikes, and those in the back tend to fall out of my hair onto the floor. The resultant curls are lumpy and unflattering compared to the previous flocked Remington curlers which I had enjoyed for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curlers were a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I live in dry climate and old rollers frying my hair.  These worked well for me. I bought two sets one for home and one for travel  I like the smaller \\&quot;large\\&quot; rollers for my shoulder length hair.  I  bought extra rollers from the  manufacturer Remington. I was worried about the flocked rollers, but I liked them better than my old version.</li>
            <li> The size is nice for traveling purposes, but the quality is not that great. I actually have the conair set which is much bigger and bulkier. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These are everything that the ad says they are.  They really heat up quickly and are ready to go in less than a minute.  They are just the right number of curlers for me and I love them!</li>
            <li> These rollers are pretty good.  I have a similar set I purchased a few years ago, but now I have so much hair I needed to get a second set in order to roll it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;compact size&lt;br /&gt;the rollers are &amp;#34;grippy&amp;#34; without tearing out my hair&lt;br /&gt;decent price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;2 of the rollers don&#x27;t heat up at all. Bummer!</li>
            <li> These curlers are really great!  The large is more like a medium to me.  Just enough for thin medium length hair.</li>
            <li> My only thing is is that the pins that hold the rollers in your hair are easy to lose.</li>
            <li> I really hate these rollers - very frustrating as they fall out the minute you put them in - I had forgotten I had already written this!  UPDATE - STILL AWFUL -</li>
            <li> Small size&lt;br /&gt;works in US and overseas&lt;br /&gt; and there is no switch to flip from 11ov to 220v.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds a style-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot ask for more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh yeah&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low priced</li>
            <li> It is small and very portable.  The only thing I would change is the medium rollers.  The medium rollers should be replaced by large rollers.</li>
            <li> Quick heating up - does not burn hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers to use while on vacation because my &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; set is too large and fragile to travel. This set is small and packs well, but I had problems with the set. The absolutely most frustrating problem was that the clips would not fit the rollers properly; the clips would either not fit over the roller, or would pop off and the roller would fall out. Also, the rollers became too hot to touch. These issues made rolling my hair a much more time consuming process than necessary. I had to let each roller cool for a few seconds before using it, and re-roll several sections of hair because the rollers kept falling out. On the plus side, the rollers do get hot for making great curls, if you can keep the clips in, and don&#x27;t mind getting a little bit burned in the process.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I have my old metal clips from my previous (broken) set. I was able to use my old clips, since the clips included do not hold the curlers in place.  Otherwise, I like that it&#x27;s very compact and works nicely.  I make sure I push the curlers down to connect at the bottom when I put them away.  After a few weeks, I have yet to have a problem with the curlers not heating up.</li>
            <li> This item does not do the work. I have a 15 year old Vidal Sassoon. I felt I needed more rollers and decided the buy the biggest rated ones.&lt;br /&gt;SOrry but it does not do the work unless you are light haired!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific hair setter. It is small enough to take traveling. The rollers may be too small for those with curlier hair, but if your hair is straight it is perfect. It heats up in about 3 minutes. The rollers are easy to handle. I don&#x27;t like the type of clips that come with it, so I bought the plastic pinch type for myself, however they do work fine.</li>
            <li> This product was advertized as having 5 large and 5 x large rollers.  The rollers we not large, let alone x large.  I returned the product.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time getting these to stay in my hair. I think that maybe longer pins may be needed.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews of hot rollers before settling on this product, and I&#x27;m thrilled with the outcome.  I have \\&quot;a lot of thin hair\\&quot; as my stylist puts it, and it&#x27;s pin straight so it usually doesn&#x27;t hold curl.  I put these in and let them sit for fifteen minutes, and I had great curls for the rest of the night.  The set comes with pins to hold the rollers, which don&#x27;t leave a mark.  The only reason I gave  this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because the first set I bought tends to have issues with all of the rollers heating up at the same time.  I ended up buying a second set so that I could have more of the medium-size rollers, and this set works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Heavy, hard to get them to stay in place and awkward, takes too long to work and the result doesn&#x27;t last long... May work better if you leave them in much longer, but they stay hot only for 15 minutes so you have to reheat.</li>
            <li> Bought this to have a back up and our vacation home.  Now its my favorite.  I recommend this set . Easy to use and heat up quickly.  I had purchased the separate clip ons, however the ones that come with the package work just fine.</li>
            <li> I use hot rollers every day . Going on a cruise and I wouldnt be able to take my bulky set.These are a perfect size and weight</li>
            <li> This is a nice small kit that works for my needs. I have long, stick-straight, fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;They get nice and hot and curls come out smooth and shiny, just like they say. They do the job!&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;The larger size rollers won&#x27;t stay in.  It&#x27;s like the pins are not sized right for them or something.  The pin pops off and flies across the bathroom! I don&#x27;t have this problem with the smaller rollers.&lt;br /&gt;Neither pro nor con, just observations -&lt;br /&gt;The curlers have to be pushed down firmly into their sockets. The first time I used them, I just put them back in enough that they were &amp;#34;in.&amp;#34; The next time I used the rollers they would not get hot!  I thought that they were just cheap and going in the trash. Then I touched a different roller and it was hot.  I realized that one or two rollers were hot because I had pushed them down much more firmly into their sockets. So now, after using them, I close the &amp;#34;lid&amp;#34; and push them all down firmly with the palm of my hand. No problems with heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a little heavy, but even with my fine hair, I do not count that as a pro or a con as it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price and for my needs, I am happy with them. Not sure I would recommend them to everyone. For a travel set or for an extension to your bigger set, sure. To just get some curl in your long straight hair that you then put up on top of your head (me), they are ok!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an \\&quot;All That\\&quot; compact travel roller set almost identical to this for over 20 years. Maybe 30. I&#x27;ve used them at least twice weekly all this time. I&#x27;ve had shoulder-length to VERY long hair. They&#x27;ve easily  traveled with me on my every trip.&lt;br /&gt;I looked them up, sure they no longer made this exact model, because I would be in a panic if one day, eventually, they were no longer working. I was thrilled my reliable rollers are still available.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying that extra set but keeping it in storage just in case...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used rollers in my hair before, but have put them in for my friends.  This set is very convenient, not too bulky. I tried for the first time in my hair and the curls turned out wonderful.  I would have given it 5 stars but it wasn&#x27;t enough to cover my head, maybe an extra row of medium curlers would do the trick.</li>
            <li> The rollers are fantastic but the clips are awful. I had to buy extra clips.</li>
            <li> I have purchased them before and bought for a gift. Great price!</li>
            <li> Please pay attention to this: THE CLIPS DO NOT HOLD THESE ROLLERS IN PLACE!!!!!!!!!!! I am so frustrated with these roller clips, hooks, loops, whatever they are called. I put one roller in and slip on the loop, put another roller in and the first roller loop pops off. I have loops flying all over the bathroom and rollers falling out of hair. I was so excited when I bought these because of the compact size. Another thing, they get very hot and are hard to hold onto when putting in hair. I&#x27;ve used them 3 times and am giving up! Going to order foam covered ones with actual clips that hold the whole roller in place. Sigh...................</li>
            <li> I believe this is a quality-control issue, so I will start off by saying I am pleased with the size of the rollers and the case. Perfect for travel, and great for thick hair. I had no issue getting them to stay in my hair with the pins provided. Unfortunately, only a couple of the rollers heated properly. The rest were cold to lukewarm. Hopefully, you get a good batch!</li>
            <li> These curlers really do the job and don&#x27;t take up a lot of space.  Ideal for travel or just everyday use.  At first I thought the curlers would be too small, but they make my hair smooth, shiny with loose, natural curls.  Give these a try - for the price, they can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> VERY HANDY PRODUCT  MY HUSBAND AND I TRAVEL ALOT AND THESE CURLERS ARE   GREAT   THEY DONT TAKE UP A LOT OF SPACE AND HEAT UP QUICK  AND DO THE JOB  GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> These curlers are junk. I love the idea of a compact set I can toss in my suitcase, but the rollers don&#x27;t get very hot and the pins don&#x27;t hold them in place. I&#x27;m better off packing my curling iron. Save your money.</li>
            <li> This product seemed to work okay at first but the pins for the red rollers are too small.  The small ones work fine but the large ones do not stay! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Worst hot rollers ever. I couldn&#x27;t get these to hold my hair to save my life. No amount of hair spray could keep the pins from immediately shooting off of my head all around the bathroom. Who knows if they curl or not? I agree with others. The pins are the wrong size and must be defective.</li>
            <li> These are ok. The pins won&#x27;t stay in, and I bought some clips specially made for hot rollers and those don&#x27;t keep the rollers in either. I probably just need to take some time and practice using them, but they just didn&#x27;t wow me enough to even do that.</li>
            <li> I have a very old Remington set that works well. I bought this to travel with. The pins fall out and the heat isn&#x27;t sufficient to give you a curl that will last. Very disappointed. Will be sending back.</li>
            <li> it was a bad buy  and the price was great. It didn&#x27;t make the curls. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I started off thinking that I was doing something wrong, since the rollers would simply not stay in my hair and the pin would come flying off within a couple minutes of me placing it.  Then I noticed a trend, the smaller sized rollers (black) stayed in perfectly, but no matter what I did, the larger ones (red) fell out.  It&#x27;s really too bad because this set seems SO convenient and easy, but I think I might have to send it back.</li>
            <li> THEY GET REALLY HOT IN A VERY SHORT TIME, AND THE ONLY THING THAT I DONT LIKE IS THAT THEY TEND TO FALL OFF IF YOU DONT ARRANGE THEM CORRECTLY, BUT OTHER THAN THIS, EXCELLENT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> My mom has had this same set of rollers for almost 5 years, and she uses them every day.  They are a super compact, travel friendly set-- they take up minimum space on a shelf or countertop, which I love.  I ordered a back up set for her, and one for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviews have mentioned that a few of the rollers wouldn&#x27;t heat up.  I can see how one could easily make the mistake of not pushing each roller correctly all the way into the base, therefore not heating the roller.  I noticed as I was plugging in the set that not all of the rollers were heating.  I made sure to push them all the way down into the base, and they all heated perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal clips work just fine with my fine hair- if they feel too loose, then bend the metal to tighten them.  (With thicker hair, vice versa.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls achieved are amazing!  (And my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl easily.)  The unit heated up within a minute and a half, and only needed about 8-10 minutes in my hair (enough time to get dressed, and put on makeup).  I rarely have time (or want to spend time) fussing with my hair, and these rollers are the perfect way to make my flat, fine hair seem bouncier and fuller.  (Also, the curls make my up-dos look instantly fancier.)  I love this set, and recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have the space for a big box of rollers.  They work like a charm!  And for $11, they are a steal!</li>
            <li> I bought these for traveling. They are absolutely awful. They heat unevenly. The clips don&#x27;t hold. They&#x27;re too small for long hair. The case is flimsy. I&#x27;m now on the hunt for a new set.</li>
            <li> I would love these rollers if they would just stay in my hair.  The clips slowly slide off and go flying across the bathroom.  Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> THESE ARE THE BEST ELECTRIC ROLLERS EVER!!!  THEY GET HOT FAST...THEY ARE EASY TO PUT IN...AND THEY STAY IN WELL, THEY DON&#x27;T SLIP OUT LIKE MANY DO...EVEN IF YOU TAKE THEM OUT BEFORE THEY ARE COMPLETELY COOL HAIR SEEMS TO CURL MUCH BETTER THAN ANY OTHER I&#x27;VE TRIED...NICE AND COMPACT!!!</li>
            <li> While first using this product, clips would not hold rollers in place.  Rollers also don&#x27;t seem to have enough gripping texture.  I bought the Conair Super Clips and they work perfectly at holding rollers.  Over-all I am pretty happy with these hot rollers, although it is the first time I have ever used somethiing like this.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:21431001]]My wife has just set her using Remington Rollers. She is also wearing slingback 5.5 inch platform shoes which she just bought. She is also wearing the longest false eyelashes I have seen which is about 1.5 inches long. She looks like a  sexy looking drag queen with those false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I would probably never buy travel curlers without looking at them. I have moderately curly hair that gets a little unruly so I need just a few electric curlers. These do not have any prongs to help grab.As a travel set there is not a place that holds the cord......it is just out and flops around so that is not put away neatly in the little red case, which the picture does not show the cord. So in summary if you had straight hair I would think these curlers would not stay in your hair very well they would slip out and the  compactness with cord is not good. They do get very hot.</li>
            <li> these rollers work well. I just wished it came with maybe 2 or 3 more rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long thing straight hair and it fell short to curl my entire head in one sitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it works but if you have really thick hair or long hair you might want to go with a set that has more curlers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they managed it, but there is zero wasted space in this compact little curler set.  I travel a lot and these are a perfect fit.  They heat up quickly and evenly and work great!  It&#x27;s sturdier than it looks--I was worried about the see-through window but the whole thing is really tough and should wear well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Having used these quite a bit for travel recently, I&#x27;ve found one quirk: the rollers can shake loose in the case and not heat up properly.  Best to open the case and give the rollers a push on the top to make sure they are all properly seated on the heating elements.  Then plug in and away you go!  BTW, in spite of other comments, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the clips.  The curlers stay in just fine, in spite of my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Great rollers for travel.  Heats quickly.  I use claw clips to hold the rollers in my hair instead of using the included roller clips.  Rollers are not too hot to the touch, which makes them easy to use.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s get very hot and great for travel nice and small</li>
            <li> This is a nifty roller set, compact enough to slip into a corner of a carry-on.  The rollers heat up quickly and are easy to use. The rubber sleeves on the rollers are kind to my super-fine hair.  The set is inexpensive, and it has been reliable for me.</li>
            <li> small, and easy to pack. Heats quickly. Does great job for me. I recommend it to anyone who uses hot curlers.</li>
            <li> I was traveling on business...forgot my hair heating products. Only option was this set at target.&lt;br /&gt;Red Clips don&#x27;t hold....flying thru the air seconds after inserting. I tried every which way! Nothing! Product deemed useless! The worst set I have owned! Buy Conair travel set!!  Sorry I had to give this set 1 star!  Negative 10 fits!  Shame on you Remington!!!</li>
            <li> Hate these. The clips don&#x27;t stay in and they keep falling out.</li>
            <li> Very happy with it.  Arrived very quickly!!</li>
            <li> I used these rollers one time and the next day I plugged it in to heat up, but they were already broken!  After one use?  This product must be very cheaply made and I am very disappointed that I spent any money on these rollers!</li>
            <li> These are a great set of curlers that do the job they were intended to. Compact enough to take with you anywhere. The ten curlers easily cover my long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t I like it? For starters 2 of the curler pins NEVER stay in...they look the same as the others, but they pop out instantly!  Get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> great little roller set for home and travel,doesn&#x27;t take up too much space when packing either.I could even squeeze it into my motorcycle back pack without my husband noticing . teehee!</li>
            <li> This is my second set and although I like the rollers, the clips that came with my second set keep popping off the curlers.</li>
            <li> Clips will not hold the larger rollers in my hair. Very frustrating. Would return, but I&#x27;ve used them a few times now.</li>
            <li> I have been using these rollers for years. I always have two sets plugged in and take one when traveling. However the most recent set I purchased about a month ago, the clips won&#x27;t stay in to save my life. As soon as I get the hair rolled, ka-boing- clip goes flying and roller falls out. I tried double-clipping and that just creates a double ka-boing. I have always liked the rollers (and remington products) so now will either try a new brand or looking for rollers with clamps so I don&#x27;t have to deal with this issue anymore. Too bad because other than the fact that the clips won&#x27;t stay in this has always been a great product for the money. However, right now it is pretty useless and stressful trying to get ready.</li>
            <li> Portable, heats quickly, ordered more large size rollers for my hairstyle, works great except pins are slightly small with thick hair...and larger pins are are too big for the rollers I have.</li>
            <li> These small, compact curlers work perfectly for me.  About my hair: Relatively thin, shoulder length, with a slight natural curl.  I blow dry my hair and then use these to add a fantastic curl prior to going out.  They heat up quickly and are an easy way to do my hair when I don&#x27;t want to straighten.</li>
            <li> Although I really like the compactness of these hot rollers, I thought I would have to send them back because there was no way they would stay in my hair.  Thanks to the advice of a friend, I scrounged around and found a bunch of &amp;#34;butterfly clips&amp;#34; (large) to hold them into my hair.  From a very old and long gone set of hot rollers from about 1980, I have TWO metal pins.  They are about 2&amp;#34; longer than the pins that come with the set and they work quite well to hold these very heavy rollers.  I know the metal wire is not terribly expensive to make these pins and am mystified why Remington does not return to a longer pin so they will actually stay in the hair.  (I have fairly long hair, it is not that they are falling out for lack of hair to hold them).  The other concern I have is that it takes more than a few minutes for the rollers to get really hot.  I usually plug them in and go do something else for awhile, but that is probably the nature of the ceramic and safety concerns, this I can live with.</li>
            <li> This is a great travel size.  Heats up quickly and is hot enough to curl even straight hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a friend who has beautiful long hair and she told me they worked wonderfully.  I also own a set and have had them for several years travelling with me to the office, gym and around the world.  They are easy to pack and are lightweight.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairsetter. It is very small, doesn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair, and is really easy to use. However:  I purchased it for a trip to Europe but when I received it I didn&#x27;t see the 110/220 emblem on the cord.  I looked for a switch but couldn&#x27;t find one.  Although the website and even the pamphlet list this as dual voltage, it is not.  I emailed Remington and they confirmed that this is not a dual-voltage product.  So I will be taking it to Europe but with a converter.</li>
            <li> I bought these and returned them. They don&#x27;t get hot. More like lukewarm rollers. It&#x27;s really too bad because the size would make them ideal for travel.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but I just have to on this product.  I have straight hair - so straight that even when I blow dry with mousse, my hair still ends up dead straight.  I have used a curling iron for years - but the curling iron dries my hair, takes alot of time and by the end of the day my hair is dead straight again, despite using hairspray all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I initially purchased these curlers, just putting them in my hair was painful.  After 3 days, I was going to throw them away.  However, I decided to persevere, and the perseverence was definitely worth it.  Once you learn how to use the pins to clip the curlers into place, the process is quick, easy and painless.  Just hang in there and keep practising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are enough curlers to do about 3/4 of my hair (head).  To put the curlers in takes about 4 minutes (used to take 9 minutes with a curling iron).  I use a curling iron for the remaining 1/4, which takes about 2 minutes.  Not only is the process quicker using these rollers, but the curl stays all day and they don&#x27;t dry out my hair like the curling iron!  What a blessing for me.  Once I take out the curlers I comb out, tease a little, use hairspray and whammo...a great look and I don&#x27;t have to touch my hair all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I am very happy with the product.  I bought a second set for travel.  I hope it has dual voltage...I&#x27;m confused from the responses from other users whether or not it has dual voltage......</li>
            <li> previous reviews were correct when relating that the rollers were not held in place by the clips&lt;br /&gt;they did reject the roller and flew out.  I do have this set that is 30 yrs old and wanted to replace it&lt;br /&gt;with like kind and was disappointed.  Perhaps the clips do not hold the rollers due to the coating on the rollers.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great. Only takes about 2 mins to heat up. I have thick hair and this still curled it well. Only problem is the rings are difficult to maneuver. 2 kept sliding out. I would rather prefer clips like the conair one offers. But besides that, it works.</li>
            <li> I purchased this same item several years ago and my old one was wearing out, so ordered a new one to take on my 3 week vacation.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t check the appliance out before I left and it turned out that the clips included to be used on the large rollers were not designed correctly and will not hold the rollers in place reliably.  I plan on going directly to Remington to see if they can replace them with clips that fit the rollers properly. Another thing that I preferred about my old set is that the cover included an attached Velcro loop that you could use to gather your cord so it doesn&#x27;t dangle while not being used.  Another minor point was that I much preferred the previous casing that was white with a small blue printed pattern on it vs this red and black combination.  I guess the good news is that you can&#x27;t miss it in your luggage!</li>
            <li> They were good for travel when I had short hair, I could use these and they were just OK.  Now I have shoulder length, thick hair and they DO NOT WORK.  They dont &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; the hair as the roller is slick, and there aren&#x27;t enough of them to do all my hair at once, so I either have to roll half of my hair and then put the rollers back in to get hot or use a curling iron.  I&#x27;m getting a larger set to replace</li>
            <li> they just don&#x27;t stay in my hair, maybe they need a grippy covering or something they just don&#x27;t work should have returned them now i guess it is to late</li>
            <li> Great compact design. Takes up very little room in your suitcase. Rollers heat up &amp; are ready to use in about 2-3 minutes like the product claims. Sets hair better then most rollers (and I have tried many). The only thing that I would change, is to add 2-4 more rollers. But I liked these rollers so much, I actually bought a 2nd set &amp; use these at home over the 5 other sets of rollers I own!!</li>
            <li> This hair setter is fantastic! It not only is small enough to fit into your suitcase but the heat emitted from the unit provides a quality \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; to hair and also more body (believe it or not). I have medium-length fine straight hair: I need only hair body and some curl and sheen to my hair (I cannot use hairspray). I found this setter to be perfect in treating me to a perfect style.[[ASIN:B000EPJNMW Remington H-1015 All That Quick Curl Travel Hair Setter]]</li>
            <li> This would be a perfect compact set if only the curlers were not so heavy. The metal clips that come with the set do not hold the curlers securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in need of a curler set that I could travel with on vacation. I am thinking about investing in what they call claw clips to see if that helps.  Overall this would have been a great product if it wasn&#x27;t for gravity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important note: Make sure that the curlers are completely pressed down into their individual heating socket.  These curlers get extremely hot when left too long in their container because the heat does not turn on and off to regulate the temperature to keep it at the same heat range.  You may need to take the curler out and let it sit for a minute or so until it cools down a bit so that you don&#x27;t burn a sensitive scalp.  Buy with caution.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected...keep it simple....great traveling roller and I use it at home daily...I love the fact the you don&#x27;t get a bunch of rollers that you never use...I love this simple, economic and great roller set...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical based on other reviews, but they worked really well. Rolled easily, but the clips left a little to be desired, the rolls kept flopping around, but that may have been user-error. I have shiny, bouncy curls.. I hope they last!</li>
            <li> Actually, this is my second set of the Remington Rollers.  I have used different hot rollers for 40 years, but like this so well I had to purchase a second set just in case. I have been using this product daily for about 10 years.  Wonderful for my very fine and straight hair.  Warms, curls and fits in suitcase easily.  People think I have a natural curl.  A little harder to fasten curler to really short hair.</li>
            <li> Just received this product today and I have already used it.  Lightweight for travel and easy to use. :)</li>
            <li> The travel roller set is very light - weight and it heats quickly. It worked well on my thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well. I had done a lot of research on what others had said so I thought it would be better than they were based off that. One of the warmers didn&#x27;t even work which was annoying.</li>
            <li> They work good, but the clips sometimes don&#x27;t want to stay on the roller. Buy some big clips to solve the problem. Like the convenience of a small set of rollers.</li>
            <li> Very good -heats fast and perfect size for travelling</li>
            <li> The rollers themselves worked great. As long as you make sure that they are seated completely on the base, they heat fairly quickly.  The clips however were terrible. The clips are not made to fit the rollers and slowly work themselves away until they eventually shoot off the roller and you have to crawl around on the floor to find them. It was very frustrating. I am going to look for clips that fit and keep them because they are dual voltage and worked great in Ireland with an adapter.  You do not need a voltage converter to use these, only a plug adapter.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old granddaughter loved it!  It is compact and great for travel.  I thought the curlers would be larger than they are.  The directions included showed you how to plug in the curlers and all the warnings but did not actually tell you how to use the curlers.  It should have on the advertisement that the curlers are for shoulder length hair or shorter.</li>
            <li> I had my previous version of the \\&quot;Remington All That! Hair Setter\\&quot; for almost 10 years, so after the poor things couldn&#x27;t give any more, I decided to buy the same brand. I used it constantly in my business travels and I have to say that the convenience is not only in how it works, but how compact it is.  They work great! I had everything timed perfectly, got out of the shower, put the rollers on, got dressed, put a little make-up and get the rollers off and presto! perfect hairdo in less than 10 minutes!  They worked great for the last 10 years and I know that these will last a long long time.  Great investment!</li>
            <li> I love this set, it is absolutely perfect for me.  I have fine hair and have been using a travel set of 5 extra large rollers from Conair for years, and I never knew what I was missing by using such an old-school setter.    The surface of these rollers is really nice and soft (but not spongy) and I could tell a difference in how much more smooth my hair was after one use.  (This must be the ion technology - ?)    But I love that this set comes with traditional setting pins, not clips. And the soft storage bag makes it easy pack up and store around the house or in a carry-on bag.    It&#x27;s worth noting that the instructions outline the warm-up time as 90 seconds for a soft curl and longer for a stronger hold.  I can&#x27;t say how much \\&quot;longer\\&quot; is, but because my hair is hard to curl, I let them heat up for 10 minutes, and I get excellent results every time!    I am officially a Remington fan!  No more Conair for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Remington travel rollers for a long time. The rollers come in 2 sizes and I only like using the big ones. So I combine 2 sets into one - with only the big rollers. I keep one (combined) set in my office to give myself a quick hair-do if I have to go somewhere after work, one set at home and for travel. It is truly dual voltage (though not labelled) and I have been them in many countries without any problem. The rollers heat up quickly and are hot enough, not like some roller sets that never heat up enough to give lasting curls.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this as I travel frequently and needed a portable hot roller set, but these were, frankly, terrible.  Not only do you have to be absolutely sure that they&#x27;re seated exactly right on the metal rod, or they don&#x27;t heat up correctly, but the worst thing was that the metal clip part isn&#x27;t wide enough to secure the roller firmly and so they constantly fell out of my hair.  I found this set to be virtually unusable and was extremely disappointed.  I would definitely NOT recommend them.</li>
            <li> I do love the curlers, but the clips that come with the item for the large curlers do not stay - even without any hair they push off the curler.  They are defective, so it is highly recommended that you buy other clips to secure these to your head - you should not have to do this, but I recommend you do.  The clips for the smaller black curlers work perfectly.</li>
            <li> these rollers are compact, heat up quickly, easy to use, store and travel with, and a great price!!  have had these for about three years and they are still like new...</li>
            <li> These are great. However, the posts to secure the rollers are too small. I&#x27;m glad I saved the posts from my old set. I also think you need to heat it up longer than what it says.</li>
            <li> I took this on a trip to Italy since it was extremely lightweight and dual voltage. It got a lot hotter a lot faster on 220V than at 110V which should be expected. It got hot, my hair curled it did what it was supposed to do. However, The clips used to hold the rollers in my hair did not. The black clips fit perfectly and held the rollers in my hair. The red ones not so much. Of the 5 red clips, only 2 fit, the other ones were constantly coming loose causing the rollers to fall out of my hair. I have long thick hair and could not get by with 5 small rollers and 2 large ones. I thought maybe it was me so I used less hair on the large rollers, to no avail, they still fell out. I have used Remington rollers before with no issue and have a larger set I use everyday at home, but it was too bulky to carry overseas for 11 days. Loved the concept, just frustrated with the outcome. Maybe their QC department needs to look harder at this defect.</li>
            <li> You will be able to use half of the rollers, as the clips for the larger rollers don&#x27;t hold them in place.  Also, the rollers are VERY hot to the touch.  I have regular rollers that are much easier to handle.  I&#x27;m in the process of returning the one I just bought.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hair rollers for loose, bouncy curls on medium length thick hair. My only issue is the clips for the large rollers don&#x27;t stay on and fly across the bathroom.</li>
            <li> My wife had a Remington travel roller set for 30 years that just quit. She looked on Amazon and found a new one. She has been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love  the travel size but if you have thick hair like me, the clips spring off Better for smaller sections of hair or thinner hair</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new set of hot rollers that wouldn&#x27;t take up too much space and would be easy to pack in a suitcase to take with me. This works perfectly. It heats up pretty quickly and works like a charm. I have thin hair so I really only need about 8 rollers for my hair. However if you have A LOT of hair than this might not be enough for you. It does the job I need of it and I have no complaints so far. (I added a photo so you can see what my hair turned out as after just hearing the rollers for 90 seconds then leaving them in until they cooled. I normally have a limp wavy type of hair so this was an improvement! I&#x27;m sure if I heated them longer than I could get more definite curls, but the messy curls was what I wanted. )</li>
            <li> The small rollers are great but the clips for the large rollers do not stay in and the roller slides out of my hair in seconds.</li>
            <li> I gave four stars because the clips keep popping off the curlers. I have a few old clips thst work; and once I get some more, I&#x27;ll be happier with this set. The price is right, they work well, and I love that they are so compact. I only use the large ones. I would give five stars if I could make the clips stay in.</li>
            <li> Useless. Curlers don&#x27;t heat fully. Pins pop off. I have used electric rollers forever . This set is by far the worst. I just got them a short time  ago and need to replace them</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use while on vacation. I was very happy with the product!  After spending the day at the beach, the rollers gave me nice curls after blow drying my hair! The rollers were compact for packing, they heated up in a timely manner and gave the results I wanted! I was able to have the bouncy curly look or I wrapped my hair after using the rollers for a more straight look. I felt like the rollers saved me time in regards to doing my hair, especially since I was in the water everyday of my 7 day vacation! I was not sure if I would like the product,  but I&#x27;m very happy I purchased two sets because I have a lot of hair. The only issue I had with the product was that the pins to hold the rollers in place popped out of my hair. But, I used an additional product,  Conair Super Clips, to keep the rollers in place 2 resolve the issue.</li>
            <li> The curlers heat up fine.  I do have some trouble keeping the pins in my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t need to be curled for long anyway.  I do recommend this product.  I wanted the old Clairol electric curlers and this was the closest I could come to getting them.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace my awesome but really old Remington Travel rollers. Everything about the new ones is fine except the metal roller holders are shaped differently from the old ones. So, they pop off and the roller falls out and there really is no fix for it except to put less hair in each roller. This was never a problem with the previous set and I cannot imagine why the design was changed.</li>
            <li> It does its job except for the clips. I needed to buy the claw clips. I can&#x27;t use these metal thingies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the exact same issue as a number of other reviewers here.  The clips (on the red rollers) will NOT stay in.  You can put them on the roller while in your hair and actually watch them slowly move off the roller until they are far enough off to fly to the floor.  Then the roller falls out of your hair.  I bought at Walmart and like a dummy I threw out the box and receipt.  These are awful!</li>
            <li> I have not used others to compare these with, but they seem to do the job and the service I received&lt;br /&gt;from Amazon was good, price fair. They are compact and convenient for travel.</li>
            <li> These are a big hit with my wife.  She has always wanted something easy to use and compact.  Something to use at home and to take on trips.  Well guys, if your wife requires rollers to style her hair and make you happy, then I would recommend you get a set of these rollers, if you want to stay happy.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy yo use. It is a whole new science for me, but they&#x27;ve made my hair look great!</li>
            <li> These work, but they are heavy and do not hold thick hair into place well. You also need two packages if you have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> my curlers arrived in great time! I tried them tonight after my shower. maybe I didn&#x27;t read the instructions completely but one needs to make sure the curlers are pushed down tight in the case. the instructions said they would heat up in 90 seconds. I found it took longer, maybe that was due to being the first time??? I will try again in the morning. I did get a nice soft curl &amp; bounce with what heat I did get. ( I might been impatient &amp; didn&#x27;t want to wait..... that has been known to happen with me )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; now that I have had more time to try the rollers I am finding  the rollers will NOT stay put. my hair is chin length, I have alot of hair but its fine so when I put in one roller &amp; reach for a second one the first one falls out. I even tried putting the small clips on the large roller.... didn&#x27;t work. I was really hoping these would be an asset &amp; give me the bounce &amp; body I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if you don&#x27;t want your fingers burnt. 1. Those little metal pins do not hold the curlers in place, they fall out and while you try to catch the curler you burn yourself. 2. The fact that you don&#x27;t have the outer layer covered means with a clip means it will cool down your hair faster which means if you want tight curls, it won&#x27;t happen and 3. it is hard to keep the hair and the curlers together as there the curlers are too slippery. I suggest not to buy any of these, I have 2 sets and neither work well.</li>
            <li> Wish it came with better clips. Otherwise works great.</li>
            <li> I have bought a similar set 6-7 years ago in Sweden and I have been more that content. That the reason why I bought two new sets from you. It is as exellent as my first set exept for one thing. The majority of the pins,- mainly the ones with red tops- glides of the curlers causing them to fall off. I have had help from a friend that narrowed the middel parts of the pins and now they are exellent. I suggest though that you alter the pins a bit, so they woun´t glide. All in all I am happy with my sets. .</li>
            <li> Not very happy with these rollers. The large n medium rollers are not as big as I thought. They heat heat up well. But the clips spring off the rollers and the rollers fall out of your hair. :-(</li>
            <li> I returned these rollers because they were too small for my hair.  The packaging was very nice and they certainly would have been easy to pack when traveling but unfortunately they did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I bought this with the hope that I will finally be able to make my hair look nice without going to the salon. And they do work! It is kind of hard to put them on, especially if you have never done your hair before. They do not get too hot, I was able to touch them without burning my fingers. The instructions are very basic so you have to figure it out as you try them on. All and all I like this product, and I can&#x27;t wait for the next big event to make my hair look great!</li>
            <li> I keep this in my suitcase for my travels. It&#x27;s small, lightweight and I like how it curls my hair.  A good buy.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend these hot rollers. It is impossible to roll the hair around them....just slides off. The clips do not fit the rollers, so they just spring out of the rolled hair. I took these on a trip out of town and literally threw them in the trash can in the room....weren&#x27;t worth bringing home!</li>
            <li> This is my third set of these!  I love them - the most recent purchase will be my travel set.  They fit nicely in luggage without taking up space.  I have a set for home that I use everyday.  It is the perfect size - the rollers heat up quick.  One aspect I really like it the smooth surface of the roller so there is no pulling of the hair, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I have bought two sets of these.  Each set has lasted a couple of years.  I really love these.  I travel with them-throughout the U.S.A.  Europe has a different connection, so you&#x27;d need to buy the attachment at a travel shop or on Amazon, if you wanted to use these outside the USA.  You&#x27;d have to do this with a hair dryer or curling iron..  I just wish that you could have either all large size or all medium size.  I saved the large rollers from my fist set for use with my second set.  These are the best heated rollers I have ever owned.  The set is compact and doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the vanity or in my luggage.  My hair looks great after keeping them in for 10-15 minutes.  They don&#x27;t take long to heat up.</li>
            <li> They were bought to be used as a compact travel set and in this respect they are great. This is the second set purchased as the first set worked so well</li>
            <li> I bought my original set at Walgreen.  It lasted about three years and was starting to wear out, i.e. not every coil was heating efficiently.  But for this price, $5 per year, I was pretty darn happy with it.  I went back to Walgreen and bought what I though was the same thing but in a black case.  WRONG!!!  They were &amp;#34;studio beauty&amp;#34;.  They never heated property, I had problems even getting the rollers into the case, the pins never worked on the rollers.  I could not figure out the problem until I finally noticed (duh) they were not the same Remington rollers.  The new ones that I purchased on Amazon work just as well as the first set I had.  Love them.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t buy these in the U.K. so ordered from the USA site. They arrived within 7 days , which I thought was excellent, considering the Christmas post.&lt;br /&gt;These are suitable to use in Europe as they are dual voltage , it states that on the box.&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be some confusion with some reviews saying they are not suitable for use in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;Only a plug adapter is required to use in Europe. They will and do work in Europe !</li>
            <li> My three stars are based largely on the price of these curlers and their convenience for travel. And yes, they will curl your hair, if you can get them to stay in long enough. It is a constant annoyance, however, as the clips are popping out here and there and all over the place the whole while you&#x27;re wearing them. I&#x27;ve owned many sets of curlers in my life, but never any that did this. Further, you have to catch them at just the right moment when they are \\&quot;hot enough,\\&quot; because mere moments later, they will become infernally hot. I will use these until they die, then happily replace them with something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using these on a recent month-long trip, I&#x27;m downgrading my rating to one star. I will not use them until they die, but will replace them before my next trip. The aggravation with the clips just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I guess my hair is very thin- and despite it being very long, I have a really hard time keeping the rolls in place, they fall easily. Maybe I need some more practice. But at least I know it&#x27;s good quality and won&#x27;t damage your hair so much, so it&#x27;s worth a try~</li>
            <li> These are perfect in this cute little case. Just plug them up and they heat quickly. You just leave them in the little plastic pack. super convienient and I love them.</li>
            <li> The large rollers don&#x27;t stay in my hair. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just too fine but the med size stays in great while the large ones fall out no matter what I do. The size is very small and compact so that&#x27;s nice and the rollers get hot...I just wish the large rollers would stay in so they could curl my hair nicer.</li>
            <li> the pins are dosen&#x27;t stay good</li>
            <li> These r excellent travel rollers -I use at home -size is conv-I switch sizes so I have both sizes in each set</li>
            <li> perfect and amazing price</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product in the past. This particular model caused the clips to fly off which was frustrating.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful - since they are package into such a small package. Ten curlers is about 2 curlers too few for my hair - but i make do.</li>
            <li> Half the curlers didnt even heat up and the few that did were not hot enough to curl right. Money waisted.</li>
            <li> Love them.  Use them every day. Great travel size. Quality and performance great. Would order again, for myself or a gift.</li>
            <li> It heats up well, but the clips for the larger rollers don&#x27;t hold well and I have already lost 3.  Clips for the smaller rolls hold great.</li>
            <li> This set is very nice.  Compared with what we used to have in the way of electric curlers, these are compact and sweet!  However, I have discovered after some testing back and forth, that I can achieve the same with a straight iron as far as curls....and it takes up less space and takes much less time.  So these were not a smart buy at all for me.  You win some, lose some.</li>
            <li> So these are my first hot rollers.  I found that they heat up very quickly and the compact size it cool but there are not enough rollers to do my whole head at once!!  Kind of a pain!  Also I have very fine hair with body and these rollers won&#x27;t stay in with the enclosed clips - I had to buy the Conair super clips.  I think I will need to buy another set so I don&#x27;t have to do my hairs twice!</li>
            <li> I love these curlers. I bought 2 sets so that I could get all large and combined them with one set of all large.  They work great and are perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of the size of this product. My sister recommended it to me and she loves it and travels with it everywhere. I will likely give this set to her as well. My hair is very long and thick and the clasps will not hold the rollers in place. For me to do that I need to bring a second set of clips with.....defeated the purpose for travel.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The curls look very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I always get compliments on my hair when I use these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thin long hair. And I use all the rolllers&lt;br /&gt;The clips hold my hair but sometimes fall but nothing to complain about.&lt;br /&gt;I would defiantly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have an older similar set by Remington with large plastic butterfly type clips that went in another separate holder.  These small clips fit inside the case with rollers and my opinion &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; better than the butterfly clips - also takes less packing space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love full size set but for travel to conserve space these work great.</li>
            <li> This a great little roller set.  It heats up very quickly, is compact, and curls really well.  I like them a lot.</li>
            <li> I wrote a scathing review a week ago because the large clips didn&#x27;t fit the large rollers. I emailed the company about the problem, and to their credit, they immediately sent new clips that fit perfectly. Great product and great service. I&#x27;ve changed my review from one star to five stars.</li>
            <li> I love this roller kit perfect for travel/every day, compact and easy to store and the rollers and clips do not leave odd kinks in ones hair like other types of clips and rollers do.  However, I had to take off a star since they changed the clips from the original design. I really wish they would go back to the old design of the old clips as these clips do not hold like the old design of the original clips.  The clips in the picture are the old clip design, but that is not what is in the kit.</li>
            <li> I will admit that my hair is on the short side but I still expected to get curl or additional body from these rollers.  I&#x27;ve had neither and am quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> They work well and give my long hair nice curls at the ends. The curlers heat up in 90 seconds, which is convenient.  Packing is petite and can easily travel in carry on luggage or a large purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a lot of hair like mine, you might want to buy an extra set.</li>
            <li> Pros: I like the tidy little case it comes in. The rollers that DO heat up are hot enough to curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The first two posts do not get hot.&lt;br /&gt;  The pins for the larger rollers pop off - they are not tempered correctly to stay on the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;  I would have preferred for all the rollers to be the smaller size.&lt;br /&gt;  Even though I try to press down on the rollers, random ones do not get hot anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m frustrated with this product and wish I&#x27;d sent it back right away.</li>
            <li> This  portable electric hairsetter works well, but could be designed better.  I had been using a similar one for several years and liked in very much. I bought this one so that I could keep one in my luggage for traveling and one at home for everyday use.  Unlike my original hairsetter, this one has no place to tuck in  the cord to keep it neat and not sprawled all over the counter or drawer when not in use.  My other one has a great Velcro fastener on the outside back.  Very handy!  This one has two small pockets on the inside of the front cover to store your clips for it.  This location makes them somewhat hard to pull out easily . . . and they get a bit hot in there.  In my other hairsetter, the pocket is on the outside of the cover, making access much easier and keeping the metal clips cool to the touch.  Other than these two design problems, this is a great little hairsetter that holds up well and works very nicely.  It&#x27;s not the one I take on my trips, though.</li>
            <li> This product wins on price, packaging, portability, and the cool ends that make the rollers easy to handle.  It heats up in a hurry, too.  Even when I curled less hair around the roller, the clip would not hold the roller in, and I am returning the product.</li>
            <li> These are compact and light weight - travels well.  The only thing that could improve is the heat up time - you have to plan ahead with these.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how small this set of rollers is. It takes up very little room on my counter or in my suitcase. I&#x27;d previously had a set of 5 travel rollers (rollers were the same size as the large rollers here) that took up more space in my suitcase than this. They did a great job on this set with managing space. I had an old big set of rollers that I got rid of because these are so much nicer and compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy a second set so I could have all large rollers. It&#x27;s great that they fit, so I can take one set when I travel. Now I have a spare base and case, and a bunch of small rollers that I add in sometimes. The two sets take up less room on my counter than my old, larger set of rollers. I am not that fond of the clips, like many other reviewers, but they are ok for travel. For home, I bought a set of [[ASIN:B000R87B1Q Conair Hot Roller Super Clips]]. They make rolling my hair a lot faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are marked dual voltage on the bottom, but I have only used them here. I&#x27;m sure they will be fine in Europe with just an adapter plug.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but the pins do not hold the dollars in my hair.  I&#x27;ll put them in and &amp;#34;boing&amp;#34; they pop off.  Would never  have bought them if I had known.</li>
            <li> I really should have reviewed these when I first bought them in fall of 2012.  Mine are starting to wear a bit and once again, I&#x27;m looking to replace them and need BOTH home use/compact size AND travel use.  I WILL BUY THESE AGAIN, UNDOUBTEDLY.  I am an older woman with fine, thin hair - these have been a true lifesaver - easy to use - clipped carefully in place (which you would do with ANY hot roller product IF you have thin, fine hair like mine!)  THEY WORK unbelievably WELL.  Give GREAT CURL and SOFT.  This is a product there is no doubt?  You get &amp;#34;full bang for the buck&amp;#34;.  I once again?  Wear my hair shoulder-length instead of the very &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; style short which everyone seems to EXPECT from us &amp;#34;seasoned&amp;#34; women.  My hair looks great (-and it helps I have very good skin and carefully applied make-up...key facets of &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; with grace!)</li>
            <li> Works like the old time Clairol ceramic hairsetters - nice curls. 4 stars  cause everyone was right, the rod holder pics do NOT stay on the large rollers. No problems on the medium rollers though.</li>
            <li> I keep these rollers in my &#x27;travel&#x27; suitcase as I&#x27;m often on the road -- compact and do the trick (I have long straight hair and use the rollers for body and curl)      -- BUT -- I purchased two sets and moved all the large rollers to one travel pack for my &#x27;travel&#x27; suitcase   AND I don&#x27;t use their clips - I use Conair hair clips which you can purchase on Amazon.       Today I&#x27;m tossing my babybliss rollers and purchasing two more sets to use at home.</li>
            <li> I have short-medium length hair, and needed something to put a bit of body in the ends. This little set works just fine.    Pros: It heats up very quickly, has 2 sizes of rollers, 5 each, the rollers are smooth for less tangling, and the unit never has to leave the pouch. The unit is small and easily packable.    Cons:  Because the rollers are smooth and not prickly, your fingers touch more surface area and they are HOT. The pins provided are not tight enough to hold the rollers as securely as I&#x27;d like, but a few minutes with a pair of pliers took care of that.    Every brand of hot rollers seems to have at least one or two drawbacks. For me, the pros outweighed the cons on this one.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I ordered this based on reviews but so disapponted when I received. It stated 5 large rollers and 5 jumbo rollers - not true! It&#x27;s more like 5 medium rollers and 5 slightly bigger medium rollers.</li>
            <li> The pins that hold the rollers do not fit it and will not stay in your hair.  Not happy with product.  Seller and delivery fine though</li>
            <li> works great, curlers get hot. medium size curlers are small and I have fine short hair. compact size and case makes it great to take anywhere.</li>
            <li> The rollers fall and then you have to go looking for the clips on the floor.  I sent mine back.</li>
            <li> I wish it could have been ordered with all large rollers, but It is small enough for carry-on luggage and works just fine.</li>
            <li> These are great, light weight &amp; fast heating! Perfect for travel, but I use every day!</li>
            <li> I love these, I&#x27;ve purchased over 20 different hot rollers and these are the best/perfect. The size is wonderful, easy to travel with, gets hot enough and sets my hair quickly. Roll these bad boys in your hair, go do your makeup and you&#x27;re hair will be ready when you are. I&#x27;ll purchase these again if i need to, and I&#x27;ve recommended these to many friends.</li>
            <li> I love these hot rollers.  The bottom of the bag contains an electrical base to which the ceramic rollers connect, so you have to make sure that each roller is securely plugged in.  They take very little time to heat up (about two minutes).  The edges of the rollers are cold to the touch, and won&#x27;t burn your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted one star because the clips do not work at all!  They kept slipping and made the whole experience very frustrating.  I will get a set of alligator-type clips for my next use.</li>
            <li> They do the job, are super compact, travel well between different regions (110 and 220 volts), and easy to use... *except* as many other reviewers have pointed out the larger red rollers do not stay and fly off easily. The problem: The pins that hold the rollers in place are mis-sized for the red rollers. Thus, the 3 star review (really more 2.5 for the faulty pins because the set&#x27;s only halfway useful without fully working pins). Amazon, any fix for this??</li>
            <li> I ordered these to try out before I purchased a huge set, but these have seemed to be perfect! My hair is almost mid back andf really thick... Most of my hair fits in these, sometimes I have to do two rounds of curls to get all of my hair, but that&#x27;s OK!</li>
            <li> Curlers do not stay in without using big alligator clips and takes a while to heat.</li>
            <li> The large pins do not hold the larger rollers in place. The pins popped right off the first time I tried to use them and curlers went flying! Its too late for me to return them now, so I will be using hair clips instead. I also wish they would get a bit hotter. Oh, well. I would not buy this set again if given the choice.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but I was looking for bigger rollers.</li>
            <li> I was less than thrilled with these rollers. I got them in and left them in till they cooled. Even &amp;#34;set the curl&amp;#34; like some other customers suggested. The results when I took them out was ok. One hour later my hair was flat again. I used spray also. Going back to my hot comb.</li>
            <li> Unlike the original curlers (like Clairol&#x27;s from the 70s and 80s), these tend to fall out, even without much hair on them.  They are dual-voltage for travel, so all you need is a plug adapter, not a transformer.  I&#x27;m using them in an undeveloped country in Central Asia, so if they work here...!  Make sure they are well-seated into the base.  If they aren&#x27;t heating, that&#x27;s probably the issue.  They&#x27;re OK.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, the clips absolutely do not hold the rollers. By the time you are rolling the third one, the first one is popping out. Or if you are lucky enough to get 4 of them in, suddenly they all pop out. It is infuriating. This went to goodwill the first day I used it.</li>
            <li> The clips do not hold the rollers in place!  Very frustrating experience.  By the time you have four in and are trying to put a fifth in, the 3rd one is slipping out.  I have to keep resetting the clip to get them to stay in.  I would highly NOT recommend these!!</li>
            <li> This are good little hot rollers for traveling.  They are small and easy to use.  They do heat up fast.  The curl seems to hold, but not hold all day long.  They do the job temporarily.  Fast Shipping and Good Packaging.</li>
            <li> Havent had a chance to use them yet because they seem like they take some time to put in... and I have thick hair. They heat up nicely though.</li>
            <li> There was no mention on the advertisement of the fact that that the power point connection on this item is only suitable for US electrical points.&lt;br /&gt;The unit is useless in UK as it cannot be connected to electrical power points. I was unable to source any kind of adaptor for this. I have ancient versions of these rollers and I was hoping to replace them, I don&#x27;t understand why Remington is not supplying UK/Europe market with appropriate goods. I feel there&#x27;s a real goods description problem here, these are advertised internationally and are totally unfit for international purpose.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this and wanted a new and second pair - however the clips were too small for the rollers so now I have to use the clips from my previous set which do fit.  This is a big disappointment because I wanted the second pair so I could leave one set in my suitcase for travel as I travel fairly often for business.  These clips are too narrow so that they all shoot off the rollers once put on.&lt;br /&gt;My old roller kit&#x27;s clips fit these but the point was to have two full kits.  Can I have a set of clips that FIT sent to me?</li>
            <li> I bought this to take to a wedding and I didn&#x27;t understand why the curlers weren&#x27;t heating up.  Well, I was just touching the outside of the container for the curlers.  Once I opened them up they were extremely warm and really held the curls.  Reasonably priced and just the right size for travel.</li>
            <li> I hate these rollers.  I have fine hair and I can&#x27;t get them to stay in my hair.  The clips keep falling out.  It is very hard to get the clip exactly right so that it stays in.  Defnitey wouldn&#x27;t recommend these.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other fine hair people...you can&#x27;t keep these curlers in.  the clips slide off so they roll out. Either the clips are all wrong or the curlers need something more to stick like velvet covering.  Rather than return these I will purchase a bunch of plastic hair clips and just clip the curler with them because they do heat fast and curl nicely.</li>
            <li> The quick curl rolls and the claims keep falling off of my hair.  They don&#x27;t stay long enough to curl my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I love these rollers!  They produce a much more bouncier and longer lasting curl than a regular curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- Small, compact, easy to store and travel with&lt;br /&gt;- Produces a better curl than a curling iron&lt;br /&gt;- Rollers stay in place easily with the pins provided&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not for all hair types.  I have fine, easy to curl hair and when I tried these on my friend (who has thick and hard to curl hair) it was a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;- Not recommended for people not familiar with rolling and setting their hair, in general.  It takes a while to figure out how to roll your hair in the rollers since there is not griping means like velco to hold them down.&lt;br /&gt;- Small number of rollers (only 10 total)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, would recommend this product to anyone who likes to curl their hair frequently without the hassle of a curling iron and setting it in rollers for volume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since I had hotrollers, but the curling iron takes forever and my hair is getting longer, so I thought I&#x27;d give some a go. After looking at many, many reviews and many price ranges, I settled on these. I figured even if I didn&#x27;t like them much, they could still do for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I do like them! The super compact size makes them easy to store under my sink, and they really do a great job of heating up quickly and curling my hair. I know it says 90 seconds, but I give them 3-5 minutes before using them. The holders fit neatly into a couple little pockets inside. I can get most of my hair with one round, but usually have to re-use a couple of curlers to complete the job as I have quite a bit of hair. If I had a whole bunch of hair or way past shoulder length, I&#x27;d probably invest in a second set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons? Not many. It would be nice if there were a couple of spare clips included in the event you miss one. If there were maybe one or two more rollers of each size, I wouldn&#x27;t have to re-use any to finish all my hair. There is no place to store the cord so you have to wrap it around the outside of the bag. But these are quite minor complaints and along with the super compact size and the very affordable price, I am glad to overlook these issues. Great buy!</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I decided on these travel rollers.  As was suggested by a few other people, I purchased two sets and combined the larger rollers as a single set.  The rollers are smaller than one would think for large rollers but from reading reviews I knew what I was getting when I purchased them.  I spent 18 days in Hawaii and California and used these rollers every day.  These are great for travel and I am excited to have them as I travel a lot!!!  I was very pleased, with the outcome. If I didn&#x27;t want a tight curl, I didn&#x27;t leave them in my hair very long.  I have some phenominal clips that I got with a hairsetter years ago, so I didn&#x27;t use the clips that came with the hairsetter as those types of clips have never worked well with my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife as a stocking stuffer (at her request) to replace the one she&#x27;d pretty well worn out.  She liked it so much she wanted another as a replacement.  She has shoulder length hair, and uses it every morning before work.  She loves it.  She bought one for her Mother as well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl the way I expected it to.</li>
            <li> These are awesome!!  Where have they been all my life!?  They get super hot and create beautiful curls in a matter of minutes.  I love using these.  Setting my curls and taking care of things around the house.  By the time I&#x27;m done cleaning or cooking I take the rollers down and my hair is good to go!  I just hope the product lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t decided whether I will keep the rollers as they are medium &amp; large and I need small &amp; medium.  They are excellent rollers, this is my third set but prior sets had 4 small rollers, which I must have.  Too bad Remington doesn&#x27;t &#x27;t sell small rollers separately.</li>
            <li> I used the full set of hot rollers years ago, but now only needed a few curlers and hated heating the big set up for a few&lt;br /&gt;rollers.  This is just the right size.  Heats up very quickly and I am really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is the 4th set of electric rollers I&#x27;ve tried.  My search has ended.  These are awesome and curl my very thick, very straight hair quite nicely.  There&#x27;s even still a bit of wave the next day.</li>
            <li> they do not stay in the  hair I&#x27;ve tried everything to secure them , they  have a coating on them that makes them slide out what a waste of time and money! DON&#x27;T BUY!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent travel rollers.  Been to Europe, America, Panama and will be going around the world with me.  Work great, no difficulty, easy to use, quick, fast, efficient - bottom line - have a great hair day!</li>
            <li> I love the price and it makes my hair wonderful and its a great ourchase anybody that loves hair products should purchase</li>
            <li> I like them.  they work fine.  It&#x27;s hard to get the metal clips on the rollers right, and usually I just use the plastic clips I have for my hair, you know, the ones with teeth that come in different colors, and they work fine.</li>
            <li> work well and are the perfect size for the small bag that you take on a trip..would recommend these ,thanks</li>
            <li> I have very straight and pretty thin hair. I bought these because I see the amazing curl hot rollers can give, and how long that curl can last. I was so excited for them to come. I guess I should have figured, but there are only 6 of the \\&quot;large\\&quot; curlers, and for my medium length hair I have to reheat and reuse them 3 times. Its great for a traveling set, but for everyday, they are a real PAIN!</li>
            <li> Bought these for an out-of-state interview and put them to use the first time the morning of said interview.  I have thin, color-abused hair that sits just below my shoulders and these two sizes were perfect for creating a nice look.  I did not have any problems with the clips, as other reviewers have noted.  I do wish there were just a few more rollers, but I was able to make what was available work.  If absolutely necessary, I could have supplemented with a curling iron.  These rollers were nice and hot within a few minutes and my fingers were kept happily cool by keeping them on the tips of the rollers as I put them in my hair.  Overall, I&#x27;m thrilled with this purchase and may consider buying a second set for when I use these at home.  And from now on, I will only travel with these rollers.  They take up hardly any room at all in my suitcase and work so much better than my old heavy giant set that I&#x27;ve lugged along in the past.</li>
            <li> I love these rollers they are vey practical, heat up fast and very convenient to travel with I use the at home too since they take up very little counter space</li>
            <li> The rollers are so slick they will not cling to the hair. I have tried several times and tried putting product in my hair first. This wa a waste of money</li>
            <li> Within 2 months of occasional (1-2 per week) use, the edges of the heating device stopped working.  Two of the prongs on one side and one of the prongs on the other no longer heat the rollers, which is inconvenient and disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love them , just put , take out and go, very quickly make my hair look beautiful, will buy 2 more , for mum and sister :)</li>
            <li> I own these and left them at my vacation home. I bought these online and assumed I was getting the same great product. Absolutely not. The redesign of the clips is terrible. There is the tiniest bit of rubber tip now which is useless to hold the clip on the curler. They won&#x27;t stay in your hair at all. This alone makes the product completely unusable. My husband watched me try to get ready and couldn&#x27;t believe it as the pins LITERALLY flew out of my hair. I have never had a problem with my older sets. Also, these rollers didn&#x27;t all heat up...only some...and they never got as hot as the older set I have. This was a total disaster and I am completely upset. I threw these in the trash because I was so mad that I had to go out to a function with my hair not done thanks to these awful rollers. Remington??!! What were you thinking??</li>
            <li> Love this item take everywhere, packs and travels well hold curls for days.</li>
            <li> The pins don&#x27;t work on these rollers. They pop out shortly after rolling your hair.and as a result are totally useless. I had another set (same brand) that came with clips that worked great which is why I ordered these. If I can find something to secure the rollers they will be good, otherwise they are headed for the garbage.</li>
            <li> My friend, who has thick, long hair, raved about these curlers. I even got to see her hair after she used these curlers - it looked great! I bought the curlers for my sister, who didn&#x27;t have nearly as much luck. My sister has long, thin hair and the  curls just wouldn&#x27;t stick. Though I don&#x27;t think the performance of the curlers aren&#x27;t to blame, I do think it can take a few practice runs to get used to these curlers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a hot curlers user, not a hot-iron type person. I love the compactness of this set; the curlers heat up very quickly and stay hot; the set is small, easy and lightweight to travel with; the curlers are perfect for my shoulder-length hair; and it&#x27;s very dependable and affordable.  I bought 2 sets and am thinking of getting another to have as a back-up set!  Thanks, Remington!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  This is the second same unit I own.  Great for travel too. The reason I have two sets is I can keep all the big rollrs in one and the smaller ones in the other.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this set!  It heats up in a minute and the rubberized rollers stay in my hair very well.  The curls are just fabulous!  I love the fact that the set is travel-sized, so I can take it with me everywhere I go.  By the way, this is my 2nd set...I bought the first one many years ago and was devistated when one of my kids accidentally threw some of my rollers away.  I immediately bought this set because I missed it so much :)</li>
            <li> I love this product, and it is my first experience with hot roller.  I give this set 4 stars, because I expected large rollers to be really large, but they are not. However, my hair look very healthy, and cute! Heats very fast, and it is simple to use. Rollers stay in place.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could really ask for any more than heated curlers being quick, easy, and compact! No water non-sense is needed. Just plug it in and I waited for about 2mins for it to heat up. The grips at the end are very safe from the heat, and the heat on the curlers isn&#x27;t skin-burning. I left the curlers in my hair for about 10 minutes and my hair was very curly! I put some of them on tight and some not tight to test it out. I have super straight asian hair, so this product is amazing enough that it&#x27;s able to curl my hair in 10 minutes. Highly recommended, especially for the great price.</li>
            <li> What a find!  These heat up quickly and hair seems to hold curl longer and better.  Small enough to fit easily into suitcase.  I ordered a second set for my daughter.  We love that curlers are in two sizes.</li>
            <li> I have never used hot rollers. Encore,  it for the price, it hip ought I&#x27;d take a gamble,  I have very thick, somewhat coarse hair and these rollers just slip right out.  I finally got my hair rolled up sort of, but it was a mess of hair sticking out all over.  Definitely not a product I would. Uh again.  I think Velcro rollers would. E more manageable for all thpes of hair.</li>
            <li> Heat fast. Work great! I use different plastic comb clips that I got at a beauty supply house with them.</li>
            <li> This product heats up quickly, but hair slips off easily.  Wish I had kept the old one I bought twenty-five years ago.  It was slow to heat, but the grippers actually kept the hair on the roller.  These may work on long hair, but they are totally ineffectual for shorter styles.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this two stars is because the rollers do get hot and will create curly hair.  But the design is horrible and the clips slip right off.  It&#x27;s very frustrating.  I want my money back.</li>
            <li> Overall is a standard product. It does not warm up very hot, so you have to keep putting the rollers back in the bag and waiting. I don&#x27;t curl my hair often so it is ok. Would not reccomend for someone who wants to use often.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a good product that curls the hair well. My only complaint would be the pins it comes with. I have to use pins from another curler set to keep the curlers in. It does heat quickly but not as quick as it seems to advertise. Mine are heated in approx 10 min. Very compact so it travels well!</li>
            <li> Great!  It cme quickly and works so well.  I usd to have hot rollers as a kid and missed them so I bought some of these.  Thin Im gonna get an extra set.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Nice purchase. Didnt get as hot as I wished they would, but they do curl great. I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I have used this same type of rollers since I was in college in the 70&#x27;s - Yikes!  And they seem to last forever! My only problem with this one is that the u shaped hooks that keep your hair on the roller - is not very wide.  I have thick hair and the hooks come off the roller.  I ended up using the hooks from my old Remington set, that were larger.  Very compact and they get hot fast.</li>
            <li> These rollers are the best...comact for travel, heat up fast, and great curls...what could be better.  I did purchase plastic roller clips separately as the metal ones that came with the rollers sometimes would fly off.  That is a minor problem.  I have had other hot rollers and these are far and away superior and great price to boot.</li>
            <li> first of all, the rubber curler with these types of curlers are a huge mistake.  i have long long layered cut hair-lots if it-did small sections for rolls and the holders would NOT hold!!  very disappointing!  i&#x27;d rather stick with hot tools curlers-they work so much better!  i had to return this.</li>
            <li> I just used this on a cruise.  It is compact so it travels well.  You do need to push the curlers down on the heating platform as they loosen a little.  Since it was humid and my hair is very fine and straight, the curl did not last long, but it did add body.  The best part was that my fine hair did not get &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; in the curlers.</li>
            <li> Good for travel use.  The rollers really heat up and are hot to hold.  Be careful.  The only drawback is that  sometimes the clips &amp;#34;shoot&amp;#34; off my head. I took these on a cruise and my Husband couldn&#x27;t stop laughing because every once-in-a while we would hear &amp;#34;ping&amp;#34; as the clip shot across the table.  I told him to duck.</li>
            <li> The product is great but smaller rollers for my hair!</li>
            <li> It was a gift and my friend loves it. I have one and it&#x27;s perfect size to take on trips.</li>
            <li> My wife has been looking for curlers that hold. She has long flowing hair, this style is a little more difficult to find. The heat up fast, travel well and the stay put. She likes them so well a bought three!</li>
            <li> I went to Italy this summer for a month and knew I needed hot rollers to take with me. I had a set just like this one many years ago. This was perfect. Compact and light. I sometimes had trouble getting the pins to hold the rollers in my hair. I figured out that was because I have fine hair. Therefore, I just put a bigger chunk of hair around the roller and that seemed to solve the problem.</li>
            <li> I like the small compact soft case, which is good for travel.  However, I agree with other reviewers that the red clips don&#x27;t stay in!  Seconds after carefully rolling up the curler, the red clips will pop out and out goes the roller.  The clips pop and go flying all over the bathroom or wherever you&#x27;re doing your hair.  I don&#x27;t have this problem with the small, black curlers.  So I&#x27;m going to buy other hair clips to use with the red curlers.  Overall, the curlers heat up enough and do their job, but the red clips don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> These are great rollers!  They heat up fast and are compact and easy to pack. If I could redesign the case, I would eliminate the clear top, which cracks eventually (but, for the price, who cares?) and I would put the pouch for the pins on the outside.  I still rate these as a 5 for value and convenience, though.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several sets of these rollers over the years and they work well and heat quickly.  I bought a new set recently and really don&#x27;t like the clips that came with the rollers.  The clips are different than the last two sets of this same product and they don&#x27;t work at all, popping out after 5 seconds or so and the curler crashes to the floor.  Without the clips, these curlers are really useless so I have to give it a very poor rating and review.</li>
            <li> I would like them to be more hot, I have lo turmed on like hours before I wear them to get just a little curl in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love it and so does my daughters.  We all use it and get awesome curls.  Note: for longer hair past the shoulders I would suggest bigger rollers.</li>
            <li> I love these, they make my hair look smooth and just enough curl to look fuller. It only takes a minute or so with the curlers in, to get the look you will love. A great buy.</li>
            <li> I received these and used them yesterday THEY ARE AWESOME!!! work so good and they are definately perfect for travel..</li>
            <li> I have the same problems mentioned by many of the one-star reviewers - the clips are too short for the roller, the roller&#x27;s surface can&#x27;t handle my fine hair, etc. A useful travel size for emergency use only.</li>
            <li> THEY DO HEAT UP FAST... AND THE SIZE IS PERFECT, BUT WHEN YOU PUT THEM ON THEY DO NOT STAY IN PLACE... THE PIN DON&#x27;T HELP...ROLLERS. AND THEY ARE TOO HEAVY FOR THE ACTUAL PIN</li>
            <li> Not nearly enough rollers, in my opinion. Does not get very hot, I think.Has rubber around rollers. I would not buy for myself.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and ordered two. There is no way one would have been enough. These heated up within 5 minutes and went in easily once I figured out the metal hooks. I left them in while I finished getting ready so about 20 minutes. Wow! The curls were great!! They were nice, full and held up well. I might have to see if I can find a jumbo size now for more of a loose wave. My only dislike was the metal clips, they hurt my head. Also the plastic smell was a little unbearable at first. I had to air them out before I could use them.</li>
            <li> Had these for almost a year now and they still work great. I have thick medium/long hair so I use 2 picks (some left overs from my old hot roller set) per roller to hold them on top of my head. If you don&#x27;t have any extra I would order more.</li>
            <li> Product is simple to use.  However doesn&#x27;t work well for extensions.  Curlers don&#x27;t get hot enough for the hair to actually hold a curl, and the clips don&#x27;t stay put.  Would be an excellent product for someone with thin natural hair, anything aside from that I would suggest an acutal flat iron, wand, or curling irons.</li>
            <li> The curlers are great but the clips are difficult to use on clean hair. They tend to slip/fly off across the room making it hard to put them in. I can usually get it but it takes me a few tries. I would recommend the clips that go over the curler instead. Once the clips are in though, they work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I bought this set yesterday, and used it for the first time this morning.  The curlers are great, but I have slippery hair and probably should have purchased flocked rollers.  The clips are TERRIBLE.  Since this is my first experience with hot rollers, it took more time than I anticipated. The clips kept springing off.  I do have some clamps that I use to keep my hair back, and that helped tremendously.  I am keeping the rollers, but getting come clamps to keep them on my head.  They are very compact, and will be useful in our motorhome.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work well, no matter how long you let it heat or how long you leave the rollers in. A waste of money but what can you expect for the price.</li>
            <li> The product is fine for average hair, but, as I suspected, they don&#x27;t stay in my fine hair. I&#x27;m not complaining because I knew I was taking a chance, and I only paid $10 (opened package return). I may do the same.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, so this small kit is just perfect. It&#x27;s fast and doesn&#x27;t get super hot, so I&#x27;m not as worried about heat damage to my hair. The waves you get are just effortlessly pretty! I might have to order some plastic clips, but no complaints here!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading some of the reviews. These rollers are NOT for long silky hair. They never hold my hair and fall down. The pins are useless and do not do any work.</li>
            <li> Nice set of rollers at a great price. They heat up fast and are easy to use. I even got an extra set to leave at my Mom&#x27;s house so I don&#x27;t have to bring a set when I visit.</li>
            <li> The clips could be a little bigger. They keep &#x27;popping&#x27; off particularly on the red rollers. I had to buy some giant clips to help keep them anchored.</li>
            <li> Have used twice - bought for travel use only.  For some reason the black curlers are hotter than the red.  Thought about returning it , but not worth paying hte return shipping.</li>
            <li> What a bargain. This is my second set of these rollers. I had the first set for 3-4 years. I like them for travel since they are so compact but I used them every single day. They hold up under the beating they get because I drop them on my ceramic tile floor all the time. I have super fine, straight as a stick hair with no body what so ever. If you use 8-10 they give you curls, less you get waves and less just body. Lasts all day even after I brush out the hairspray. Still have body and waves until I wash my hair again the next morning.</li>
            <li> These are a great value and an even better deal on Amazon. They are so compact, they are easy to take along and at home take little space.  They heat quickly and seem gentle on the hair.  Sometimes the pins slip out if you have too much hair on the roller.  I got some clips to hold mine in place.</li>
            <li> The rollers are fine for short, thin hair.  Hard to keep pins in. I would rebuy these but they are just okay--nothing great.</li>
            <li> Good rollers, some didn&#x27;t clip in very well in my medium length layers but the long layers were ok. I need to get the hang of clipping them in and not burning my fingers. Its been SO many years since I used hot rollers and they haven&#x27;t changed. These are good overall</li>
            <li> I have not used this product yet, but I have a similiar one to it and liked it very much.  thanks</li>
            <li> I put this on my wish list after reading some of the positive reviews, and ignoring the negative ones.  I received it for Christmas and quickly discovered that the negative reviews were all true.  The rollers heat unevenly.  Every day that I use it, I have one lock of hair that is nearly straight because that particular roller didn&#x27;t heat up properly. Also - for some reason, the clips for the red rollers don&#x27;t hold them in place even a little bit.  I found it necessary to go out and buy some clips to keep them in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  If you decide to ignore the negative reviews and go for this, do yourself a favor and buy some roller clips in the same order.  Trust me, you&#x27;ll need them.</li>
            <li> Good starter kit but I seriously need another set to cover my head. Tip:  Pin up and take down when it has completely cooled down, last all day.</li>
            <li> great product. will work with again!</li>
            <li> This product works just great and the assortment of sizes works well for me. Would recommend for anyone. My daughter tried it and was amazed at how quick curled or waved her hair.</li>
            <li> Short and crisp (used 15 days)&lt;br /&gt;Pros:-&lt;br /&gt;1. Get heated in 90 - 180 seconds&lt;br /&gt;2. Universal voltage converter&lt;br /&gt;3. Easy to carry.&lt;br /&gt;4. No shock or current&lt;br /&gt;5. Can hold from end , heat resistant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:-&lt;br /&gt;1. Very unusable rollers pin. Buy only if intent to seperately purchase rollers clips.&lt;br /&gt;2. Rollers are rubberised coated from above.&lt;br /&gt;3. Medium size rollers take a little more time to heat up, but not any major issue.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these in the mail when they came! The price is great and the compact size would fit so much better in my luggage, but they don&#x27;t get hot enough in comparison to my regular curlers (Vidal Sassoon VS321). I&#x27;d say lukewarm at best and the curl im used to lasting all day falls flat after an hour. I will be returning.</li>
            <li> Clips NEVER stayed in. Looking for better set.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that these would be great but they didn&#x27;t heat up evenly. I returned them and am sticking with Conair.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!!! Great Price! Great Product!!!!</li>
            <li> Pros:  Small, outside is soft fabric as it should be for travel  Cons:  set is too heavy, rollers are made of hard rubber and are so heavy that fall right out of my hair and won&#x27;t say in with the pins, the cord sticks out the back with no velcro holder just hangs out, the top does not zip so the rollers and pins can fall out.  I had the Remington H1022 for 8 or 10 years - a long time - and it is the perfect product - flocked, lightweight curlers that stay in hair, heat up but don&#x27;t burn fingers, heats fast, very nice zip cover so things parts don&#x27;t fall out and a holder for the cord.  A couple heating elements are finally going out which is why I had to order the new version.  Are there no women who work at Remington that can try out these designs - who thinks it is a good idea to have heavy hard rubber curlers held in your hair with little pins?  Bring back the H1022.  Charge more and people who want quality will pay.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this compact set of rollers. I have very thick shoulder length hair and I can have my dried hair styled in literally 6-7 minutes and out the door. I wish all 10 rollers were the large ones as I don&#x27;t like a tight curl. I put the 5 big ones around head on top layer of hair. Then apply smaller rollers around bottom layer for maybe 2 minutes tops. It gives me the lift at the roots that I want and body without looking styled and curly. Compact size is great for travel and the 90 second warm up time is amazing. 10 large rollers and this would have been a 5 star for me. Hey, the price was great and I was sceptic. I am now loving this set. May still look for a similar one with the 10 large but this was a great buy and deal.</li>
            <li> I had used this roller set a few years ago and loved it.  Not sure why I ever got rid of it!  Fast forward to now, I order this one, which is the same roller set I used before, except the large clips that go with the red rollers DON&#x27;T FIT!  They are too small.  So invariably, once you put the roller in and clip it, the clip slides off, springs across the room, and the roller drops off your head.  I&#x27;m picking up clips and rollers out of the sink, off the floor, from the toilet . . . you get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the attached photo, you can see how the clip for the small black roller fits just fine.  The red one is gapped because it&#x27;s too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the clip would fit, this set would be perfect and I&#x27;d rate it 5 stars.  I love the curls it leaves in my shoulder-length, fine hair . . . when it will stay in my hair long enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I contacted Remington to get them to send me clips that fit; they did indeed send 6 more large clips, but those still didn&#x27;t work with my roller set!  And I&#x27;m now past the return period with Amazon.  THIS SUCKS.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time! The rollers do work well and are reasonably priced but, all the clips are in  similar shades of blues  which causes confusion when trying to set your hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set a couple of years ago based on one review that said the rollers were the closest one can get to the old Clariol rollers &amp;#34;your mother used to have&amp;#34;.  This is correct; they work well for medium to longer hair, heat up quickly, and don&#x27;t leave &amp;#34;pin marks&amp;#34; on the hair.  However 10 rollers really isn&#x27;t enough; one needs 12 or 14.  Therefore I recently  purchased a SECOND set in order to have more curlers.  The pins on this &amp;#34;latest&amp;#34; set are different from those on my original purchase-  smaller plastic end pieces which don&#x27;t seem to hold the rollers as well.</li>
            <li> These are okay.  They take longer than my old set to heat up and turn off faster than I would like.  Of course, my old set was ruined because I forgot about them, so I won&#x27;t complain too much about that last one.  My biggest gripe is actually about the wire clips, if you can call them that.  My old set, which was essentially the same, but red and green,  held my hair just fine.  These wire clips hold nothing.  They don&#x27;t even go on all the way.  Perhaps this is my fault.  Maybe, I&#x27;m just not putting enough force on them.  If it turns out to be user error, I will happily update my review.</li>
            <li> Works great. I have very long hair and I love these. MUST USE CLIPS. The little metal things do not work at all.</li>
            <li> Love how fast they heat up, but most of all the the curls.The pins hold the hair in place very well.</li>
            <li> this is my second set in the last 15 years, really hold up well and great for traveling</li>
            <li> Horrible, for a &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; set, the rollers are heavy. I have thin hair and the clips are too small to even hold an empty roller. You can watch it slowly slip out and drop to floor. No matter how much hair I put in roller. I can&#x27;t use them. ;(</li>
            <li> Compact, heats up well, nice travel kit</li>
            <li> I love this rollers sooo much! I have long thick hair that would NEVER hold a curl before I found these. My only reason for giving them 3/5 stars is that the clips for the red rollers do not fit. Like at all. So unless you have another option, I&#x27;d recommend only planning to use the 5 black ones. Like I said, I have long, thick hair, so 5 small rollers doesn&#x27;t really work for me. So I&#x27;ve ordered another set so I don&#x27;t have to keep rolling 1/4 of my head at a time!</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, travels well, and curls great.</li>
            <li> The curlers do heat up pretty quickly but they are too hot to the touch.  The curler pins&lt;br /&gt;do not hold the hair to the curler.  They pins pop off and curlers fall out of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Very hard to keep on your head,quite heavy too, keeps falling off.The clips they came with are no help either.Why make these products if they&#x27;re so nonfunctional ,very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great roller set, compact, great when traveling, heats fast, good curl produced.</li>
            <li> I have had these wonderful curlers before and this was the only place I could buy them. They are SO GOOD - light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The hair setter is compact and lightweight, which makes it ideal for travel.  However, there are two flaws that caused me to only give this product 2 stars.  First, the pins for the larger rollers are not sized correctly, and they pop out no matter how little hair you put in the roller.  Second, the rollers do not heat up evenly--some heat up well, while others are only lukewarm.  Very disappointed and would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> These just didn&#x27;t work on my hair :(</li>
            <li> Rollers reach a high temperature quite quickly and are easy to handle. The massive draw back us that the clips don&#x27;t fit the rollers properly and they constantly fall out. If I could find clips to fit I would be giving the 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I thought this small, compact set would be good for traveling but these rollers drive me crazy.  They are so slick that they don&#x27;t catch the ends, and with my shoulder length hair, when I try to tighten them for rolling, they slip out.  The clips are way too narrow and short to catch your hair and have leverage against your scalp, also contributing to rollers falling out.  I had to use long bobby pins and even they didn&#x27;t keep the rollers tight. I have years of experience with ceramic rollers. This is just a bad design for hair like mine (thick, shoulder length).  I am going back to my Conair traveling set (12 rollers including 8 large) which works fine.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and don&#x27;t need a lot of heat.  These curlers take about 15 min. to get hot enough to curl my hair.  I purchased 2 sets because I use 20 rollers.  For international travel, I use just one base. I remove the base from the other case (it slips out easily), and use the 2nd case just for the spare rollers.  As I use a roller from the base, I replace with a spare.  By the time I use the first 10 rollers, the others are almost hot enough.  These two compact cases can be tucked into small spaces in your luggage and don&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> The overall unit has a great compact size and shape.  They heat up quickly and get more hot than my previous rollers did, which I like.  However, they break very easily.  I had one set that broke in less than a year, then because I liked the product so much I ordered a second set, which also broke within 6 mos.  Too bad, a great product until it breaks.</li>
            <li> love size but really does not curl my hair like my large one does</li>
            <li> They get pretty hot which is what I was looking for. The clips aren&#x27;t the best but I have another kind that I use with them instead. I traveled with them recently to the UK and they worked fine with the adapter.</li>
            <li> The clips keep coming out no matter how many ways I try to attach them, then the rollers fall out. Took it on a vacation due to the compact size.  Will never use it again.</li>
            <li> I have bought and tried many travel hot rollers, and these are the best.  They travel well and behave fabulously!</li>
            <li> CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THESE&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE 4 SETS</li>
            <li> The rollers do get hot enough but the wire clips are not strong enough to hold in the larger curlers.......I would not buy these again&lt;br /&gt;because of the bad clips.........</li>
            <li> I have long hair and lots of it. These are easy to use, quick to heat up and perfect for traveling! They give me loose bouncy curls that last all day. My only complaint would be the clips that come with, I didn&#x27;t feel they held well so I bought some inexpensive jaw style clips from my local beauty store and they work amazing!</li>
            <li> Perhaps my hair is too thick but I could not keep these rollers on my head. They heat up fast and are very easy to pack but I left them behind.</li>
            <li> My favorite set of rollers that I use at home and when traveling.  I have moderately thick but fine hair down to mid back with long layers.  The larger size roller is perfect.  I had my first set for ~5 years before replacing the case when it started taking longer to heat up and never reached a hot enough maximum temperature although the rollers themselves were still in great condition.  I suspect this may be related to the number of times I left them on for prolonged time periods by forgetting to unplug.  In fact that is the only feature I think they are missing, auto-off.  When I purchased the second set, I placed all the large rollers in new case.  They heat up in just 2-3 minutes.  I can create several different styles from just a little bounce and shine, curly ponytail, or fluffy defined curls all over depending on the number of curlers, how long they set, and if I bother with curl holding gel (I hate the feel of hair spray so rarely use).  Sometimes I use the metal pins that came with them although they don&#x27;t hold as securely but don&#x27;t leave any crimp marks on hair and sometimes I use [[ASIN:B000R87B1Q Conair SPC10X Super Clips, 10 Count]] which hold more securely but have to be careful or they leave crimp marks.</li>
            <li> Works great for my hair. I have very thick and long hair. It&#x27;s easy quick and the curls last about 6 hours in thick long heavy hair. The cover is compact and very easy to travel with and stuff in that small space in the drawer.</li>
            <li> These rollers work well. I have a larger set at home that I use often. The set I have at home feels like it gets hotter but gives me the same curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind this is ten rollers. It is enough for my hair - 2 inches below shoulder and not thin nor thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for traveling - takes all the fuss out of what to do with my hair&lt;br /&gt;  - very compact size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clips - they are not the best but the claw clips take up extra space. When you get good with the curler pins it should be fine. if you would rather not worry about one of your rollers falling out while you are running around your hotel room getting ready - get the claw clips and pack one less pair of shoes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all - compact, ten rollers, does not feel scalding hot but gives a great curl.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would be good for travel or even keeping in my office for quick styling.  It appeared to be defective in that only the two curlers on the end heated up after several minutes.  These curlers are much much smaller than they appear in the pictures.  If you have short hair and get a set that works properly it would be a good deal for you the case and pin holder compartment is a good functional concept.</li>
            <li> the picture of the roller looks alot bigger than what it is. the large rollers are on the small size. On that note, beside the roller being on a little small side it does get the job done, curls up the hair pretty nice just have to let it heat up about 15 minutes NOT in 90 seconds which was directed on the box.overall its a perfect size to pack and go with you to travel with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with these curlers. They heat up very fast and are easy to pack around. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time!  The rollers were a bit smaller than I wanted, but they are convenient for traveling.</li>
            <li> The clips that hold the roller in the hair are much too short.  Rollers fall out.  If clips were longer, they would probably work.  Suggestion: Make longer clips. Other than that, it looks to be a nice product even though I wasn&#x27;t able to try it out. Signed, Spouse.</li>
            <li> I travel a ton for work and have been looking for some rollers that were both a great quality, and a space-saver. After seeing that these were the top selling curlers on Amazon, I thought why not give them a whirl.These do not heat up as quickly as advertised, but they do their job perfectly and have a great price point.</li>
            <li> This set packs up easily in the suitcase, gives tight, cute curls, and is easy to use! Heats up fast, so I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> They leave my hair looking professionally done. While the curl doesn&#x27;t last--for some reason, it leaves my hair looking softer...</li>
            <li> For some reason the clips didn&#x27;t fit correctly and would pop off as you were curling your hair.  You&#x27;d have to go all around the room to find them.  Had to get some pliers and adjust the tension now seem to work better.  Just seems like the wrong sizes were sent.  Love the product otherwise-heats quickly, curls nicely.</li>
            <li> These are ok, I had a lot of trouble with the medium rollers. The pins that hold them in your hair seemed to be too small and the rollers kept poping out. I got very frustrated and ended up flat ironing my hair. If you but this also by better clips to hold the rollers in.</li>
            <li> These rollers get HOT and can burn your hair and scalp. They fall out easily and the combo (5 small, 5 medium) just isn&#x27;t enough to curl your whole head - even with shorter hair (mine is just about chin length). Waited to long to return - just tossed them in the trash.</li>
            <li> These rollers make great curls if you can get them to stay in! The pins as another reviewer stated are useless!!! I bought a set of generic roller clips to use with these. Now the have 3 stars for a reason. If the clips worked I&#x27;d have given them 5 stars. Cons: The pins do not work you need to buy your own clips  Pros: Compact Great Curls They get very hot very quickly Travel well- easy to pack in a weekender or backpack  Update: Even after trying multiple types of clips these DO NOT STAY IN. Complete waste of money. My MIL who has thicker hair also tried these to no avail</li>
            <li> I had hot roller for many years, so I decided to purchase new one. This  makes perfect curls!! It doesn&#x27;t take long to heat ether. I really recommend this to anybody who need to replace hot roller.  Its compact size makes it  Perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> I bought these curlers years ago at a local mass retailer, and have been in love with them ever since.  I&#x27;ve used many other sets of curlers in my life, and these are the best on the market today.      The set is small and compact and heats up quickly, thus is great for both home and travel.  I travel a lot for work, and have never regretted using part of my precious carry-on suitcase space to bring these curlers with me.  I have thick, shoulder-length, naturally curly hair (type 3a) but find I often need a more tame/professional look at work, and these do the trick (and also require MUCH less product to keep my hair looking nice, which is a huge benefit when traveling).  I use the larger rollers at the crown of my head, and the smaller ones on the shorter hair at the side and in the back; for the small rollers, I put more hair in them so the curls don&#x27;t end up like ringlets. I leave them in a few minutes, then spritz with a bit of hairspray after I take them out, and am ready to go.  If any sections of hair come out too ringlet-like, I&#x27;ll tug the curl out a bit before spraying. I end up with large wavy frizz-free curls that are manageable, soft, and hold all day.  If I&#x27;m at home or getting ready for a non-work occasion, I&#x27;ll often leave in a bit longer to get tighter curls.    Finally - I know one of the most important feature in a hot roller is how well it stays secured in your hair, and that can differ significantly based on hair type; these work phenomenally for me (the combination of the rubberized texture of the roller, and the type of pin included).  I&#x27;m not sure how well they would work for people with thin/fine hair, although I also used them once on a friend who has very fine/thin hair, and they worked well on her too.</li>
            <li> These rollers actually put a &amp;#34;bend&amp;#34; in my medium length, thick gray hair.  They got hot surprisingly fast and the compact size of the unit fits into a suitcase as well as the last corner not in use on the bathroom counter.  For a quick fix - as opposed to a permanent - this is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.  My hair was fried while dyeing it, and these curlers make my hair feel very soft.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I had to buy 2 sets because I wanted all the curlers to be the same size (lg).  I never turn it off so it is ready whenever I am.  The last 2 sets lasted 4 years being on all the time so I am thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li> this is my 1st set of rollers, but i&#x27;m very pleased with them.  i have fine hair that won&#x27;t hold curl....i&#x27;ve tried products and curling irons/ flat irons to curl it....you name it!  well i tried these and all i did was wash, dry my hair, but some heat protective product on it and put the rollers in.  i let them heat up for about 10 min and then put them in and let them do their thing while i do my make-up.  by the time i&#x27;m done, so is my hair.  i don&#x27;t roll them all the way to my head, so i can get a looser curl, but overall i&#x27;m happy with the results and my hair has a curl all day!!!</li>
            <li> I use these for daily styling and for travel. I love the design and how easy they are to pack, but they are also good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> These rollers heat up fine -- but they get so hot and it&#x27;s hard to hold them and put them in.  I even went back to my old electric rollers that were older and take longer to heat up -- but at least I don&#x27;t burn my fingers on them.  I like the small, travel aspect of this set, but they are not as easy to use and put in because of the way they are structured.  Your fingers get burned putting them in.</li>
            <li> some reviews said these don&#x27;t get hot, not true in my case but i think i have an explanation for that. you have to be sure to push the rollers down pretty hard onto the electrical component (I didn&#x27;t realize they weren&#x27;t down all the way at first). My hair is long and fine, never holds a curl even with a curling iron. But these did! they actually worked and in a very short amount of time, and even though it was my first time using hot rollers and I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing. I didn&#x27;t use any product at all so the curls came out in about 30 minutes, but any rollers or irons would do that.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m a hair idiot and i like them</li>
            <li> I had one of these I bought at a PX in Italy.  Bought this one for my daughter in law.  This is a great set...compact and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Thougnt this product would work on curly hair but there is no grip to hold hair onto rollers, making hair just slip off rollers. Pins do not hold rollers in place. Should have believed reviews I read prior to purchasing. Returning would cost about as much as cost of rollers. Guess I&#x27;ll just give them away.</li>
            <li> They work, but it&#x27;s probably not a good idea to get heated rollers if you don&#x27;t really know how to use them :). Also, I could&#x27;ve done without the extra clips I ordered with them, the suck and their hold on the rollers aren&#x27;t that great at all.</li>
            <li> This was my first foray into hot rollers and not knowing how well they would work for my hair type, I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on a set.  This set fit the bill nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Heat up quickly&lt;br /&gt;Case is compact, keeps all the pieces together for both use and storage and is easy to put away&lt;br /&gt;Two sizes in rollers, so I could see what fits best in my hair&lt;br /&gt;Gives my hair body that lasts all day- nearly impossible to do otherwise!&lt;br /&gt;Price- if the set hadn&#x27;t done what I wanted it to do, I wouldn&#x27;t be out much&lt;br /&gt;Quick shipping with Prime&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;No auto shut-off feature, which makes it a bit of a safety hazard&lt;br /&gt;Not always easy to get hair to get on to rollers without kinking (I have fine hair with layers, so it&#x27;s a struggle to get the longer and shorter pieces to all stay secured)&lt;br /&gt;Pins aren&#x27;t very effect at securing rollers- I&#x27;ll have them rolled up against my scalp but they&#x27;ll slip down a couple inches once I \\&quot;secure\\&quot; them&lt;br /&gt;Rollers themselves are a bit heavy and prone to pull at hair if not put in just right&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being new to hot rollers, I&#x27;m not sure if my issues with getting rollers in place and securing them are going to be common to any set or not. All in all, I found the hassles to be worthwhite as I&#x27;m able to give my hair the kind of waves that have never before been possible- other methods always fall out within the hour!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m happy with this set.  At some point, I may upgrade now that I know that the concept of hot rollers works with my hair but for now, I find the pros outweigh the cons and I like the new styling options they give me.</li>
            <li> For everyday use, I use the Remington Pearl heated clip curlers, which I love, but the unit is really large. I travel quite a bit, so I was looking for something small and functional... and this is it! It is very compact and light-weight. It heats right up in about 5 minutes. If the curlers are not heating up, but sure that they are connecting properly at the base (check that the prongs are properly aligned and press the curler down to ensure a good connection). I had no problem getting the curlers to stay in my hair with the provided pins. I have medium-thick hair, and I can get by with the 10 curlers without having to re-heat them and curl my hair in sections. I find that these (compared to the R. Pearl unit) need to heat up a little longer, stay in my hair a little longer, and (obviously) there are far fewer curlers, so maybe this unit is not great for everyday use, but it is an excellent choice for travel! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Perfect for the cruise I went on!  I bought one set for me and another for my dtr who has long hair.  She loved it!!</li>
            <li> I rated this a 3 because I hardly use them and its takes me a while to get situated in my hair, Im better off using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> the red curlers don&#x27;t stay on your head and the pins pop off.....I have two sets of these so I can have all black.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly and stays in well in thick hair. I noticed some reviewers complained some curlers didn&#x27;t get hot. You have to make sure all the curlers are pushed fully into the base since the heat transfers from the connection at the base of each curler.</li>
            <li> Guess I expected &amp;#34;Large&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34; to be a bit bigger... rollers look more like Medium and Small to me, but I&#x27;m not a roller expert.  Did try them and am happy with the results...gives gorgeous waves, which soften to perfect beach waves.  Even better, the package is SUPER small and LIGHT.  Can totally see hauling these on many trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cushion on roller is slightly rubberized and holds hair super well.  Can wind-up hair tight and they don&#x27;t budget during setting time.  Big improvement on rollers I&#x27;ve tried and then ditched in the past.</li>
            <li> I love these... so much!  I blow dry and flat iron my naturally curly hair.  The second day it needs some ooomf and these do the trick!  The flocked or velvet-ish textured ones are NO good for naturally curly hair, they leave you with a fluffy look.  These rollers are a smooth texture and give my hair a more defined, bouncy volume.  They&#x27;re the size of a brick, which is awesome for travel! May need two sets if you have fuller hair... but even two sets of these would take up less space than one set of other rollers.</li>
            <li> If the curls held, this would be the best invention ever made. I put them up and leave them for 5 min or so and then take them off, that is so much faster than any other hair curler, but my curls though they look great, they barely hold for one hour, I figure it&#x27;s not hot enough... or need some kind of hair spray... not sure...</li>
            <li> They are great rollers. I liked them so much I purchased a second set. I have not used them for travel as of yet...but these are now part of my primary go-to hair style.</li>
            <li> This curler set replaced a small Conair jumbo set I have had for years before it tried to burn up.  While these curlers are not the jumbo-size, they still do well in my volume-less hair to give me a little body.  I have decided I really like them as besides body, they also give my hair a little curl on the bottom - or curve, depending on how long I keep them in.  Two pointers:  Do not count on them being hot in 90 seconds.  I heat mine for about 5 minutes.  Secondly, make sure all the curlers are pushed securely to the bottom of the base, because if they aren&#x27;t, they won&#x27;t get hot at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good set and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Need more practice, but overall it&#x27;s a good product.  Worth the money.  I&#x27;m used to using curling iron, so we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I had a similar set for many years, but the rollers appeared not to heat up as well over the last year.  I was glad to find this replacement since I found that the rollers heat up quickly and hold the waves I am looking for.  The fact that the ends stay cool is a plus since they do get quite hot.</li>
            <li> I saw the great reviews and figured why not, for $14 it can&#x27;t hurt. Well, it DID hurt! These are way too heavy for me. It was painful to leave them on while I applied makeup because they weigh down and pull your hair down! Ouch! And the metal clips...if they aren&#x27;t poking you in the head, they are popping off and unraveling the roller as it falls to the floor. It also takes about 4-5 minutes to heat up.. Then, be careful of the metal prong part on the roller that sits in the case...it is SUPER hot and it touched my ear and burned it. I had to roll it facing away from my skin and then i struggle keeping it in my hair because the clips kept popping off. I had a nice curl though that lasted maybe an hour with lots of spray. So, all in all, the 1 star reviewers were right. I have very long medium thickness hair. I was able to get all the rollers in my long hair so the number of rollers is sufficient. That&#x27;s about the only plus to this product.</li>
            <li> Great rollers at a great price.  Convenient size for everyday use and for traveling.  One thing I do not like is that the rollers are so hot it burns my fingers to use them.  There should be a &#x27;cool&#x27; spot to hold them while you are putting them in your hair but there isn&#x27;t.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Curlers get nice and hot, however I cannot get the clips to stay on, especially the larger rollers! I have tried numerous ways and they end up popping off and flying across the room. I am going to look for different clips for them.</li>
            <li> Purchased these to use when traveling.  Have ended up with them being my go-to hot rollers.  Very compact, and if you don&#x27;t need a lot of rollers, a great choice.  Reliable, even after being jostled in a suitcase time and time again.</li>
            <li> I love these things!! I have fairly long (middle of my back) thick, but fine hair.... and these work like I want. I actually use them with no product and the curls hold great for about 6-8 hours. If I tweak it just right I can use the 4 big curlers on my under hair and the other 4 smaller ones on the top, let them sit while I do my makeup and hello beautiful curls. Once is awhile I need an extra so I just pop it back in the warmer and it&#x27;s ready in less then a minute.</li>
            <li> It is compact and comes with it&#x27;s storage, carrying bag.  Rollers do warm up quickly, without getting too hot.  Two sizes of rollers for more definition of  curls.  Only negative part is that rollers connectors are clip type and they have to be inserted into their slots perfectly or they will not make connection to heat -- this takes some time to figure out and slip in correctly.</li>
            <li> These rollers are compact yet high heat. They do not burn my fingers but they give plenty of heat to curl my hair. Perfect for throwing in your bag to take on a trip but I use mine at home as well.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can think of against these hot rollers is that the pics tend to fall out.  Otherwiase works well and is very fast!!</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised that these worked so well!!  My hair never holds a curl for very long and I was able to have my hair curly all through Easter service and lunch after!!  My curls were just the right amount of bounce and shiny as well!  I got 2 sets as I have a ton of hair and knew that one set would not work for all of my hair.  I love that the case is so compact!  I can stack them on top of each other on my bathroom counter and they hardly take up any room.  I may by the hair clip style &#x27;pins&#x27; to hold them as I have never been able to get the handle of the traditional ones.  But that would be my only complaint.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. I bought 2 and use them almost every day. The clips are essential. The heat fast and curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer:  have never tried hot rollers before so i have never tried other products to  compare this with.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that: I LOVE my hot rollers.&lt;br /&gt;They are compact and they work wonders. I feel like they are easier to use than the regular curler.</li>
            <li> This set does not heat up enough. I would need 4 sets to curl my hair, and my hair loses curl after an hour.</li>
            <li> These are great! they heat up fast and work well. I just wish there were a couple more rollers... I have long, very thick hair! Only downside, is they are not large... it says large and medium in product description... I&#x27;d say more like small and medium.</li>
            <li> Who decided how to describe the product?  The &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; rollers are actually a medium size and the &amp;#34; medium&amp;#34; ones are actually small.  Gave it to my granddaughter to use at camp.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a set like this to take when I travel. Very lightweight and compact. Gets warm quickly and stays hot for a good curl.  Just what I was hoping for</li>
            <li> Biggest problem I had is they would not stay in your hair, they are heavy and nothing I did made them stay in. They did get hot enough just don&#x27;t stay in.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse, long hair, that is usually very difficult to curl. It did take me a while to get the hang of putting them in. The only think i would do, if you are like me, is buy the clips and toss the metal things. the rollers have some weight to them plus the weight of my hair so the prong things, were not holding up. since i bought the clips they stay very secure for a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically i leave them in for 30 mins to get an all day curl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to hot rollers, but I&#x27;m not very happy with this set. Definitely not for thick hair. Also, the large rollers are not very large.</li>
            <li> I love this little compact rollers, like others I wish it had more large rollers but I still love the product and it works great!!</li>
            <li> Because of that problem I am not using the rollers anymore and had a bad experience during my last trip.</li>
            <li> Curlers hold well and dont snag the hair so thats good. The only down fall to this product is the rollers dont get hot enough. They definitely dont take 90 seconds to heat up. I let mine heat for about 10 minutes and I feel like they still were not hot enough. After taking them out(after about 15 minutes) I had nice volume and big curls..... but 30 minutes later my hair was pretty flat again. I used hair spray as well. :( My hair is long and very fine. I feel like if they got hotter, the curl would hold longer. Also it would be great if there was 2 more rollers in the package. I could barely fit all my hair in the 10 rollers and my hair is pretty thin.</li>
            <li> This tiny set is so convenient and compact to toss in a suitcase or in a carry on bag. The set heats quickly and rollers are indeed hot. Just enough rollers to get a good &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; when traveling light.</li>
            <li> These are so easy to use and heat up well and are just the right size for me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Carol</li>
            <li> Love these ....really like the compactness of these rollers ...great for travel</li>
            <li> The rollers are just the right size and there are just enough!  The clips have good storage pockets (there are two sizes of clips, so you have to use the right pocket).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Update 10-23-13) They are harder to use than I expected -- they don&#x27;t hold my hair tight enough to really set the curl, but they are good for touch-ups...</li>
            <li> These are very easy to use &amp; to carry. I often take them to the gym with me in the morning before work - I barely even notice they&#x27;re in my bag! I just wish there were 2 or 4 more. I have to curl the back of my hair with an iron.</li>
            <li> Find roller holders don&#x27;t work too well  --- I would prefer something that wasn&#x27;t all a hard plastic to stay in your hair easier</li>
            <li> Bought these at Target as another store did not have what I wanted. Am growing hair out. Is now inch past ear lobe and  and varies in length from 2-6 inches long. I use all rollers each time and sometimes need several more rollers, thus I take first ones out , reheat (sometimes) and use where needed.  Unit heats quickly. End caps are cool. Middle of rollers are very hot and can burn if rollers are heated for longer than ten minutes.  Heat is retained in rollers so can reuse at times.  My hair curls very easily so I take them out while still warm. The wire clips do not hold the rollers well and can get very hot.  Very compact case, takes little room on bathroom counter. I accidentally left the unit on for 12 hours. Nothing melted, no overheated smell. Nothing was damaged.  4 stars given due to slipping and burning fingers.  I bought super clips from amazon which work very well to prevent slipping.</li>
            <li> I love how compact these rollers are, and how quickly they heat up. The only thing I really dislike is the type of clips they come with (u-shaped wire ones), they don&#x27;t hold my hair at all and I had to purchase plastic comb-claw ones separately in order the use the curlers at all.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure they were heating up enough for me.  However it was just that my (very old) curlers were so well used they were burning my fingers my head and my hair. LOL  Funny what you get used to.  So I&#x27;m very happy with Cutie (my name for my new curlers.</li>
            <li> They dont heat up all too much, which is good if your hair is thin, but I have thick hair so it&#x27;s not too great. And the stupid PINS to hold your hair in place are so silly. Why? Why would you use those. They fall out. Give me some clips. Ugh.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these products work well with thick hair. These were easy enough to put in but they didn&#x27;t hold curls for long at all. I&#x27;m lucky if they last an hr. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This cute little item is a livesaver for traveling.  I got rid of my big unit and use this at home too.</li>
            <li> Great little rollers... perfect for travel.  I was a little surprised when they said large and medium on the roller size... I would call them medium and small.  I have very long hair , but they worked for me okay since it&#x27;s very straight and I can&#x27;t get enough curl.</li>
            <li> These work great and heat up instantly, definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> These rollers are terrible. Listen to the other reviews --- they dont heat evenly and the clips for the red rollers dont stay in so they pop out as I&#x27;m getting ready in the morning. I am throwing these away. Remington --- fix your poorly designed product!</li>
            <li> I have purchased numerous hot roller sets of all types for years.  In my experience the flocked rollers, which are the type customarily sold now, do not get hot enough.  I find that the the curl from those rollers is not worth the effort and straightens almost immediately.  A curling iron works better but is more time consuming.  These curlers heat up very quickly and can get quite hot, depending on how long they&#x27;re plugged in.  They are easy to use, and applying hairspray immediately after removal ensures a curl that lasts all day.  This set is a convenient size for travel, if that is your purpose.  I really wish they made a larger set of this exact type of rollers, including jumbo sized ones - it would be the ideal for home use.</li>
            <li> Did not curl my hair very well at all. I have been using a curling iron for over 20 years. I gave this away. Hopefully it worked better for the person I gave it to. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try these and I did not  want a huge set.  This was the perfect purchase for me.  The rollers heat up quickly and with just the right amount of heat.  They give my hair long lasting waves.  The set is travel perfect.  It was not a huge investment and I got what I wanted from these little red and  black hot rollers.  There are five of each size and that amount is enough to set waves in my longish thickish hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are compact and again...travel perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Do not get that hot, pins are difficult to use, rollers are heavy and do not stay in fine/thin hair.</li>
            <li> The curlers are small and the plastic and rubber surfaces are so hot that it&#x27;s hard to hold onto the roller. I did what another reviewer suggested and ordered two sets, combining all the larger rollers into one unit, but they&#x27;re still quite small and the result isn&#x27;t as natural as I&#x27;d like. The rubber surface of the roller is grabby and you can&#x27;t twist the roller to drag the hair ends into a straight alignment, so you end up wrapping the hair around the roller, ringlet-style.  Eight slightly larger rollers would be enough, and a flocked surface so the the hair could be wrapped correctly.  The soft exterior is a good idea for travel; I just wish the curlers were more user-friendly.</li>
            <li> I think mine is defective because it does not heat up at all.  I would return it but I throw&lt;br /&gt;the box away that it came in. I am disappointed because the reviews were so high on&lt;br /&gt;this product. I must have just received a lemon.</li>
            <li> Luv these little puppies. You plug them in - - in the morning and in 10 - 15 minutes they are plenty hot.  I leave them in my hair until they cool and I have a curls and body galore for a day, two or three. I agree with the other reviewers that the curler clips are worthless but I use the plastic hair clips that stylists use to hold sections of your hair back while they&#x27;re cutting.  You can get a bag of those for less than $5 bucks. I&#x27;m used to the larger hot curlers that only give your hair a bend but no real curl.  I love that these are portable and you can throw them in any bag (backpack, large purse or travel bag) and take them with you.  I also love that they heat up in a really short time.  Really good buy.</li>
            <li> The size of the curlers and the overall packaging is great or else I would have given these one star, but for me they just didn&#x27;t work. The tiny bumps on the curlers do nothing to help hold the hair onto the curlers.  I have relatively thick hair that is cut to my shoulders and these did absolutely nothing to curl it. I got a tiny bit of body out of them but no real curl whatsoever. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent for travel or every day use. Heat up really quick. Only curlers that have ever put a lasting curl in my hair.</li>
            <li> The curlers in this product are better described as medium and small, so they are a challenge for longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also, they don&#x27;t seem to heat evenly, so playing around to get them all up to temperature wastes some time -&lt;br /&gt;precious time when getting ready for work or other appointments. Also the clips do not hold the curler in well.&lt;br /&gt;I would hesitate about recommending these, as I will soon be replacing the set I purchased just a few months ago.</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly and are compact. But not for those of us that have thick straight and very healthy O.o hair (shiny sleek no split ends). If your hair is bad at holding curls... I&#x27;m sorry but hot rollers are not the way to go... (how I wish they were really love the outcome of everyone&#x27;s large bouncy curls) even with hair spray and rolling my hair 4 time curls would just fall. Had to curl with my flat iron. I will still give a good rating just because I knew there was very little of a chance that my hair would hold the curls if any at all.</li>
            <li> WORKS VERY WELL. NEED TO BUY MORE NOT ENOUGH FOR WHOLE HEAD. YOU WOULD HAVE TO SET HAIR AGAIN TO GET WHOLE HEAD DONE. COMES WITH ONLY TWELVE ROLLERS. I ALSO BROUGHT MY OWN SEPARATE HAIR CLIPS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years, but recently I ordered a new set and found that the clips, especially the ones for the larger red rollers, do not hold the rollers in place even for the two minutes or so it takes to curl your hair.  The one I got seems to be defective, but looking at a couple other reviews, it wasn&#x27;t just my set of clips.  They aren&#x27;t made in the right size to hold the rollers.  I still love these little convenient sets of rollers - easy to travel with, but will have to look for another one so I can stop chasing the falling rollers and clips all over the bathroom as they immediately fall out of my hair.  Also, in just a couple months since I got them, the edges of the rollers are breaking - although possibly helped along by all the times they have fallen to the tile floor.  Two stars only because the concept is a good one and they have worked well for me in the past (same brand).</li>
            <li> the rollers get the job done, but the clips that are included WILL NOT WORK. you are going to have to get clips in addition to this, or use a hair net. i love the little pouch, which is quite compact and less bulky than alternative versions of hot rollers, but they are VERY heavy, which is something to consider if you will be traveling by air, and need to watch weight.</li>
            <li> I have a set of these from a while back that I would give 5 stars.  However, they have changed the clips slightly and the large rollers DO NOT STAY IN.  The clip pops off and the rollers roll onto the floor.  I thought the reviewers who complained about his were silly because I had a set and they worked fine. So I bought another set so that I could keep it in my travel bag, but it is UNUSABLE.  Not fun to find out on my cruise.  Remington needs to find a different solution than these newer clips that don&#x27;t work.  DO not, do not buy this product.  The black ones seemed to work okay - the smaller rollers.  So that is why I gave it two stars instead of one.  And the rollers heat up well and fast.</li>
            <li> I agree with the others that say the clips that come are essentially worthless!  They will not hold, especially for the larger rollers!  I am on a limited amount of time when using these at the gym before work and spend too much time trying to secure them.  I  brought clips from my full set at home to try and they &#x27;helped&#x27;, but still did not hold well.  I would like to return them.</li>
            <li> I just started using these and the pins keep popping out, especially the larger ones.  I&#x27;m not rolling what I believe to be a huge amount of hair either. My hair is long (middle of my back) and thin.  I think I need to look for something else.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and simplifies my morning, however, I have fine hair VERY FINE HAIR and will need to seek something that will hold my hair. Otherwise I recommend it Highly!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly hot within minutes of being plugged in. It&#x27;s not scorching on the fingers to handle but hot enough to get hair to the curliness that is wanted. Totally surprised by this product, am glad I picked it up for such a cheap price. Also not as damaging as hot irons</li>
            <li> Sent these back. They look good but just too small for my long hair!! the case looked nice and good for travel or home use.&lt;br /&gt;Just a little too small.</li>
            <li> Second set of these &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; hair curlers.  Just what I need for a little curl at home or when traveling.  Heat fast and thoroughly every time.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These are a piece of junk and a total waste of $.  There&#x27;s no way to clip them onto your hair.</li>
            <li> The clips for the larger size curlers DO NOT FIT and will not stay in place.  They explode off the curlers without warning and land in the sink, on the floor, or under the cupboards.  I purchased an earlier version of this product in 2001 and was quite pleased with it, particularly the feature enabling international travel.  However, the newer versions feature clips of inferior, improper design that do not work with the curlers.  How hard can it be for the manufacturer to use a functional design?</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just me, since I&#x27;ve never used hot rollers before, but every single time I roll up a little bit of hair then put this U shaped clip in, it pops out!  Is there a trick to this???  Do I push the clip all the way in, or halfway?  If anyone has any advice I&#x27;d sure appreciate it.  Otherwise, it is a nice travel set, and I like them in general.</li>
            <li> This item arrived in a timely manner and was in great shape.  It was a bit smaller than what I expected.  All in all a great product as described.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I have asian hair so maybe other ethnicity-types will have different (i.e., better) results from using these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the best results from using these hot rollers were if (similar to other users) you made sure to heat them up for at least 15 minutes. Make sure before you plug them in, that you push all of the rollers down so they sit flush against the bottom otherwise you&#x27;ll find that some rollers are a little cooler and not heated as much as the others. It took me several tries to get my hair curled because I either didn&#x27;t heat the rollers long enough or I didn&#x27;t roll them up tightly enough. When I finally got it right and left them in my hair for about 20 minutes, I was ecstatic because my hair looked like I just stepped off a cover magazine. My hair. Alas, not my face. Anyway, the only negative I have to say is that the curls don&#x27;t last throughout the day even with hairspray. Either I&#x27;m not using the right spray/gel product or the disulfide bonds in my curls just gave up against the fight against asian hair. I don&#x27;t blame them, it&#x27;s hard to keep asian hair curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages: small size is great for using at home and traveling, don&#x27;t need more than the 10 rollers to curl all of your hair (I have shoulder-length hair), curls the hair in big soft waves&lt;br /&gt;Disadvantages: doesn&#x27;t curl for very long, takes a while (at least 15 minutes) to heat up, have to leave in hair for at least 15 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use these rollers if I&#x27;m in a hurry, but they do the job if you have time to spare.</li>
            <li> I have long hair- past my shoulders.  It&#x27;s in layers; it&#x27;s finely textured but there&#x27;s a lot of it- these rollers curled half of my hair.  Maybe you&#x27;d say, \\&quot;Oh, well- buy another set!\\&quot;  No.  These rollers are so slippery and rubbery that it was nearly impossible to roll that one half.  I tried hairspray, I tried using smaller amounts of hair, larger amts, etc...it&#x27;s like rolling your hair around a plastic hairbrush handle.  The only good I would say about it is that the clips fit pretty well and the heat is decent.  Obviously, there are women out there with different hair than mine that love these but if you have hair that&#x27;s anything like what I described, there are better sets out there!</li>
            <li> I almost always use a curling iron on my hair-it&#x27;s easier and much faster for what I do.  However, to keep a big, bouncy curl for a long time, you need hot rollers.  I would occasionally borrow my mothers (relics from the 70&#x27;s!) that still work.  I finally decided to buy my own.  Imagine my disappointment when I started looking and realized that most new sets have a u shape indent to the curlers so the heating element rests against the curler rather than the curler having a hole in the middle that slides over a post.  I tried 4 different sets with the indent in the curler--each left an indent in my hair.  I finally tried these, when I realized that they they are completely round and sit on a post.  To be honest, at this point I was fed up with the search and I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from a travel set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How wrong I was.  These are amazing!  There are 10 curlers, 5 med and 5 a little larger (I think they measure 1\\&quot; and 1 1/4\\&quot;).  They heat fast and get hot.  My hair curls easily, as does one of my daughters.  Sadly (according to them) two of my daughters have straight, silky hair that doesn&#x27;t like to stay curled. When we use these hot rollers on their hair though, there are curls for hours!  They are sort of rubbery and grippy in the middle so the hair doesn&#x27;t slide off.  However, I have not had any problems because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes with those funky wire hot roller pin things to keep them in place.  I have never been able to figure those out so I bought large jaw clips to hold them in place.  They do the job and they don&#x27;t leave crimps in my hair.  This is a nice size for travel and the case itself is soft-sided, not a hard plastic shell so it shouldn&#x27;t break.  This still keeps the heat in though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These really are nice--they heat fast, get evenly hot, don&#x27;t leave a crimp in the hair, don&#x27;t take up a lot of space, and aren&#x27;t a ton of money!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 20 years, I believe this is my third vresion of the set.  One problem with this version was the ill fitting clips.  But most troublesome issue was that they left off the velcro cord storage compartment, which made it much easier to travel with.  Now there is no where to store the cord.  I hope the next version of these rollers add this feature back.</li>
            <li> i am very pleased with the rollers.  They heat up quickly and make a nice curl.  i would buy again.</li>
            <li> Work just as well as my huge expensive rollers that I use at home. Only difference is they cost less and take up way less space. If you&#x27;re a traveler and you use hot rollers on your hair, then you won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> These are great for a traveler but I use them everyday myself.  They heat up quick but I like to extend the heating time a few minutes to get them really hot.  I like the curl result (I have long hair with medium thickness and slight layering).  Can&#x27;t beat the price or size.  I bought these based on other reviews and am very happy.</li>
            <li> These did not meet my wife&#x27;s expectations but they may well be more a result of her lofty expectations rather than the quality of the product. For that reason, I rated an average 3-stars.</li>
            <li> These rollers are too heavy and small to roll hair properly. The roller had a rubber type finish that your hair does not grab onto and they are very difficult to roll. I have a lot of hair, but it is fine, and these do not work. very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I had the old Remington travel rollers and loved them.  I don&#x27;t remember when I bought them, but maybe it was a decade ago.  I bought these thinking they would be similar.  These are terrible.  Some of the rollers do not heat up at all.  Of the ones that do heat up, they do not heat up very warm.  The clips do not work very well.  I switched to using hair clips that I had.  I returned this set to get another set.  The second set had more that worked but did not get very warm, and one did not work.  This is a big disappointment being that I used to be such a big fan.  With technology, you figure that rollers would become better not worse.</li>
            <li> These are great rollers.  I have an old set - a couple of curlers had fallen on the floor and chipped so after at least 10 years I ordered a new set.  They heat up very quickly -- big plus.  They are hot so be careful with your fingers.  I put my new rollers in, put the new clips in and by the time I&#x27;d put the 3rd roller in, the first roller fell out.  Whaaa?  Same size clips as before.  (They aren&#x27;t too small.)  Thankfully I still had my old clips, used them and all was fine!&lt;br /&gt;The old clips have about 1&amp;#34; of rubber/plastic on the straight end and about 3/4&amp;#34; on the bent end.  The new clips have just a dot of rubber/plastic on the ends.  (Looking at the picture here,  I see MUCH more rubber/plastic on the ends (like the old ones.)  I think that they are a better/stronger metal too but have no way of knowing because they are useless.  If you have old rollers, try their clips.  They will work much better.&lt;br /&gt;Revlon, these are worthless with the new dots of rubber on the clips.  Please put more of a grip back on your clips!  Bad move!&lt;br /&gt;(I just compared them again and they have also slightly changed the clip shape.  Exactly the same until you get to the bent end - it isn&#x27;t bent in as much.)  Here&#x27;s a picture of the old clips (that work) and the new clips (that don&#x27;t!)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe this little set of hot rollers worked as well as it did. It has 10 rollers and and heats up fast and is perfect for traveling. Only thing I would suggest is to get the clips to hold the rollers, I am not fond of the pins that come with it.</li>
            <li> Love its compact size, love how fast it heats, and love how gentle the rollers seem on my hair.  I wish the rollers were a little larger in size - the large and medium size described seem more like small-medium and medium, but they get the job done.  I threw my old (!) rusted steam roller set away.  I don&#x27;t find the reasonable price objectionable either!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She has used it and was happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it was dual voltage, this makes it great to travel with as i dont have to bother about converters.</li>
            <li> Warm up very quickly.  Easy to use.  clips to secure are small to handle and made of metal, so they can get warm to the touch if left in hair due to heat of curler.  would buy again.  love the handy case, great for travel.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter in law cause she loved mine!  I have used these for 20 years and they are still kicking (every day!!!)  travel really well and perfect size!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed! Product was described as 5 large &amp; 5 medium rollers. The rollers, in my opinion, are actually 5 medium and 5 small rollers. I was hoping for large rollers to smooth out my hair, instead they make tight curls. To top it off, I was going to return them but found out that amazon would charge me almost $6 in shipping. So, I would only be refunded about $10 bucks. For $10 bucks, I felt like I should just keep them. If I need tight curls, I&#x27;ll use these rollers  guess. Don&#x27;t buy these if you are looking for a large roller.</li>
            <li> I love using these. They are really simple and my hair goes up fast, though for whatever reason my hair can&#x27;t keep the curl. I tried everything but if I&#x27;m lucky I get a few hours of extra curls before they fall out.</li>
            <li> I took one look at this tiny little package and thought to myself, &amp;#34;No way this is going to work on my (below shoulder length) hair in Houston.&amp;#34;  I gave it a try anyway and I was amazed!  You DO have to let it warm up longer than advertised but other than that they work as promised.  In fact, the first try, I left them in about 20 minutes while I applied my makeup and, when I took them down, I swear my hair looked like I belonged on the Grand Ole&#x27; Opry stage!  Talk about big &amp; curly.  After several combings, my hair finally settled down enough to leave the house and stayed wavy all day, even in Houston humidity!  This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> You need to make sure when you replace the curlers that they push down securely on the spot to make sure they warm properly. They don&#x27;t warm real quickly but, they do warm hot enough for my hair needs but, if you are used to a super hot curler then these may not be for you. They are small and compact so perfect for travel. I haven&#x27;t tried the clips because I bought a set that I use for every curler I have that holds really securely.</li>
            <li> These are a great size for travel, but that is about it.  They are hot to the touch...and nearly impossible to hold while you are trying to put them in your hair.  The metal clasps did not stay on the roller, which was an issue.</li>
            <li> A couple months ago my 1980-something hot rollers died. I needed a replacement, and found these. Some reviewers wanted more rollers, but overall they looked good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they are. Folks- you are spending like $20 on a set of hot rollers and you get a good deal for your money. The rollers get good and hot (I heat them up about 5 minutes) and I do my very thick hair (shoulder blade length) by rolling it into large sections (back and sides in smaller rollers, top in large rollers).  Unless you want to rock a LOT of curl you don&#x27;t need more rollers than this comes with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use these, this is how I do it:&lt;br /&gt;take take top of hair (what would be a Mohawk if you had one, but wide- like 2 inches wide) and separate into 3 sections. Roll first bang section, then second, then back (which should be the crown of your head). Now I roller for the part in front of your ear on each side (you&#x27;ve used 5 rollers) and you have 2 for the top of the back, two for the bottom of the back. Now go plant your fanny in a chair and read or watch TV for like 20 minutes. Take them out, and voila- gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: If you&#x27;re headed to prom or someplace fancy spray a bit of hairspray on each section before rolling, then again when you take them out of the rollers. Don&#x27;t get all crazy brushing through it, tousle with your fingers. The more you brush, the more you kill the curls.</li>
            <li> These are just the right amount and pack well for travelling. They do the job.</li>
            <li> The unit very compact for travel and heats quickly, but it&#x27;s difficult, almost impossible, to get the curlers to stay in my hair.  There is really nothing on the curler to grip so it slides right out.  I&#x27;ll be looking for something different.</li>
            <li> I have never used a roller. After reading the reveiws I decided to purchase two set of rollers. I have long hair. It works really great on my hair. Looking at my hair everyone says it looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love to do my hair, but these you plug in and they heat up so quickly!  Also they work so well and are nice and compact!</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair and these curlers work great.  Easy to use and fast.  I use these while getting ready for work and now have  a prettier pony tail at the hospital.  Does not damage hair.  I bought two since one was not enough for my long hair.</li>
            <li> Good Points:  Small size&lt;br /&gt;  heats well&lt;br /&gt;Bad Points:  clips wont hold curlers&lt;br /&gt;  hard to get last curlers off of stand&lt;br /&gt;I really like the design of this set of curlers.  That said I wish they would redesign the clips that are suppose to hold them in your hair.  I first thought that I was putting to much hair on each curler. so I put the clips in where there wasn&#x27;t any hair at all.  They still pop out and the curler falls to the floor.  I am going to look for the clips from my old sets and see if the smaller ones will fit this set.  The design on those clips are such that they won&#x27;t fall out.  As for the heating, I usually turn these on before I shower and dry my hair so that they are really hot, I think the 90 second heating won&#x27;t quite be hot enough to make lasting curls. However that is not a problem for me. I would really like them to make a set like this using jumbo size rollers.....that would really be great!</li>
            <li> These rollers do not get hot enough to use.  They barely even get warm.  I would recommend against purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I love this prodoct!! it is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair and I habe been struggling with curling irons for a whilenow but the curls never held for more than 20 mins. Well with this product, I now have beautiful curls that would last the whole day!&lt;br /&gt;It is super easy to use, it takes no time to heat and a few minutes to roll and 10 mins later Violla!! you have big bouncy curls :D&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super happy with this product. I wonder if they make a flat iron that is as easy to use.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Easy for travel and works just right.&lt;br /&gt;My sister told me about these hot rollers when I loved her hair. She said...&lt;br /&gt;Come here and showed me her travel hot rollers. And told me to look on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Order was quick arriving in three days so it&#x27;s a great purchase all the way around.</li>
            <li> Wish there were 2 more curlers in the pack, but I guess that is the point of &#x27;compact&#x27;. They heat fast and create long lasting curls, so you can&#x27;t ask for much more than that!</li>
            <li> I love the compact size, perfect for home and travel.  My first set lasted over 20 years, decided it was time for a new set.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be good for a little extra body when I needed it.  Rollers stay in quite nicely and don&#x27;t tangle your hair, but case is awkward to get the rollers in and out and they will keep getting hotter if you have it plugged in.  I was delayed in using them once for about 10 minutes and they were so hot I could barely stand to roll my hair.  So if you are careful not to let them heat longer than the 90 seconds or 2 minutes at most they are fine.  No auto shut off and apparently no temperature max.  Doubt I will use very much.  The results were not much different than my curling iron and not as easy to use.</li>
            <li> These are just like the last Remington hot roller curlers I had! love these rollers! They heat up so fast!</li>
            <li> I had a set of these already but bought this one so I would have ten of each size to use. Trouble is the clips in this set are different than my original set and will not hold any of the rollers in. I can only use 5 of each size and then take them out to use with the other rollers when the first set is ready. The shape of the clips is just a fraction different from the old ones and has tiny red tips instead of the larger red tips on the first set. Not sure if they were the right ones but they don&#x27;t work to hold any of either set of rollers. Still using them but it takes twice as long.</li>
            <li> I have a large set of Remington hot rollers and love them, so I figured this small set would be perfect for travel. NOT! There was absolutely no way these rollers would stay on my head. I tried everything, but they dive-bombed off as soon as I let go. Worse, the clips flew around like lost birds, and I had to spend a lot of time searching for them. One landed in a hotel toilet. Yes, it was gross, but the set doesn&#x27;t give you extras. They did heat fine, but you do have to make sure you clip them onto their holders. I never got any to stay in long enough to know if they give a good curl. In defense of the rollers, most people apparently didn&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
            <li> I use this on short hair and it does a nice job - heats up quickly, easy on my hair and works quickly.  I like this unit because it is small and easy to store and pack.  I took the advice of one reviewer and bought a second set so that I could mix the sizes and that works great because they all fit on any of the heating units...and the price was still less than some of the more pricey roller choices.  The only down side is the clips - the do not hold well for my short hair because the rollers are a bit on the heavy side.  I purchased the Soft and Style Hot Roller Clamps and use them instead - no marks on my hair and they hold very well.</li>
            <li> Great price, great quality, works very well! I&#x27;m happy I purchased these hot setters. If your looking for good quality and affordable hot ceramic rollers, I would recommend these!</li>
            <li> I purchased these because of their compact size.  Unfortunately, the rollers were so heavy and they kept falling out of my hair.  I even tried a different type of clip that has worked with all my other rollers. Also, the curls they produced did not last as long as other rollers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Second set, first set a little sturdier but hey this is a low price. The clips do not fit the curlers so i have to use the old clips.</li>
            <li> Ehh..they&#x27;re alright. Used them once at home but often toss them in my overnight bag. Clips don&#x27;t hold real tight but they do in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these in any department stores anymore. I like these brand because they get really hot.</li>
            <li> The pins that come with the curlers don&#x27;t hold my hair. After wrestling with them a few days, I finally gave up and just bought some cheap bearclaw clips to hold the curlers in place instead of using the pins. Could just be the texture and/or density of my hair but it was rather aggravating having the pins and curlers pop out all over the place while trying to set my hair. Otherwise a great product... convenient to use and makes beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> I pulled them in and NOTHING worked! Merry Christmas!!!!&lt;br /&gt;What is happening to Amazon???</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, my wife has had trouble with the spring clips staying in her hair. The product would be excellent if they could fix this, as this makes them very time consuming and aggravating for her to use. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the clip, or the material the rollers have over them. The small footprint is great, and everything else is good. Hope they fix the clip issue.</li>
            <li> I bought these at Target.  They hit up as advertised.  They are compact.&lt;br /&gt;However, I could not get the clips to stay on the roller, and the curlers kept falling out.  Very disappointed, and left them at the last hotel.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has a good recommendation, please let me know.</li>
            <li> The clips do not hold the rollers in place.  Be careful the clips spring out at a rapid rate!!</li>
            <li> Not as big as expected but easy to use and super cute</li>
            <li> If it were possible to give negative stars, this product deserves it.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium length hair (down to my shoulders), and my hair is very thick. The clip on things that come with the product to secure my hair doesn&#x27;t even do the job. I had to buy those huge claw clips to secure the rollers in. It comes with ten of the rollers and i was only able to curl 3/4 of my hair. On top of that, the curls only lasted 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product sucks. Save your money. There is a reason why it&#x27;s only $15.</li>
            <li> These work well but I gave it three stars because the large curlers do not stay in your hair. The clips that hold the large curlers in place pop off constantly. The ones for the medium curlers are great.</li>
            <li> I have thick shoulder-length hair and I tried using these twice before deciding to write this review. Here is what I experienced:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These do heat up quickly, and are fairly reasonable to handle (they aren&#x27;t TOO hot where I felt I might burn my fingers while rolling my hair). A &#x27;ready&#x27; light might be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are not enough rollers for my hair; which while it is thick, it only grazes the top of my shoulders. So I did the underneath portions of my hair first, left the rollers in for about 40 minutes, and then repeated with the crown sections of my hair. Results - great, until I gently brushed it. The curls came right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another attempt yielded the same results, but I tried a half-head at a time with the rollers with the addition of products as well as additional setting time. Plus I nixed the brush and only finger-combed my hair. Still no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see this set being a nice ADDITION to a larger set; or maybe good for people with shorter and/or very fine hair. But for me they just don&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> I have been using these rollers for 15 years.  My first set lasted about 10 years, I never really thought about it until the case got crummy.  These are a GREAT set, very much worth the money.  I have thick super long hair.  Through the years these have been great for shoulder length and even now when my hair is almost to the small of my back they still work great.  I get so many compliments on my hair with people asking me how to do it.  I couldn&#x27;t recommend them more!</li>
            <li> These are the best curlers for the price. They come in a small and compact case and heat up quickly and are very very hot! I can not rave enough about these little gems! If you travel often or just want these for your every day use you will not be disappointed! If you have thick or extra long hair you might want to buy two sets. I personally have thick medium length and use these along with another set of Jumbo Rollers by Conair.</li>
            <li> Had to give it one star; couldn&#x27;t give it less.  If you want lukewarm rollers this is the one for you.  They didn&#x27;t get very hot no matter how long I left them on.  Definitely would not recommend!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and lots of it.. I did not think these curlers heated up enough to  curl it..</li>
            <li> My old set of these worked perfectly, so I bought a new set of the same exact thing.  For some reason, in this new set the clips fly off and will not hold the rollers in at all.  It is useless.</li>
            <li> First looking at this, I thought \\&quot;there&#x27;s no way this little thing can work well.\\&quot;  Was I wrong!  The rollers heat well, and my curls lasted!  The size is perfect for travel, I would even use for every-day use as well.  Someone else commented that you need to be sure the rollers are \\&quot;plugged\\&quot; into the post, and that is true-but it&#x27;s no big deal.  I really only wanted the large red rollers, so I bought 2 sets and will trade out the black rollers - the case can hold all 10 red rollers just fine.  I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I bought these for a trip, and I have ended up using them everyday since! As a matter of fact, my hair is much longer now and I went and purchased an expensive standard set of hot rollers and took those back in preference over these little guys.  The plus is they DO stay in my thick, unruly hair and they also get nice and hot.  The only thing I would like is for a few more curlers now that my hair is longer.  I bought these two years ago and they are still going strong.  So really, other than the fact that I would like the set to be twice as large, I love them and give them a near two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who was, at the time, on a hair roller kick.  That kick lasted for about two days after I purchased this.  Buy it for the family and pass it on down to the next teen in the group and for when that teen reaches the &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve GOT to have my hair in rollers its the ONLY style&amp;#34; kick.  Don&#x27;t worry.  Its short lived. (The kick, not the rollers. They go on and on.)</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife. The product is nicely designed and packaged but the rollers wouldn&#x27;t stay in place. My wife followed the instructions carefully, used the recommended clips for each roller, and after just a few seconds the clip would fall out and the roller would fall on the floor. I read the instructions and tried putting her hair up in the rollers . . . same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We liked the compactness of the design and portability but it failed in doing the job we bought it for so we returned it.</li>
            <li> I almost gave up on these curlers because the clips do spring out and fly across the room - then the curlers fall.&lt;br /&gt;BUT I accidentally figured out that the clips go into the very end of the curlers where there&#x27;s a slight depression. The clip fits perfectly and holds when pushed in that slightly depressed area. Look at the roller carefully before using it and the explanation makes sense. In general I&#x27;m really happy with how quickly the curlers heat and produce a really nice curl that lasts. It&#x27;s a nice inexpensive set.</li>
            <li> the best hot irons i ever had. my hair is long so i ended up needing two sets of them. they do heat up fast and the meatal tabs are hardcore. i like it. good buy</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these. These reviews were good, and I saw a blogger I like endorse them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest problem I had was that 3 of the prongs just don&#x27;t heat at all, so the product was straight up defective. I did check that I was clicking the curler into the prong base, but no dice; it wasn&#x27;t the curler itself because I heated them successfully on other prongs. Seven curlers is not enough to justify keep it, even at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving aside the defective piece, I was just not that impressed by the performance. My hair is shoulder length, medium thickness and slightly wavy, so it holds well when I curl or straighten it; I rarely encounter hair dryers, curling irons, or curlers that won&#x27;t do something.  But for some reason, it just didn&#x27;t hold the curl that well with these. Right after I took them out, it looked nice but it fell flat after about 20 minutes. I think it has to do with the fact that the curlers themselves are very short (probably to make them travel friendly); and the fact that the surface just wasn&#x27;t very grippy. I didn&#x27;t mind the U-pins, but folks with more difficult hair than mine might not like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad. These were a good price and they were indeed nicely portable. Back they go...</li>
            <li> These rollers are really awesome! I was skeptical because I have long, VERY thick hair, and I assumed I would need at least two sets of rollers. So not the case with these. They heat up quickly. The small case is so convenient to take along with you and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space! My only complaint would be the pins used to hold them in, but I think that&#x27;s more user error and lack of practice rather than the pins themselves. I would definitely give these a shot.</li>
            <li> These rollers do hot hold well in your hair and it doesn&#x27;t hold the curls well. I wish I could just return it but I&#x27;ve already used it. Save your money!</li>
            <li> It was a hot mess. I was so excited to find these only to find out who the clips don&#x27;t fit the model!! Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love these little travel rollers. I needed something compact and small that works and these do. They heat up quickly, the leave great curls. I&#x27;m very pleased with these. They aren&#x27;t a $200.00 set of rollers they&#x27;re inexpensive travel rollers. There&#x27;s 8 of them.</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is slightly thin-ish. I can get the rollers to work, but I have to re roll most of them atleast three times. The clips barely keep the roller in place, despite starting at the middle of the shaft, tucking the ends, then rolling up to head, the ends always seem to fall out. I can set my hair perfect and tight in the roller, but as soon as I put the clip in, they slouch down an inch, and my ends fall out. I could get my entire head rolled in under four minutes if the clips and rollers would stay in place. The heat is excellent, and after rigorously trying to put my hair up, the end result is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I  came back to reiterate that the clips do not keep the rollers in! It&#x27;s horrible1 i could roll my whole head in 4 minutes it I didn&#x27;t have to re do the rolls, use several clips on some, and I am using the thinnest of sections. Next time I go for a set that has butterfly clips or something, not thin metal bobby pin type things.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using hot rollers ever! It was really easy.. I have blond bleached hair. Rollers didn&#x27;t burn my hair, they created nice curls. I got tons of compliments. Definitely A++++. I&#x27;m going to get them for my friend for her birthday.</li>
            <li> The clips are too short or small. The rollers pop off.</li>
            <li> These rollers were bought as a gift. Very small but the rollers give great curls. Great for traveling or for small places.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set to replace a set of old wax core rollers I had, which came in a large, hard plastic case that had bare metal rods on which to heat them, and plastic clips that had to be stored separately from the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received these, I was pleasantly surprised by how compact they are. They&#x27;re meant to be heated inside the case, which has two small front pockets to hold the clips (I removed the clips before I got started, since I wasn&#x27;t sure how hot they&#x27;d get next to the rollers). They claim to be &amp;#34;instant heat&amp;#34; and the instruction booklet says they&#x27;re hot enough to create a wavy effect within 90 seconds, although you can allow them to heat to the full temperature for tighter curls. It doesn&#x27;t specify how long it takes them to reach that point, so I left them for 10 minutes while I did some other things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers were easy to handle, and the rubbery texture kept them from sliding too much through my hair. I used all 5 of the larger size and 3 of the smaller for my test run. I was worried that the metal pins would be hard to use, but I found the hold was actually much better than that of the plastic claw clips I was used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder-length, very straight, fine, and color-treated (lightened) hair, which is hard to curl. These hot rollers made a tight curl in my hair in just 20 minutes from start to finish (when they cooled and I removed them), which was easy for me to finger comb and rearrange into the looser look that I wanted. I think I could easily use all 10 for fuller body and a more evenly distributed style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There would likely not be enough rollers in this set for anyone with longer hair, or thicker hair, than my own, although they heat quickly enough that I think anyone with long/thick hair could easily do half, put them back into the case to reheat, and do the other side without too much fuss. This went much faster (for me) than using any other kind of hair appliance, and I suppose if you wanted to save time, they&#x27;re cost effective enough that you could purchase two sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with these, and the compact size should be very easy to travel with; at around 6&amp;#34; long, this case will probably take up less space in my suitcase than a single shoe. I would highly recommend!if you wanted to save time, they&#x27;re cost effective enough that you could purchase two sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with these, and the compact size should be very easy to travel with; at around 6&amp;#34; long, this case will probably take up less space in my suitcase than a single shoe.

            <li> Might just be my hair, who knows, but these did nothing for me. Followed all the tips suggested by others in the comments, but these were nothing special. I returned them. Would have given it a lower rating but cutting the product some slack because it could be my hair that is the problem.</li>
            <li> These little curlers make your hair really curly and last all day long. I bought them for a trip and they packed real well.  You cannot leave them on as long as other rollers unless you really want super curly hair. They pack real real well.</li>
            <li> Love them, does not burn your fingers, doesn&#x27;t hurt your hair, or cause damage to hit, my husband loves the way the curls look, I have a set of my own (probably need another one for myself because i have long hair), this was a gift.  Would recommend this product to every woman.</li>
            <li> Es rápido y super fácil de usar, super recomendada.&lt;br /&gt;Perfecto para viajar porque tiene los dos voltajes y super pequen;o paquete :)</li>
            <li> As a life-long hot roller user, the packaging of these is the best. Of course every other set I&#x27;ve had, the plastic lid has cracked and broken off with repeated suitcase usage no matter how safely I thought they were packed. With the lid off they then didn&#x27;t heat up correctly and had to be thrown out. I even contacted the manufacturer to get a replacement lid but they weren&#x27;t available. I do wish this product had an option to have all large rollers for long hair. They are inexpensive enough that I just bought 2 sets and combined to make one large and one small. I will give the small one away. An outstanding purchase.</li>
            <li> These do not get hot enough. Don&#x27;t buy them. I was away too long on vacation and could not send them back. Useless .</li>
            <li> This set was perfect for my use. The only reason it gets 4 stars and not 5 is because the rollers aren&#x27;t quite as big as I thought they would be. Nice and compact, heats up quickly, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> the small &amp; large size rollers are excellent.  But  I want more biggest roller.  I see from the internet review.  I open the official remongton website. but they don&#x27;t sell to outside USA.&lt;br /&gt;how can I get the extra large / jumbo size. rollers ?&lt;br /&gt;do you have links / some body  can sell to outside USA ?</li>
            <li> Curlers don&#x27;t heat up well, don&#x27;t stay in hair . Clips don&#x27;t hold and they only included 0ne clip per curler, took to post office to return and it would be over $6, so I&#x27;m keeping them..</li>
            <li> Really great product for the price.  I am a thrifty shopper, and this item was marked just right for me to buy.  The rollers are good sizes and they heat up quickly.  Very glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I Love these Hair curlers. They work well and heat up quickly. They are very easy to store which I like because sharing a bathroom with 5 others doesn&#x27;t leave much room for my stuff. I only have 2 bad things about them that I can deal with. 1- There aren&#x27;t many of them so sometimes you have to wait to do the rest of your hair, and 2 they can burn your fingers. When I roll up my hair which is shoulder length I have slightly burnt my finger tips from the heat.</li>
            <li> It curls my hair instantly &amp; gives nice beautiful curls. I do wish there was an indicator light to let you know that it is heating up but all in all it does get very hot (not enough to burn you, unless you touch the metal parts). I have accidentally left it plugged in for 8 hours &amp; was sure I was doomed &amp; it would not work again properly but it is still running strong! No complaints here.</li>
            <li> This is my second set.. like them so much bought second set for use in extra bath and third to travel with.</li>
            <li> The curler set is compact and heats up in 5 minutes.  They have also moved the clip pockets to the front of the holder to reduce heating of the clips which could be uncomfortable to handle.  However,all the clips on both sets I bought recently are too small, pop off and ping around the room.  Fortunately, I have saved clips from prior hot roller sets and have cobbled together a set of clips that do work rather than return a portable set with a small footprint that works well on a bathroom cabinet or stores well in a cabinet or suitcase.  However, the alternative clips take up additional room.  Remington needs to solve the clip problem or it has made a good product that will be rejected by buyers due to poor quality control - not design.  I have an older set purchased from Target and the clips fit great no matter the amount of hair on the roller so a good product with all the components working properly is possible.  Sadly, I gave one of these sets as a gift so two people are inconvenienced due to the ongoing clip problem.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic!!! And so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> These are excellent for travel.  This is the second set I bought.</li>
            <li> Warm up quickly, great for shorter hair. Not really enough rollers for someone with thick or very long hair. They stay in very well.</li>
            <li> OMGosh FANTASTIC, LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> 1. The traveling case - small, compact, lightweight.  5 stars&lt;br /&gt;2. The curlers - heat up quickly, help you get a good, long-lasting curl. 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;3. The clips - shame on Remington!  The clips are a cheap cop-out and cause nothing but frustration when trying to use them.  Seriously, I have used hot curlers for years with a similar style of clips; there should be no &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34; to using them.  These are too short and flimsy. 0 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy these curlers, do NOT rely on the clips they come with.  You will have to factor in the time, energy, and expense to buy additional hot roller clips or use that don&#x27;t shoot off the roller 3 seconds after putting them in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some for the last  twelves years , used all the time even great for traveling so far these are the same only thing that has changes is the color of bag old was black and this is red! My friend just ordered also</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in my Remington Ceramic Hot Rollers. I have an older model of these Hot Rollers and the&lt;br /&gt;older version are so much better. The older version heat up hotter . The new version continually fall out of my hair&lt;br /&gt;because the clips do not work. I would never recommend these. I will use my older version and donate the new ones.</li>
            <li> I bought these specifically to take on a cruise. None of the clips for the larger size rollers would actually fit on the rollers, let alone keep them in my hair. The clips sprang off immediately, almost hitting my boyfriend in the eye. I threw them out rather than carry them all the way back home and try to find clips to fit (which actually defeats the purpose of the travel ease anyway)&lt;br /&gt;I have used other travel rollers and never had this issue. A complete waste of money</li>
            <li> didnt realize they were so small.. did nothing to my hair but knot it i hate this thing ughhhasdh sdkj</li>
            <li> I packed the set for my early morning workout at the gym and they worked great.&lt;br /&gt;These heat quickly and the curls last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give 5 stars, was due to the number of rollers.  I had to order two sets so I would have enough large rollers to get the job done.</li>
            <li> It is small compact and great for traveling. But the pins are so annoying. I ended up using my own clam clips. These pins hurt and fall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they say large rollers but they are not that large at all.</li>
            <li> I love this hairsetter!  It is perfect for home and travel! It doesn&#x27;t take up much room, so it&#x27;s perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li> I am happy with these rollers. I wish they were a larger diameter, but they heat very quickly and are easy to use. They are not enough for my entire head, but they heat quickly enough that when I remove the first few, they are heated again before I remove the last few. They do not take hardly any space at all.</li>
            <li> they work okay, but not as good as I would hope that they would. I&#x27;m glad I did a practice try before actually trying to style my hair with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these hot rollers several times. I don&#x27;t know what happened to them, but the clips are either the wrong size or made differently now I&#x27;ve been using the same rollers for 10 years! The rollers slip out of my hair and the clips pop out. I really don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t stay in my hair using the provided metal clips. I have to use hair clips to keep them in place.</li>
            <li> heats up fast and very compact</li>
            <li> This was a high quality product but the rollers where much to small for my shoulder length hair.  I would really have loved to have a set with rollers at least twice the size.</li>
            <li> I had an off brand of this model for two years and loved it. I saw the brand &amp;#34;Remington&amp;#34; and thought I had hit pay dirt. But it&#x27;s awful. The clips do not fit the curlers, and fly out of my hair. It is impossible to use. Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Great product great curl.</li>
            <li> I like these curlers, but you have to use them with curler clips (the grey, claw-like ones), or else your hair is likely to get fuzzy if it is fine. They are good for travel, but they don&#x27;t get super hot. If you&#x27;re looking to enter into the world of hot rolling or get some travel rollers, this is great, if you want more than that, get a better set.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair but recently colored it to have the ombré look so I needed it to be curled. Initially I bought a curling iron but that was difficult to use. I am not a hair expert, I have only used a flat iron, do not even know how to blow dry my hair! Anyways after the curling iron failure,  found these curlers on amazon. Decided to go with the Remington brand because my flat iron is the same brand and I have had it for over two years. I am so glad I did! These curlers are extremely easy to use and each curler has a rubber body to help stay put in your hair. I am still trying to figure out how to use the clips but overall I would highly highly recommend this product. If I can use it, anyone can.</li>
            <li> V v v v vvv disappointing!!!! I have the exact same ones from the 90s and they work perfectly well!!! These new ones, the large horseshoe clips don&#x27;t fit the large rollers! The smalles ones are fine though. I would have expected better quality rollers after 20 years!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers because the 1960s set of Kindness by Clairol (which still works) took too long to heat up, and they were very heavy.  The Remington rollers are light, the package is small and the curlers do heat very quickly.  My problem with them is that the clips provided are not large enough.  They would actually &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; off and fly across the room.  Very frustrating!!  I do not have particularly thick hair and it is chin length and very straight. I took the clips from the 1960s set to see if the longer clips would help, and they worked very well.  Remington should provide longer clips to hold the curlers in place.  Otherwise, I really like the convenience of the rollers and the way my hair looks after use.&lt;br /&gt; Hint: I learned that I could tie a scarf around my head to hold the rollers in place if I want to leave them in while I get dressed or whatever.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they fit perfectly in a suitcase or duffel bag. They heat up very quickly which is nice. I don&#x27;t care for the size of the red rollers so I actually bought a second set and replaced the reds with the black rollers and only use the set of black rollers. The only flaw is that sometimes certain heating elements don&#x27;t work so I&#x27;ll have a cold roller and have to put it on a working one. Not a big deal but a little inconvenient</li>
            <li> I think these curlers are brilliant - my first lot lasted 10 years (used every day).  I could not buy a replacement set in England and so had them sent from America.  I love them because they only take 90 seconds to heat up.  I have to buy 2 sets as I only want the medium size curlers. So I shall have to sell the larger set on E.Bay.  They come with an American plug so you have to use an adaptor - these only cost about £2.</li>
            <li> I did not realize the difference in size, i thought all the rollers included were the same size because a friend of mine has the same set and hers comes with all the rollers in the same size. I have too much hair for only 10 rollers especially since 5 of them are smaller. I do like that they are very portable though.</li>
            <li> My sweet husband just gave this set to me for Christmas and I LOVE them! I am a hairstylist, and I have a large set of hot rollers in the salon that I use all the time. I was looking for a small set for home and travel, and these are perfect! They heat up fairly quickly, and are easy to use. The surface of the rollers is kind of rubberized, so they grip the hair well; better, actually, than the smooth set I use in the salon. The pin-style clips might be a little fiddly for some (not my favorite) but you could always get a pack of butterfly clips to use instead. I love the little pockets on the inside of the case for the clips so they don&#x27;t get lost. The only caution I would offer is to make sure each roller is firmly seated on its heating element or they won&#x27;t heat up. When I first plugged them in I was disappointed to find that some of them were hot and others weren&#x27;t; then I realized that some were not pushed all the way down on their little pegs. Once I pushed them all down, they heated quickly and worked great. They don&#x27;t need to stay in your hair for long to create bouncy curls, and they leave your hair shiny and bouncy with curls that last for hours. LOVE them!</li>
            <li> I love this set. It gets hot fast, it has enough curlers for my long hair. It is small and very easy to travel with. If you do take it overseas you do need a plug converter - good think I had one.</li>
            <li> These rollers are compact and a nice size for medium length hair.  However they do not stay in with metal pins or plastic clips.  Also do not heat up well.  Would return but shipping gets expensive and not worth it.</li>
            <li> Great...I have really long hair and was not sure if these would heat up enough to actually do the job.  Not only do they heat up quickly, they are really hot and my hair comes out perfectly.  Small enough to stash in my suitcase too!  Only downside is that the clips are awful, and do not hold for me, perhaps the weight of my hair is too much?  I bought some clips at the drugstore to use instead and love these.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these curlers.  Heat up fast and are not damaging to hair if you don&#x27;t let them heat for too long, which has a small learning curve to perfect for your particular hair. Great quality!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive a travel size set of rollers that would free up my luggage.  The size was right but when it came to actual use, this was a let down.  The clips that are supposed to hold the roller in your hair...well, they don&#x27;t.  They last around 15-30 seconds before they spring out of your hair, dropping the roller.  Additionally, the breakdown of rollers themselves is not ideal for someone looking for additional body and bounce.  The red rollers are the perfect size for that but there are just as many of the smaller, black rollers...leaving you with the need to roll, HOLD because the clips won&#x27;t, reheat and reroll other sections.  However, if you are looking for your Farrah Fawcett wings and curls, the black curlers will be just right for you if you can get them to stay in your hair...</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and the curlers just didn&#x27;t take.  I don&#x27;t know if they would work better on longer or thicker hair but it was a total bust for me.  If returning wasn&#x27;t such a pain I would do that.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for... these rollers are in my trash.  They didn&#x27;t curl my hair, they got warm but not hot. Maybe I didn&#x27;t wait long enough— is 10 minutes long enough?</li>
            <li> not as expected.. been trying it out but doesnt work on my hair.. doesnt even become hot enough to hold curl</li>
            <li> These are wonderful! My hair is thick stick straight asian hair, and all I have to do is prep my hair with mousse (I use Tresemme) and then roll these suckers in! Because my hair is so long (past my waist) I have to leave them in for about an 1hr-2hrs. Oh yeah, and if you have hair as straight and uncooperative, or as long and thus &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; as mine, then simply buy at least 2 of these!</li>
            <li> Makes great curls, I like that the rolls have two different sizes. I use them both in Europe with 110volt and in USA with 220volt. I seam to have some problems with one of the rolls getting warm but it is not a big enough deal to bother about sending them back.</li>
            <li> this is my second set..they get used daily and usually last 4-5 years...just the right amount of curlers for  me and not too big to pack for a trip...this set however has one curler (post) I should say,that does not heat up much.. its the one right by the plug connection...threw the box away or I would have sent it back...otherwise I like the product**</li>
            <li> Clips won&#x27;t stay in. Other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The clips are worthless. I have 4 inch long hair and the clips pop off the rollers and fly across the room. The only reason I am keeping the set is because they are seay to pack. I replaced the clips with others from an older set I had. Don&#x27;t buy this unless you have a plan B for clips</li>
            <li> love these curlers they get hot quickly and can be reheated quickly when needed</li>
            <li> I bought these for my trip to Europe, thinking they would be very small for me to pack lightly. A mistake! The clips do NOT stay in. I would put in a clip and then it would &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; off. I tried two clips to hold the curlers in, and that didn&#x27;t work. Althought these were very inexpensive, do not purchase. I rarely rate anything a 1 star, but these are a total waste of your money.</li>
            <li> Rotten product. Clips pop off. Enough rollers for 1/3 of my hair. Gave 2 stars because they get really hot and fit neatly in a suitcase.</li>
            <li> The clips that come with the rollers make it very difficult to keep the rollers in at all.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work well for my long medium thickness hair. The rollers just kept falling out of my head and did not produce the desired curls. I&#x27;ll keep &#x27;em around for emergency back-up, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use them much if ever.</li>
            <li> Close to a near perfect hair setter particularly for travel. I don&#x27;t keep the pins in the slots buy carry them separately in a plastic baggie just because I&#x27;m too impatient to fit them back in the slots. Other than that, I love this thing</li>
            <li> terrible - I went by the reviews for those who absolutely loved it , what a joke.  And for the love of me I cannot keep the pins on the rollers.  I have to use in a small room because when they let loose, it is like a projectile and hard to find the pins ....ridiculous.</li>
            <li> compact and good for travelling but disappointed as plug sockets unsuitable in UK and had to purchase separately universal plug (a further £6.99) also found rollers difficult to keep in place, certainly not like ones I had some years go (different make).  chose Remington as thought would be ideal</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve had experience with hot rollers and I have to say I am pleasantly surprised with this little set.  I was reluctant for years to try hot rollers because I was figured they&#x27;d be a waste of money.  Curling irons never get a curl into my hair, ever.  Even when I go to a pro, they struggle to get a curl into my hair.  After seeing so many people recommend hot rollers especially for hair that&#x27;s like mine, I decided to take a chance with hot rollers and decided to try this set since it&#x27;s smaller and not as pricey as others on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the picture and description, I thought that I&#x27;d need two sets to work all my hair into the rollers and I can actually get away with one set if I want looser curls.  This look is good for everyday.  I might need the second set for more tight curls.  For reference, my hair is layered and the longest layer reaches the small of my back.  I have lots of fine hair, as well.  Like I said, I never had much success with anything else that&#x27;s supposed to curl your hair but, with these, not only are they fast and easy, they curl my hair without an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HEAT: They heat up at a decent rate.  I think they reach optimum temp. in about 3 minutes, unlike the description states.  This isn&#x27;t an issue for me but, if you were looking for something that heats up much quicker than that, these might be a disappointment to you.  They hold their heat well while they are in your hair.  Also, I don&#x27;t have an issue where some curlers heat up and others don&#x27;t like other people stated in their reviews but, to be safe, I always make sure that they are pushed all the way into the heating device while heating up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLIPS: They come with their own clips.  They are the metal kind and I&#x27;ve heard that these kind are the best since they don&#x27;t leave marks or creases in your hair.  I also, unlike other reviewers, didn&#x27;t have an issue with these clips and their holdability.  They stay put and don&#x27;t flop around.  I think that if you&#x27;re having this issue, you might be putting too much hair around one roller.  I  can&#x27;t be certain of that but, that&#x27;s what I suspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIZE: These are definitely a portable set and if you plan to use these as a travel set, they are extremely compact.  I like that they are compact because, unlike other sets, they don&#x27;t have bulky cases that would take up far too much space in my bathroom.  Even with my two sets, I feel like they&#x27;re the perfect size and don&#x27;t take up much space at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love these and I&#x27;d recommend them to everyone looking to purchase some hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I ordered one set of these rollers and I loved them and ordered another set.  I like the red size best so I placed all the red in one and all the black in other.  I do use the black ones for the shorter part of my hair.  My hair holds the curl better with these rollers than any other product I have used before.</li>
            <li> The worst rollers I&#x27;ve ever used. They pop out as soon as you put in</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and left this in for the full 15 minutes. To my surprise I had a mass of tight curls!&lt;br /&gt;I need too tweak the timing of how long I leave them in, but very impressed with how well this works.</li>
            <li> This is a very small, compact set.  However, I was able to get all of my moderately thick, shoulder length hair rolled using just these 10 rollers.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just that my hair takes a curl fairly easily or because it&#x27;s not too long, but I only have to leave these in my hair for about 5-10 minutes and my hair will be nicely curled.  I left these in for 15 minutes the first time if did it, and my hair was waaay (too) curly and it lasted for over 24 until the next time I washed it.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect for traveling - compact and light weight.  However, allow 15 - 20 minutes for ALL the curlers to heat up, not the couple minutes as advertised.  I would have returned but I don&#x27;t use all that often.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my mom. Wish there were more rollers, but it works great. Heats up quickly and curls stay.</li>
            <li> The pins do not fit the rollers and pop out of your hair immediately.  It is so frustrating.  I wish they worked.</li>
            <li> I thought from the pic that five of the rollers were large, but they&#x27;re more like medium and small.  They heated well, but my hair is too long I guess.  :(</li>
            <li> I like the size.  The curlers are heavier than most, but heat well.  Make sure you push them all down into the connection or you might have a curler or two that doesn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li> This product was very disappointing.  I&#x27;ve used electric rollers for years and find that five large rollers give me just the right amount of curl and body and lasts all day-- except with these rollers!  The curlers fall out of my hair.  I tried using more curlers with less hair and the large rollers still fell out.  I will replace with the conair which do not disappoint.</li>
            <li> The wife likes them, said they are kind of heavy, but will do.</li>
            <li> Just what I have been looking for replacement.</li>
            <li> The rollers set is nice and small for packing, but the clips won&#x27;t hold very well and the velcro closer tore the first time I opened it.  I would not buy them again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on a Saturday afternoon, so I was expecting to get the product sometime towards the end of the next week. When I got home from work Monday, it had already arrived, which was a nice surprise. The rollers worked perfectly, and it heats up practically immediately. Unfortunately my hair will still not hold a curl, and it&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault; I&#x27;ve been trying to get my hair to hold a curl since I could curl my hair. I would definitely recommend this product (unless you have super, fine hair that won&#x27;t hold a curl).</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  Nice compact size for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;They take longer to heat up then advertised.  I think most would be&lt;br /&gt;happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I use these fro daily &amp; travel! They work great &amp; so fast with the perfect amount of rollers for mid length fine hair!</li>
            <li> YES they will curl your hair, (though I am sure there are a few exceptions). The case is very small and compact, although the image here makes the case look much larger.  I have not purchased curlers in a long time, so I found it odd that the nylon case the curlers are in, has a cord coming out of it that plugs into the wall...but maybe I am just out of the loop in the world of curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: I think curlers went out of style a while back, (though they never should have because they are much less of a hassle than the curling iron) so for those of you who are not familiar, here are some basic tips.&lt;br /&gt;1. Plug them up and let them heat for 15-20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;2. Don&#x27;t straighten your hair before hand (even if you have bad frizz like me) because it makes it harder to re-curl. If you need to straighten some parts, do it afterward.&lt;br /&gt;3. If you like, you can spritz your hair with some styling/heating formula&lt;br /&gt;4. Roll your hair. You may have to try this a few different times before you get your desired results. Some people like to roll the hair under, some over, some all the way up to the root, some not, some like to use just the big curlers, ect. If the roller is hot on your neck, tuck some tissue or TP between the roller and your neck.&lt;br /&gt;5. WAIT UNTIL CURLERS FEEL MOSTLY COOL ON YOUR HEAD. This is key! When they are cool, take the rollers out. If you feel the curls are too tight, run your fingers through your hair/flip your head over/brush it. If it looks just right, spritz it with hairspray, let it set for 5 min, and then run your fingers through your hair/flip your head over/brush it. After that, spray again.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Works great!</li>
            <li> Great for travel have had a set for over 15 years and time for a new one!! Really great for any traveler !</li>
            <li> These are quite terrible. They fall out of your hair so easily, the pins will not stay in, and one set is not enough for a full head of hair.</li>
            <li> Great for travel &amp; home usage !!</li>
            <li> The pins do not hold the rollers in your hair.</li>
            <li> clips don&#x27;t hold the rollers. Had to order special clips. Heat up fast.</li>
            <li> These get hot very quickly, but it is sometimes hard to get them to go on the small connector to reheat them. They are good for a travel set though. I don&#x27;t use them for everyday.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to heat and rollers don&#x27;t stay in very easily.  I don&#x27;t know why they can&#x27;t make better hot rollers.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, yet fine (middle eastern hair). I had my doubts that the curlers would be able to create tight curls, but i was wrong. The curlers dont seem to get very hot, because you can touch them, but it really only takes about 90 seconds to heat up, and i only left in my hair for less than 10 minutes, and the result is a very tight curl. :-)</li>
            <li> I decided to try hot curlers, but they don&#x27;t work at all for my long thick hair.  First of all, just wrapping my hair up in the curlers causes it to start to hurt, just from the weight of my hair.  Secondly,  it takes a lot longer than skillful use of a curling iron.  Lastly,  because I don&#x27;t have a problem with too little volume, this device made my hair a lot puffier than necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the device works perfectly, and I think would be good for chin length thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have super straight, long hair so I was not expecting much. These are awesome. They are ridiculously compact(great for travel!) They heat up fast. They don&#x27;t burn your fingers. I have super bouncy curls right now. WIN!</li>
            <li> After having remington travel  rollers for twenty years l do find these disappointing one thing they have a two pip pluge,and the clips do not grip the hair.As I need 20 mediam  I had to order four sets. Not very please with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I.  Hate. These.  Rollers.  I had a similar Remington set that I inherited from my mother that had to be replaced when one of my kids knocked them into the toilet.  Let me tell you, I&#x27;d rather use toilet rollers than these.  They do NOT stay in.  Miserable experience when a hot roller hits your bare foot because the pins don&#x27;t hold.  I wish I could give zero stars.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect for travel, the quantity of rollers is perfect for me, the color is attractive and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy (not in a good way) hair cut in a modern Sassoon bob, longer on the sides &amp; shorter in the back. My hair is way below chin length, but doesn&#x27;t quite reach my shoulders, still a sizable amt of hair to manage. My hair doesn&#x27;t look good just air dried or blown dry, it must be styled or flat ironed.  But, for the hot, humid summer I was looking for lower maintenance, less damage to my hair &amp; a way not subject my hair to a lot of flat ironing. I&#x27;d never used hot rollers in my life.  But, they seemed an option: a head full of longer loose curls. I didn&#x27;t know if they would be a solution, so chose this inexpensive set as an experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;They heat rapidly, in the 90 seconds as promised in the instructions, so your time isn&#x27;t wasted.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re definitely hot enuf to curl your hair, but not so hot that you can&#x27;t easily handle them. No safety issues here, your fingers won&#x27;t get burned. The sides stay cool, so very easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;They keep their heat for about 10-15 min, so do curl nicely &amp; also impart shine &amp; bounce. Because of my natural wave, I only had to keep them in my hair for 5-7 min.&lt;br /&gt;The ten rollers were enuf for my big thick head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;The package is well designed: the rollers &amp; metal pins all have a place in the soft plastic bag. The size is small, fantastic for traveling, very portable &amp; a space saver for those who don&#x27;t have much storage room in their home.&lt;br /&gt;You just plug the bag in &amp; wait 90 sec. Easy!&lt;br /&gt;The price is incredible: $14.95.&lt;br /&gt;Push down on each roller till it snaps into place, then that will insure each roller will heat up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;You need to physically wind your hair around these rollers as there aren&#x27;t many teeth or any Velcro to hold your hair to the rollers. There are a few \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; on the rollers &amp; the hair does hold, just wind your hair around the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;The metal clips work &amp;hold the hair in place but you do need to experiment w/a few different angles to insert them. After 3 rollers, I found the angle that worked for me: I insert diagonally, cross wise, from the bottom of the roller up vs insert the pin from top down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased w/these.  I may buy a 2nd set, so I have even more to use if my hair gets longer. After I got them, I noticed they were also in my local Target for a similar price. They would also make a terrific gift.</li>
            <li> I have to start saying that I don&#x27;t own, and never did, a curling iron. So I can&#x27;t compare with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin and frizzy and I got nice curls with these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, just plug in, in a few moments it&#x27;s hot but it&#x27;s ok to touch (but the sides don&#x27;t get hot) and you just roll your hair, attach the clips to hold it in place and go do something else while you wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how long I left it there, but not too long (it says that you only need 15&#x27;). It comes out with some nice curls and volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the result and I think it&#x27;s very practical because after you put it on your hair you can apply makeup, get dresses etc and then it&#x27;s done. I don&#x27;t like time consuming things so I am enjoying it!</li>
            <li> These rollers are perfect, not only in size, but also in the quality and the curls in my hair.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I curl my hair more than any other style and love hot rollers.  Unfortunately they are not convenient to travel with.  I researched and found these travel size hot rollers and was shocked at how lovely, soft and full my curls were.  I have long hair that reaches to the small of my back and I honestly didn&#x27;t think these would be enough to curl all of my hair at once.  I was wrong.  I now use these rollers all the time instead of the original large set because these create a more lovely, lasting curl and they take up less bathroom counter space :)</li>
            <li> Just horrible. If I could give them less than one star, I would. The clips hold the black rollers, but not the red ones at all. I used to have a travel set from Conair that was great. I guess I will have to find them again. Save yourself the hassle and pass on these.</li>
            <li> I bought this travel set of hot rollers in spite of some negative reviews stating 1) they didn&#x27;t heat up enough and 2) didn&#x27;t stay in fine hair. The first criticism is partially true. They don&#x27;t get as hot as some sets that I&#x27;ve owned, but I&#x27;m glad they don&#x27;t. These get plenty hot enough to curl my hair without being so hot I either can&#x27;t handle them, they burn my scalp, or result in  very tight, frizzy curls. On the contrary, these were very easy to handle, and they produced soft, loose curls, which was the look I wanted.  As to the second complaint, I have very fine hair, but these rollers stayed in my hair without any problem. However, you do have to roll them tightly and secure the pins, which are color-coded to the color of the roller. If you have trouble using the pins, this set would probably work with clip style pins. I plan to use these rollers both at home and while traveling. I have medium-length hair. Other travel sets only give you 5 rollers, which isn&#x27;t enough. The 10 roller set is the perfect amount of rollers for my needs.</li>
            <li> I saw the great reviews on here and thought that these would be good to try because it was only a $15 investment. I have longer hair (the longest it&#x27;s ever been, 6-7 inches past my shoulders) and needed something that could style my hair quickly and help w the frizz. I have fine hair but there is a lot of it, and it&#x27;s wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THe rollers were smaller that I thought I wanted, but I bought them anyway. I used the black ones first and did the sides of my face and the top layers of my hair. I then used the red ones for the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I timed the heat up to about 100 seconds, then started. I waited about 10-12 minutes to take them out after I finished putting in all of them, until the majority of them were cool. Then I started taking them out in the approximate order I put them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally said, HOLY S*** when I took them out. My hair had PERFECT large curl. EXACTLY what I wanted. It was so perfect I didn&#x27;t even have to brush it out. I will add photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is to not wrap the hair too tight around the rollers. For the pins, place the flat side next to your head. Push the pun directly down in the middle of the roller, so the pin and roller form an X or cross. I had NO problems with the rollers staying in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will now be using these probably every other day, since that&#x27;s when I wash and re-blow dry my hair. I&#x27;m obsessed!</li>
            <li> I bought a set of my these for myself and liked them so much a friend asked to borrow them for a trip.  She borrowed mine several times before I bought her a set of her own.  They heat quickly enough that if there aren&#x27;t enough of them, you can reposition them and reheat  for a &amp;#34;second helping&amp;#34; if necessary.</li>
            <li> Love it! Perfect for my hair, African American female with past shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> The clips don&#x27;t fit the rollers well at all!! The first couple of times I plugged them in only one side heated up; since then it has been working OK (but not as fast warming up as claimed) and I am always worried they are going to fail at any time because of my original experiences - I have a much older set of these rollers (same manufacturer) and they were/are far superior to these new ones.  Got the new ones since I was going to Europe and wanted the dual voltage - that feature worked fine.</li>
            <li> Great rollers for travel</li>
            <li> Going to order a second set.......that good!</li>
            <li> Like the set a lot.  The rollers heat up quickly and stay hot enough to get a good curl.  However, I need more rollers and will probably order some larger ones to go with these.</li>
            <li> I was going to say these were a joke, but I have to admit that my hair can be the issue.  Read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives for me: No on/off switch; the clips popped off several times, and I wasn&#x27;t putting too much hair on them or using the wrong clips; too many large and not-so-medium rollers; no small rollers.  I think I need rollers w/ more &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; or teeth.  These have small, non-synchronous raised areas that don&#x27;t really grip. I also felt they dried out my hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OTHERWISE... If you do NOT have short, coarse, thick hair like I do, then there are many redeeming qualities: cute, compact, fast-heating (and re-heating) rollers - perfect for travel or daily use - doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  The price is a great selling point (I actually got mine on sale at Target, but the Amazon price is still less expensive), and having used Remington products for many years, trust they would be reliable.</li>
            <li> Heats very fast, super compact wonderful for travel and affordable for ceramic with quality of Remington.  My last Remington rollers I bought over a decade ago and still use them just purchased this one to travel with and excited for my next trip so I can use them :)</li>
            <li> it heats up very fast, it takes a little practice to use the U shape pins but it gets very easy after a couple of times.</li>
            <li> Way too hard to use. Maybe I just need more practice? Also, the medium rollers give really strange looking curls. I think I should have bought a bigger set.</li>
            <li> The previous reviews about the red clips not holding and literally flying off across the room are spot on.  It happened to me several times, and not because I loaded too much hair on the curler.  The relatively smooth design is nice and hair grips well for a good start.  The edges of the curlers are not super hot, so use is easier, but the center is definitely hot enough to really set my hair well. I have some larger clips from a different set, and they seem to hold the curlers better, but I will probably still get some jaw clips to hold them more firmly in place.  Plan a little extra in your styling time schedule to allow them to cool COMPLETELY - you will be happy you did and get lots of body and soft curl.</li>
            <li> love it! My hair is so thin that it&#x27;s hard to get it curled but I was able to wave it with these rollers. took me a little longer because there isn&#x27;t enough but it&#x27;s perfect for travelling.</li>
            <li> I bought some rollers like this years ago and absolutely love them, so I was very excited to find these on amazon! These rollers give the perfect curl and are comfy and are great for traveling! I have a lot of hair, so I need 2 of these and now have 2.</li>
            <li> These rollers are horrible. They get so hot they burn your fingers when rolling your hair and the pins do not stay in. They literally pop off. I had to use pins from a 30 year old set. Take me back to the old days where things worked.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these at wally world.  The reason for buying two is that with my hair (thick and coarse) there is no way that 5 large or five medium rollers are going to do it for my hairstyle.  I have to have the same size rollers for my hairstyle.  I incorporated all the large ones into one unit and the same for the medium size rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the rollers worked for me (heating time 10 minutes as the 90 second heat up suggestion isn&#x27;t hot enough, not by a long shot.  Of course opening and closing the flap on the holder releases heat and the rollers on the end don&#x27;t retain their heat.  As I remove rollers from the ends first to try to use them, I can only get a couple before the other two are cold.  So I usually start with using rollers from the center, then move the end ones to the middle.  Sounds a pain I know, but I really do love these rollers and the convenient travel size. At most (for me) it&#x27;s irritating but not enough for me to return them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the flying hair clips!  As other reviews have said, yep the clips go flying out in all directions!  Your loved ones (even the dog) run for cover.  Not all is lost though.  I discovered that the large clips work fine for the smaller medium rollers and don&#x27;t go flying.  Made sense to me that the large rollers then needed larger clips and I found them on evil bay for a couple of bucks.  If you have very thick hair, they work great and I haven&#x27;t had a single clip fall out.  If you have very thin hair, then I don&#x27;t know what to suggest other than returning them and finding another option.  Now, truth be told, no I don&#x27;t think I can do the Watusi while wearing the rollers, but they do stay in place.  The brand name of the clips is Sta-Rite and a size large is what is needed to keep the large rollers in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I took a star away for the lousy design of the clips and the fact that the end rollers don&#x27;t stay hot unless you move them around.  A rating of 3.5 would be more like it but I rounded up since they do work for my needs.</li>
            <li> I love these but they are heavy. They are more like the traditional hot rollers which I love. I cannot use the ones that have flocking as it makes my hair frizzy. These leave my hair shiny and bouncy. If you you have sent hair one set might be enough however if you even remotely have medium thickness of hair you will need to sets in order to get a good curl. You can use just one set but you are going to really have to cram a lot of hair on to each roller. They heat up fast. They are also small and compact so even if you have to to travel it&#x27;s not a big deal. Everything that you need is right inside the case so there&#x27;s no big chance of you losing the pins.</li>
            <li> These are the best heated rollers I have ever used.  Sorry I took so long to replace my old ones!</li>
            <li> This turned out to be one of those products that I wished I had spent more money on because the inexpensive route was the wrong way to go. I have really thick hair and even when I would roll just a small section of it up in one these within five to ten seconds my hair would spit them out because it was too heavy for the curler to hold. I should have listened to the other reviews but I&#x27;m a stubborn tightwad. So if you&#x27;re reading this and you&#x27;re a fellow tightwad with thick hair.....believe me this is a waste of time. Spend the extra money on something better. I give it two stars instead of one because if you&#x27;re willing to spend three hours curling your hair in small half inch sections then indeed it does work....but c&#x27;mon ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that.</li>
            <li> These are just horrible. I&#x27;ll echo the other negative reviews by saying that those clips are completely ineffective. No matter what size the roller, it just slid right out of my hair. At first, I thought I was just putting them in wrong. I was left chasing rollers around the floor and with straight hair with a little weird looking crinkle in it. One of the clips flew behind my radiator. I&#x27;m not sure how they can get away with selling a product that just flat out does not work. I feel like I should just go back to the curling iron.</li>
            <li> Curlers work great and feel good. A nice size assortment, but the clips DO NOT work. My old clips from an older Remington set do work on these new curlers.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of curlers ... in a light travel case.  I had one before ... it died ... so glad to have found this replacement.  The little case is not as nice as the one for my last set but ... so far so good.  I do use this set at home as well as on the road.</li>
            <li> Rollers work great , but pins will not stay on. Better use clips bought separately. Really need about 4 more if you have much hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a two-week tent camping trip to Colorado.  I have a car-inverter for my laptop and figured I could get a nice, little set of hot rollers I could plug in once in a while and make myself look a little bit more presentable!  I got them on the way rather than beforehand, so didn&#x27;t know until we were a state or two away from point of purchase that they didn&#x27;t work....AT ALL.  I think ONE got a little warmish...but I&#x27;m not completely sure of that.  I thought maybe it was plugging them into the car that was the problem (although everything else electric worked with that set-up), so I tried plugging them into a campground bathroom outlet...again, nothing.  It said they would heat up in 90 seconds!!  I&#x27;m thinking maybe they meant 90 hours.</li>
            <li> This has got to be designed for people with super fine hair. I have average, Irish hair and this does not get high enough to do anything for my hair. The rollers do not offer uniform heat, some do not even get hot, only slightly warm. I&#x27;ve been doing my hair since I was 12, and have used several roller sets for updos and this is one of two that is just no good. I was excited at the portability of this, and it is portable... it just doesn&#x27;t work. Save your money. I even tried to do tiny tendrils of only a tiny amount of hair and it still was not hot enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a variety of curlers, curling wands, and curling irons over the years in attempts to style my otherwise very straight, thin hair.  My mother had a set of these rollers that I tried out and completely fell in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curlers heat in 5-7 minutes, though I&#x27;ll often leave them on for closer to 10 for maximum heat.  Please note, they do get VERY hot, so it may be beneficial to use a glove (as one would with a curling wand) when using these rollers.  I use the smaller rollers for the top of my hair and the larger for big curls in the under layers.  Since I have relatively thin hair, 10 rollers does the trick.  For those with thicker and/or longer hair, you may want two sets unless you&#x27;re going for big curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other rollers I&#x27;ve purchased in the past, these don&#x27;t snag your hair when you try to take them out - worthy alone of a five star rating!  Even better, my curls hold WITHOUT hairspray for 5-8 hours with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is also great - the small, compact set easily fits into my carry-on suitcase or gym bag.  I&#x27;m buying a second set to leave in my suitcase full time.</li>
            <li> I love it but then my hair is thin.  I did have to find some clamp like clips to keep the rollers in.</li>
            <li> The clips don&#x27;t stay in place well at all</li>
            <li> I never write reviews for products, but when it comes to these rollers i just had to! I&#x27;m not saying that they are for everyone, but if you have shoulder length fine hair like I do these are perfect. To get really good results blowdry your hair first,and than put on these rollers. I was a little disappointed by the clips, but after a while I figured out how to use them and they work great. I&#x27;ll probably end up buying a second pack of rollers just because my hair is getting a little longer but its worth it! The only reason I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars is because i wish it brought more rollers! This product is worth buying!</li>
            <li> The little clips that hold the rollers to your hair don&#x27;t stay clipped very well.  They do heat up quickly, but are constantly falling out of my hair.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful curlers.  I travel all over the country on my Harley and this is going to be great when my hair is not pulled back in a bandana.. My space is limited so this with the conair travel smart dryer will be awesome.  I have hair to the middle of my back...fairly thick and curly.  I blow dry straight the best I can, then curl.  Some reviews say they don&#x27;t heat up...You have to PUSH the curler down on stem so it makes contact and keep the cover on it.  Leave them on longer if you them hotter.  The clips hold fine..you just have to know how to put them in,,go from the opposite way that you roll the curler.  The curl lasts for 8 to 10 hours, but my hair has curl so don&#x27;t know how it works on straight hair.</li>
            <li> They heat up really fast, really high quality construction.  Compact size makes them great for travel and home use. The size is perfect for volume and curl, I ended up purchasing 3.</li>
            <li> These work quickly and are so nice and compact. They just aren&#x27;t very large. I use them anyway and get a soft curly look. I would have described them as small and medium size rollers.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of curlers over the years - so I thought I&#x27;d give these a shot.  I do not like them.  The curl holds for about 20 minutes and then - nothing.  I even tried sleeping in them - to give them extra time. Same thing. My hair is not hard to curl and these just do not do it for me. Finally just gave up and gave them to Goodwill.  Maybe they will work for SOMEBODY!</li>
            <li> I used these today to get some waves on my hair and they are wonderful. Kept them on my hair for only 10 minutes and got beautiful waves. They heat up pretty fast, like in 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years both at home and when travelling.  It curls the hair with out burning my scalp.  These rollers are very well made and they last for years.  .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these in my travel bag for 20 years.  Loved them.  But the new ones are absolutely horrible.  I bought TWO new ones since I have thick hair. Both of them were terrible, so this isn&#x27;t an incident of my getting a random bad one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curlers do not get very hot, and they are very heavy, so combined with pins that don&#x27;t hold them in place means you have rollers and pins all over the bathroom floor instead of on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The red canvas case is cheap too, the unit is poorly constructed. And while you&#x27;re working with a brush/comb with one hand trying to pop a roller out with the other hand is difficult too, because the rollers are too tight on the heating posts.  I threw mine away.  Just tossed it out.</li>
            <li> These curlers are great! They heat up so quickly and give my hair such a nice curl. I do have longer hair though, so I had to purchase a second set to get the best out of the curlers. I like that there is 2 different sizes of curlers, it gives my hair more dimension!</li>
            <li> Personally, I thought this product was really difficult to wrap around my straight, slightly layered Asian hair.  My hair kept on slipping off the roller. By the time I managed to get the roller rolled closed to my head, there were lots of stray hairs flying in every direction, and the provided clips didn&#x27;t work well to keep the rollers in place near my scalp.  I don&#x27;t know, perhaps I just don&#x27;t know how to use the gadget correctly, but personally I have a lot better luck with velcro rollers.  Sorry, Remington...</li>
            <li> These rollers were too small and too slim for long thick hair, even though other reviews said otherwise. I had to return them as I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten much use out of them.</li>
