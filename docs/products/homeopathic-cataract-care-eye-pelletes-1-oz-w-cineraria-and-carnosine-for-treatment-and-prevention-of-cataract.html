    <ol>
            <li>so I will continue to use the pellets and hope for the best.</li>
            <li>very good stuff</li>
            <li>great product - seems to help</li>
            <li>Homeopathy is used by the royal family of England, and everybody has to convene that they all look in great shape.</li>
            <li>is great news.</li>
            <li>am combining it with bright eyes &amp; ALA.</li>
            <li>Bright eyes dissolve the cataracts &amp; the alpha lipoic acid</li>
            <li>service good.  -  Giving product a try</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Good homeopathic product with almost immediate results; smoothe transaction</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and they looked good, so bought a bottle.</li>
            <li>I bought it together with eye drops and they both work good.</li>
            <li>Nice complement to the eye drops.</li>
            <li>So then I thought about stopping these pellets but they seem to be helping more and more every day, it is amazing!</li>
            <li>these are easy and pleasant to take and seem to e helping.</li>
            <li>Best of luck with them, I wish you all clear vision!</li>
            <li>so these drops and tabs are very important.</li>
            <li>I guess I did not read the description better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe the eyedrops work better, but knowing how homeopathy works, I doubt it.</li>
            <li>is seeing more and the cataracts may be diminishing.  </li>
            <li>I guess it takes longer to show better result</li>
            <li>My eyes are doing better along with the treatments I get.  </li>
            <li>I should be able to undergo my cataract surgery and this product helped me get there.</li>
            <li>So I am reordering more and sending 1 to my mother in law.</li>
            <li>We hope for more improvement.</li>
            <li>My cataracts didn&#x27;t get any better.  </li>
            <li>I doubt that this helps, but it did give me hope...until I finally got the cataract surgery which has worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>So to heck with the insurance companies and their surgery, they can keep it because I can see out of my right eye again!</li>
            <li>directions say they would be absorbed through the gums for best results, so for dogs its hard to do that</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this eye pelletes for my husband, who has a mild cataract.</li>
            <li>I rarely need the glasses anymore.  </li>
            <li>using until gone i would hope it breaks up or minimize the cats they are fresh march 25th</li>
            <li>But her eyes are definitely more clear of discharge.</li>
            <li>This may not be a problem for most, because I am sensitive to all kinds of things.</li>
            <li>Yea right.</li>
            <li>This does not have the right ingredient for my symptoms.</li>
            <li>A cateract in my right eye has been there since Oct 2012.</li>
            <li>We just can&#x27;t afford it right now.</li>
            <li>Molly Anne is bouncing around and able to see clearly enough to see where she is going.&lt;br /&gt;Hooray...</li>
            <li>I noticed that my 10 year old Beagle was getting a cloudiness in her eyes and her veterinarian confirmed the presence of an opaque area in her eye.</li>
            <li>I took the product just like they say: 3 pellets, 3 times a day (a total of 9 pellets a day).  </li>
            <li>For the first 200 days I also took the eye drops.  </li>
            <li>No matter how safe laser surgery doctors report it to be, there can be complications from laser surgery, and this does seem like such a safer alternative..</li>
            <li>-I noticed a difference first time</li>
            <li>A friend of mine said this worked for her dog (a large 90 pound Chow mix)</li>
            <li>Certainly hope I have bluriness.</li>
            <li>I really believe that these pellets have a positive affect on my vision.  </li>
            <li>I had diabetes in my eyes and undergo intense treatments.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if these work</li>
            <li>but I will take the whole bottle with my dog.</li>
            <li>But after 200 days, the drops irritated my eyes so much, I had to discontinue taking them.  </li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t seen much improvement</li>
            <li>so much so, he&#x27;s decided to just continue to use these two products rather than reschedule the surgery..</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very hopeful, and so am I, that this will help dissolve the cataracts...</li>
            <li>As for us, we are very hopeful and will continue to give this a try.</li>
            <li>Meaning I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have all the processed other stuff they use to make medicines.  </li>
            <li>i highly doubt any cat/care or slowing process med will help anyone or animal with full diabetes req daily insulin shots as my min pin</li>
            <li>This particular product is still being used, so the effectiveness of it will come in about a month.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t a quick fix and needs to be used as directed on a daily basis..</li>
            <li>Another positive side effect is that since she was about 3 she has had issues with discharge coming from her eyes and it seems to be helping clear up that issue as well.</li>
            <li>But my eyes do seem a little better.</li>
            <li>I had little sight out of my left eye and much more out of my right eye.</li>
            <li>After taking these pills for a month, my right eye regained total sight.</li>
            <li>so they cannot duplicate the cuts with the new lens</li>
            <li>Other than that, I would like to say that I&#x27;m a great believer in natural healing products, and have definitely noticed benefits from other products.</li>
            <li>My left eye is improving, more slowly than the right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll know for a little more after her next appointment.</li>
            <li>Still to early to determine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a organic, natural, homeopathic type person.  </li>
            <li>So far there has been no improvement.</li>
            <li>so I thought why not try it with my almost 10 year old 8 pound Yorkie with cataracts in both eyes.</li>
            <li>So then I found these Homeopathic Cataract eye pellets on Amazon and starting taking 5 pellets a day based on the normal dosage of Homepathic remedies (taking more not necessarily better) on February 1, 2014.</li>
            <li>Helps with cataract in conjunction with  Natural Ophthalmics drops</li>
            <li>and they are working on my dog that had developed cataracts.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s nearly 8 months.  </li>
            <li>I really never knew if it really work or not !</li>
            <li>after further study tis product is not specific enough at least in my condition I recommend the book asa hershoff homeopathic remedies for more specific direction on homeopathic use for cataract</li>
            <li>no improvement my min pin can barely see from side to side perif only..</li>

            <li> I have not used the product long enough to tell its impact on my cataracts.</li>
            <li> improvement left eye is broken cats right eye solid</li>
            <li> I have not used this very long, but is starting to help.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is the second product i&#x27;ve tried to control/reduce cats with little change.</li>
            <li> I used this product as per the directions and had no positive results at all, the bottle lasted around 60 days.</li>
            <li> Being naive about health insurance and not old enough for Medicare, I thought you could just have surgery to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> i tried one jar for my dog who has cataracts due to diabetes.</li>
            <li> I did some research and found that other countries treat cataracts with eyedrops, not with surgery.</li>
            <li> So the last eye specialist said in January 2014 that it still wasn&#x27;t bad enough but try to get the driver&#x27;s license early</li>
            <li> I give her 3 pellets 3 times a day for at least the last 3 months.</li>
            <li> Have only seen slow down not any clearing up.</li>
            <li> but I am about half way there.</li>
            <li> but it seems less cloudy from my view.</li>
            <li> In fact, they got worse, as cataracts generally do.  </li>
            <li> and I see little result</li>
            <li> I will continue to use,takes a few months.</li>
            <li> excellent,I am a firm follower of homeopathy.</li>
            <li> Lo and behold there are degrees of how bad it is before the insurance companies wll pay for cateract surgery regardless of my having to drive at night for work and the fact that I am part of a first response team for our county.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hoping that it does, ordered a 2nd one to keep on trying as eye drops are difficult to administer</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>
            <li> I cant get my dog to take theses, so kinda sucks.</li>
            <li> But, as any homeopathic medicine they work slowly.</li>
            <li> They kept saying the cateract wasn&#x27;t bad enough, I was worried because my driver&#x27;s license had to be renewed this year and required an eye test.</li>
            <li> At least it is not getting worse</li>
            <li> my eye doctor says my cataracts have not gooten worse in 4 years so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe my cataracts have gotten worse, but they haven&#x27;t improved.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had an allergic reaction and had to stop using them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> She also doesn&#x27;t seem to mind the pellet, but that&#x27;s because I give it to her with a piece of chicken</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice complement to the eye drops.</li>
            <li> Part 3 of the Protocol. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> But my eyes do seem a little better. I am using in conjunction with Can-see drops for a cataract condition.</li>
            <li> service good.  -  Giving product a try</li>
            <li> Buyer beware. I guess I did not read the description better. These are pills and not drops. 3 pills 3 times a day ? Yea right. Probably last 2 weeks max.</li>
            <li> Did not work.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the eyedrops work better, but knowing how homeopathy works, I doubt it. This does not have the right ingredient for my symptoms.</li>
            <li> great product - seems to help</li>
            <li> I believe that that this product is helping to eliminate some of the cataract in my Molly Anne&#x27;s eyes.&lt;br /&gt;She is seeing more and the cataracts may be diminishing.  Still to early to determine.&lt;br /&gt;But Molly Anne is bouncing around and able to see clearly enough to see where she is going.&lt;br /&gt;Hooray...</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this product. I had little sight out of my left eye and much more out of my right eye. After taking these pills for a month, my right eye regained total sight. My left eye is improving, more slowly than the right but I am about half way there.This product has made a difference.</li>
            <li> I been using this po roduct for a month and I see little result I guess it takes longer to show better result</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a organic, natural, homeopathic type person.  Meaning I love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have all the processed other stuff they use to make medicines.  This particular product is still being used, so the effectiveness of it will come in about a month.  Once a month has passed I will update this review to let you know the status.</li>
            <li> after further study tis product is not specific enough at least in my condition I recommend the book asa hershoff homeopathic remedies for more specific direction on homeopathic use for cataract</li>
            <li> I noticed that my 10 year old Beagle was getting a cloudiness in her eyes and her veterinarian confirmed the presence of an opaque area in her eye. I decided to try this supplement to try to dissolve the forming cataract. I give her 3 pellets 3 times a day for at least the last 3 months. We will have to wait until her next visit with the veterinarian to see if there is any improvement but it seems less cloudy from my view. There is approx. a 6 week supply of pellets in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 06/29/14- My dog was recently to the veterinarian for an exam and the doctor told me that there is still a cloudiness but that the doctor can see thru the obstruction so..... do the pellets work? At least it is not getting worse so I will continue to use the pellets and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> Need to use daily. To get an idea of the optimal change on the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to let you know,</li>
            <li> I was having lots of eye problems and while dealing with them, the doctor said he also found cataracts.  I began using these drops, and the pellets.  My vision has definitely improved.  I rarely need the glasses anymore.  My dog was just diagnosed with cataracts today and plan to do the same for her that I have done for myself and see what the vet has to say as we go forward.</li>
            <li> Whoever makes the product, I want to thank you for saving my life.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how to rate this product, because it&#x27;s one that would have to be used for quite some time before results would be seen. I&#x27;m seeing an eye doctor within three or four months, and will ask if he notices any changes. At that time, I&#x27;ll post in again. Other than that, I would like to say that I&#x27;m a great believer in natural healing products, and have definitely noticed benefits from other products.</li>
            <li> Having a cataract removal soon. Can not take them until I get approval from my doctor.</li>
            <li> Have only seen slow down not any clearing up. Though I would see some cataract reversal from what I saw advertised</li>
            <li> Bought this product for dog with onset of diabetes and overwhelmed cats in both eyes. given same 3x daily dosage as a human with&lt;br /&gt;little improvement left eye is broken cats right eye solid no improvement my min pin can barely see from side to side perif only..&lt;br /&gt;still using until gone i would hope it breaks up or minimize the cats they are fresh march 25th 2014 not yrs hardened i highly doubt any cat/care or slowing process med will help anyone or animal with full diabetes req daily insulin shots as my min pin does.&lt;br /&gt;this is the second product i&#x27;ve tried to control/reduce cats with little change.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is going to work yet. So far there has been no improvement. Homeopathis remedies take time. I bought two bottles so I will let you know when I am done with both of them.</li>
            <li> The person for whom I bought this says it is working.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Good price. Hope it works.</li>
            <li> these are easy and pleasant to take and seem to e helping.</li>
            <li> still no results on my eyes!  I really never knew if it really work or not ! I tried it twice</li>
            <li> I really believe that these pellets have a positive affect on my vision.  I had diabetes in my eyes and undergo intense treatments.  My eyes are doing better along with the treatments I get.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t hurt boosting your vision during my treatments.  I believe it also gives me some clarity  I should be able to undergo my cataract surgery and this product helped me get there.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine said this worked for her dog (a large 90 pound Chow mix) so I thought why not try it with my almost 10 year old 8 pound Yorkie with cataracts in both eyes. I give her one pellet a day and it seems to be helping. Another positive side effect is that since she was about 3 she has had issues with discharge coming from her eyes and it seems to be helping clear up that issue as well. She also doesn&#x27;t seem to mind the pellet, but that&#x27;s because I give it to her with a piece of chicken and I squish it together. I think it is helping with her cataracts but it&#x27;s hard to tell. But her eyes are definitely more clear of discharge. I&#x27;ll know for a little more after her next appointment. Either way I&#x27;ll continue using it because it does seem to be helping.</li>
            <li> sugar pills is all they are. wish I didn&#x27;t order them</li>
            <li> I used this product as per the directions and had no positive results at all, the bottle lasted around 60 days. I was using this with the eye drops by the same manufacturer and after 60 days my cataract in my left eye has not changed at all, I will not buy this product again</li>
            <li> Good homeopathic product with almost immediate results; smoothe transaction</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and they looked good, so bought a bottle. It made my Labradors eye even cloudier! I threw it in the garbage. I would not recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have not used this very long, but is starting to help. I would recomend this product. I will continue to use,takes a few months.</li>
            <li> Too soon to see if it works but I take it 3x daily and hope for improved vision.</li>
            <li> excellent,I am a firm follower of homeopathy. my cataract has already diminished in size after the use of these pellets for 6months</li>
            <li> Homeopathy is used by the royal family of England, and everybody has to convene that they all look in great shape.</li>
            <li> I am trying these and do not have a lot to report yet. The drops have helped me a lot my eye doctor says my cataracts have not gooten worse in 4 years so is great news. I had radials done years ago with the diamond knife so they cannot duplicate the cuts with the new lens so advise is no surgery so these drops and tabs are very important. I will leave a further update on this</li>
            <li> A cateract in my right eye has been there since Oct 2012. Being naive about health insurance and not old enough for Medicare, I thought you could just have surgery to get rid of it. Lo and behold there are degrees of how bad it is before the insurance companies wll pay for cateract surgery regardless of my having to drive at night for work and the fact that I am part of a first response team for our county. They kept saying the cateract wasn&#x27;t bad enough, I was worried because my driver&#x27;s license had to be renewed this year and required an eye test. My job depends on having a current valid driver&#x27;s license. So the last eye specialist said in January 2014 that it still wasn&#x27;t bad enough but try to get the driver&#x27;s license early and if I don&#x27;t pass the eye test I could have grounds to complain to the insurance company and maybe get the surgery approved. What a hassle! So then I found these Homeopathic Cataract eye pellets on Amazon and starting taking 5 pellets a day based on the normal dosage of Homepathic remedies (taking more not necessarily better) on February 1, 2014. The pellets worked, they started clearing up the cateract and improving my eye sight within days. I went for my driver&#x27;s license test on Feb 26 and passed! So then I thought about stopping these pellets but they seem to be helping more and more every day, it is amazing! So I am reordering more and sending 1 to my mother in law. So to heck with the insurance companies and their surgery, they can keep it because I can see out of my right eye again!</li>
            <li> I had big hopes for these pellets. Unfortunately, I had an allergic reaction and had to stop using them. I don&#x27;t know whether they work or not. This may not be a problem for most, because I am sensitive to all kinds of things. Best of luck with them, I wish you all clear vision!</li>
            <li> At this point I&#x27;m not seeing any results!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if these work but I will take the whole bottle with my dog.</li>
            <li> Helps with cataract in conjunction with  Natural Ophthalmics drops</li>
            <li> Delivery on time and they are working on my dog that had developed cataracts.  He has gotten the brown color back in his eyes by 75% or so.</li>
            <li> Too difficult to tell if they really help,but certainly worth a try along with the eye drops. ..surgery last resort.</li>
            <li> I cant get my dog to take theses, so kinda sucks. I just use the eye drops, way easier.  I wish I could exchange for the eye drops.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye pelletes for my husband, who has a mild cataract. I bought it together with eye drops and they both work good. But, as any homeopathic medicine they work slowly. There is some improvement for the 7 months he already used them. We hope for more improvement.</li>
            <li> I doubt that this helps, but it did give me hope...until I finally got the cataract surgery which has worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> My cataracts didn&#x27;t get any better.  In fact, they got worse, as cataracts generally do.  I&#x27;ll be getting the surgery this year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  I don&#x27;t believe my cataracts have gotten worse, but they haven&#x27;t improved.  I read somewhere that you should give this product nine months.  That&#x27;s 270 days.  I took this product faithfully for 238 days.  That&#x27;s nearly 8 months.  I took the product just like they say: 3 pellets, 3 times a day (a total of 9 pellets a day).  For the first 200 days I also took the eye drops.  But after 200 days, the drops irritated my eyes so much, I had to discontinue taking them.  But anyway, I would think that after 8 months of taking the cataract pellets, my vision would improve.  Would one extra month make that big a difference?  I doubt it.</li>
            <li> i tried one jar for my dog who has cataracts due to diabetes. i haven&#x27;t seen much improvement but I&#x27;m hoping that it does, ordered a 2nd one to keep on trying as eye drops are difficult to administer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;never worked, dog&#x27;s eyes never improved...directions say they would be absorbed through the gums for best results, so for dogs its hard to do that</li>
            <li> I have not used the product long enough to tell its impact on my cataracts. Certainly hope I have bluriness.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband along with the Cataract Eye Drops with Cineraria 15ml. He was scheduled to have cataract surgery in December, but then ended up with the flu and a couple of days in the hospital, so he opted to put the surgery off because we have hospital bills to pay off and the only cataract doctor in our area does not offer a payment plan. We just can&#x27;t afford it right now. I did some research and found that other countries treat cataracts with eyedrops, not with surgery. That search brought me to Amazon and this product.. I decided to buy the two products for my husband to see if it might help..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using both for 2 months as directed, he feels that he&#x27;s seeing an improvement, so much so, he&#x27;s decided to just continue to use these two products rather than reschedule the surgery.. He&#x27;s very hopeful, and so am I, that this will help dissolve the cataracts... No matter how safe laser surgery doctors report it to be, there can be complications from laser surgery, and this does seem like such a safer alternative.. It&#x27;s at least worth a try in an attempt to prevent the need for surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t a quick fix and needs to be used as directed on a daily basis.. As for us, we are very hopeful and will continue to give this a try.</li>
            <li> very good stuff-I noticed a difference first time I took it .I am combining it with bright eyes &amp; ALA. Bright eyes dissolve the cataracts &amp; the alpha lipoic acid blocks the enzyme the allows them to for-so I am going at it from all sides</li>
