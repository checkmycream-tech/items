            <li>But I am very happy with the price of the kit, and I would not be expecting to have an awesome professional brush in it.  </li>

            <li>Very easy to do.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to mix the ingredients and apply.</li>
            <li>I thought it amazing, my eyebrows are light and always had to use pencil.&lt;br /&gt;Not anymore !  </li>
            <li>This tint is very light.</li>
            <li>I love this eyebrow dye.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I do this instead of having to pay $$$ at a salon every month.</li>
            <li>its alright -probably need more practice or better directions</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love the results.</li>
            <li>, i think i love this.</li>
            <li>I love the way it looks on my eyebrows</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t leave the product on for more than 1 min.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a problem with this, but just as a heads up to those who might be thinking about purchasing. :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But I think for someone with light blonde hair it would be perfect.  </li>
            <li>The color is great, brows look very natural.</li>
            <li>This product does work and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Though godfrey is made with henna clay it has a strong odor, this product had almost none.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy that brush and little cup for mixing are included.</li>
            <li>I use light brown</li>
            <li>The great part is that it totally covered the gray eyebrow hairs.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product...</li>
            <li>I like godfroy because it was cheap, but trust me, this product is much more worth it.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pleased that I don&#x27;t need to darken my eyebrows with powder every day.  </li>
            <li>My hair is a pretty light blonde (not platinum) and this looks great on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The brush supplies makes it easy to get the shape right.</li>
            <li>however I never leave it one for the full length</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need nearly as much brow powder, and my eyes have more definition when I&#x27;m sans-makeup, too.</li>
            <li>but my face wash fades it really quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with the quality of the product and I would definitely recommend the brand to everyone.</li>
            <li>Will update if it fades too quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast!</li>
            <li>works really well and easy to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried.comes off skin very well and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The brush is a little too soft and not the best quality, so I would recommend using another brush.</li>
            <li>I own it in darker, use it regularly; bought this version/tint for my strawberry-blond-haired sister, who LOVES it.  </li>
            <li>As good as any other product.  </li>
            <li>Loks identical to the dye they market as eyebrow and lash, but It says right on the tube of dye &amp;#34;This product must not be used for dyeing the eyelashes or eyebrows; to do so may cause blindness.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I dye my light blonde eyebrows every other week and works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently every month or so for the past 6 months, whenever the color fades, and it looks great.</li>
            <li>Great color, much better than the godfrey which was too severe and gave me angry brows.  </li>
            <li>For whatever reason the beauty salons in the US charge way more that Australia for tinting and waxing facial hairs.</li>
            <li>then I am used to, but it really made my eyes pop!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be careful with this when doing your own eyebrows to keep it out of your eyes.  </li>
            <li>This really is more of a dark brown for me, however, even though it&#x27;s says its light brown.</li>
            <li>Love that I only have to put on mascara to go out now.  </li>
            <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call the color &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>i feel like i could enjoy the beach and things more because im less worried about having NO eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I had the developer, the dye and a nice sized little container to mix this in.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much faster to get ready.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s really just a neutral medium brown color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to do and saves a lot of $ on salon treatments, which are typically $15 minimum.</li>
            <li>Better using less time for the first application and wait one day to make sure your brows don&#x27;t get too dark.</li>
            <li>I wiped it off after just a minute to make sure I didn&#x27;t go to dark,</li>
            <li>Love it, such low maintenance....</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this.  </li>
            <li>but im naturally a light/medium brown.</li>
            <li>i read reviews where people said this light brown was so dark it was almost back,</li>
            <li>A little darker than I expected but a very handy little kit.  </li>
            <li>Really works well and stays for a long time.</li>
            <li>Light brown did nothing even though I have pale blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>the only reason i havent rated this 5 stars is because as of right now i dont know how long the color will last.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the natural brown, and look forward to its arrival.</li>
            <li>I have naturally medium brown hair, but my brows are blonde.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural strawberry blonde and my eyebrows are white.</li>
            <li>Before this I used Godfroy for a few years and the results were ok, the color only lasted a week and a half maximum.</li>
            <li>As a red head with blond corse hair and not patience for daily make up tinting my eyebrows and eyelashes is far easier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy, little mess, and no danger of getting it in my eyes or anything as the cream is thick and stays put when mixed right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a dark blonde (close to brown), so it&#x27;s a little too light for me, next time I probably would go with just brown.</li>
            <li>As a novice, I thought it was bad that it darkened, turns out that&#x27;s actually good.</li>

            <li> I recently purchased the natural brown, and look forward to its arrival.</li>
            <li> I have naturally medium brown hair, but my brows are blonde.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural strawberry blonde and my eyebrows are white.</li>
            <li> Before this I used Godfroy for a few years and the results were ok, the color only lasted a week and a half maximum.</li>

            <li> As a novice, I thought it was bad that it darkened, turns out that&#x27;s actually good.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time even with regular several x/month use.  </li>
            <li> otherwise it turns far to dark.</li>
            <li> Long lasting</li>
            <li> double the brows alittle goes a long way and dont leave on to long</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been three weeks total and the color has hardly faded if not at all, still no white hairs and looks completely natural.</li>
            <li> Covers grey.</li>
            <li> o i also feel like this will totes last a long time because you only need a little color and a couple drops of solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blonde and it&#x27;s not too dark.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the thickest brows, but I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call them thin, so</li>
            <li> I could go with 5 minutes next time and probably get to a little lighter brown.  </li>
            <li> The color is darker than expected though</li>
            <li> but product is darker than I expected</li>
            <li> I used it a few days ago and it makes such a difference!  </li>
            <li> It does darken a little the next day as other reviewers indicated.  </li>
            <li> I leave the dye on longer near my nose, and less time on the ends, usually 5 mins total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The color has turned to the dark lower than expected.</li>
            <li> She recommended squeezing the dye into the small glass mixing thing, and adding developer and mixing with the white stick thing until its just creamy.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands that worked but faded within 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> A step not covered in the instructions that made a big difference is letting the dye sit for at least a minute to oxidize before applying.</li>
            <li> So for me leaving the color even for 15-20 minutes doesn&#x27;t make the color dark.</li>
            <li> Not for dark eyebrows.</li>
            <li> And much less than the salon (where the grays came uncovered in a week).</li>
            <li> I was a little worried I would have caterpillar eyebrows</li>
            <li> or youll have somne dark brows !!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a natural strawberry blonde and my eyebrows are white. Before this I used Godfroy for a few years and the results were ok, the color only lasted a week and a half maximum. I like godfroy because it was cheap, but trust me, this product is much more worth it. godfroy was only 2 minutes per eyebrow (i did 15 on each for this product) it&#x27;s been three weeks total and the color has hardly faded if not at all, still no white hairs and looks completely natural. I use light brown</li>
            <li> Love it! The color is darker than expected though</li>
            <li> Product arrived announced.&lt;br /&gt;My Wife liked a lot.</li>
            <li> This is amazing for eyebrows.  I own it in darker, use it regularly; bought this version/tint for my strawberry-blond-haired sister, who LOVES it.  Lasts a long time even with regular several x/month use.  I HIGHLY recommend this.  Would not use on eyelashes (tried. it burns. Won&#x27;t repeat).  On eyebrows its amazing.</li>
            <li> The color has turned to the dark lower than expected. But I liked the result!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Really works well and stays for a long time.</li>
            <li> Light brown did nothing even though I have pale blonde hair.  Mixing the two ingredients just makes a gloppy messy, impossible to apply even with the disposable mascara brushes I ordered separately on the advice of other users.  The instructions recommend you use a color remover for your skin that does not come with the kit.  So I ordered that separately (for $37 bucks!) before using the product.  Turns out I didn&#x27;t need it at all because the &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t color at all.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow dye. My best friend is an esthetician and begged me not to home dye my eyebrows, but I gave it a try with this product and I&#x27;m really happy with the results--I&#x27;ve been using it consistently every month or so for the past 6 months, whenever the color fades, and it looks great. It&#x27;s very easy, little mess, and no danger of getting it in my eyes or anything as the cream is thick and stays put when mixed right. I&#x27;m really glad I do this instead of having to pay $$$ at a salon every month. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason the beauty salons in the US charge way more that Australia for tinting and waxing facial hairs. As a red head with blond corse hair and not patience for daily make up tinting my eyebrows and eyelashes is far easier. This is the closest colour I can get to match my hair and complexion however I never leave it one for the full length otherwise it turns far to dark. The brush supplies makes it easy to get the shape right.</li>
            <li> its alright -probably need more practice or better directions</li>
            <li> My hair is a pretty light blonde (not platinum) and this looks great on my eyebrows. I was a little worried I would have caterpillar eyebrows but I was wrong. It was a tad bit darker then I am used to, but it really made my eyes pop! Wouldn&#x27;t turn back now. The color lasts a good 1-2 weeks. Love it, such low maintenance....Try the black for your eyelashes!!!</li>
            <li> My sister is an esthetician, and she recommended this kit to dye my blonde brows. She recommended squeezing the dye into the small glass mixing thing, and adding developer and mixing with the white stick thing until its just creamy. A step not covered in the instructions that made a big difference is letting the dye sit for at least a minute to oxidize before applying. As a novice, I thought it was bad that it darkened, turns out that&#x27;s actually good. Now I know! Another tip, apply only where the hair is as the skin may be tinted for a few days after dying (haven&#x27;t really had this problem myself). I leave the dye on longer near my nose, and less time on the ends, usually 5 mins total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the results. It&#x27;s so much faster to get ready. I don&#x27;t need nearly as much brow powder, and my eyes have more definition when I&#x27;m sans-makeup, too. It&#x27;s super easy to do and saves a lot of $ on salon treatments, which are typically $15 minimum. If you have fair brows you want to darken, give it a try! This kit has everything you need.</li>
            <li> but im naturally a light/medium brown. i read reviews where people said this light brown was so dark it was almost back, blah blah blah, but ive got to say, i think i love this. i just JUST dyed my brows and the color is perfect. i feel like i could enjoy the beach and things more because im less worried about having NO eyebrows. i left it on for 7 minutes and i cleaned up with a cotton swab instead of just letting color sit on my skin and risk dying it. the only reason i havent rated this 5 stars is because as of right now i dont know how long the color will last. i also received everything pictured, and it was a GLASS mixing cup, so thats awesome. o i also feel like this will totes last a long time because you only need a little color and a couple drops of solution.</li>
            <li> A little darker than I expected but a very handy little kit.  Long lasting</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any luck with any of the Refectocil products.  By the way, you have to purchase an additional product to make the color take.</li>
            <li> Buying this all together in this set I had the developer, the dye and a nice sized little container to mix this in.  I left it on my eyebrows for 7 minutes (between the 5 and 10 minutes suggested in the directions).  I could go with 5 minutes next time and probably get to a little lighter brown.  The great part is that it totally covered the gray eyebrow hairs.  And after several weeks they have stayed brown.  I&#x27;d be careful with this when doing your own eyebrows to keep it out of your eyes.  But the paste you mix (developer/dye) isn&#x27;t runny so I had no issues.  I&#x27;m pretty pleased that I don&#x27;t need to darken my eyebrows with powder every day.  They look great.  And much less than the salon (where the grays came uncovered in a week).</li>
            <li> Great kit. Lasts me a year doing my brows every 3 weeks. Very easy to do. Covers grey. Brst stuff I have found and I&#x27;ve tried them all. This really is more of a dark brown for me, however, even though it&#x27;s says its light brown. I would say to err on the side of ordering lighter than you think. You can also mix 2 colors to customize.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use. Mix to toothpaste consistancy,brush on, wipe off, done! I wiped it off after just a minute to make sure I didn&#x27;t go to dark, ended up doing again for another minute. Great product will buy again after this one runs out although it will be a while.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works great and the kit is awesome!  I needed everything the kit came with so the fat that I could buy it all together was awesome.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! I love the way it looks on my eyebrows</li>
            <li> Fantastic product... I&#x27;m a redhead so I need my brows dyed from time to time. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands that worked but faded within 2-3 days. This works and it lasts for a good 3 weeks or so</li>
            <li> I received the product but the glass mixing dish was replaced by &amp;#34;cheesy&amp;#34; plastic one with no expanation.  The glass dish was one of the reasons i bought the kit instead of the items separately.</li>
            <li> Very good tinting quality. This tint is very light.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I dye my light blonde eyebrows every other week and works great. Its very easy to mix the ingredients and apply. I think people can go longer between dying but my face wash fades it really quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this.  I&#x27;m blonde and it&#x27;s not too dark.</li>
            <li> As good as any other product.  Poor coverage on gray hair which makes you keeping applying at least 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> Great product. I am quite blond so I don&#x27;t leave the product on for more than 1 min. My experience is that your eyebrows darkens over 24 hours. Better using less time for the first application and wait one day to make sure your brows don&#x27;t get too dark. To avoid discoloring of your skin around the eyebrow I apply vaseline before applying the hair dye.</li>
            <li> Only giving this product 4 stars because I remember it being darker (and yes, I tried leaving it on the max amount of time). I recently purchased the natural brown, and look forward to its arrival.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy. You need very little to do the job. It lasted almost 3 weeks before fading.</li>
            <li> I thought it amazing, my eyebrows are light and always had to use pencil.&lt;br /&gt;Not anymore !  Thanks</li>
            <li> OMG it made me look like i had double the brows alittle goes a long way and dont leave on to long or youll have somne dark brows !!</li>
            <li> Very good! Arrived very fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy that brush and little cup for mixing are included. The color is great, brows look very natural. I&#x27;m a dark blonde (close to brown), so it&#x27;s a little too light for me, next time I probably would go with just brown. So for me leaving the color even for 15-20 minutes doesn&#x27;t make the color dark. But I think for someone with light blonde hair it would be perfect.  The brush is a little too soft and not the best quality, so I would recommend using another brush. But I am very happy with the price of the kit, and I would not be expecting to have an awesome professional brush in it.  Overall, I am very happy with the quality of the product and I would definitely recommend the brand to everyone.</li>
            <li> works really well and easy to use but product is darker than I expected</li>
            <li> I have blonde eyebrows,  and have gotten them colored at a salon before,  but it never lasted and I hated having to return every couple of weeks. This product darkened them quite nicely. Love that I only have to put on mascara to go out now.  I used it a few days ago and it makes such a difference!  Think it will last a couple of weeks. Will update if it fades too quickly.</li>
            <li> Great color, much better than the godfrey which was too severe and gave me angry brows.  It does darken a little the next day as other reviewers indicated.  Though godfrey is made with henna clay it has a strong odor, this product had almost none.</li>
            <li> I have naturally medium brown hair, but my brows are blonde. I don&#x27;t have the thickest brows, but I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call them thin, so I like to fill them in so I don&#x27;t look brow-less. This stuff is great! I can dye them once a month for about 10 minutes, and for the next month I don&#x27;t have to fill in my brows at all! I will definitely be repurchasing this again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call the color &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s really just a neutral medium brown color. I don&#x27;t have a problem with this, but just as a heads up to those who might be thinking about purchasing. :)</li>
            <li> Not for dark eyebrows. Does nothing.</li>
            <li> Loks identical to the dye they market as eyebrow and lash, but It says right on the tube of dye &amp;#34;This product must not be used for dyeing the eyelashes or eyebrows; to do so may cause blindness.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product does work and is easy to use. Ordering another one, want a bit darker color. I love it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.the best I&#x27;ve tried.comes off skin very well and easy to use.</li>
            <li> so easy to use. great product</li>
            <li> The best product on the market for coloring eyebrows.</li>
            <li> it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
