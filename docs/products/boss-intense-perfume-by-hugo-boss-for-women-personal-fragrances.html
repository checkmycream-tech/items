            <li>though I am a man I have been using intense for over 8 years.</li>
            <li>THIS PERFUME IS MORE LIKE BODY SPRAY, IS REALLY INTENSE WHEN YOU FIRST PUT IT ON, BUT AFTER LITTLE WHILE</li>
            <li>A deep undercurrent bold smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I bought this product  because I wanted to try a new brand</li>
            <li>I will continue to reorder every time I need a new bottle.  </li>
            <li>but, without the heavy scent of a true musk.  </li>

            <li> I love this scent! I can&#x27;t find it in stores anywhere. Amazon has comparatively good prices for this product. Great scent for everyday use--not super strong or too flowery. A deep undercurrent bold smell that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Bought for my girlfriend for Christmas.She loves it and was almost out of her current bottle so got it for her.Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase. The product is exactly as advertised, fairly priced, and quickly shipped. I had no problems with this order. Would buy form this seller again.</li>

            <li> Excelente producto!! Original 100%!!!Puntualidad 100%. La entrega fue en el tiempo establecido! Lo recomiendo ampliamente... Gracias...espero volver a comprarles pronto!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t taken it out or used it because I just started mine, this is just for a backup. The packing of the product looks like it&#x27;s authentic and made in UK I believe.</li>
            <li> I could not find it in stores, awesome price for an awesome product!</li>
            <li> best perfume ever please keep it in stock</li>
            <li> Perfect. Thanks amazon</li>
            <li> lo recomeindo ampliamente, pueden comprar con confianza, el articulo fue el esperado o solicitado, la compra se efectuo sin problemas, el articulo llego en el tiempo estimado, sin contratiempos.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different fragrances over time, but this is THE ONE! I always get compliments on it as it works with my chemistry. It is indeed my signature fragrance from now on.</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME IS MORE LIKE BODY SPRAY, IS REALLY INTENSE WHEN YOU FIRST PUT IT ON, BUT AFTER LITTLE WHILE AND I MEAN LIKE 15 MINUTES OR SO, IS GONE. THE SMELL IS NOT THAT GREAT EITHER, IT&#x27;S OK. I THINK THE THIS TIPE OF HUGO BOSS IS MORE IKE FOR WOMEN BETWEEN 35-50, IS JUST WHAT I THINK.</li>
            <li> Discovered this scent years ago and stuck with it.  I&#x27;ve had numerous positive comments from both mean &amp; women over the years.  It&#x27;s not often that a man will tell a married chick that he likes the way she smells!  To my &amp;#34;nose,&amp;#34; the fragrance has a slight vanilla undertone with a suggestion of musk....but, without the heavy scent of a true musk.  Amazon has the best &amp;#34;all in&amp;#34; price (price +delivery) that I&#x27;ve found!</li>
            <li> I love the smell.my husband love the smell ofb this perfume. I will be purchase many more bottles. Soon.all my friends like it.will make great gifts for Christmas. Birthday s.nice vBulletin color for the bottle</li>
            <li> Boss Intense has a great smell and I will buy it again, I just wish that the smell would last a little longer.  And I was glad that Amazon shipped my product on time.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this anymore.  It is my favorite scent.  I will continue to reorder every time I need a new bottle.  Everyone should try this fragrance</li>
            <li> I am heart broken that this is no longer in production. I so desperately wish they would start making this again so the price would go back down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I am a man I have been using intense for over 8 years. I originally got it for my lady but I ended up using it myself.&lt;br /&gt;It makes me feel relaxed and comfortable when I smell it. I always used it when I went on vacation so I have a lot of great memories tied into this smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the smell lasts over 5 hours for me but everyone is different because it reacts to peoples skin differently. However if you can find a bottle and you are wondering if you should try it please do. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Esta colonia es demasiado buena, solo que, este tamaño es pequeño, recomiendo comprar la de mayor tamaño para que rinda.</li>
            <li> The product does not smell like the original.  Packaged the same, but clearly not the same product.</li>
            <li> i love this perfume. i have been wearing it for about 8 years now. its very sexy smelling. not floral at all. im very picky about fragrance due to allergies and this one is just perfect.</li>
            <li> my wife loves it shame it&#x27;s not in production any more, i think it&#x27; been replaced with a couple of other hugo boss but nothing as good</li>
            <li> I would like to purchase this product but I can&#x27;t because the \\&quot;product description\\&quot; does not match the \\&quot;product features\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Description says that it&#x27;s a different perfume all together....Please fix this so I can purchase this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, I couldn&#x27;t find the contact seller option. So, I had to leave a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll add this to my cart and check back later. Thanks! :)</li>
