            <li>I love them!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>it is a nice cotton it fits a bit funky on my head rest but the quality of softness on the face is what matters.</li>
            <li>These are nice -</li>
            <li>These are very well made and work perfectly with the Fleece Face Rest Pad.  </li>
            <li>I love that you can use them over and over again verses the disposable ones.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>These face covers are ok</li>
            <li>They also fit memory foam face cradle!</li>
            <li>Comfortable!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;to be able to breathe.</li>
            <li>These are soft and wash up great.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy</li>
            <li>They are a huge improvement over using folded pillow cases.</li>
            <li>Earthlite face rests and they fit well on both, even with a fleece cover underneath.</li>
            <li>I have a fleece cradle cover over my face cradle, and these covers fit well over the cover.</li>
            <li>This is the second batch I have purchased, and I am extremely happy with them.  </li>
            <li>Just....hole filled...</li>
            <li>This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased Flannel face rest covers, they&#x27;ve been great each time.</li>
            <li>They fit my headrest nicely, are comfortable and soft, and can throw them in the washing machine.</li>
            <li>You need to make sure that the seams are on the outer and inner lining of the headrest and that it is smoothened out nicely, otherwise the customer ends up with a line on his/her face after the treatment...</li>
            <li>They make massage much simpler &amp; more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I really like the softness and the oversize fitting.</li>
            <li>the positive side, it does still fit my Oakworks face cradle.</li>
            <li>They fit my face cradles very well.</li>
            <li>They are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; clean, they stay soft as well.</li>
            <li>I purchased the first ones more than a year ago, and they are still like new.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to hear from clients that they love having a real cover on the face rest as opposed to either disposable covers or towels/pillow cases that other therapists use.  </li>
            <li>(at least I think) will most likely buy some more when I graduate and start up my own clientele.</li>
            <li>The title says it, they are a good reusable cover, a little thin but otherwise a very good, quality purchase.</li>
            <li>The natural fiber is comfortable and washes well.</li>
            <li>They are soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have a fleece covering that I put on first, then this goes over it.</li>
            <li>They fit my head rest great, not to tight or loose.</li>
            <li>I was using paper towels or pillow cases before but these face covers are much easier, also works for massage chairs</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>cheap enough....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>After being dried,they seem to fit well enough for my clients</li>
            <li>They are very convenient and are washing up well.  </li>
            <li>ONE TIME didn&#x27;t even use them yet and there is already a whole in the main front seem just from washing it one time....</li>
            <li>It came in super fast and I used them the next day in my massage class.</li>
            <li>Soft and sturdy, exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
            <li>they are really fuzzy and soft though!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for these face cradles...</li>
            <li>I gave them four stars instead of five because the stitching could be a little better.</li>
            <li>After many heavy duty launderings they are holding up well.</li>
            <li>I have washed and dried these many times</li>
            <li>They wash and dry beautifully, fit the face cradle completely even with a fleece cover underneath, and,</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re big enough to fit over my fleece pad</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other covers that seem to get a little rough after many washes, but these ones stay nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Not sure how OCD you want to get about snug fit and face lines, but my massage therapy clients are happy with the results as am I. By the way, one idea to help that problem is starting a client prone to give their face time to relax during the second part of their session and less likely to have lines or flushed skin.</li>
            <li>soft and natural.</li>
            <li>even though they slightly pill, it&#x27;s the soft, fluffy kind that is oh so comfy.</li>
            <li>They are not too small or cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I purchased the 3 pack of flannel face cradle covers recently and while the material is very soft, I did notice</li>
            <li>They are soft, pilled up a bit after the first few washings hope that does not continue.</li>
            <li>The covers seem to stay soft for a long time too.</li>

            <li> It came in super fast and I used them the next day in my massage class. I love that you can use them over and over again verses the disposable ones. Good price for the quantity! (at least I think) will most likely buy some more when I graduate and start up my own clientele.</li>
            <li> it is a nice cotton it fits a bit funky on my head rest but the quality of softness on the face is what matters.</li>
            <li> I love these. They are a huge improvement over using folded pillow cases. I&#x27;ve been using them on both Masters and  Earthlite face rests and they fit well on both, even with a fleece cover underneath. After many heavy duty launderings they are holding up well. No makeup or oil stains yet.  I gave them four stars instead of five because the stitching could be a little better. I&#x27;ve had to mend a couple of them where the stitching came loose. This only took a few minutes, and overall the quality is reasonable for the price. I definitely recommend these covers.</li>
            <li> I have a fleece cradle cover over my face cradle, and these covers fit well over the cover. They are not too small or cheaply made. I like them. The natural fiber is comfortable and washes well. Not sure how OCD you want to get about snug fit and face lines, but my massage therapy clients are happy with the results as am I. By the way, one idea to help that problem is starting a client prone to give their face time to relax during the second part of their session and less likely to have lines or flushed skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my massage therapist -she said the seams dig into her clients face. It&#x27;s too bad because it was very very soft.</li>
            <li> Good quality at a good price.  They fit my headrest nicely, are comfortable and soft, and can throw them in the washing machine.</li>
            <li> I ordered five of these face cradle covers, one in each color, back in July.  Since then I&#x27;ve been using them very frequently; each cover gets used and washed at least twice a week.  I love them!  They fit my face cradle perfectly.  They&#x27;re big enough to fit over my fleece pad and I can still get the seams adjusted so they don&#x27;t leave lines on my clients faces.  Even with the constant washing and drying, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything going wrong with the fabric or the construction.  It&#x27;s also nice to hear from clients that they love having a real cover on the face rest as opposed to either disposable covers or towels/pillow cases that other therapists use.  I&#x27;m ordering more!</li>
            <li> I bought these from this company a year ago or so and am so happy I am getting 24 more! They are the nicest and longest lasting face rest covers I have found! Thank you for good quality!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my massage practice. They fit my face cradles very well. Some previous reviews stated they weren&#x27;t sewn well. I haven&#x27;t found this to be the case. They are soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> These face covers are ok but I am not sure I would purchase them again. I was looking for a cover that would go over my face cradle which has a fleece cover on it. This cover does not go over it well.</li>
            <li> I was using paper towels or pillow cases before but these face covers are much easier, also works for massage chairs</li>
            <li> I am hoping after repeated washing the strange odor will go away. They are soft, pilled up a bit after the first few washings hope that does not continue.</li>
            <li> Work well. The cream color has a dirty look even though it is clean. You can probably mask the cosmetic issue with room lighting. They also fit memory foam face cradle!</li>
            <li> Good material and they&#x27;re big enough to cover the face cradle with the sheep skin cover on it. The covers seem to stay soft for a long time too. I&#x27;ve had other covers that seem to get a little rough after many washes, but these ones stay nice and soft.</li>
            <li> These are nice - I have a fleece covering that I put on first, then this goes over it. Its oversized and it works well.  I have bought others in the past that leave a really bad face ring bc they are too small.  This one is much bigger and leaves little face wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Works great! Comfortable!</li>
            <li> This is the second batch I have purchased, and I am extremely happy with them.  I purchased the first ones more than a year ago, and they are still like new.  I have an oversized memory foam face rest, so it was difficult finding a reusable cover for it until I found these.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> These are soft and wash up great. They fit my head rest great, not to tight or loose. Goes on easy</li>
            <li> I did not like these face covers. They don&#x27;t fit well to the face cradle and are really thin and seem cheep.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these face cradles...they seemed to be simple enough..cheap enough....I ordered four and threw them in a regular cycle wash...ONE TIME didn&#x27;t even use them yet and there is already a whole in the main front seem just from washing it one time....that&#x27;s not a good sign....probably wont buy them ever again unfortunately... :( they are really fuzzy and soft though! Just....hole filled...</li>
            <li> These are the best face cradle covers I&#x27;ve used in my 14 year career.

            <li> I purchased the 3 pack of flannel face cradle covers recently and while the material is very soft, I did notice&lt;br /&gt;that one of the covers is already torn after one washing. After being dried,they seem to fit well enough for my clients&lt;br /&gt;to be able to breathe. Overall I would say that this product was just \\&quot;ok\\&quot; because it did shrink a bit.&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, it does still fit my Oakworks face cradle.</li>
            <li> The title says it, they are a good reusable cover, a little thin but otherwise a very good, quality purchase.</li>
            <li> I am a physical therapist assistant and massage therapist and was looking for face rest covers for our massage chair at work.  I am very pleased with these covers.  I ordered three different colors (white, beige, blue).  They all seem of the same quality.  They are very convenient and are washing up well.  I would not hesitate to order these covers.  They are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> soft and natural. You need to make sure that the seams are on the outer and inner lining of the headrest and that it is smoothened out nicely, otherwise the customer ends up with a line on his/her face after the treatment...</li>
            <li> I have a memory foam head cradle and they are a little small for it, but manageable, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this product as all face cradles are not exactly the same size.  Now, I&#x27;m very glad I did.  These are very well made and work perfectly with the Fleece Face Rest Pad.  I love them!</li>
            <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased Flannel face rest covers, they&#x27;ve been great each time. Easy to use &amp; clean, they stay soft as well.</li>
            <li> I love these! They make massage much simpler &amp; more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Soft and sturdy, exactly what I wanted and needed.</li>
