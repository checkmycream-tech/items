    <ol>
            <li>this shaver and the blades are the best i have ever...</li>
            <li>I bought this razor because it fits the Gillette Sensor 3 blades which are the best you can get.  </li>
            <li>This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Great razor for the price.</li>
            <li>But does good on the face.  </li>
            <li>This razor is good buy</li>
            <li>As advertised - good quality - have been using these for many years.</li>
            <li>I liked the price.</li>
            <li>Great razor for the Price much more easy to handle then the Gillette Sensor &amp; A better handle &amp; shave!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as smooth as others I have tried, for the money,again it is a good value.</li>
            <li>But use a Sensor razor handle with the blade instead of a Personna Tri-flexxx  Handle,because the pivot is a LOT better.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re surprisingly top notch.</li>
            <li>and I was more than satisfied and good price the pictures are deceiving as there aren&#x27;t  two  extra boxes of blades</li>
            <li>They give a good shave, not quite as good as the Excels, but good enough especially for the price!</li>
            <li>It takes a lot of repeat strokes to cut the hairs off but it is smooth and doesn&#x27;t pull or cut.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable any way it&#x27;s held.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>A three blades razor is plenty good for my soft beard and the blades</li>
            <li>Just what i needed...well made and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it two stars is because the Sensor 3 is so much better</li>
            <li>First, it was pictured as a handle and 2 boxes of cartridges.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to spend the money and get a real Gillette Sensor</li>
            <li>These razors perform very well.</li>
            <li>Am pleased with the 10 days that I have so far completed and we shall see how long the comfort lasts.</li>
            <li>At first they seemed to pull at my beard around the upper lip and chin too much.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted a new handle to replace my old Sensor handle which is now rusty and encrusted.  </li>
            <li>and i am 70 yrs old.....</li>
            <li>It is a solid shave at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s neither too light nor too heavy.</li>
            <li>I had been using Gillette Mach 3 blades which are quite good but expensive.</li>
            <li>I would rate the shaves so far as excellent, now just waiting to evaluate the life expectancy which is the other half of the ratings game.  </li>
            <li>The Personna is one of the few if not the only brand that will take the OLD BRAND cheap Tri-Flexxx Triple Blades.</li>

            <li> The Personna is one of the few if not the only brand that will take the OLD BRAND cheap Tri-Flexxx Triple Blades.</li>
            <li> but at least they are super sharp blades and last a very long time.</li>
            <li> and it lasts so long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Tri-flexxx blades for about a month and their performance matches the Mach 3 for half the price, and they seem to be lasting just as long!</li>
            <li> It gives a rough shave(hard on the skin) and the blades have a tendency to pop out of the handle.</li>
            <li> Personna blades are actually decent compared to most blades which are really awful.  </li>
            <li> The Persona blades start sharp and stay that way, sometimes for months.</li>
            <li> It is a very crude fit to the Personna and Sensor 3 cartridges so it is hard to attach a new cartridge</li>
            <li> cost a lot less than the name brand blades.</li>
            <li> The new Sensor handles are extremely expensive now because there are so few still on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li> what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Easily the worst razor I have used.</li>
            <li> The blades are closer together then say a Mach 3, so it clogs easier and faster when shaving my head, and the blades are not secured well at all, tap it on the sink or flick it really hard in the shower and the blades come off.  </li>
            <li> i mean ever shaved with........</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Worse than using a bic disposable.  </li>
            <li> This with its frill blades is affordable and works as well as the expensive name brands</li>
            <li> Personna handle is terrible.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> this shaver and the blades are the best i have ever...i mean ever shaved with........and i am 70 yrs old.....</li>
            <li> As advertised - good quality - have been using these for many years.</li>
            <li> Just what i needed...well made and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> It shave alright but it won&#x27;t hold up to tapping on the sink to remove hair from your face. Not good.</li>
            <li> It depends on what you are using the razor for.  I keep my head shaved, not the razor to use on your head.  But does good on the face.  The blades are closer together then say a Mach 3, so it clogs easier and faster when shaving my head, and the blades are not secured well at all, tap it on the sink or flick it really hard in the shower and the blades come off.  Basically, I&#x27;m using it to prolong my Mach 3 blades for head shaving by using the tri-flexxx only for my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because it fits the Gillette Sensor 3 blades which are the best you can get.  I really wanted a new handle to replace my old Sensor handle which is now rusty and encrusted.  The new Sensor handles are extremely expensive now because there are so few still on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Personna handle is terrible.  It is a very crude fit to the Personna and Sensor 3 cartridges so it is hard to attach a new cartridge and it doesn&#x27;t pivot well at all.  The handle is almost unusable and would be a one star by itself.  I&#x27;ll have to spend the money and get a real Gillette Sensor handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Personna blades are actually decent compared to most blades which are really awful.  It takes a lot of repeat strokes to cut the hairs off but it is smooth and doesn&#x27;t pull or cut.  The only reason I give it two stars is because the Sensor 3 is so much better and it lasts so long.</li>
            <li> I found the blade to be satisfactory. But use a Sensor razor handle with the blade instead of a Personna Tri-flexxx  Handle,because the pivot is a LOT better.</li>
            <li> Take that you money grabbing gold digging name brands. This with its frill blades is affordable and works as well as the expensive name brands</li>
            <li> Worse than using a bic disposable.  Easily the worst razor I have used.</li>
            <li> Bought these to replace the Gillette Sensor Excels I&#x27;ve been using for years.  At first they seemed to pull at my beard around the upper lip and chin too much.  After a week of using them it seems my skin has adjusted and no longer have that feeling.  They give a good shave, not quite as good as the Excels, but good enough especially for the price!</li>
            <li> It is a solid shave at a reasonable price. It isn&#x27;t as smooth as others I have tried, for the money,again it is a good value.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  I would rate the shaves so far as excellent, now just waiting to evaluate the life expectancy which is the other half of the ratings game.  Am pleased with the 10 days that I have so far completed and we shall see how long the comfort lasts.</li>
            <li> I keep getting cut with these blades. Once im out its back to gillette.</li>
            <li> got screwed on this one, all you get is the razor body and two individual razors, not two packages of razors as pictured. what a waste of money. but at least they are super sharp blades and last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. It is comfortable any way it&#x27;s held. It&#x27;s neither too light nor too heavy. The Persona blades start sharp and stay that way, sometimes for months. No, that&#x27;s not an exaggeration.</li>
            <li> First, it was pictured as a handle and 2 boxes of cartridges. What came was a handle with 2 cartridges. After using it, I would not recommend it. It gives a rough shave(hard on the skin) and the blades have a tendency to pop out of the handle. Back to Gillette for me.</li>
            <li> The Personna is one of the few if not the only brand that will take the OLD BRAND cheap Tri-Flexxx Triple Blades.</li>
            <li> Great razor for the price. comes with 2 removable blades.</li>
            <li> I liked the price. I use the  Personna Tri-Flexxx Triple Blades with it. A three blades razor is plenty good for my soft beard and the blades cost a lot less than the name brand blades.</li>
            <li> This razor is good buy and I was more than satisfied and good price the pictures are deceiving as there aren&#x27;t  two  extra boxes of blades</li>
            <li> Great razor for the Price much more easy to handle then the Gillette Sensor &amp; A better handle &amp; shave!</li>
            <li> These razors perform very well. I had been using Gillette Mach 3 blades which are quite good but expensive. I&#x27;ve been using the Tri-flexxx blades for about a month and their performance matches the Mach 3 for half the price, and they seem to be lasting just as long! No nicks or cuts. They&#x27;re surprisingly top notch.</li>
