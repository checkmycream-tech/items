            <li> Excellent product and I received this very fast and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair manageable and to greasy</li>
            <li> I love it but it has mineral oil in it. I use it on my edges to smooth them down.</li>
            <li> I would really love this without the use of petroleum, which makes my curls clump together and pouffy. If it were creamier, it would be perfect. It smells wonderful, but I can only use it as a before shampoo conditioner.</li>

            <li> Nice smell; very lightweight; I have thin hair and my hair really absorbs this product without being weighed down. I use coconut oil on my hair, so I thought I&#x27;d try this product. Great for the scalp.</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> SUPER HYDRATED HAIR, soft with a pleasant smell of coconut.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for people with dry hair.</li>
            <li> Review submitted in Feb. 2013.  My wife and granddaughters liked this product and were very pleased that this product was purchased for them.</li>
            <li> This product is just so, so. It doesn&#x27;t really do much of anything.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely hard to find in any store I&#x27;ve searched in. I&#x27;ve only been able to locate it on Amazon and am so grateful for that! It is a wonderful hair product and my recommendation to anyone who  might be going through the same &amp;#34;SEARCH&amp;#34; dilemma I was going through, stop the madness &amp; just go to AMAZON.COM!.....Thank You!</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the item so I can&#x27;t honestly rate the goods. I got hair dress instead. So I received two of the same items in different sizes.</li>
            <li> This product was not described accurately.  It is a pomade not a conditioner. I just don&#x27;t want anyone to be misled.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for  a friend. she states that she can not use anything but this for her hair.</li>
