            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find this file again.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was more than the file!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Years ago when they first came out they were the best files ever.  </li>
            <li>These files are some of the best around and don&#x27;t lose all of their grit after the first filing.</li>
            <li>so I make sure to take good care of my toes.</li>
            <li>The case keeps product from catching on everything.</li>
            <li>The file seems to be as effective as day one after many uses.</li>
            <li>Both of my daughters were constantly borrowing mine, and they are now very happy to have their own files.</li>
            <li>Finally, finally, I found this wonderful nail file.  </li>
            <li>Its perfectly shaped to file the sides of my toe nails and does that with such ease that I have to give it five stars.</li>
            <li>I had one for many years just like it and lost it.</li>
            <li>I love these diamond deb files.</li>
            <li>I love the 6\\&quot; Diamon Deb Nail Files I bought.</li>
            <li>As like many others, I&#x27;ve used these for 30+ years.</li>
            <li>You could do better with the two for a dollar at the Walgreen&#x27;s checkout.</li>
            <li>This file took care of many nails during that time, and even served as a screwdriver at times.  </li>
            <li>This nail file has a pointed tip which works so much better for cleaning underneath your nails.</li>
            <li>For the price it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this file to anyone who is looking for a product that does an excellent job and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>The file is OK for shaping, but does NOT have a fine side to finish like I thought it would have.  </li>
            <li>I grew up with Revlon&#x27;s stainless steel nail files and loved them.  </li>
            <li>My nails split easily</li>
            <li>Have been using often for over 2 years - it&#x27;s still going strong</li>
            <li>Deb nail files are not as good as my older (made in Korea) ones.</li>
            <li>Others don&#x27;t leave my nails as smooth as this one.</li>
            <li>Files nails smoothly.</li>
            <li>I was heartsick at the loss but imagine my surprise when I found it still available.  </li>
            <li>The file grit is fine and does not irritate the senses and remains in great working condition for a long time.</li>
            <li>This file works very well and has a nice point to clean under fingernails.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to discover that I could purchase new ones online.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without it and was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a true diamond dust nail file for some thirty years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great file and a really nice action.</li>
            <li>I guess this is as good as it gets in the 21st century.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the product and the timely way in which I received same.</li>
            <li>Files are better than most, but are not quite as smooth as I expected.  </li>
            <li>The point is great for cleaning under nails, but is very sharp.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, very long lasting useability.</li>
            <li>All in all, a great little tool...</li>
            <li>I have used this a couple of times so far, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Better than the old stainless steel, a product that files nails quickly and cleanly without worry about hurting the nail.  </li>
            <li>The Diamond Deb nail file is without a doubt worth searching for.</li>
            <li>It files quickly and without requiring too much pressure.</li>
            <li>So bummed that I misplaced the longer of my Diamon Deb nail files, I was pleased to be able to find Diamon Deb on Amazon.</li>
            <li>However, as with most personal care products, there is always newer and \\&quot;better\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This nail file is difficult to find in stores, but is one of the best products in the market.</li>
            <li>love it will not go back to emery boards.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>same brand, same good quality.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it for nail but as a mini flat file , it is not as durable as hardward flat file but the price is good.  </li>
            <li>; These new ones (made overseas) are a tad coarse, could be finer, does an ok job, but needs an emery board to finish.</li>
            <li>I had very ancient ones that desperatly needed replacing.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the file and the very&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks for putting them on line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guitarist and electric bassist and my nails have to be ready.  </li>
            <li>I use the Revlon product and this...  this one travels very well and remains in the gig bag ready to use at a moments notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always liked this nail file but have had trouble finding them.</li>
            <li>I just recently lost my original Diamon Deb that I purchased about 40 years ago.  </li>
            <li>However, they are still better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>my last one was made in the USA, but the quality seems to be there and its certainly a&lt;br /&gt;lot better than my old old one that my son used to file some metal pieces for some project</li>
            <li>I have all three sizes now - the 4\\&quot; for my purse, the 6\\&quot; in the study for quick fixes, and the 8\\&quot; in the bedroom for the regular maintenance.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that could have made it better would have been a larger variety of sizes.</li>
            <li>I have one that is older than that</li>
            <li>and it is still in decent condition.  </li>
            <li>Decent product for the money.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The new (made in China)</li>
            <li>I will certainly order from this source in the future.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t realized just how worn out my old ones were.</li>
            <li>I finally found the one indicated above, but although it performs well enough, it doesn&#x27;t last more than four to five years.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted to replace the one I&#x27;ve had for a long time.....</li>
            <li>The edges on the point are a tiny bit rough, but it files well &amp; can&#x27;t make any significant complaints.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen the real originals in a long time.  </li>
            <li>It was wonderful to find an item I used years ago and had been unable to locate lately.</li>
            <li>The other is much finer -</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;pick\\&quot; end is unique in that it has been narrowly shaped to better \\&quot;fit\\&quot; under the nail to scrape out the grime (sorry!).</li>
            <li>I have noticed that a new file needs to be broken in a bit, but it&#x27;s well worth the break-in period.    </li>

            <li> Ordered a few of these for myself and family. I had very ancient ones that desperatly needed replacing. The replacements are wonderful. I hadn&#x27;t realized just how worn out my old ones were. I was thrilled to discover that I could purchase new ones online.</li>
            <li> I have used this a couple of times so far, and I love it. Never used this brand before. It files quickly and without requiring too much pressure. I hope it lasts!</li>
            <li> Files are better than most, but are not quite as smooth as I expected.  I have been trying to replace Revlon diamond files that I had for years and lost.  These do not have shaping vs. finishing sides.  Both sides are alike.</li>
            <li> I grew up with Revlon&#x27;s stainless steel nail files and loved them.  However, as with most personal care products, there is always newer and \\&quot;better\\&quot;.

            <li> My boyfriend was looking for one of these. Can&#x27;t find in stores. Shipping was more than the file! Great product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a history of ingrown toe nails in my family so I make sure to take good care of my toes. There&#x27;s nothing beautiful about this file, I would actually describe it as plain and ugly (my preference are products that serve the purpose and look nice!) but boy, does it do the job! Its perfectly shaped to file the sides of my toe nails and does that with such ease that I have to give it five stars.</li>
            <li> I started using these in the 80s and still have one, only need to replace because of losing them.</li>
            <li> have used this product in the past - unable to find in local stores - found it online and received order in only a couple of days</li>

            <li> I was very pleased to find this file again.  I was leery when I learned it was made in China&lt;br /&gt;as my last one was made in the USA, but the quality seems to be there and its certainly a&lt;br /&gt;lot better than my old old one that my son used to file some metal pieces for some project&lt;br /&gt;he was doing.  I swear.....this is the last time I&#x27;ll bring that up.  Thanks for the file and the very&lt;br /&gt;fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The file is OK for shaping, but does NOT have a fine side to finish like I thought it would have.  A bit disappointed about that. I wish they would make a two sided file. Revelon made one for years but I can no longer find them.</li>
            <li> This nail file is difficult to find in stores, but is one of the best products in the market. The file grit is fine and does not irritate the senses and remains in great working condition for a long time. I have had one for years and only have to replace it because it is lost.     The \\&quot;pick\\&quot; end is unique in that it has been narrowly shaped to better \\&quot;fit\\&quot; under the nail to scrape out the grime (sorry!).

            <li> The other is much finer - it&#x27;s strange because they don&#x27;t say that there are different grits to be had but you have to file forever to get the one to work. Good product.</li>
            <li> I love the 6\\&quot; Diamon Deb Nail Files I bought. They work flawlessly without mangling your nails! I have brittle nails that split in layers and these files work the best.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this nail file but have had trouble finding them. Thanks for putting them on line. The only thing that could have made it better would have been a larger variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very long lasting useability. Both of my daughters were constantly borrowing mine, and they are now very happy to have their own files.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a true diamond dust nail file for some thirty years.  I have one that is older than that and it is still in decent condition.  I finally found the one indicated above, but although it performs well enough, it doesn&#x27;t last more than four to five years.</li>
            <li> For the price it is pretty good.  I don&#x27;t use it for nail but as a mini flat file , it is not as durable as hardward flat file but the price is good.  I would recommend it if you use it occasionally.</li>
            <li> This is the only nail file I will use. Others don&#x27;t leave my nails as smooth as this one. And now I have to get my daughter one because she won&#x27;t leave mine alone.</li>
            <li> So bummed that I misplaced the longer of my Diamon Deb nail files, I was pleased to be able to find Diamon Deb on Amazon. As like many others, I&#x27;ve used these for 30+ years. That&#x27;s how long they&#x27;ve lasted. I could have sworn the originals were coated with actual diamond dust. These say &amp;#34;crystal surface.&amp;#34; These new ones (made overseas) are a tad coarse, could be finer, does an ok job, but needs an emery board to finish. I&#x27;ll have to look harder for my misplaced Diamon Deb because obviously they&#x27;re not the same anymore. You could do better with the two for a dollar at the Walgreen&#x27;s checkout.</li>
            <li> I bought this avoid buying flimsy disposable nail files from drug stores. It&#x27;s durable and not flimsy. Files nails smoothly. The point is great for cleaning under nails, but is very sharp. The case is very handy to keep the file from snagging. 6&amp;#34; makes it difficult to fit into a zip lock bag for traveling, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Decent product for the money. The edges on the point are a tiny bit rough, but it files well &amp; can&#x27;t make any significant complaints.</li>
            <li> My nails split easily so I am always in need of a file. These files are some of the best around and don&#x27;t lose all of their grit after the first filing. Grit lasts for months.</li>
            <li> I just recently lost my original Diamon Deb that I purchased about 40 years ago.  This file took care of many nails during that time, and even served as a screwdriver at times.  I was heartsick at the loss but imagine my surprise when I found it still available.  I strongly recommend this file to anyone who is looking for a product that does an excellent job and lasts a long time.  Try it!</li>
            <li> This worked great until I lost it, now I need to buy another. The case keeps product from catching on everything.</li>
            <li> So disappointed to see that this file was made in China.  It is not nearly as good as the old U.S.A  made file.  Shame.</li>
            <li> Have been using often for over 2 years - it&#x27;s still going strong</li>
            <li> I need nail files to keep my nails neat trim and protected from harms way.  I&#x27;m a guitarist and electric bassist and my nails have to be ready.  This file does it.  I use the Revlon product and this...  this one travels very well and remains in the gig bag ready to use at a moments notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great file and a really nice action.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted to replace the one I&#x27;ve had for a long time.....same brand, same good quality.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> The new (made in China) Diamond Deb nail files are not as good as my older (made in Korea) ones. The finish is somewhat rougher. However, they are still better than other brands I have tried. I guess this is as good as it gets in the 21st century.</li>
            <li> love it will not go back to emery boards.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the one they pictured, but it works.  The one in the pic has a handle.  The one they sent me just has a sharp point.</li>
            <li> I truly like this nail dresser and use it almost daily. It will probably out last me. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it is made in China.</li>
            <li> This nail file has a pointed tip which works so much better for cleaning underneath your nails.</li>
            <li> This file works very well and has a nice point to clean under fingernails.  Reminds me of one my Grandma always carried with her.  I really like it!</li>
