            <li>Very nice product that exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>The best, most compact nail clippers anywhere.  </li>

            <li>and I was delighted with the gift.</li>
            <li>Good design but</li>
            <li>Works as well as I need them to and the under finger nail scrapper is good too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this 100%  Quality, fit and finish for a great price!</li>
            <li>Tweezerman always has good products.</li>
            <li>The quality is good for the price.</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly on my car keys, never have to go looking for a clipper, good quality, good price, works as it should</li>
            <li>I find it as a good replacement after the guard at the airport tookmy good one from me.</li>
            <li>Good quality, works well.</li>
            <li>and I have been very pleased with the construction quality and size.</li>
            <li>nice travel clippers, and good file.  </li>
            <li>the plus side, they come with a great warranty and free</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Matters of great concern should be treated lightly.</li>
            <li>Fit great in your pocket do not even notice</li>
            <li>Liked it before I received it because I saw one in use by someone else.  </li>
            <li>Liked it&#x27;s compact size.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve used nail clippers that look like this one that are made in France and Germany and liked them, then don&#x27;t buy this one.  </li>
            <li>These will be nice</li>
            <li>Fold up so compactly, so flatly,  nice file, nice clippers.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone looking for this kind of product.</li>
            <li>The Khlip is still superior in terms of ergonomics, fit and finish and sharpness, but it better be for sixty bucks!</li>
            <li>no issues, just  a great super slim nail clipper you can have on you at all times.  </li>
            <li>Now I own several pairs because they are the best nail clipper I have seen.</li>
            <li>They hold an edge and give you a very smooth cut.  </li>
            <li>More importantly it is handy and easy to carry every day.  </li>
            <li>that does a much better job of filing &amp; smoothing.</li>
            <li>This was okay.</li>
            <li>It looks like the two blades are not lined up any more, can&#x27;t understand how this would happen</li>
            <li>so if your paying much more than that, i would pass.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, love these clippers.  </li>
            <li>I would like more lever to it.  </li>
            <li>They fold compact but they are not the most comfortable clippers to hold.</li>
            <li>At the very least, this is a very good product at a great price.</li>
            <li>Easily carried in glove compartment of vehicle, or purse</li>
            <li>I love the way it folds flat, the great nail file and the way it cuts so easy on the toughest nails.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, we&#x27;ll made and sharp, folds well and goes great on a key chain.</li>
            <li>I have tested this new one and it works just as good as the others.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to find this one made by Tweezerman, but it is a bit flimzy.  </li>
            <li>Solid pair of clippers, great for travel.</li>
            <li>They fit in picketvquite well without given detectable bulge.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use the nail file--can&#x27;t stand the sound fo</li>
            <li>They are worth the couple bucks more than the ones you find in the beauty aisles.</li>
            <li>Emery board is aggressive, so great for the big stuff</li>
            <li>i have owned twiezerman bail clipper for longer thatn 20 years, this is either a cheap copy or the quality of the product is diminishing</li>
            <li>my opinion, this is another case where you&#x27;re better off to spend more and buy the real thing.</li>
            <li>Not only do they work really well, but the sleek design is awesome.</li>
            <li>You may need something a little more heavy duty for true pachyderm stuff and you may need a microscopic dainty set for your infants, but for everythig else in between, these are perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the original folding Tweezerman clipper for years until it was confiscated</li>
            <li>Does not have a pointed end to clean the nail.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I was fortunate to get a better tempered spring than another writer did as I&#x27;ve had no failure.</li>
            <li>The nail file/cleaner just flops around, often getting in the way when you&#x27;re trying to clip your nails and the cleaner portion is far too large/thick to effectively get under your nails.</li>
            <li>I have a couple other Tweezerman items that I am happy with.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and file works great.</li>
            <li>sharp, strong and compact,  good file.  </li>
            <li>Though I thought the price was a little high for nail clippers, I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my first one broke, but I loved it, so I bought a second one.</li>
            <li>Anyway for those of you who aren&#x27;t willing to pay that much for a mundane object as this, I honestly think these are the next best, at 1/5 the price.</li>
            <li>The nail file is of a vastly superior &amp;#34;stippled&amp;#34; pattern and is a huge improvement over the typical design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Nice solid manufacture, simple and easy to carry, super sharp blades and lovely after sale policy to sharpen your nail clipper for free, nobody appreciates good products without great warranties, overall the Tweezerman folding nail clipper is a good solid product with minor aesthetical details over which to improve.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they fold flat making them easy to carry in pants pockets.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  I own the Khlip nail clipper (a $60 uber-end nail clipper), and I have to admit, these are almost as sharp and given the formfactor (with the folding file), just as easy to hold and use.  </li>
            <li>worth it for me.</li>
            <li>This nail clipper is extremely good, sharp.  </li>
            <li>, that goes right onto your keychain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I had to turn right around and send them back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looked for this nail clipper at many stores, couldn&#x27;t find it in local retail.  </li>
            <li>I got so used to it, when I lost my first one I had to buy another one immediately.</li>
            <li>Love the way they open and close.</li>
            <li>I abused my first one by stripping wires.</li>
            <li>the metal is more flexible than comapared to the INOX (French brand) clipper</li>
            <li>that one can pay up to 3â€“4x more for the same device with a fancier name stamped on it.</li>
            <li>Easy to cary in your pocket with the low profile folding structure.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item largely because it said it was made in USA.  </li>
            <li>The Seki doesn&#x27;t have the cleaner/nail file and is rather too large to carry around anyway.    </li>
            <li>The biggest problem was the spring action stopped working on the very first use.  </li>
            <li>not sure what they meant in the discription about different stops at different angles as i do not seem to be able make it adjust at all, but it does work great.</li>
            <li>I have owned another French style clipper that worked great for over 20 years till it got misplaced.</li>
            <li>The file works very well.  </li>
            <li>The file is very course.  </li>
            <li>B000F35R00 Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper]] and finding out that that the Seki just wouldn&#x27;t work for me as a carry around clipper.  </li>
            <li>Clipping the nails is a real challenge, at times, with this clipper.</li>
            <li>I really like these and don&#x27;t have the a problem with the file.</li>
            <li>Because it is so straight</li>
            <li>I also received it very promptly, two days after my order.</li>
            <li>Finally bought, just to satisfy free shipping deal from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Well made plus a small ring to attached to keys is  quite handy...</li>
            <li>bottom up versus top down.</li>
            <li>so the Tweezerman model isn&#x27;t able to cut half the time; fully depressed and nothing has happened for example.</li>
            <li>B0000532A5 Revlon Classic Nail Clip - 1 ea]].</li>
            <li>Opening is wide, strong spring</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clearly, it makes no sense to spend half a bill on henckel toenail clippers for goodness&#x27; sake, but you can do better than the dollar store throwaways and get a pair of snips which are sharp, well made, cleverly designed, and easily handled.</li>
            <li>; high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>If they were sharper and a little more sturdy made (heavier metal) I would buy them again.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of getting used to the different &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of these clippers compared to the standard ones, but these are much sharper and more accurate than the typical ones I find at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>but I still use normal clippers at home.</li>
            <li>Sharp clippers and small flat design when folded up is perfect.</li>
            <li>my favorite part is the sharpness of this clipper - it cuts your nails quickly and sharp, not like some other clippers that have tendency to make a mess due to dullness - these are sharp and awesome.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lever is held down by the file, and the file does not come up as easily as you might think.  </li>
            <li>I have a feeling I would be looking for a new one soon.</li>
            <li>These clippers live in my purse.  </li>
            <li>However, prior versions made in Europe were of higher quality.</li>
            <li>I have to do many small clips to get the correct curve.</li>
            <li>This is my second pair since my wife to the first one.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the screw driver edge for anything other than to clean underneath my nails..</li>
            <li>Overall I really like these anyway for travel</li>
            <li>This is super small and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, these folding nail clippers are compact, maintain their edge and cleanly cut my nails with little effort.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much leverage and the clipper goes to the completely flat, fold-up position when clipping the nails.  </li>
            <li>It feels like it would be better put to work filing down the bars of my jail cell.</li>
            <li>Far, far better than the poorly cast, barely chromed junk that I&#x27;ve been saddled with up to now.</li>
            <li>a sharp the first couple of times you use them</li>
            <li>/&gt;They collapse into a 2.25\\&quot;x0.5\\&quot;x0.125\\&quot; space with no sharp edges to snag on the purse lining or cut me when I go digging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel the cutting ability is satisfactory and the quality is good.  </li>
            <li>However, it did not do a good job cutting the nails.</li>
            <li>the nails\\&quot; scrapper has the wrong angle to be effective.  </li>
            <li>It cuts nails, but you have to use more force than I expected; at least on my nails.  </li>

            <li> So I had to turn right around and send them back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looked for this nail clipper at many stores, couldn&#x27;t find it in local retail.  </li>
            <li> I got so used to it, when I lost my first one I had to buy another one immediately.</li>
            <li> Love the way they open and close.</li>
            <li> I abused my first one by stripping wires.</li>
            <li> the metal is more flexible than comapared to the INOX (French brand) clipper</li>
            <li> that one can pay up to 3â€“4x more for the same device with a fancier name stamped on it.</li>
            <li> Easy to cary in your pocket with the low profile folding structure.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item largely because it said it was made in USA.  </li>
            <li> The Seki doesn&#x27;t have the cleaner/nail file and is rather too large to carry around anyway.    </li>
            <li> The biggest problem was the spring action stopped working on the very first use.  </li>
            <li> not sure what they meant in the discription about different stops at different angles as i do not seem to be able make it adjust at all, but it does work great.</li>
            <li> I have owned another French style clipper that worked great for over 20 years till it got misplaced.</li>
            <li> The file works very well.  </li>
            <li> The file is very course.  </li>
            <li> B000F35R00 Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper]] and finding out that that the Seki just wouldn&#x27;t work for me as a carry around clipper.  </li>
            <li> Clipping the nails is a real challenge, at times, with this clipper.</li>
            <li> I really like these and don&#x27;t have the a problem with the file.</li>
            <li> Because it is so straight</li>
            <li> I also received it very promptly, two days after my order.</li>
            <li> Finally bought, just to satisfy free shipping deal from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Well made plus a small ring to attached to keys is  quite handy...</li>
            <li> bottom up versus top down.</li>
            <li> so the Tweezerman model isn&#x27;t able to cut half the time; fully depressed and nothing has happened for example.</li>
            <li> B0000532A5 Revlon Classic Nail Clip - 1 ea]].</li>
            <li> Opening is wide, strong spring</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clearly, it makes no sense to spend half a bill on henckel toenail clippers for goodness&#x27; sake, but you can do better than the dollar store throwaways and get a pair of snips which are sharp, well made, cleverly designed, and easily handled.</li>
            <li> ; high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If they were sharper and a little more sturdy made (heavier metal) I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of getting used to the different &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of these clippers compared to the standard ones, but these are much sharper and more accurate than the typical ones I find at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> but I still use normal clippers at home.</li>
            <li> Sharp clippers and small flat design when folded up is perfect.</li>
            <li> my favorite part is the sharpness of this clipper - it cuts your nails quickly and sharp, not like some other clippers that have tendency to make a mess due to dullness - these are sharp and awesome.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lever is held down by the file, and the file does not come up as easily as you might think.  </li>
            <li> I have a feeling I would be looking for a new one soon.</li>
            <li> These clippers live in my purse.  </li>
            <li> However, prior versions made in Europe were of higher quality.</li>
            <li> I have to do many small clips to get the correct curve.</li>
            <li> This is my second pair since my wife to the first one.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the screw driver edge for anything other than to clean underneath my nails..</li>
            <li> Overall I really like these anyway for travel</li>
            <li> This is super small and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, these folding nail clippers are compact, maintain their edge and cleanly cut my nails with little effort.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much leverage and the clipper goes to the completely flat, fold-up position when clipping the nails.  </li>
            <li> It feels like it would be better put to work filing down the bars of my jail cell.</li>
            <li> Far, far better than the poorly cast, barely chromed junk that I&#x27;ve been saddled with up to now.</li>
            <li> a sharp the first couple of times you use them</li>
            <li> /&gt;They collapse into a 2.25\\&quot;x0.5\\&quot;x0.125\\&quot; space with no sharp edges to snag on the purse lining or cut me when I go digging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel the cutting ability is satisfactory and the quality is good.  </li>
            <li> However, it did not do a good job cutting the nails.</li>
            <li> the nails\\&quot; scrapper has the wrong angle to be effective.  </li>
            <li> It cuts nails, but you have to use more force than I expected; at least on my nails.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and is very sharp!</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman folding clipper is the right size and has the cleaner and nail file, but it&#x27;s a clumsy affair.  </li>
            <li> no key ring, but very sharp and so far seem durable.</li>
            <li> As an older man that often works in dirty, rough conditions, I need a nail clipper that easily fits in my pocket, operates quickly and easily, especially for broken or torn nails and has a nail file and cleaner.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that I feel like the cutting edge should be curved more.</li>
            <li> I hated it and was actually happy when I lost it one day.</li>
            <li> I find that turning the clippers over helps me better orient the clippers and cutting position.</li>
            <li> I had owned a clipper that closed similarly to this one for years.  </li>
            <li> I had the Henckel folding nail nipper for a long time before it \\&quot;ran away with the spoon\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> No loud clicking.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like long nails that trap grime.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for what I expected to be an identical Tweezerman clipper that I&#x27;ve carried around for several years but fell out of my pocket.  </li>
            <li> Sadly the newer versions are not as well made as the original and are not made in Germany</li>
            <li> I had hoped for above average build and material quality.</li>
            <li> After a half a dozen uses the clipper stopped working and will only just pinch the nail.</li>
            <li> Left them rough and with sharp edges that had to be filed down.</li>
            <li> It clips nails neatly and the nail file smooths rough edges.</li>
            <li> There is a key ring for key chains and it is about as thick as two keys put together.</li>
            <li> sharp.</li>
            <li> there is a hook on the other side of the file that isn&#x27;t depicted in the product snap shot</li>
            <li> Good concept, but poor, poor, poor design/implementation.</li>
            <li> this is a very compact nail clipper, those with larger hands may find it awkward to handle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very sharp (be very careful when collapsing) and retain their edge (sharp 4 years now).  </li>
            <li> Though construction of Tweezerman is \\&quot;busier\\&quot; than Henckel&#x27;s, I found no reason to think the engineering of it had any less integrity than the other.</li>
            <li> In summary, I&#x27;m sorry that I got the Tweezerman clipper and don&#x27;t see any reason not to stay with the MUCH CHEAPER and easier to use [</li>
            <li> The three stars are an indication of the build quality being average.</li>
            <li> The blades on this thing is sharp!  </li>
            <li> The only negative I can even think of is that the little black sheath does NOT stay on the clippers if you keep them on a keyring - as I do.  </li>
            <li> Only bad thing is my toddler wants to play with them all the time.</li>
            <li> This one cuts my nails with less effort too.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my first impression was that the clippers were awkward to hold.  </li>
            <li> that loose floppy thing that contains the file is constantly in the way making it nearly impossible to control the clipper  and there is no way of holding the clipper where it is not in the way, I think you should stick to tweezers only as this thing&#x27;s a mess, cumbersome and aggravating to use.</li>
            <li> However, American-MADE usually involves foreign parts anymore--</li>
            <li> There is even a little ring on the end with which to hang off one&#x27;s keychain.  </li>
            <li> the grub digger outer deal at the tip of the file could be a little pointier</li>
            <li> Just takes a little getting used to, since you use the lever clips upward instead of downward.</li>
            <li> Fits snuggly in the little pouch it comes in.</li>
            <li> The fit and finish are terrible compared to the earlier version, with flimsy construction.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Have to press it all the way tight closed to create enough force for cutting.  </li>
            <li> I do like the added ring attachment(absent from the other)at the rear hinge which allows a small chain or hook of some sort to link it to whatever the user would want to help prevent loss.</li>
            <li> Matters of small concern should be treated</li>
            <li> the clipper cutting action works well however</li>
            <li> On the negative, the file/cleaner end does make itself a nuisance like the other, but I don&#x27;t find it a serious flaw.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using past tense.  </li>
            <li> the lever that contains the file and also holds the clipper closed is a very poor design when the clipper is opened</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not good for those of us with arthritis......  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I find it slight awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Steel too thin so bends when you try to cut nails.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also difficult to clip hang nails.      </li>
            <li> This also helps to work around the awkwardness of having the file/scraper arm sticking out in an uncomfortable to use position/angle.</li>
            <li> AND it is very thin</li>
            <li> I use it for emergency nail cutting when I&#x27;m away from home and need clippers NOW.  </li>
            <li> Awkward to use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s awkward to use</li>
            <li> Even with all the cutting and collapsing, the edges retain ther alignment</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need to worry about bending rather than cutting a nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;under</li>
            <li> Always disappointing when a company diminish the quality of what, in this case, used to be a well-made product.</li>
            <li> The Henckel&#x27;s file was almost worthless compared to this one as it has a \\&quot;diamond type\\&quot; of raspy material (they don&#x27;t say what)</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed and P.O.ed in being misled!  </li>

            <li> I have used Henckels folding clippers without problem. I purchased one of these for different kit. This model didn&#x27;t have the power to clip through my thumb or finger nails. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had owned a clipper that closed similarly to this one for years.  It finally broke. I search forever trying to replace it. I was fortunate to find this one made by Tweezerman, but it is a bit flimzy.  I have a feeling I would be looking for a new one soon.</li>
            <li> It cuts nails, but you have to use more force than I expected; at least on my nails.  I love the fact that they fold flat making them easy to carry in pants pockets.  The file works very well.  If they were sharper and a little more sturdy made (heavier metal) I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I had the Henckel folding nail nipper for a long time before it \\&quot;ran away with the spoon\\&quot;. The cost for replacement would have been twice that of Tweezerman. This one cuts my nails with less effort too. Maybe I was fortunate to get a better tempered spring than another writer did as I&#x27;ve had no failure. Made in Korea, of course, doesn&#x27;t guarantee metallurgical perfection. Nor from anywhere else. The Henckel&#x27;s file was almost worthless compared to this one as it has a \\&quot;diamond type\\&quot; of raspy material (they don&#x27;t say what) that does a much better job of filing &amp; smoothing. As it should. On the negative, the file/cleaner end does make itself a nuisance like the other, but I don&#x27;t find it a serious flaw. I do like the added ring attachment(absent from the other)at the rear hinge which allows a small chain or hook of some sort to link it to whatever the user would want to help prevent loss. Though construction of Tweezerman is \\&quot;busier\\&quot; than Henckel&#x27;s, I found no reason to think the engineering of it had any less integrity than the other. Of course time will always tell, but I would heartily recommend it to those looking for good quality and durability.</li>
            <li> There seems to be an inordinate amount of nit-picking going on here. The design, with the \\&quot;floppy\\&quot; handle/file, is identical to those European models--costing 3-4 times the price. They&#x27;re ALL engineered for compactness, not for use at the local nail salon! I found no complaints with the performance, either.        The fact that they&#x27;re made in Korea (one of our allies) rather than China is, in my opinion, an asset. I too prefer American-made. However, American-MADE usually involves foreign parts anymore--so, what are you going to do? At the very least, this is a very good product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I bought this item largely because it said it was made in USA.  People can talk about components of some things coming from abroad, but bottom line - it is not made in USA!  It is imported from Asia.  Totally disappointed and P.O.ed in being misled!  It&#x27;s going back to where it came from!</li>
            <li> I have had this clipper for several years now.  I like how compact it is.  I feel the cutting ability is satisfactory and the quality is good.  I don&#x27;t know how it would hold up with constant use, but I don&#x27;t feel it was made for that.  I use it for emergency nail cutting when I&#x27;m away from home and need clippers NOW.  Always been grateful to have them.</li>
            <li> Good concept, but poor, poor, poor design/implementation. Awkward to use. I hated it and was actually happy when I lost it one day.</li>
            <li> Looked for this nail clipper at many stores, couldn&#x27;t find it in local retail.  Liked it before I received it because I saw one in use by someone else.  My son bought one for me on Amazon and I was delighted with the gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the original folding Tweezerman clipper for years until it was confiscated post 9-11.  Sadly the newer versions are not as well made as the original and are not made in Germany anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, these folding nail clippers are compact, maintain their edge and cleanly cut my nails with little effort. There is even a little ring on the end with which to hang off one&#x27;s keychain.  In addition, Tweezerman (a subsidiary of Zwilling Henckels) has an awesome lifetime guarantee and sharpening service on all their implements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that would like to travel by air, Tweezerman&#x27;s parent company has this version, http://www.amazon.com/Pour-Homme-Clipper-Black-Leather/dp/B002A9JPKK/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_bt_1  that does not have the fold-out nail file and is therefore TSA compliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this is a very compact nail clipper, those with larger hands may find it awkward to handle.</li>
            <li> Great clippers with excellent leverage and great cut nail catching.  However, prior versions made in Europe were of higher quality.</li>
            <li> This nail clipper is extremely good, sharp.  I got so used to it, when I lost my first one I had to buy another one immediately.</li>
            <li> Nice solid manufacture, simple and easy to carry, super sharp blades and lovely after sale policy to sharpen your nail clipper for free, nobody appreciates good products without great warranties, overall the Tweezerman folding nail clipper is a good solid product with minor aesthetical details over which to improve.</li>
            <li> Small but supper sharp and the nail filer actually useful! my favorite part is the sharpness of this clipper - it cuts your nails quickly and sharp, not like some other clippers that have tendency to make a mess due to dullness - these are sharp and awesome.</li>
            <li> great finger nail clippers.  Love the way they open and close.</li>
            <li> Liked it&#x27;s compact size. However, it did not do a good job cutting the nails. Left them rough and with sharp edges that had to be filed down.</li>
            <li> The best, most compact nail clippers anywhere.  The only negative I can even think of is that the little black sheath does NOT stay on the clippers if you keep them on a keyring - as I do.  But the sheath is extraneous anyway.  Great clippers for musicians (keyboardists, guitarists, etc.) who need to keep the nails trimmed back.</li>
            <li> sleek. sharp. portable. file is wicked. the grub digger outer deal at the tip of the file could be a little pointier</li>
            <li> The file is very course.  It feels like it would be better put to work filing down the bars of my jail cell.</li>
            <li> I have had this style of nail clipper for over 15 years. This is my third pair. I abused my first one by stripping wires. The name was Inox and I think it said it was made in France. My second one I am still using. I just wanted another on hand incase I damage or lost this one. I have tested this new one and it works just as good as the others. I love the way it folds flat, the great nail file and the way it cuts so easy on the toughest nails. You do have to get used to handling differently than standard clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth it for me. I hope it is for you also.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper after buying the [[ASIN:B000F35R00 Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper]] and finding out that that the Seki just wouldn&#x27;t work for me as a carry around clipper.  As an older man that often works in dirty, rough conditions, I need a nail clipper that easily fits in my pocket, operates quickly and easily, especially for broken or torn nails and has a nail file and cleaner.  The Seki doesn&#x27;t have the cleaner/nail file and is rather too large to carry around anyway.    The Tweezerman folding clipper is the right size and has the cleaner and nail file, but it&#x27;s a clumsy affair.  The nail file/cleaner just flops around, often getting in the way when you&#x27;re trying to clip your nails and the cleaner portion is far too large/thick to effectively get under your nails. Clipping the nails is a real challenge, at times, with this clipper. There isn&#x27;t much leverage and the clipper goes to the completely flat, fold-up position when clipping the nails.  That&#x27;s not good for those of us with arthritis......  It&#x27;s also difficult to clip hang nails.      In summary, I&#x27;m sorry that I got the Tweezerman clipper and don&#x27;t see any reason not to stay with the MUCH CHEAPER and easier to use [[ASIN:B0000532A5 Revlon Classic Nail Clip - 1 ea]].</li>
            <li> Good design but the metal is more flexible than comapared to the INOX (French brand) clipper so the Tweezerman model isn&#x27;t able to cut half the time; fully depressed and nothing has happened for example.</li>
            <li> Works as well as I need them to and the under finger nail scrapper is good too.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used nail clippers that look like this one that are made in France and Germany and liked them, then don&#x27;t buy this one.  It looks like the others but it&#x27;s awkward to use and it won&#x27;t hold an edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the European models for some time.  They hold an edge and give you a very smooth cut.  These will be nice a sharp the first couple of times you use them but they&#x27;re not durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this is another case where you&#x27;re better off to spend more and buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> I really like these and don&#x27;t have the a problem with the file. The only problem I have is that I feel like the cutting edge should be curved more. Because it is so straight I have to do many small clips to get the correct curve. Overall I really like these anyway for travel but I still use normal clippers at home.</li>
            <li> I got a pair because I rock climb and you need trimmed nails. Now I own several pairs because they are the best nail clipper I have seen.</li>
            <li> The blades on this thing is sharp!  No loud clicking.  It cut through my thickest nails like butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lever is held down by the file, and the file does not come up as easily as you might think.  there is a hook on the other side of the file that isn&#x27;t depicted in the product snap shot, that goes right onto your keychain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway no issues, just  a great super slim nail clipper you can have on you at all times.  I haven&#x27;t used the screw driver edge for anything other than to clean underneath my nails..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I own the Khlip nail clipper (a $60 uber-end nail clipper), and I have to admit, these are almost as sharp and given the formfactor (with the folding file), just as easy to hold and use.  The file works like a handle that extends into your palm, so there is no slippage when using these clippers.  The Khlip is still superior in terms of ergonomics, fit and finish and sharpness, but it better be for sixty bucks! lol.  Anyway for those of you who aren&#x27;t willing to pay that much for a mundane object as this, I honestly think these are the next best, at 1/5 the price.</li>
            <li> Great clippers.  Well made, and don&#x27;t rust in salt water.</li>
            <li> Replaced my lost one, excellent clipper</li>
            <li> This was okay. I lost these nail clippers, I always lose them.</li>
            <li> I have a couple other Tweezerman items that I am happy with.  Unfortunately, my first impression was that the clippers were awkward to hold.  For starters, once unfolded for use there was nowhere to stow the fold-out nail file.  So it just flopped around and got in the way...or rubbed against the end of the lever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that was not the biggest problem with these clippers.  Notice I&#x27;m using past tense.  The biggest problem was the spring action stopped working on the very first use.  So I had to turn right around and send them back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, they come with a great warranty and free sharpening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would only recommend these as a travel item.  They fold compact but they are not the most comfortable clippers to hold.</li>
            <li> Just takes a little getting used to, since you use the lever clips upward instead of downward.</li>
            <li> Sharp clippers and small flat design when folded up is perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Opening is wide, strong spring AND it is very thin so it can get to any nail even at the edge!  I&#x27;d recommend this 100%  Quality, fit and finish for a great price!</li>
            <li> After a half a dozen uses the clipper stopped working and will only just pinch the nail. It looks like the two blades are not lined up any more, can&#x27;t understand how this would happen we only use it to cut nails. I have owned another French style clipper that worked great for over 20 years till it got misplaced. Do not waste your money on this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I would price these at about 17$ so if your paying much more than that, i would pass.  If you find them cheaper, i would jump on it.  nice travel clippers, and good file.  no key ring, but very sharp and so far seem durable.</li>
            <li> Solid pair of clippers, great for travel. I recommend these and have two pairs, one for travel and one for home.</li>
            <li> Though I thought the price was a little high for nail clippers, I am very happy with the product. I also received it very promptly, two days after my order.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman always has good products.</li>
            <li> Fold up so compactly, so flatly,  nice file, nice clippers. Would buy again any time. Only bad thing is my toddler wants to play with them all the time.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Matters of great concern should be treated lightly. Matters of small concern should be treated seriously.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some might regard the simple choice of a personal grooming implement to be unworthy of any level of analysis. &amp;#34;Why not just use the seventy-five cent jobbies hanging in the checkout aisle at CVS?&amp;#34; You may ask. It&#x27;s understandable that one may choose to let go of this issue and allow inferior mass-produced junk to populate one&#x27;s medicine cabinet. For those who cannot be bothered, then move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, it makes no sense to spend half a bill on henckel toenail clippers for goodness&#x27; sake, but you can do better than the dollar store throwaways and get a pair of snips which are sharp, well made, cleverly designed, and easily handled. This set is the perfect size for all but the thickest, toughest, furry-toe-knuckled hobbitlike toenails. You may need something a little more heavy duty for true pachyderm stuff and you may need a microscopic dainty set for your infants, but for everythig else in between, these are perfect. Far, far better than the poorly cast, barely chromed junk that I&#x27;ve been saddled with up to now.</li>
            <li> Another great Tweezerman product. I&#x27;ve wanted these for a while. Finally bought, just to satisfy free shipping deal from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could never find them at stores.&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars for the &amp;#34;thought-to- be&amp;#34; high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they are so wonderfully convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Who ever designed these should be awarded from company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 5/9 having lost above item I repurchased after a price drop was listed. They fit in picketvquite well without given detectable bulge. Easily carried in glove compartment of vehicle, or purse</li>
            <li> These clippers live in my purse.  They are perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They collapse into a 2.25\\&quot;x0.5\\&quot;x0.125\\&quot; space with no sharp edges to snag on the purse lining or cut me when I go digging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are very sharp (be very careful when collapsing) and retain their edge (sharp 4 years now).  Even with all the cutting and collapsing, the edges retain ther alignment so you don&#x27;t need to worry about bending rather than cutting a nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;under the nails\\&quot; scrapper has the wrong angle to be effective.  (I have a different Tweezerman tool for that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the nail file--can&#x27;t stand the sound fo files.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, love these clippers.  They are worth the couple bucks more than the ones you find in the beauty aisles.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this for years because once I got one from Germany. The quality is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Well made plus a small ring to attached to keys is  quite handy...</li>
            <li> the clipper cutting action works well however the lever that contains the file and also holds the clipper closed is a very poor design when the clipper is opened that loose floppy thing that contains the file is constantly in the way making it nearly impossible to control the clipper  and there is no way of holding the clipper where it is not in the way, I think you should stick to tweezers only as this thing&#x27;s a mess, cumbersome and aggravating to use.</li>
            <li> These are the best!!!</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly on my car keys, never have to go looking for a clipper, good quality, good price, works as it should</li>
            <li> Not only do they work really well, but the sleek design is awesome. Fits snuggly in the little pouch it comes in. Great to keep in my car.</li>
            <li> Does not have a pointed end to clean the nail.  I find it as a good replacement after the guard at the airport tookmy good one from me. Remember to put this in your suitcase gentlemen.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my first one broke, but I loved it, so I bought a second one. It clips nails neatly and the nail file smooths rough edges.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever owned, bought 4</li>
            <li> Have to press it all the way tight closed to create enough force for cutting.  I would like more lever to it.  Also, the file part just flops around while you try to cut your nails.</li>
            <li> Clips nails perfectly and has a super nail file!  Easy to cary in your pocket with the low profile folding structure.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good quality, works well.</li>
            <li> I use clippers quite often.  I cook for a living and occasionally do videos.  I don&#x27;t like long nails that trap grime.  This is super small and very sturdy.  More importantly it is handy and easy to carry every day.  It has a nail cleaner, nail file, and clippers.  There is a key ring for key chains and it is about as thick as two keys put together.</li>
            <li> sharp, strong and compact,  good file.  just what i was needing.  not sure what they meant in the discription about different stops at different angles as i do not seem to be able make it adjust at all, but it does work great.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, we&#x27;ll made and sharp, folds well and goes great on a key chain. Emery board is aggressive, so great for the big stuff but a bit ham fisted.</li>
            <li> I have been carrying these around on my carabiner for a couple of weeks now and I have been very pleased with the construction quality and size.</li>
            <li> I find it slight awkward to use. Compared to traditional American clippers, the leverage is opposite: bottom up versus top down. I find that turning the clippers over helps me better orient the clippers and cutting position. This also helps to work around the awkwardness of having the file/scraper arm sticking out in an uncomfortable to use position/angle. The three stars are an indication of the build quality being average. I had hoped for above average build and material quality.</li>
            <li> Steel too thin so bends when you try to cut nails.  It will not cut a thumbnail.  I won&#x27;t even try to cut the nail on my big toe with it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend! Fit great in your pocket do not even notice that there in my pocket. Sharp and file works great. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for what I expected to be an identical Tweezerman clipper that I&#x27;ve carried around for several years but fell out of my pocket.  While it looks very similar in the picture, the quality has been dramatically reduced.  The fit and finish are terrible compared to the earlier version, with flimsy construction.  Notwithstanding, it still performs it&#x27;s function, it&#x27;s just an inferior quality product.  Always disappointing when a company diminish the quality of what, in this case, used to be a well-made product.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of getting used to the different &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of these clippers compared to the standard ones, but these are much sharper and more accurate than the typical ones I find at the pharmacy. The nail file is of a vastly superior &amp;#34;stippled&amp;#34; pattern and is a huge improvement over the typical design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that one can pay up to 3â€“4x more for the same device with a fancier name stamped on it. Zwilling and F. Hammann are examples</li>
            <li> Very nice product that exceeded my expectations. Works very well and is very sharp! Would recommend to anyone looking for this kind of product.</li>
            <li> i have owned twiezerman bail clipper for longer thatn 20 years, this is either a cheap copy or the quality of the product is diminishing</li>
            <li> This product is well made and work great. This is my second pair since my wife to the first one.</li>
