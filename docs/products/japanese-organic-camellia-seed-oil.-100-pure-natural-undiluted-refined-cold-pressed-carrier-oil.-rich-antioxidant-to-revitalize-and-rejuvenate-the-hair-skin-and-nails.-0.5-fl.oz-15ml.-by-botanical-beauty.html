            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>Camellia JAPONICA feels so great on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I ordered all three, and have seen a remarkable difference in my skin in just a week.</li>
            <li>I find creams to be drying and oils much-much more effective at giving me great skin.  </li>
            <li>its just okay, was recommended buy a girlfriend.</li>
            <li>I love camellia oil</li>
            <li>and this is one of the better brands that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>so start with just a tiny bit as you can always add more until you discover the perfect amount for your purposes.</li>
            <li>like it better than most anti-wrinkle night time moisturizing cremes.</li>
            <li>Most cremes cause me to get pimples and this does not.</li>
            <li>Some oils absorb faster, some slower, but doing the oils is so much better long-term.  </li>
            <li>love product but</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>Love itüòç</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to overdo it with oils</li>
            <li>I primarily use it for my skin (underneath a moisturizer) and sometimes on my hair.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t fit my needs.</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t see the significant change I wanted.</li>
            <li>I switched to a pure vitamin e oil and it works much better for me.</li>
            <li>I have a whole army of oils now from this company, and I just rotate them, and they all feel fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see myself purchasing this again, but if I do, I would transfer it to my own blue glass bottle with a secure dropper.</li>
            <li>My skin loves oils and this oil absorbs so quickly.</li>
            <li>So, I have found from personal experience that oils on top of a really high quality toner is the best possible thing you can do for your skin.</li>
            <li>I use this at night on my face before bed, It soaks right into the skin and does not leave an oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is clear, veritably odorless, and easily absorbs into the skin, nails, and hair.  </li>
            <li>Several drops worked through my hair and left on for an hour before shampooing is a great, restorative mask.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and it makes a great night time oil because of the high antioxidant content (green tea),</li>
            <li>Really moisturizing!  </li>
            <li>I also use it when my hair is straight (flat-ironed) as a daily moisturizer and it gives a brilliant sheen, detangles and softens my roots without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>Good for hair in small amounts.</li>
            <li>Very high quality oil.  </li>
            <li>and since there was not much left before it leaked, I felt comfortable re-ordering.</li>
            <li>Worked really well.</li>
            <li>The reason I purchased my second bottle so quicly after my first bottle was because my first bottle LEAKED</li>
            <li>Seriously, I am not using any creams anymore, but have about 8 of this company&#x27;s oils, and just rotate them.  </li>
            <li>omega fatty acids including a high amount of oleic acid (most moisturizing component of oil).</li>
            <li>Not only was the lining of my bag covered in oil stains but the entire $9 bottle had leaked without the top being OPEN.</li>
            <li>If I am keeping count, I purchased 2 bottles and only used a little more than 3/4 of 1 bottle before the remaining amount leaked out.</li>
            <li>My skin and pores have been clear, balanced and glowing since incorporating this oil.</li>
            <li>My natural hair is 4a.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for diluting concentrated and scented oils - those oils that come with a label warning against direct application to  the skin.</li>
            <li>Since doing that, even during hot, dry weather conditions, my nails do not become brittle or break.  </li>
            <li>Because creams dry off--unless they have a high % of oil, or a high % of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive, mature skin and adding just one drop of this oil to my moisturizer makes all the difference.  </li>
            <li>One drop spread between the palms of my hands and then lightly run through my waist length hair also imparts a subtle gloss.  </li>
            <li>I finally got around to removing the plastic seal off the second bottle a few months ago and used it a total of (3) times with it still 90% full before it leaked again all over my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>I tend to have dry sensitive skin and this is just the thing for me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I unfortunately have to update my review. The reason I purchased my second bottle so quicly after my first bottle was because my first bottle LEAKED and I lost the 1/4 that was left. I thought it was simple user error and since there was not much left before it leaked, I felt comfortable re-ordering. I finally got around to removing the plastic seal off the second bottle a few months ago and used it a total of (3) times with it still 90% full before it leaked again all over my makeup bag. Not only was the lining of my bag covered in oil stains but the entire $9 bottle had leaked without the top being OPEN. The bottle was completely EMPTY. I am in shock at the money I wasted to use an empty bottle. If I am keeping count, I purchased 2 bottles and only used a little more than 3/4 of 1 bottle before the remaining amount leaked out. The dropper is affixed too loosely and that should be addressed. I don&#x27;t see myself purchasing this again, but if I do, I would transfer it to my own blue glass bottle with a secure dropper. -------- This is my second purchase of this oil (camellia sinensis or green tea oil). I primarily use it for my skin (underneath a moisturizer) and sometimes on my hair. I have combination skin and it makes a great night time oil because of the high antioxidant content (green tea), omega fatty acids including a high amount of oleic acid (most moisturizing component of oil). It is also balancing and non-comedogenic so it does not cause breakouts or leave the face shiny. My skin and pores have been clear, balanced and glowing since incorporating this oil. I also use it when my hair is straight (flat-ironed) as a daily moisturizer and it gives a brilliant sheen, detangles and softens my roots without weighing my hair down. My natural hair is 4a.</li>
            <li> very small..  i use it  in my hair and skin.. haven&#x27;t seen the difference yet.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well. Good for hair in small amounts. Recommend mixing it with your shampoo&lt;br /&gt;updated review****. After using this for about a month I just didn&#x27;t see the significant change I wanted. Had to apply twice a day to skin just to stay hydrated such a small bottle kinda a waste. I switched to a pure vitamin e oil and it works much better for me.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for diluting concentrated and scented oils - those oils that come with a label warning against direct application to  the skin. The Organic Camellia Seed Oil is face-friendly, and should allow a dilution of the scented oils to the point where they can be applied topically. However, I will downgrade this review if my face falls off upon application.</li>
            <li> its just okay, was recommended buy a girlfriend. This product didn&#x27;t fit my needs.</li>
            <li> I love camellia oil and this is one of the better brands that I&#x27;ve tried.  It is clear, veritably odorless, and easily absorbs into the skin, nails, and hair.  I have very dry, sensitive, mature skin and adding just one drop of this oil to my moisturizer makes all the difference.  I also use one drop to rub into my nails and cuticles morning and night.  Since doing that, even during hot, dry weather conditions, my nails do not become brittle or break.  One drop spread between the palms of my hands and then lightly run through my waist length hair also imparts a subtle gloss.  Several drops worked through my hair and left on for an hour before shampooing is a great, restorative mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to overdo it with oils so start with just a tiny bit as you can always add more until you discover the perfect amount for your purposes.</li>
            <li> I use this at night on my face before bed, It soaks right into the skin and does not leave an oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I like it better than most anti-wrinkle night time moisturizing cremes. Most cremes cause me to get pimples and this does not.</li>
            <li> I researched and found that the traditional, and ancient, Japanese beauty regimen consists of Konjac sponges, rice bran oil, and Camellia seed oil. I ordered all three, and have seen a remarkable difference in my skin in just a week. I am very dry, have sun damage, malasma and vitiligo, and I can physically see an improvement in moisture, tone, and elasticity. This may be a miracle combination.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizing!  I have a whole army of oils now from this company, and I just rotate them, and they all feel fabulous!  Camellia JAPONICA feels so great on the skin.  What I do is just apply a few drops after the toner and before everything else I might do.  Massaging it in for a few seconds really helps the skin&#x27;s elasticity, tone, color, and health.  Seriously, I am not using any creams anymore, but have about 8 of this company&#x27;s oils, and just rotate them.  I find creams to be drying and oils much-much more effective at giving me great skin.  Some oils absorb faster, some slower, but doing the oils is so much better long-term.  Because creams dry off--unless they have a high % of oil, or a high % of chemicals.  So, I have found from personal experience that oils on top of a really high quality toner is the best possible thing you can do for your skin.</li>
            <li> very small. love product but not really worth price</li>
            <li> My skin loves oils and this oil absorbs so quickly. I tend to have dry sensitive skin and this is just the thing for me. I deserves 5 stars but the only reason I gave it 4 is because the bottle is so small. I use it before I put my make up on and at night so I went through the bottle within a month. I wish they sold it in different oz.</li>
            <li> Used this product to make my stay in hair conditioner. Worked really well. Wish I had ordered a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> Very high quality oil.  Lovely.</li>
            <li> This oil seems very high quality, but I was bummed at how small the bottle is... I guess I should have looked up the size before purchase!</li>
            <li> Great product!! Love itüòç</li>
