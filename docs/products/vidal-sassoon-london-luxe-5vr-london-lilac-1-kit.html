            <li>It might be that 15 minutes is the best amount of time for you.</li>
            <li>Summer is the perfect time to make things brighter, and if you&#x27;re thinking about what brand and colour to go with, I&#x27;d recommend Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s London Lilac, which is one of its 9 colour selections from its London Luxe series.</li>

            <li>Great color, easy to use, not smelly</li>
            <li>The London lilac and the midnight muse are both rich beautiful dyes.</li>
            <li>IMHO, Vidal Sassoon is still the best when it comes to certain hair products, like, say this hair color.</li>
            <li>and it was amazing...</li>
            <li>bright purple means it was a way better experience.</li>
            <li>The integrity of the colour is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The color came out amazing.</li>
            <li>At my own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received a sample from BzzAgent to try and give my honest feedback on.</li>
            <li>Just remember that you need to monitor the development of the dye based on your own hair porosity.</li>
            <li>it looks nice in the sun.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have a well-known hair colour company produce some colourful shades.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a nice glimmer of purple-reddish tinge -</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t dyed my hair in 8 months and it still looks nice.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use, the results exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Works well and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Best used on natural hair or lighter colors....</li>
            <li>and I have gotten so many amazing compliments and the change.</li>
            <li>Ok so the color is really nice</li>
            <li>By far the best purple dye I&#x27;ve used-</li>
            <li>do recommend the product since the scent wasn&#x27;t invasive and the dye spot on skin were remove fairly easily!</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I got to try this product out free thanks to Vidal Sassoon and this product is great!</li>
            <li>Did NOTHING...if your looking for a nice plum color, invest in Jerome Russell&#x27;s violet, SMELLS delicious and works for me...remember, when you buy a &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; dye, you NEVER get the same results from the picture on the box!</li>
            <li>I love the consistency.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s extremely pleased with the color</li>
            <li>absolutly in love with this product....</li>
            <li>the best in the market i tried the midnight blue mouse</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I have had so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Have dyed my hair purple semi-regularly for many years.</li>
            <li>Really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>still not a terrible color. :-)</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments on this hair color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with it until something better comes along.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product twice hoping for a better outcome,  </li>
            <li>Was okay.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this color.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this dye to be just okay.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, definitely will be using again!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the better smelling hair colors that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way the color turned out.</li>
            <li>I have used London lilac, midnight muse, and runway red all with excellent results.</li>
            <li>and I had a more goth look than I probably would like at my age.</li>
            <li>The lighter I got, the more compliments I received.</li>
            <li>color didn&#x27;t get on my pillow case, towels, or fingers like many of the \\&quot;unnatural\\</li>
            <li>For some reason roots is a style now, but it looks cute.</li>
            <li>Leaves more of a tint on dyed black/brown hair.</li>
            <li>this color came out burgandy, i was hoping for it to be more purple-ish.</li>
            <li>I got a FABULOUS deal too!</li>
            <li>Was very excited to see an established brand of hair color that comes in funky colors, and most importantly is permanent!</li>
            <li>My hair looks beautiful with the new hair color and it feels smooth, and silky!</li>
            <li>Loved the color and it really lasts! :)</li>
            <li>and it still looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>The gorgeous color is vivid; nice compliments from people on the street.</li>
            <li>I will say I love the 2 step process and the instructions were easy to understand.</li>
            <li>I love the way it came out and how easy it was to apply.</li>
            <li>I am originally ginger (red head/haired) and this color turned out to be perfectly lilac!!</li>
            <li>I originally wanted to go even more purple than this, but I am so in love with this color, I don&#x27;t plan on changing any time soon.</li>
            <li>So bright and vibrant!</li>
            <li>I was able to try out this product for free, via Vidal Sassoon and BzzAgent</li>
            <li>Lilac is more of a light pastel purple.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using any other hair colour than this awesome one.</li>
            <li>It turns my medium/mousy brown hair into a rich and stunning shade of purple.</li>
            <li>As my first time ever dying my hair; I was so pleased with the results that I got from Vidal Sassoon!</li>
            <li>There was no chemical smell during application, and the results came out very bold and just like the colour indicated on the packaging.</li>
            <li>The product was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The purple was bright and vibrant in my hair, and the process itself was a lot easier than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>This is probably because I&#x27;ve been dying my hair of over 25 years and all the processing causes it to suck in color easily.</li>
            <li>The color that came out is a deep, healthy looking purple-black, and my bleached tips are a more medium bright</li>
            <li>and I expect to need a touch up every 6-8 weeks, which is fine with me.  </li>
            <li>Still a nice dye and doesn&#x27;t fade OR bleed as much as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>disclaimer: was sent this item to try out for free from Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li>I got this from a Vidal Sassoon as a free sample to try and after using it</li>
            <li>my stylist and I have been looking for a great shade of purple that holds in my blonde hair with highlights!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been using a light brown dye).</li>
            <li>/&gt;-leaves hair silky smooth and shiny</li>
            <li>/&gt;-was easy to clean up off of my counters when I spilled it</li>
            <li>So I got this product to try for free from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>Vidal Sassoon claims that it&#x27;s permanent, but also says that it lasts up to 48 washes, so that doesn&#x27;t sound so \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; to me.</li>
            <li>Great burgundy red option,</li>
            <li>I got this product free for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li>it shows in the light ^_^</li>
            <li>Fabulous Color.</li>
            <li>I used it on my dark brown hair and it&#x27;s been perfect- not too bright, but you can definitely tell it has a purple tint.</li>
            <li>The colour is very nice and bold and so easy to apply and only takes 25 minutes</li>
            <li>It also washed out really quickly and easily, which was a plus.</li>
            <li>Most kits are geared towards a very warm tone purple that after a handfull of washes turns red, and I and my cool tone skin don&#x27;t look good in full, washed out red hair.</li>
            <li>london liliac is my new favorite color, i have gotten tons of complements on it :-)</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Vidal Sassoon color, and I have to say I am extremely, extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>I got my sample in the mail and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>LOVE this color so much!</li>
            <li>The color was even this time and looks rich.  </li>
            <li>I originally wanted the darkest violet, but accidentally ordered the London Lilac.</li>
            <li>I love that my hair color is a darkish violet and then in the sunlight it really shines!</li>
            <li>Love it so much!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find anything special about this hair colour though.</li>
            <li>I used it to put some bright lowlights in my strawberry blonde hair</li>
            <li>But it gave me this gorgeous navy blue color.</li>
            <li>love it so much I ordered a case</li>
            <li>To get true color needs to be dyed a couple times.</li>
            <li>but honestly i&#x27;ve washed my hair like 10 times so far</li>
            <li>but if you want to achieve a red color without dyeing your hair evey 4 weeks then this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend it to anyone looking for a bright, bold new change!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this on brown hair I can see you would get purple like the photos show, just remember the more red you have in your hair, the more burgundy like it will be.</li>
            <li>Love how the color turned out the second time since it was more noticeable.</li>
            <li>Always had to use semi-permanent brands like Manic Panic or Punky Colors, which wash out too quickly.</li>
            <li>I always wanted a more purple hair color but it always turns out more red</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t wash out for more than 2 washes like most red colors.</li>
            <li>this gives her hair, it&#x27;s a very nice shade that can pass for a natural dark color in normal light, but under bright lights or in the sun</li>
            <li>have high expectation towards this product, and it turns out better than I have expected.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It fades kind of fast, but that is true with all vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>I tried this product free thanks to Vidal Sassoon and BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments and it&#x27;s not hard on my hair at all.</li>
            <li>My hair was nice and soft, and the color took evenly over my whole head!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be using this more!</li>
            <li>This color really lasts!!  </li>
            <li>the colours changing depending on what light I&#x27;m in - not too off the wall that I can wear it at work (office job), but still feel a bit funky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application was easy and seamless.  </li>
            <li>Though the colour is red based, the purple shows nicely and I love how it completely transformed my summer ombre.  </li>
            <li>This color is fun.</li>
            <li>But the color is nice and covered my white streak nicely though it is not the same shade as the rest of my hair</li>
            <li>I love the box, the design looked professional and the colour looked enticing.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a nice burgundy red.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>In the beginning it is purplish but when it fades, it goes to a really nice shade of red.</li>
            <li>all too often they fade right out to red or aren&#x27;t even really purple enough to begin with, but this one&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>If you want a more accurate representation of what the color will look like (at first), take a look at their Deep Velvet Violet.</li>
            <li>BUT, if you ever get hit with sunlight, it positively shines!</li>
            <li>It barely fades and I am really glad I got it</li>
            <li>However, since the box shows more of a plum shade, I was pleasantly surprised when this had more of a deep grapey color on me.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color in my daughters hair and long lasting.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY color I have done more than 2 dyes worth, and I have been doing it for over a year.</li>
            <li>The instructions were clear and it was all easy to use.</li>
            <li>I used it on bleached ends (my natural hair colour is black), it turned into a beautiful purple colour.</li>
            <li>Just because the recommended dyeing time is 25 minutes does NOT mean that 25 minutes is the right amount of time for YOUR hair!</li>
            <li>When you first dye it, it&#x27;s this gorgeous black-violet color, then slowly fades to a very nice dark auburn (4+ weeks).</li>
            <li>pretty your hair</li>
            <li>This color really lasts!</li>
            <li>I used the applicator tip and a brush to first cover my hairline all around, my side part and crown.  </li>
            <li>finished color was darker on top, almost back-purple with an ashy purple on the bottom third.  </li>
            <li>is my first time using a permanent color</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this for people who are looking for a cheap alternative!</li>
            <li>and I was worried that this dye would be more of a red color</li>
            <li>I was a bit scared to use this colour at first, but couldn&#x27;t wait to use it once I received it through BzzAgent courtesy of Vidal</li>
            <li>At first my hair turned out pretty.  </li>
            <li>but then it faded into red more than purple in just a week.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even tell you how many compliments I get DAILY on this haircolor!</li>
            <li>otherwise I&#x27;m love it and will definitely use their products again.</li>
            <li>The first two or three days I had some staining to the scalp</li>
            <li>Faded out of my hair to fast.it was really pretty wthe first couple of days but kept washing out and was lighter after a week.</li>
            <li>and my hair was taking on more of a darker red colour as the plum was washing out.  </li>
            <li>They really tried to make the product smell good- to mask the typical scent of chemicals.</li>
            <li>It is better and more long lasting than even salon hair colour.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done a streak of bright red, magenta, blonde.</li>
            <li>My roots aren&#x27;t the same color as the rest of my locks, but regardless it&#x27;s a good color overall.</li>
            <li>However, I was not convinced by looking at the box and reading reviews that it would come out a true purple by putting it on my natural brown hair.</li>
            <li>The result weren&#x27;t as flashy as i&#x27;d love, but it gave me nice shiny purple reflect all over, with a deep black/purple shade under it :)</li>
            <li>I always bleach my hair before applying the purple, because I want the purple to be very vibrant.</li>
            <li>The colour is bold, my hair is soft and hydrated and the colour you want is the colour you get.</li>
            <li>I would have used a different color, except this event is pretty important</li>
            <li>This product covers completely, doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, and gives me a really nice color of purple that I always get compliments for</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t bled near as much as the other product I had bought, the color lasts fairly well, I love the actual color so far,</li>
            <li>The shade is a lovely color and not too bright, which I was afraid of.  </li>
            <li>the color was more pink than purple.</li>
            <li>but this one really worked well.</li>
            <li>I really like this color.</li>
            <li>If you want to really keep the color without it looking faded, you&#x27;ll need to dye every four weeks, which is way too often to be dying your hair.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this hair color.</li>
            <li>I enjoy coloring my hair different shades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s straight up purple</li>
            <li>Instead the dye was very close to the colour on the box.</li>
            <li>I used this dye on bleached hair and the color really pops.  </li>
            <li>and its really faded</li>
            <li>This has been the first dye out of countless brands and boxes that ended up being a true purple colour.  </li>
            <li>It evened out my very light roots and dark box colored hair.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely loved how simple it is to use, that it didn&#x27;t clump and that the Lilac colour sits well even over dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>London Lilac is my new go to color!</li>
            <li>it did not even smell as bad as other the consistency is perfect and i am in love with it</li>
            <li>Nope, turned out to be more of a black- purple.</li>
            <li>Plus the color is vibrant and it will cover up your grays.</li>
            <li>I noticed that especially on the ends of my hair where the bleach didn&#x27;t lighten as much, it is definitely more of a red color, and not purple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this is the closest I have gotten to a very professional looking color!</li>
            <li>all, i love it, but the color matching on the back isn&#x27;t quite right for Dark brown hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes over dark hair and adds a nice violet in the light, looks dark in less light.</li>
            <li>In darker light it looks like a deep purple red but in the sun it is a very vibrant violet color-</li>
            <li>The color is definitely noticeable in high light and outdoors, but not so much indoors and has held up over numerous washings!</li>
            <li>Normally colors don&#x27;t show well in my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m OK with that because my hair does sometimes take color unevenly.</li>
            <li>I hope that Vidal Sassoon continues to make these fun colors so that I never have to revert back to semi-permanent dyes again.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I even gave it a 1 star was because the seller packaged it beautiful with a small lotion sample and a personal letter  saying &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I can wash it normally</li>
            <li>The dye was a pinkish color and had an ammonia smell to it and was warm on my scalp but the one bottle covered all of my thick, shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>Conversely if your hair is very non-porous, 25 minutes may not be long enough, an your hair will come out too light.</li>
            <li>I got a lot of compliments from friends and family on my new hair colour.</li>
            <li>Sally Beauty Supply has a couple new options for a permanent violet purple, FYI.</li>
            <li>, didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations</li>
            <li>This dye was SO easy to use, and it didn&#x27;t leave any mess anywhere.</li>
            <li>My roots from growout from the first time are definitely lighter color from the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li>only reason it lost one star is because after the first couple of washes, I did notice a lot of the purple seemed to be fading</li>
            <li>This means that if you want the colour to stay exactly like what it looks like after initial application, I would say that you&#x27;d have to re-dye every two to three weeks depending on how often you wash your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this over my previously dyed (bright( red hair and about an inch of regrowth (mousy brown with 20% grey).</li>
            <li>That being said, if you want extremely blue or purple, you&#x27;d be better off bleaching your hair first, especially if you have dark Brown hair.</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re okay with your hair possibly being a dark purple almost black, before it turns the true color.</li>
            <li>So I would definitely recommend buying two boxes of dye.&lt;br /&gt;The color came out a slightly purple, mostly wine color.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and used this kind of shade before with other brand.</li>
            <li>As easy to use as other regular hair</li>
            <li>A very dark purple, and more purple than red.</li>
            <li>Also, to make color last, remember to use gentle shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>Since my hair is very porous, it was literally 15 minutes for me when I dyed my hair with the blue.</li>
            <li>I also have bleached, natural hair.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t tell when you&#x27;re inside, but outside, it&#x27;s really purple.</li>
            <li>I used it exactly according to directions (it says to leave it on for 30 min) and it completely damaged my hair leaving it dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks, it has faded to the shade I had originally wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was hoping that if I left the color on for 45 minutes that I&#x27;d have a vibrant purple.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing this colour again once this fades to keep the purple vibrant for months to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a bit of an adjustment for me to get used to since I was a much lighter/brighter color for a long while.</li>
            <li>, the fact that my hair didn&#x27;t feel coarse or dry, but instead looked SUPER glossy after dying, was definitely a plus in my books!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, with a week or so, as the color slowly washed out, it became a striking but oddly enough still &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shade of purple.</li>
            <li>After recieving the Produc through a Bzzagent campaign for as a promotion for the Vidal Sassoon brand I was excited yet anxious to try.</li>
            <li>I have used many different boxed dyes in the past that said they were supposed to be plum or purple shades, and just ended up with varying red hues.  </li>
            <li>have tried a few other purple hues from the line, so it made the leap into a more lilac hue a BIT</li>
            <li>I bought the London Lilac because I was looking for a more subtle purple, not a neon teenage punk purple.</li>
            <li>using over a darker dye will give barely there results.</li>
            <li>, however I had already colored my hair completely purple by bleaching my hair and adding a different product.  </li>
            <li>When I applied it, the color BARELY came out.</li>
            <li>Especially with the 5 inches of natural roots that grew in.</li>
            <li>Since my base was an auburn brown after I colored I got a gorgeous very purple burgundy!</li>
            <li>It comes out super vibrant even on dark hair (mine is close to black, a lot like the darkest on the scale on the box).</li>
            <li>I have had purple hair for a long time and tried most of what is out there, enduring the mess, the staining and the time spent under a dryer to set the color.  </li>
            <li>And I used it on never colored hair that was freshly lightened to pale blonde.</li>
            <li>I had on the bottom half and in the very front turned purple as well.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is very porous--if it has been processed a lot, for instance--it will suck up the dye like a sponge such that after 25 minutes your hair may look too dark.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve always had a hard time keeping red vibrant -- the burgundy that this color turns into stays vibrant for quite some time (same for my friends).</li>

            <li> It might be that 15 minutes is the best amount of time for you.</li>
            <li> Summer is the perfect time to make things brighter, and if you&#x27;re thinking about what brand and colour to go with, I&#x27;d recommend Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s London Lilac, which is one of its 9 colour selections from its London Luxe series.</li>

            <li> IMHO, Vidal Sassoon is still the best when it comes to certain hair products, like, say this hair color.</li>
            <li> and it was amazing...</li>
            <li> bright purple means it was a way better experience.</li>
            <li> The integrity of the colour is amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The color came out amazing.</li>
            <li> At my own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received a sample from BzzAgent to try and give my honest feedback on.</li>
            <li> Just remember that you need to monitor the development of the dye based on your own hair porosity.</li>
            <li> it looks nice in the sun.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have a well-known hair colour company produce some colourful shades.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a nice glimmer of purple-reddish tinge -</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t dyed my hair in 8 months and it still looks nice.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to use, the results exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Works well and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Best used on natural hair or lighter colors....</li>
            <li> and I have gotten so many amazing compliments and the change.</li>
            <li> Ok so the color is really nice</li>
            <li> By far the best purple dye I&#x27;ve used-</li>
            <li> do recommend the product since the scent wasn&#x27;t invasive and the dye spot on skin were remove fairly easily!</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I got to try this product out free thanks to Vidal Sassoon and this product is great!</li>
            <li> Did NOTHING...if your looking for a nice plum color, invest in Jerome Russell&#x27;s violet, SMELLS delicious and works for me...remember, when you buy a &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; dye, you NEVER get the same results from the picture on the box!</li>
            <li> I love the consistency.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this product.</li>

            <li> I have had so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Have dyed my hair purple semi-regularly for many years.</li>
            <li> Really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> still not a terrible color. :-)</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments on this hair color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with it until something better comes along.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product twice hoping for a better outcome,  </li>
            <li> Was okay.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this color.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this dye to be just okay.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, definitely will be using again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the better smelling hair colors that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way the color turned out.</li>
            <li> I have used London lilac, midnight muse, and runway red all with excellent results.</li>
            <li> and I had a more goth look than I probably would like at my age.</li>
            <li> The lighter I got, the more compliments I received.</li>
            <li> color didn&#x27;t get on my pillow case, towels, or fingers like many of the \\&quot;unnatural\\</li>
            <li> For some reason roots is a style now, but it looks cute.</li>
            <li> Leaves more of a tint on dyed black/brown hair.</li>
            <li> this color came out burgandy, i was hoping for it to be more purple-ish.</li>
            <li> I got a FABULOUS deal too!</li>
            <li> Was very excited to see an established brand of hair color that comes in funky colors, and most importantly is permanent!</li>
            <li> My hair looks beautiful with the new hair color and it feels smooth, and silky!</li>
            <li> Loved the color and it really lasts! :)</li>
            <li> and it still looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> The gorgeous color is vivid; nice compliments from people on the street.</li>
            <li> I will say I love the 2 step process and the instructions were easy to understand.</li>
            <li> I love the way it came out and how easy it was to apply.</li>
            <li> I am originally ginger (red head/haired) and this color turned out to be perfectly lilac!!</li>
            <li> I originally wanted to go even more purple than this, but I am so in love with this color, I don&#x27;t plan on changing any time soon.</li>
            <li> So bright and vibrant!</li>
            <li> I was able to try out this product for free, via Vidal Sassoon and BzzAgent</li>
            <li> Lilac is more of a light pastel purple.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using any other hair colour than this awesome one.</li>
            <li> It turns my medium/mousy brown hair into a rich and stunning shade of purple.</li>
            <li> As my first time ever dying my hair; I was so pleased with the results that I got from Vidal Sassoon!</li>
            <li> There was no chemical smell during application, and the results came out very bold and just like the colour indicated on the packaging.</li>
            <li> The product was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The purple was bright and vibrant in my hair, and the process itself was a lot easier than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> This is probably because I&#x27;ve been dying my hair of over 25 years and all the processing causes it to suck in color easily.</li>
            <li> The color that came out is a deep, healthy looking purple-black, and my bleached tips are a more medium bright</li>
            <li> and I expect to need a touch up every 6-8 weeks, which is fine with me.  </li>
            <li> Still a nice dye and doesn&#x27;t fade OR bleed as much as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> disclaimer: was sent this item to try out for free from Bzzagent.  </li>
            <li> I got this from a Vidal Sassoon as a free sample to try and after using it</li>
            <li> my stylist and I have been looking for a great shade of purple that holds in my blonde hair with highlights!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been using a light brown dye).</li>
            <li> /&gt;-leaves hair silky smooth and shiny</li>
            <li> /&gt;-was easy to clean up off of my counters when I spilled it</li>
            <li> So I got this product to try for free from BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon claims that it&#x27;s permanent, but also says that it lasts up to 48 washes, so that doesn&#x27;t sound so \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; to me.</li>
            <li> Great burgundy red option,</li>
            <li> I got this product free for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> it shows in the light ^_^</li>
            <li> Fabulous Color.</li>
            <li> I used it on my dark brown hair and it&#x27;s been perfect- not too bright, but you can definitely tell it has a purple tint.</li>
            <li> The colour is very nice and bold and so easy to apply and only takes 25 minutes</li>
            <li> It also washed out really quickly and easily, which was a plus.</li>
            <li> Most kits are geared towards a very warm tone purple that after a handfull of washes turns red, and I and my cool tone skin don&#x27;t look good in full, washed out red hair.</li>
            <li> london liliac is my new favorite color, i have gotten tons of complements on it :-)</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Vidal Sassoon color, and I have to say I am extremely, extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> I got my sample in the mail and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this color so much!</li>
            <li> The color was even this time and looks rich.  </li>
            <li> I originally wanted the darkest violet, but accidentally ordered the London Lilac.</li>
            <li> I love that my hair color is a darkish violet and then in the sunlight it really shines!</li>
            <li> Love it so much!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find anything special about this hair colour though.</li>
            <li> I used it to put some bright lowlights in my strawberry blonde hair</li>
            <li> But it gave me this gorgeous navy blue color.</li>
            <li> love it so much I ordered a case</li>
            <li> To get true color needs to be dyed a couple times.</li>
            <li> but honestly i&#x27;ve washed my hair like 10 times so far</li>
            <li> but if you want to achieve a red color without dyeing your hair evey 4 weeks then this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend it to anyone looking for a bright, bold new change!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this on brown hair I can see you would get purple like the photos show, just remember the more red you have in your hair, the more burgundy like it will be.</li>
            <li> Love how the color turned out the second time since it was more noticeable.</li>
            <li> Always had to use semi-permanent brands like Manic Panic or Punky Colors, which wash out too quickly.</li>
            <li> I always wanted a more purple hair color but it always turns out more red</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t wash out for more than 2 washes like most red colors.</li>
            <li> this gives her hair, it&#x27;s a very nice shade that can pass for a natural dark color in normal light, but under bright lights or in the sun</li>
            <li> have high expectation towards this product, and it turns out better than I have expected.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It fades kind of fast, but that is true with all vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> I tried this product free thanks to Vidal Sassoon and BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments and it&#x27;s not hard on my hair at all.</li>
            <li> My hair was nice and soft, and the color took evenly over my whole head!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be using this more!</li>
            <li> This color really lasts!!  </li>
            <li> the colours changing depending on what light I&#x27;m in - not too off the wall that I can wear it at work (office job), but still feel a bit funky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application was easy and seamless.  </li>
            <li> Though the colour is red based, the purple shows nicely and I love how it completely transformed my summer ombre.  </li>
            <li> This color is fun.</li>
            <li> But the color is nice and covered my white streak nicely though it is not the same shade as the rest of my hair</li>
            <li> I love the box, the design looked professional and the colour looked enticing.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a nice burgundy red.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> In the beginning it is purplish but when it fades, it goes to a really nice shade of red.</li>
            <li> all too often they fade right out to red or aren&#x27;t even really purple enough to begin with, but this one&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> If you want a more accurate representation of what the color will look like (at first), take a look at their Deep Velvet Violet.</li>
            <li> BUT, if you ever get hit with sunlight, it positively shines!</li>
            <li> It barely fades and I am really glad I got it</li>
            <li> However, since the box shows more of a plum shade, I was pleasantly surprised when this had more of a deep grapey color on me.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color in my daughters hair and long lasting.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY color I have done more than 2 dyes worth, and I have been doing it for over a year.</li>
            <li> The instructions were clear and it was all easy to use.</li>
            <li> I used it on bleached ends (my natural hair colour is black), it turned into a beautiful purple colour.</li>
            <li> Just because the recommended dyeing time is 25 minutes does NOT mean that 25 minutes is the right amount of time for YOUR hair!</li>
            <li> When you first dye it, it&#x27;s this gorgeous black-violet color, then slowly fades to a very nice dark auburn (4+ weeks).</li>
            <li> pretty your hair</li>
            <li> This color really lasts!</li>
            <li> I used the applicator tip and a brush to first cover my hairline all around, my side part and crown.  </li>
            <li> finished color was darker on top, almost back-purple with an ashy purple on the bottom third.  </li>
            <li> is my first time using a permanent color</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this for people who are looking for a cheap alternative!</li>
            <li> and I was worried that this dye would be more of a red color</li>
            <li> I was a bit scared to use this colour at first, but couldn&#x27;t wait to use it once I received it through BzzAgent courtesy of Vidal</li>
            <li> At first my hair turned out pretty.  </li>
            <li> but then it faded into red more than purple in just a week.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even tell you how many compliments I get DAILY on this haircolor!</li>
            <li> otherwise I&#x27;m love it and will definitely use their products again.</li>
            <li> The first two or three days I had some staining to the scalp</li>
            <li> Faded out of my hair to fast.it was really pretty wthe first couple of days but kept washing out and was lighter after a week.</li>
            <li> and my hair was taking on more of a darker red colour as the plum was washing out.  </li>
            <li> They really tried to make the product smell good- to mask the typical scent of chemicals.</li>
            <li> It is better and more long lasting than even salon hair colour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a streak of bright red, magenta, blonde.</li>
            <li> My roots aren&#x27;t the same color as the rest of my locks, but regardless it&#x27;s a good color overall.</li>
            <li> However, I was not convinced by looking at the box and reading reviews that it would come out a true purple by putting it on my natural brown hair.</li>
            <li> The result weren&#x27;t as flashy as i&#x27;d love, but it gave me nice shiny purple reflect all over, with a deep black/purple shade under it :)</li>
            <li> I always bleach my hair before applying the purple, because I want the purple to be very vibrant.</li>
            <li> The colour is bold, my hair is soft and hydrated and the colour you want is the colour you get.</li>
            <li> I would have used a different color, except this event is pretty important</li>
            <li> This product covers completely, doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, and gives me a really nice color of purple that I always get compliments for</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t bled near as much as the other product I had bought, the color lasts fairly well, I love the actual color so far,</li>
            <li> The shade is a lovely color and not too bright, which I was afraid of.  </li>
            <li> the color was more pink than purple.</li>
            <li> but this one really worked well.</li>
            <li> I really like this color.</li>
            <li> If you want to really keep the color without it looking faded, you&#x27;ll need to dye every four weeks, which is way too often to be dying your hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this hair color.</li>
            <li> I enjoy coloring my hair different shades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s straight up purple</li>
            <li> Instead the dye was very close to the colour on the box.</li>
            <li> I used this dye on bleached hair and the color really pops.  </li>
            <li> and its really faded</li>
            <li> This has been the first dye out of countless brands and boxes that ended up being a true purple colour.  </li>
            <li> It evened out my very light roots and dark box colored hair.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely loved how simple it is to use, that it didn&#x27;t clump and that the Lilac colour sits well even over dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> London Lilac is my new go to color!</li>
            <li> it did not even smell as bad as other the consistency is perfect and i am in love with it</li>
            <li> Nope, turned out to be more of a black- purple.</li>
            <li> Plus the color is vibrant and it will cover up your grays.</li>
            <li> I noticed that especially on the ends of my hair where the bleach didn&#x27;t lighten as much, it is definitely more of a red color, and not purple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this is the closest I have gotten to a very professional looking color!</li>
            <li> all, i love it, but the color matching on the back isn&#x27;t quite right for Dark brown hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes over dark hair and adds a nice violet in the light, looks dark in less light.</li>
            <li> In darker light it looks like a deep purple red but in the sun it is a very vibrant violet color-</li>
            <li> The color is definitely noticeable in high light and outdoors, but not so much indoors and has held up over numerous washings!</li>
            <li> Normally colors don&#x27;t show well in my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m OK with that because my hair does sometimes take color unevenly.</li>
            <li> I hope that Vidal Sassoon continues to make these fun colors so that I never have to revert back to semi-permanent dyes again.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I even gave it a 1 star was because the seller packaged it beautiful with a small lotion sample and a personal letter  saying &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I can wash it normally</li>
            <li> The dye was a pinkish color and had an ammonia smell to it and was warm on my scalp but the one bottle covered all of my thick, shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Conversely if your hair is very non-porous, 25 minutes may not be long enough, an your hair will come out too light.</li>
            <li> I got a lot of compliments from friends and family on my new hair colour.</li>
            <li> Sally Beauty Supply has a couple new options for a permanent violet purple, FYI.</li>
            <li> , didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations</li>
            <li> This dye was SO easy to use, and it didn&#x27;t leave any mess anywhere.</li>
            <li> My roots from growout from the first time are definitely lighter color from the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li> only reason it lost one star is because after the first couple of washes, I did notice a lot of the purple seemed to be fading</li>
            <li> This means that if you want the colour to stay exactly like what it looks like after initial application, I would say that you&#x27;d have to re-dye every two to three weeks depending on how often you wash your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this over my previously dyed (bright( red hair and about an inch of regrowth (mousy brown with 20% grey).</li>
            <li> That being said, if you want extremely blue or purple, you&#x27;d be better off bleaching your hair first, especially if you have dark Brown hair.</li>
            <li> So I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re okay with your hair possibly being a dark purple almost black, before it turns the true color.</li>
            <li> So I would definitely recommend buying two boxes of dye.&lt;br /&gt;The color came out a slightly purple, mostly wine color.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and used this kind of shade before with other brand.</li>
            <li> As easy to use as other regular hair</li>
            <li> A very dark purple, and more purple than red.</li>
            <li> Also, to make color last, remember to use gentle shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> old</li>
            <li> Since my hair is very porous, it was literally 15 minutes for me when I dyed my hair with the blue.</li>
            <li> I also have bleached, natural hair.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tell when you&#x27;re inside, but outside, it&#x27;s really purple.</li>
            <li> I used it exactly according to directions (it says to leave it on for 30 min) and it completely damaged my hair leaving it dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, it has faded to the shade I had originally wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was hoping that if I left the color on for 45 minutes that I&#x27;d have a vibrant purple.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing this colour again once this fades to keep the purple vibrant for months to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a bit of an adjustment for me to get used to since I was a much lighter/brighter color for a long while.</li>
            <li> , the fact that my hair didn&#x27;t feel coarse or dry, but instead looked SUPER glossy after dying, was definitely a plus in my books!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, with a week or so, as the color slowly washed out, it became a striking but oddly enough still &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shade of purple.</li>
            <li> After recieving the Produc through a Bzzagent campaign for as a promotion for the Vidal Sassoon brand I was excited yet anxious to try.</li>
            <li> I have used many different boxed dyes in the past that said they were supposed to be plum or purple shades, and just ended up with varying red hues.  </li>
            <li> have tried a few other purple hues from the line, so it made the leap into a more lilac hue a BIT</li>
            <li> I bought the London Lilac because I was looking for a more subtle purple, not a neon teenage punk purple.</li>
            <li> using over a darker dye will give barely there results.</li>
            <li> , however I had already colored my hair completely purple by bleaching my hair and adding a different product.  </li>
            <li> When I applied it, the color BARELY came out.</li>
            <li> Especially with the 5 inches of natural roots that grew in.</li>
            <li> Since my base was an auburn brown after I colored I got a gorgeous very purple burgundy!</li>
            <li> It comes out super vibrant even on dark hair (mine is close to black, a lot like the darkest on the scale on the box).</li>
            <li> I have had purple hair for a long time and tried most of what is out there, enduring the mess, the staining and the time spent under a dryer to set the color.  </li>
            <li> And I used it on never colored hair that was freshly lightened to pale blonde.</li>
            <li> I had on the bottom half and in the very front turned purple as well.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is very porous--if it has been processed a lot, for instance--it will suck up the dye like a sponge such that after 25 minutes your hair may look too dark.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve always had a hard time keeping red vibrant -- the burgundy that this color turns into stays vibrant for quite some time (same for my friends).</li>
            <li> It is nice and thick, but not too thick, so it doesn&#x27;t drip all over.</li>
            <li> time I applied it over my newly dyed dark blonde (with gray) hair.</li>
            <li> It took a few months to actually become the Lilac as pictured, but with only touch-ups now it is vibrant and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It was a little dark at first but after styling and washing once the colour was LILAC!</li>
            <li> Not sure how long the color will last since this is the first time using it.  </li>
            <li> is also a god send since I flat iron my hair daily</li>
            <li> I wanted a new look (my hair is black</li>
            <li> I had bleached hair that had a blonde dye over it and even my natural medium to dark brown</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried due to the fact real my hair is kinda messed up from chemo and other meds.</li>
            <li> I try to wash my hair less frequently to make the colour last.</li>
            <li> but if any natural or artificial light gets on it you can definitely see the purple.</li>
            <li> ONE problem with this dye is that it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> will update this review once I find out how long it last before</li>
            <li> first.&lt;br /&gt;After bleaching, I applied the hair color and was surprised that there was BARELY enough dye to cover my long bob length hair (and I have an undercut on one side, which equals even less hair.)</li>
            <li> I wanted to add a subtle change to my hair, I have medium-dark brown hair and applied the dye overtop of my original dark color.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair, so the colour barely got on my hair.</li>
            <li> A few streaks, but that&#x27;s probably because I had some old henna-based dye lingering in my hair.</li>
            <li> Not by a long shot.</li>
            <li> but I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have spent $ on this since the &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; (if there was any) didn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is labeled lilac, because it doesn&#x27;t look remotely lilac, especially on the box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle but at the same time loud and different.</li>
            <li> Some henna has Metallic salts in it or other additives that will actually cause permanent dye to burn your hair.</li>
            <li> Now we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts!</li>
            <li> It did last a long time, however the color turned into red within a few days.</li>
            <li> Out of all four of my friends (and myself) who tried this, the result was the same -- looks like a really dark burgundy red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I left the dye in my hair for a 1 and 10 minutes since i have dark hair but after i washed it out i checked the results</li>
            <li> and it was the dark blackish purple with a red tint in the sun.</li>
            <li> Color is only *slightly* purple.</li>
            <li> Only slight shine in sunlight.</li>
            <li> The result I got was a deep, almost black purple.</li>
            <li> have dark brown hair with bleached tips and wanted to cover it up with something other than my old go-to, black hair dye, so I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Trying to find a dye that didn&#x27;t turn my hair dark red has been much harder than I expected when I got an urge to go purple.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as I expected</li>
            <li> dye cannot lighten other dyes....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews stating that the color didn&#x27;t turn out as the box shows, but give it a while.</li>
            <li> Lilac is a CRAZY purple not just a mild purple</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong!!</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find color in local stores.  </li>
            <li> I had expected it to be very dark</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that a month of two to three washes a week and the color is GONE.</li>
            <li> I have/had med to dark brown hair and</li>
            <li> my end result is a dark purple  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark and reflects the purple in the sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like a dark grape.</li>
            <li> In comparison to Manic Panic it was not as thick, so it did have the potential to drip, but the fact it didn&#x27;t leave the world</li>
            <li> If you have really thick hair, or lots of hair, definitely use two boxes to start.</li>
            <li> it coloured over my previous red color and made my hair feel silky and thick.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown (just about black)</li>
            <li> I got what I wanted, a shade between black and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it made my hair turn a black color</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day with an expensive, professional color protector shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely difficult to find a long lasting purple hair dye without going to the salon.</li>
            <li> The box was a little dented when I received it, but everything was there and intact.</li>
            <li> After washing it out of your hair, it comes out as a very dark purple-red.</li>
            <li> I waited about 35 mins, rinsed, rinsed, rinsed, conditioned and dried my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> or it maybe a bit harsh.</li>
            <li> I bought it as soon as I saw it and applied it a few days ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks</li>
            <li> and i got like a few strings of a purple color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this would work on black un bleached hair though.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering this color again and probably trying at least one of the other VS purple shades.</li>
            <li> Then I applied the disgusting conditioner exactly according to directions (says to leave it on for a few minutes) and it left my hair greasy and sticky.</li>
            <li> sorry, white sheets.</li>
            <li> actually ordered the wrong color.</li>
            <li> I need two boxes to do my head, medium thickness/medium length, so I&#x27;d recommend doubling up if your hair is past your shoulders.</li>
            <li> Waste of my time and money!</li>
            <li> unfortunately both times it turned to red within a week.</li>
            <li> I usually leave dye on 30 minutes or so to ensure it has a chance to gain its deepest impact on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I will look about silly for the remainder weeks until I can dye again (with a different brand!).</li>
            <li> Usually sold out when I look for it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The color turns out awful even with light brown hair, it looks black</li>
            <li> - close to &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34;, at least a lot closer than the Manic Panic that I was using before.  </li>
            <li> I usually pay 10+ dollars when I walk in somewhere to buy it!</li>
            <li> I usually used statement colours that I buy from the beauty supply store, but I think that after trying the London Luxe dye I will be sticking with it!</li>
            <li> So you do end up with a lighter, and unfortunately redder, colour than you started out with after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I mean box dye is terrifying to me and going from blonde to lilac</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in that bit</li>
            <li> Obsessed.</li>
            <li> so it sucks :(</li>
            <li> but it fades like CRAZY.</li>
            <li> and I am afraid I have ruined my hair by dying it so soon again.</li>
            <li> And the hair color didn&#x27;t have an unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> color doesn&#x27;t smell too bad.</li>
            <li> I was severely disappointed when it started to fade</li>
            <li> Results are always based on the base color you are working with.</li>
            <li> That product bled horribly, colored my towels, pillow cases, etc.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the worst hair color brands.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the violet in this color! Goes over dark hair and adds a nice violet in the light, looks dark in less light. Best used on natural hair or lighter colors....dye cannot lighten other dyes....using over a darker dye will give barely there results.</li>
            <li> I have been using Henna for about a year, and wanted something different. Disclaimer: DO NOT color over henna if you have any doubts about what you re doing. Some henna has Metallic salts in it or other additives that will actually cause permanent dye to burn your hair. Do not use permanent dye over Indigo. I use Henna Hut which has no metalllicac salts. At my own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the review. I love the consistency. It is nice and thick, but not too thick, so it doesn&#x27;t drip all over. Since my base was an auburn brown after I colored I got a gorgeous very purple burgundy! My hair was nice and soft, and the color took evenly over my whole head! This was my first time using Vidal Sassoon color, and I have to say I am extremely, extremely pleased. I got what I wanted, a shade between black and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this on brown hair I can see you would get purple like the photos show, just remember the more red you have in your hair, the more burgundy like it will be. Results are always based on the base color you are working with. Also, to make color last, remember to use gentle shampoos and conditioners. They don&#x27;t have to be expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for twenty years and I have done everything under the sun to it. I am really pleased with this product. If for some reason I becmoe displeased I will update this review.</li>
            <li> the color was more pink than purple.</li>
            <li> The London lilac came out red with purple tint, not purple. At best, it was wine colored. Definitely not purple, nothing like the advertisements or even the box. And I used it on never colored hair that was freshly lightened to pale blonde.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 yrs. old and I was hesitant about purchasing this color, however I had already colored my hair completely purple by bleaching my hair and adding a different product.  That product bled horribly, colored my towels, pillow cases, etc.  London Luxe has been awesome!  I&#x27;ve just colored my hair for the second time with this and I love it!  It hasn&#x27;t bled near as much as the other product I had bought, the color lasts fairly well, I love the actual color so far, though again, I colored it over aleady purple hair.  My roots from growout from the first time are definitely lighter color from the rest of my hair.  The shade is a lovely color and not too bright, which I was afraid of.  I will definitely be using this more!</li>
            <li> Very nice color........</li>
            <li> good shipping good price</li>
            <li> I received a sample from BzzAgent to try and give my honest feedback on. I got my sample in the mail and was excited to try it. I got the blond and and applied it to my hair. I will say I love the 2 step process and the instructions were easy to understand. Loved my hair when done.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using the London Lilac color for about 6 months now. She&#x27;s extremely pleased with the color this gives her hair, it&#x27;s a very nice shade that can pass for a natural dark color in normal light, but under bright lights or in the sun it&#x27;s a great shade of purple.</li>
            <li> Love love this color!!</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the best hair color I have boughten. Plus the color is vibrant and it will cover up your grays. The box does come with everything you will need too.  AAA+++++Product!!!</li>
            <li> Trying to find a dye that didn&#x27;t turn my hair dark red has been much harder than I expected when I got an urge to go purple. Most kits are geared towards a very warm tone purple that after a handfull of washes turns red, and I and my cool tone skin don&#x27;t look good in full, washed out red hair. This does not do that. My only complaint is that a month of two to three washes a week and the color is GONE. Still, for the price? Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Not as purple as pictured. Fades to a red. Still a nice dye and doesn&#x27;t fade OR bleed as much as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color in my daughters hair and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Normally colors don&#x27;t show well in my hair but this one really worked well. Also this color is a beautiful color.</li>
            <li> London Lilac is my new go to color! I love the way it came out and how easy it was to apply. I&#x27;ve received so many compliments (From random people passing by me) on &amp;#34;how pretty your hair color is.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Great way to boost a girls confidence!!</li>
            <li> I received my hair color kit from Vidal Sassoon and absolutely loved it! It was very easy to use, the results exceeded my expectations. My hair looks beautiful with the new hair color and it feels smooth, and silky!</li>
            <li> LOVE this color so much! I get so many compliments and it&#x27;s not hard on my hair at all.</li>
            <li> This is the best color ever. When you first dye it, it&#x27;s this gorgeous black-violet color, then slowly fades to a very nice dark auburn (4+ weeks). BUT, if you ever get hit with sunlight, it positively shines! It just radiates this almost-neon burgundy. I get stopped every time I&#x27;m in public by people wondering what color my hair is. This is the ONLY color I have done more than 2 dyes worth, and I have been doing it for over a year. It is my forever color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT beware, it continues to wash out for a while. sorry, white sheets.</li>
            <li> disclaimer: was sent this item to try out for free from Bzzagent.  It is beautiful purple colour. It&#x27;s definitely difficult to find a long lasting purple hair dye without going to the salon. I used it on bleached ends (my natural hair colour is black), it turned into a beautiful purple colour. I&#x27;m not sure how this would work on black un bleached hair though. I would purchase this item in the future if i decide to redye my bleached ends.</li>
            <li> The London lilac and the midnight muse are both rich beautiful dyes. However you will not get what you are looking for if you do not do a strand test! Just because the recommended dyeing time is 25 minutes does NOT mean that 25 minutes is the right amount of time for YOUR hair! If your hair is very porous--if it has been processed a lot, for instance--it will suck up the dye like a sponge such that after 25 minutes your hair may look too dark. It might be that 15 minutes is the best amount of time for you. Conversely if your hair is very non-porous, 25 minutes may not be long enough, an your hair will come out too light. For me, when I apply the dye, I watch the dye on my hair process, and once it reaches the color I want, THEN I rinse it out! Since my hair is very porous, it was literally 15 minutes for me when I dyed my hair with the blue. But it gave me this gorgeous navy blue color. This is a good product. Just remember that you need to monitor the development of the dye based on your own hair porosity. Hence the strand test.</li>
            <li> Works well and very easy to use.  Product was exactly as I expected</li>
            <li> This color really lasts! It barely fades and I am really glad I got it</li>
            <li> I got to try this product out free thanks to Vidal Sassoon and this product is great! it coloured over my previous red color and made my hair feel silky and thick. I have washed it a few times and the color is staying in my hair very well. I have suggested this product to a lot of people already! It also didn&#x27;t dye my skin. I&#x27;m going to continue to use this product and I have gotten so many amazing compliments and the change.</li>
            <li> I was able to try out this product for free, via Vidal Sassoon and BzzAgent and I absolutely loved how simple it is to use, that it didn&#x27;t clump and that the Lilac colour sits well even over dark brown hair. Summer is the perfect time to make things brighter, and if you&#x27;re thinking about what brand and colour to go with, I&#x27;d recommend Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s London Lilac, which is one of its 9 colour selections from its London Luxe series.</li>
            <li> IMHO, Vidal Sassoon is still the best when it comes to certain hair products, like, say this hair color. I am originally ginger (red head/haired) and this color turned out to be perfectly lilac!! It compliments my very fair skin perfectly. I get lots of compliments! I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this color and the brand! I have been using it for a year now and still love it! I also love how inexpensive it was here on Amazon! I usually pay 10+ dollars when I walk in somewhere to buy it!</li>
            <li> i love this color! london liliac is my new favorite color, i have gotten tons of complements on it :-)</li>
            <li> absolutly in love with this product....the best in the market i tried the midnight blue mouse and it was amazing...it did not even smell as bad as other the consistency is perfect and i am in love with it</li>
            <li> Beatific color. I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> I got this from a Vidal Sassoon as a free sample to try and after using it I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using any other hair colour than this awesome one. There was no chemical smell during application, and the results came out very bold and just like the colour indicated on the packaging. I got a lot of compliments from friends and family on my new hair colour. It is better and more long lasting than even salon hair colour.</li>
            <li> I wanted to add a subtle change to my hair, I have medium-dark brown hair and applied the dye overtop of my original dark color. The color is definitely noticeable in high light and outdoors, but not so much indoors and has held up over numerous washings! Great color, would recommend!</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and used this kind of shade before with other brand. The result weren&#x27;t as flashy as i&#x27;d love, but it gave me nice shiny purple reflect all over, with a deep black/purple shade under it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, i love it, but the color matching on the back isn&#x27;t quite right for Dark brown hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend the product since the scent wasn&#x27;t invasive and the dye spot on skin were remove fairly easily!</li>
            <li> Great item.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Best purple hair color ever. For almost a year my stylist and I have been looking for a great shade of purple that holds in my blonde hair with highlights!&lt;br /&gt;I love it so much I ordered a case</li>
            <li> So my hair was way darker once died it, but after a week maybe, the color that I wanted truly showed. So I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re okay with your hair possibly being a dark purple almost black, before it turns the true color. I also have bleached, natural hair.</li>
            <li> I have had purple hair for a long time and tried most of what is out there, enduring the mess, the staining and the time spent under a dryer to set the color.  Then I found this-easy color in a box YAY!&lt;br /&gt;First time I applied it over my newly dyed dark blonde (with gray) hair. Ever since Manic Panic left me with purple ears I coat my neck, ears and the skin along my hairline with conditioner.  I used the applicator tip and a brush to first cover my hairline all around, my side part and crown.  Then I separated my hair into 3 layers and spread color on each one.  The dye was a pinkish color and had an ammonia smell to it and was warm on my scalp but the one bottle covered all of my thick, shoulder length hair. I waited about 35 mins, rinsed, rinsed, rinsed, conditioned and dried my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finished color was darker on top, almost back-purple with an ashy purple on the bottom third.  I&#x27;m OK with that because my hair does sometimes take color unevenly.After about 6 weeks I colored it again, leaving it on for 35 mins.  The color was even this time and looks rich.  I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of comments and compliments about it-all positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using a permanent color and I expect to need a touch up every 6-8 weeks, which is fine with me.  Great color, easy to use, not smelly,  I love it!</li>
            <li> I tried this product free thanks to Vidal Sassoon and BzzAgent! I love this colour! So bright and vibrant! I used it to put some bright lowlights in my strawberry blonde hair and I am so happy with it! Great consistency, colour that lasts!</li>
            <li> This color is fun. I have had so many compliments on it. Don&#x27;t worry about age, I&#x27;m 57, and it does look great on me. The box was a little dented when I received it, but everything was there and intact. It is a very nice shade without being neon.&lt;br /&gt;It came in plenty of time.</li>
            <li> This dye was SO easy to use, and it didn&#x27;t leave any mess anywhere. Not the towel, counter, my skin, nothing! In comparison to Manic Panic it was not as thick, so it did have the potential to drip, but the fact it didn&#x27;t leave the world bright purple means it was a way better experience. It also washed out really quickly and easily, which was a plus. Now we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts! #GotItFree</li>
            <li> I am not that big of a fan of Vidal Sassoon. But the color is nice and covered my white streak nicely though it is not the same shade as the rest of my hair I have/had med to dark brown hair and my end result is a dark purple  it looks nice in the sun. Not sure how long the color will last since this is the first time using it.  the dye did burn my scalp but I have not dyed my hair in about 4 years so it may have just been that or it maybe a bit harsh.</li>
            <li> Love how the color turned out the second time since it was more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I really like this color. Reminds me of red wine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually ordered the wrong color. I originally wanted the darkest violet, but accidentally ordered the London Lilac. Regardless, I kept the color and tried it out. I wanted a new look (my hair is black but I&#x27;ve been using a light brown dye). I love that my hair color is a darkish violet and then in the sunlight it really shines! My roots aren&#x27;t the same color as the rest of my locks, but regardless it&#x27;s a good color overall.</li>
            <li> This color is beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown hair with bleached tips and wanted to cover it up with something other than my old go-to, black hair dye, so I decided to give this a try. The color that came out is a deep, healthy looking purple-black, and my bleached tips are a more medium bright purple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been getting compliments asking who did my hair (me!) and where to buy this dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner that comes with this is also a god send since I flat iron my hair daily and it&#x27;s turned it silky soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Beautiful, deep purple that&#x27;s noticeable on darker hair colors&lt;br /&gt;-leaves hair silky smooth and shiny&lt;br /&gt;-maintains colors through washes&lt;br /&gt;-was easy to clean up off of my counters when I spilled it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None I can think of</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my hair color since I started using this! It turns my medium/mousy brown hair into a rich and stunning shade of purple. I need two boxes to do my head, medium thickness/medium length, so I&#x27;d recommend doubling up if your hair is past your shoulders.</li>
            <li> I love this! Have dyed my hair purple semi-regularly for many years. Always had to use semi-permanent brands like Manic Panic or Punky Colors, which wash out too quickly. They also are pain in that they stain towels and pillow cases every time your hair is damp. Was very excited to see an established brand of hair color that comes in funky colors, and most importantly is permanent! I bought it as soon as I saw it and applied it a few days ago. I always bleach my hair before applying the purple, because I want the purple to be very vibrant. It came out well. A few streaks, but that&#x27;s probably because I had some old henna-based dye lingering in my hair. (I had to attend a business training where purple hair is frowned upon. Boo!) The product was easy to apply. It didn&#x27;t stain the skin on my forehead, around my ears, or my neck. (Woo! No Vaseline required!) The conditioner that comes with it works well. Really pleased with the results. I hope that Vidal Sassoon continues to make these fun colors so that I never have to revert back to semi-permanent dyes again. If you have really thick hair, or lots of hair, definitely use two boxes to start. Then you can use one box at a time to touch up your roots thereafter!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tell when you&#x27;re inside, but outside, it&#x27;s really purple. Nothing like the box, but purple nonetheless. It&#x27;s been a few weeks and it&#x27;s faded into a reddish purple. still not a terrible color. :-)</li>
            <li> Did NOTHING...if your looking for a nice plum color, invest in Jerome Russell&#x27;s violet, SMELLS delicious and works for me...remember, when you buy a &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; dye, you NEVER get the same results from the picture on the box! Waste of my time and money! The only reason why I even gave it a 1 star was because the seller packaged it beautiful with a small lotion sample and a personal letter  saying &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So I got this product to try for free from BzzAgent.  I love the box, the design looked professional and the colour looked enticing. The instructions were clear and it was all easy to use. I have dark hair, so the colour barely got on my hair. It was low-odor, but the smell did bother me. I didn&#x27;t find anything special about this hair colour though. About a month later, I do notice that my gray is back at the front of my head, and I don&#x27;t even wash my hair that often.</li>
            <li> Loved the color and it really lasts! :)</li>
            <li> Best violet hair color from a box.</li>
            <li> Great color, but it fades like CRAZY. Every time I washed my hair, the water runs magenta. Vidal Sassoon claims that it&#x27;s permanent, but also says that it lasts up to 48 washes, so that doesn&#x27;t sound so \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; to me. If you want to really keep the color without it looking faded, you&#x27;ll need to dye every four weeks, which is way too often to be dying your hair.</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments on this hair color. Not truly purple, but still beautiful!</li>
            <li> The BEST!!! Pefect!!!&lt;br /&gt;The color is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;I have high expectation towards this product, and it turns out better than I have expected.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst hair color brands. I used it exactly according to directions (it says to leave it on for 30 min) and it completely damaged my hair leaving it dry and brittle. Then I applied the disgusting conditioner exactly according to directions (says to leave it on for a few minutes) and it left my hair greasy and sticky. It&#x27;s all basically just a bunch of junk loaded with gross chemicals.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have a well-known hair colour company produce some colourful shades.  The shade is a reddish purple, whereas I was looking for a blueish purple.  So I bought the 1bb Midnight Muse (blue) and made it about 30% blue and 70% Lilac and it is the shade I wanted.  A bit of a pain, but I&#x27;ll stick with it until something better comes along.&lt;br /&gt;Pros - close to &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34;, at least a lot closer than the Manic Panic that I was using before.  As easy to use as other regular hair colours.&lt;br /&gt;Cons - the colour still comes out a bit every time you wash your hair, and getson the towel, too (though it washes out in the laundry).  So you do end up with a lighter, and unfortunately redder, colour than you started out with after a few weeks.  I try to wash my hair less frequently to make the colour last.</li>
            <li> I will be going to a beauty school that does not like us box  coloring our hair but I can not afford to go to the salon at the moment and this is the closest I have gotten to a very professional looking color! It evened out my very light roots and dark box colored hair. I definitely recommend this for people who are looking for a cheap alternative!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product twice hoping for a better outcome,  unfortunately both times it turned to red within a week.</li>
            <li> Color is only *slightly* purple. Out of all four of my friends (and myself) who tried this, the result was the same -- looks like a really dark burgundy red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it&#x27;s definitely not the lighter purple as it appears on the box. If you want a more accurate representation of what the color will look like (at first), take a look at their Deep Velvet Violet. After washing it out of your hair, it comes out as a very dark purple-red. A wash or two later, it&#x27;s a nice burgundy red. So... Is it a good &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; purple? No. Not by a long shot. However, I&#x27;ve always had a hard time keeping red vibrant -- the burgundy that this color turns into stays vibrant for quite some time (same for my friends). Great burgundy red option, but I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have spent $ on this since the &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; (if there was any) didn&#x27;t last at all. Sally Beauty Supply has a couple new options for a permanent violet purple, FYI.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this hair color. I enjoy coloring my hair different shades. I&#x27;ve done a streak of bright red, magenta, blonde. I decided to do an all over purple color. I was hoping that if I left the color on for 45 minutes that I&#x27;d have a vibrant purple. Nope, turned out to be more of a black- purple. After a few weeks, it has faded to the shade I had originally wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the after-color conditioner. And the hair color didn&#x27;t have an unpleasant scent. But I probably won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Was okay. When I applied it, the color BARELY came out. No one could even tell I dyed my hair. Only slight shine in sunlight.</li>
            <li> I always wanted a more purple hair color but it always turns out more red and I was worried that this dye would be more of a red color but it wasn&#x27;t. I LOVE this color. It&#x27;s straight up purple and I see no red. It&#x27;s darker looking indoors but if any natural or artificial light gets on it you can definitely see the purple. I had bleached hair that had a blonde dye over it and even my natural medium to dark brown I had on the bottom half and in the very front turned purple as well.  I love this color!!</li>
            <li> I was a bit scared to use this colour at first, but couldn&#x27;t wait to use it once I received it through BzzAgent courtesy of Vidal Sassoon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few other purple hues from the line, so it made the leap into a more lilac hue a BIT easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hair (medium brown), it&#x27;s a nice glimmer of purple-reddish tinge - the colours changing depending on what light I&#x27;m in - not too off the wall that I can wear it at work (office job), but still feel a bit funky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application was easy and seamless.  I didn&#x27;t mind the smell, and the cream was so simple to use in my hair.  I usually leave dye on 30 minutes or so to ensure it has a chance to gain its deepest impact on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband can&#x27;t stop making me swish my hair - he loves the colours too!</li>
            <li> I was expecting this dye to be just okay. I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong!! The integrity of the colour is amazing. After recieving the Produc through a Bzzagent campaign for as a promotion for the Vidal Sassoon brand I was excited yet anxious to try. I mean box dye is terrifying to me and going from blonde to lilac I had expected it to be very dark and I would have to wait for it to lighten up over time. Instead the dye was very close to the colour on the box. It was a little dark at first but after styling and washing once the colour was LILAC! I usually used statement colours that I buy from the beauty supply store, but I think that after trying the London Luxe dye I will be sticking with it! The colour is bold, my hair is soft and hydrated and the colour you want is the colour you get. Awesome product, definitely will be using again!</li>
            <li> At first my hair turned out pretty.  but then it faded into red more than purple in just a week.</li>
            <li> Coverage isn&#x27;t the greatest. Has red tones it is as well. To get true color needs to be dyed a couple times. But i do like it.</li>
            <li> As my first time ever dying my hair; I was so pleased with the results that I got from Vidal Sassoon! The purple was bright and vibrant in my hair, and the process itself was a lot easier than I anticipated. They really tried to make the product smell good- to mask the typical scent of chemicals. I got tons of compliments on my hair. I highly reccommend it to anyone looking for a bright, bold new change!</li>
            <li> This color really lasts!!  I used this dye on bleached hair and the color really pops.  I can wash it normally and it still takes two months to fade appreciably.  And my hair does not hold dye well.  Besides, you cant beat the price!</li>
            <li> Lilac is a CRAZY purple not just a mild purple lol beware!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair at home for quite some time now. I have naturally dark brown (just about black) hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color came out amazing. It&#x27;s beautiful! It&#x27;s dark and reflects the purple in the sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color doesn&#x27;t smell too bad. It&#x27;s one of the better smelling hair colors that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is great and smells nice. They give enough to use once a week for 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONE problem with this dye is that it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. It says permanent on the box, however the color lasted maybe 13 days. I wash my hair every other day with an expensive, professional color protector shampoo and conditioner. I was severely disappointed when it started to fade and I realized that I need to dye my hair again for an event I have coming up in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the same dye on my hair again last night and I am afraid I have ruined my hair by dying it so soon again. I would have used a different color, except this event is pretty important and I need my hair to not look 8 different colors. So, I know the dye will fade again and I will look about silly for the remainder weeks until I can dye again (with a different brand!). So, If you are looking for something that washes out in 2 weeks, this is the hair color for you!</li>
            <li> Ok so the color is really nice it says its suppose last 40 something washes but honestly i&#x27;ve washed my hair like 10 times so far and its really faded so it sucks :( , didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations</li>
            <li> I have been using &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; dyes since 1978. This one is a winner. I can&#x27;t even tell you how many compliments I get DAILY on this haircolor! It took a few months to actually become the Lilac as pictured, but with only touch-ups now it is vibrant and shiny.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews stating that the color didn&#x27;t turn out as the box shows, but give it a while. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this color on my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Ravens fan so purple is my fav color. This product covers completely, doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, and gives me a really nice color of purple that I always get compliments for</li>
            <li> I got this product free for testing and review purposes. I must say I&#x27;ve never purchased this brand before and am kicking myself for not trying it sooner! The colour is very nice and bold and so easy to apply and only takes 25 minutes and I don&#x27;t have to leave my house for a salon look!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way the color turned out. I was a bit worried due to the fact real my hair is kinda messed up from chemo and other meds. But it took perfectly and looks awesome. I would have put 5 stars except it was supposed to be 2 day delivery and it actually ended up being about a week. I was a little disappointed in that bit otherwise I&#x27;m love it and will definitely use their products again.</li>
            <li> My hair color looks so cool OMG!!! it shows in the light ^_^</li>
            <li> I have used London lilac, midnight muse, and runway red all with excellent results. That being said, if you want extremely blue or purple, you&#x27;d be better off bleaching your hair first, especially if you have dark Brown hair.</li>
            <li> I used this over my previously dyed (bright( red hair and about an inch of regrowth (mousy brown with 20% grey). The result I got was a deep, almost black purple. Like a dark grape. It was a bit of an adjustment for me to get used to since I was a much lighter/brighter color for a long while. The first two or three days I had some staining to the scalp and I had a more goth look than I probably would like at my age. But, with a week or so, as the color slowly washed out, it became a striking but oddly enough still &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shade of purple. I don&#x27;t know why this is labeled lilac, because it doesn&#x27;t look remotely lilac, especially on the box. Lilac is more of a light pastel purple. However, since the box shows more of a plum shade, I was pleasantly surprised when this had more of a deep grapey color on me. The lighter I got, the more compliments I received. For myself, it looked best around day 30. I&#x27;m about 60 days in and it still looks pretty good. This is probably because I&#x27;ve been dying my hair of over 25 years and all the processing causes it to suck in color easily. I will be ordering this color again and probably trying at least one of the other VS purple shades.</li>
            <li> Faded out of my hair to fast.it was really pretty wthe first couple of days but kept washing out and was lighter after a week.</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find color in local stores.  The gorgeous color is vivid; nice compliments from people on the street.</li>
            <li> I bought the London Lilac because I was looking for a more subtle purple, not a neon teenage punk purple. However, I was not convinced by looking at the box and reading reviews that it would come out a true purple by putting it on my natural brown hair. So I decided to bleach my hair first.&lt;br /&gt;After bleaching, I applied the hair color and was surprised that there was BARELY enough dye to cover my long bob length hair (and I have an undercut on one side, which equals even less hair.) So I would definitely recommend buying two boxes of dye.&lt;br /&gt;The color came out a slightly purple, mostly wine color. I noticed that especially on the ends of my hair where the bleach didn&#x27;t lighten as much, it is definitely more of a red color, and not purple.&lt;br /&gt;The color didn&#x27;t get on my pillow case, towels, or fingers like many of the \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; colored dyes I&#x27;ve used, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review once I find out how long it last before fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like the color, but it&#x27;s NOT purple.</li>
            <li> It did last a long time, however the color turned into red within a few days.</li>
            <li> I left the dye in my hair for a 1 and 10 minutes since i have dark hair but after i washed it out i checked the results and it made my hair turn a black color and i got like a few strings of a purple color then my third time washing my hair was Saturday and the color still bleeds out therefore i will not be using this anymore</li>
            <li> I loved this color. I dyed my hair in June 2014 and it was the dark blackish purple with a red tint in the sun. and now it&#x27;s still red. It didn&#x27;t wash out for more than 2 washes like most red colors. but if you want to achieve a red color without dyeing your hair evey 4 weeks then this is a good choice. In the beginning it is purplish but when it fades, it goes to a really nice shade of red. I haven&#x27;t dyed my hair in 8 months and it still looks nice. Especially with the 5 inches of natural roots that grew in. For some reason roots is a style now, but it looks cute.</li>
            <li> Leaves more of a tint on dyed black/brown hair. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> i got this for a great price with a coupon and i have been looking for it everywhere; however the color did not come out how i imagined it would. i have been dying my hair for about 15 years and have done every color of the rainbow. this color came out burgandy, i was hoping for it to be more purple-ish.</li>
            <li> I used it on my dark brown hair and it&#x27;s been perfect- not too bright, but you can definitely tell it has a purple tint. A very dark purple, and more purple than red. By far the best purple dye I&#x27;ve used- all too often they fade right out to red or aren&#x27;t even really purple enough to begin with, but this one&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> The color turns out awful even with light brown hair, it looks black</li>
            <li> Fabulous Color. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it! Usually sold out when I look for it elsewhere. It fades kind of fast, but that is true with all vibrant colors. I got a FABULOUS deal too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this hair dye.  I have used many different boxed dyes in the past that said they were supposed to be plum or purple shades, and just ended up with varying red hues.  This has been the first dye out of countless brands and boxes that ended up being a true purple colour.  Though the colour is red based, the purple shows nicely and I love how it completely transformed my summer ombre.  I will definitely be purchasing this colour again once this fades to keep the purple vibrant for months to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the fact that my hair didn&#x27;t feel coarse or dry, but instead looked SUPER glossy after dying, was definitely a plus in my books!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it lost one star is because after the first couple of washes, I did notice a lot of the purple seemed to be fading and my hair was taking on more of a darker red colour as the plum was washing out.  This means that if you want the colour to stay exactly like what it looks like after initial application, I would say that you&#x27;d have to re-dye every two to three weeks depending on how often you wash your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included is a before and after picture so you can see for yourself!</li>
            <li> Obsessed. It comes out super vibrant even on dark hair (mine is close to black, a lot like the darkest on the scale on the box). In darker light it looks like a deep purple red but in the sun it is a very vibrant violet color- Not quite red and not quite purple. I originally wanted to go even more purple than this, but I am so in love with this color, I don&#x27;t plan on changing any time soon. It&#x27;s subtle but at the same time loud and different. Love it so much!</li>
