            <li>The scent is wonderful!!!</li>
            <li>One of the best hair product I&#x27;ve had in a while!!!</li>
            <li>I bought this cream three days ago, and I am really impressed.</li>
            <li>It smells good and doesnt make my hair crunchy!</li>
            <li>The pump is great, too - no need to shake an aerosol or squeeze a tube.</li>
            <li>Not so great with my curly/wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I use the EverCurl shampoo and conditioner as well as the Hydracharge leave-in cream and they are great.  </li>
            <li>The one pro for this product is that it smells great.</li>
            <li>Love!!</li>
            <li>But if I use this and some John Freida hairspray, I am good to go.</li>
            <li>This is really good stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great at combating the frizz and my hair is in awesome large ringlets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the EverCreme line before and liked it, and since the price was good</li>
            <li>so I love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE that they did that!  </li>
            <li>I love this cream gel!  </li>
            <li>and it gives your curly hair a nice shine and definition.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice, but when I applied it to my hair it felt sticky and drying.</li>
            <li>It smells kind of tropical to me.</li>
            <li>Takes the frizz out, adds a nice feel too.  </li>
            <li>When I use a blow dryer, I can also get nice waves with it, too.</li>
            <li>and it smell really nice too.</li>
            <li>Perfect compromise to avoid using mousse - Look very natural</li>
            <li>This is the best products for my hair, my hair is well moisturized, soft, and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my naturally curly hair; it defines my curls and minimizes frizz without making it crunchy.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of very fine, curly hair</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Evercurl mousse for a while (and love it), so I decided to give this gel a try.</li>
            <li>Love the Evercurl line.  </li>
            <li>and it looks so much better and more manageable</li>
            <li>Really do love the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>And the ladies love the smell of it...</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>but I did love the hold and</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting this if you want more hold for your curls without that crunchy feeling.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t probably re buy unless I crave more hold.</li>
            <li>Love this product for my curly hair that is permed.  </li>
            <li>Favorite curl cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and I really love how my hair feels and looks.  </li>
            <li>Hoping for better results.</li>
            <li>While it has helped better than others it still didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>the top will easily break</li>
            <li>Look better, feel better, add some confidence, be comfortable, form that dome with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair that is combination curly, wavy.</li>
            <li>but if you have thicker hair it would probably work fine</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, but I only need one pump of product.</li>
            <li>Keeps the curls locked and somewhat frizz free.</li>
            <li>it it really defined my curls giving them a nice hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shampoo/Conditioner/this product are labled as sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I have a curly perm and this is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used to keep the curls defined and to tame frizz.  </li>
            <li>I have really baby fine curls that love to frizz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a restrictive hold like you would get with tons of gel or hair spray, but I liked this combo better than the mousse I used before and find the hold is enough for me.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is no longer available locally, so I was so happy that Amazon has it</li>
            <li>That being said, it gives great volume and I even wake up the next day with curls/waves that are ready to go!  </li>
            <li>I love the whole hair care line,  </li>
            <li>Nice soft curls.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and love the EverCurl Conditioning Cleanser</li>
            <li>It smells great, and while it is very sticky, it actually helps with the braiding and curling process.</li>
            <li>so they got frizzy really quickly.  </li>
            <li>So far I am using Tresemme Flawless Curls Hydration Lotion Cream (about a golf ball size globe) on soaking wet hair, then I wring out the excess water in my hair, pat with a towel, and then apply 2-3 quarter size dollops of L&#x27;Oreal Evercurl Sculpt &amp; Hold Cream-Gel.</li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t make hair sticky or weighed down.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry out, controls frizz nicely.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thin and curly, so this product is the best combo between a mousse and a hair gel.</li>
            <li>Thats right.</li>
            <li>Not only does it do a great job of giving my fine curls body, but it also has a decent amount of hold to last throughout the day.</li>
            <li>do fine that it works really well on really wet/drenched hair.  </li>
            <li>A great replacement for the higher priced versions that do essentially the same thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different gels, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>This stuff works great on my thick wavy hair - actually makes my curls more ringlet-like.  </li>
            <li>During my attempt at fixing the pump, the entire top popped off, sending cream/gel stuff flying everywhere...</li>
            <li>One day I love it next not so much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for several years, tried other things, but always come back to this as it is the best for my hair.  </li>
            <li>the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that it&#x27;s got a strong fragrance</li>
            <li>Smells nice, feels nice, my hair is not so fluffy anymore after using this (still a little bit).</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t leave your hands or sides of your face that are touched by the hair sticky after drying (i.e. if humid or rainy), and holds reasonably well.</li>
            <li>since I discovered this whole product line.  </li>
            <li>and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like the sticky feeling of my hair</li>
            <li>and i really like all the EverCurl products except this one.  </li>
            <li>I use the whole line of L&#x27;Oreal products for curly hair.  </li>
            <li>but it works really well</li>
            <li>It really makes a world of a difference, holy grail product for me.</li>
            <li>When trying to shape/scrunch my hair, the stickiness of my hands would  cause the hair to pull away from my head causing a look similar to the hair in the light</li>
            <li>it straight</li>
            <li>and this was too much for mine</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to it working.</li>
            <li>Works very well with blow-dryer.</li>
            <li>I used it on my wet 3B curly hair and it made it soft but also kind of made it feel sticky.</li>
            <li>Good product for thick curly hair</li>
            <li>I live in the northeast and this keeps my hair very curly and moisturized!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong hold with wind and long hair, although what hair product would.</li>
            <li>The curl maintained its shape and it does seem to protect from frizz if enough is applied, but overall I think there are products available at the same level of quality for a better price.</li>
            <li>Its little tacky I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>Better lock down the Ms.</li>
            <li>I like the soft texture it gives my hair, and I don&#x27;t need to worry as much about using too much since it softens curls,</li>
            <li>so I will not be repurchasing this product only because I go through it too quickly</li>
            <li>It even works on high humidity days</li>
            <li>I expect that this is highly dependent on your hair type and the desired effect.</li>
            <li>This is a good curl defining gel, just be modest with the amount you use because it can leave the hair feeling sticky and crunchy, and looking wet even when its dry.  </li>
            <li>If I put on any more, then my hair looks oily and heavy.</li>
            <li>I bought this on sale at CVS for $6; the normal price there is $9.50.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair crunchy and doesn&#x27;t stop the frizz as well as normal gel.</li>
            <li>My hair is over 4in long, wavy to curly, and i&#x27;m able to make one of these bottles last about 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I bought this about a week ago and its a pretty decent leave in for curly hair especially if you like a little more hold but don&#x27;t want crunchy curls.</li>
            <li>Also, I only use cleansing conditioner and it takes this right out in the shower.</li>
            <li>It will help tame the more unruly curls, without making your hair look like it was sprayed.  </li>
            <li>I have long, blonde, fine, VERY curly natural hair and this product did not work at all for me.</li>
            <li>I have very naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>My curls are soft and manageable and any frizz (I live in a humid area) is well under control.</li>
            <li>HUGE MESS</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that complain that the product is super sticky on your hands, and it is a bit sticky, but it washes off.</li>
            <li>and it dries still soft with no feeling of a weighted product and controls my curls.</li>
            <li>I have recently started using to keep hair combed straight</li>
            <li>Although, I still hold out hope that it won&#x27;t completely strike for another 3-4 years.</li>
            <li>Buying on line is convenient and since my hair came back from chemo really curly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a product to help with the natural curl and frizz.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this product, but I would not recommend it for those who have really thick, curly hair as I don&#x27;t think it would have enough hold for them.</li>
            <li>I do like the more expensive brands, but shelling out that kind of cash all the time is hard to do.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s prone to frizz (especially in the humid climate that I live in...), and therefore need to put some sort of product in my hair each day to make it behave.</li>
            <li>After I gently towel dry  my hair  </li>
            <li>I have really thick hair which doesn&#x27;t really hold curls, so I&#x27;ve been using gel to french braid my hair overnight, then scrunching it with mousse in the morning, which typically creates nice waves.</li>
            <li>I have very, very curly, thick hair, and I live in south Louisiana</li>
            <li>how pretty my hair looked when it eventually dried.</li>
            <li>No different from Garnier Fructis or any other household cheap brand - did not significantly or otherwise insignificantly revitalize my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got long curly hair, mid back, and this product does the magic, it keeps my curls under control without making them stiff or heavy.</li>

            <li> and this was too much for mine</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to it working.</li>
            <li> Works very well with blow-dryer.</li>
            <li> I used it on my wet 3B curly hair and it made it soft but also kind of made it feel sticky.</li>
            <li> Good product for thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I live in the northeast and this keeps my hair very curly and moisturized!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong hold with wind and long hair, although what hair product would.</li>
            <li> The curl maintained its shape and it does seem to protect from frizz if enough is applied, but overall I think there are products available at the same level of quality for a better price.</li>
            <li> Its little tacky I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> Better lock down the Ms.</li>
            <li> I like the soft texture it gives my hair, and I don&#x27;t need to worry as much about using too much since it softens curls,</li>
            <li> so I will not be repurchasing this product only because I go through it too quickly</li>
            <li> It even works on high humidity days</li>
            <li> I expect that this is highly dependent on your hair type and the desired effect.</li>
            <li> This is a good curl defining gel, just be modest with the amount you use because it can leave the hair feeling sticky and crunchy, and looking wet even when its dry.  </li>
            <li> If I put on any more, then my hair looks oily and heavy.</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale at CVS for $6; the normal price there is $9.50.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair crunchy and doesn&#x27;t stop the frizz as well as normal gel.</li>
            <li> My hair is over 4in long, wavy to curly, and i&#x27;m able to make one of these bottles last about 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a week ago and its a pretty decent leave in for curly hair especially if you like a little more hold but don&#x27;t want crunchy curls.</li>
            <li> Also, I only use cleansing conditioner and it takes this right out in the shower.</li>
            <li> It will help tame the more unruly curls, without making your hair look like it was sprayed.  </li>
            <li> I have long, blonde, fine, VERY curly natural hair and this product did not work at all for me.</li>
            <li> I have very naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> My curls are soft and manageable and any frizz (I live in a humid area) is well under control.</li>
            <li> HUGE MESS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that complain that the product is super sticky on your hands, and it is a bit sticky, but it washes off.</li>
            <li> and it dries still soft with no feeling of a weighted product and controls my curls.</li>
            <li> I have recently started using to keep hair combed straight</li>
            <li> Although, I still hold out hope that it won&#x27;t completely strike for another 3-4 years.</li>
            <li> Buying on line is convenient and since my hair came back from chemo really curly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a product to help with the natural curl and frizz.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with this product, but I would not recommend it for those who have really thick, curly hair as I don&#x27;t think it would have enough hold for them.</li>
            <li> I do like the more expensive brands, but shelling out that kind of cash all the time is hard to do.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s prone to frizz (especially in the humid climate that I live in...), and therefore need to put some sort of product in my hair each day to make it behave.</li>
            <li> After I gently towel dry  my hair  </li>
            <li> I have really thick hair which doesn&#x27;t really hold curls, so I&#x27;ve been using gel to french braid my hair overnight, then scrunching it with mousse in the morning, which typically creates nice waves.</li>
            <li> I have very, very curly, thick hair, and I live in south Louisiana</li>
            <li> how pretty my hair looked when it eventually dried.</li>
            <li> No different from Garnier Fructis or any other household cheap brand - did not significantly or otherwise insignificantly revitalize my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got long curly hair, mid back, and this product does the magic, it keeps my curls under control without making them stiff or heavy.</li>
            <li> Heavy gels and creams are great for keeping my hair from flying off my head in all directions; unfortunately, they also weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> I will say that I do still get a slight bit of frizz on a few of my top layers later on in the day, so when my hair is dry I spritz it with a satin hold hairspray to keep the little strands in check.</li>
            <li> Just gel products make my red, curly, coarse hair very dry and crunchy, L&#x27;Oreal added cream....</li>
            <li> Three hours later I have soft, touchable curls that are NOT weighed down!</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair, and the gel/cream combo does a great job of keeping my hair tame with minimal frizz without leaving my hair stiff like a lot of other gel does.</li>
            <li> Also, this lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I also have to be careful not to put this on the underside of my hair as I end up with a total rats nest underneath with the combo of the stickier hair rubbing against my shirt all day.  </li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry then put on diffuser on hair dryer and go finish.  </li>
            <li> like that it keeps my hair curly when I air dry and it doent dry it out.</li>
            <li> I do see a difference whether I leave my hair to air dry (curly)</li>
            <li> or I blow dry</li>
            <li> Adds control and shape without dry texture to my  color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only down size is that there isn&#x27;t a lot of product</li>
            <li> The downside of this product is that it is sticky putting on and only managed my hair for half a day.</li>
            <li> I use it with wet hair</li>
            <li> Just add a tiny amount in the palm of your hand, rub hands together and then scrunch into your towel dried hair after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> I use this product on my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this like it says after shampoo and conditioner while hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> It was ok...but created a strange texture in my hair and weighed it down.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and they always leave my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> when dry my hair feels a little crunchy</li>
            <li> This left my curls dull and flat, maybe it was just too heavy of a gel/cream.</li>
            <li> This gel does not do anything for my hair other than weigh it down and make it look oily.</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky, so a little goes a long way; my hair goes to mid-back and I use 3 pumps.  </li>
            <li> Usually, the way I use this is that I&#x27;ll spread this all through my hair after washing it, and let it air dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about 1/3 of the bottle and will throw the rest away as it is not worth the mess it leaves on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Hey any product that can manage my hair even if it was for half the day...</li>
            <li> My hair is long thick and curly.</li>
            <li> but when i run my fingers a little through my hair the crunchyness dissapears</li>
            <li> I put about 2-3 quarter size dollops into my hair, and it still does not weigh my curls down!</li>
            <li> Not sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> used on damp hair I could see some curl, but as it dried my hair took to Houston Humidity like a dinosaur capsule you put in the tub that grows 4X</li>
            <li> My hair absorbs moisture like crazy but it goes limp and lifeless if I moisturize too much.</li>
            <li> Does not leave your hair stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> I keep going back to it because it works and is not overly expensive (like deva curl or oidad)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this in a moment of desperation because they were out of the gel I usually use (Herbal Essence Set Me Up).</li>
            <li> It makes my hair stiff and hard to get even fingers through.</li>
            <li> I am a curl fanatic that has tried everything from Moroccanoil, John Frieda, Nexxus, Paul Mitchell, Cury Girl, and Bumble &amp; Bumble.</li>
            <li> I have curly thick hair.</li>
            <li> As the day went on my hair slowly became frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have thin, type 2C swavy/curly hair</li>
            <li> The bottle pump was broken when the package arrived.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> Its difficult to find hair products that can manage unruly curls but this defined my curls.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this cream gel every day, but when the weather is humid, or my hair is just having a bad day, this product comes to the rescue.  </li>
            <li> My hair started to fall out because of my mother&#x27;s horrible balding genes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair, and the gel/cream combo does a great job of keeping my hair tame with minimal frizz without leaving my hair stiff like a lot of other gel does. It even works on high humidity days so I love it!</li>
            <li> Perfect compromise to avoid using mousse - Look very natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed. This gel does not do anything for my hair other than weigh it down and make it look oily. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I played around with this product for a bit before I could make it work for me. I have a lot of very fine, curly hair that&#x27;s prone to frizz (especially in the humid climate that I live in...), and therefore need to put some sort of product in my hair each day to make it behave. This stuff is great, but I only need one pump of product. If I put on any more, then my hair looks oily and heavy. But if I use this and some John Freida hairspray, I am good to go.</li>
            <li> This works wonderfully! I use it with wet hair everytime I wash it and it dries still soft with no feeling of a weighted product and controls my curls. Love!!</li>
            <li> I have a curly perm and this is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used to keep the curls defined and to tame frizz.  Unfortunately, it is no longer available locally, so I was so happy that Amazon has it and the price is excellent.  Just add a tiny amount in the palm of your hand, rub hands together and then scrunch into your towel dried hair after shampooing.  It doesn&#x27;t add stiffness if you use it on damp hair and it gives your curly hair a nice shine and definition.  I&#x27;ve used this for several years, tried other things, but always come back to this as it is the best for my hair.  Also, this lasts for a long time.  The last container I had just ran out after over a year of using on my shampooed hair two to three times a week.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I live in the northeast and this keeps my hair very curly and moisturized!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Evercurl mousse for a while (and love it), so I decided to give this gel a try. I have really thick hair which doesn&#x27;t really hold curls, so I&#x27;ve been using gel to french braid my hair overnight, then scrunching it with mousse in the morning, which typically creates nice waves. I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different gels, but this is my favorite. It smells great, and while it is very sticky, it actually helps with the braiding and curling process. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale at CVS for $6; the normal price there is $9.50. I&#x27;ve used the EverCreme line before and liked it, and since the price was good I thought I would give this a try. I have very, very curly, thick hair, and I live in south Louisiana so humidity/frizz is an issue. After trying, I don&#x27;t think I will be buying this again. The scent is nice, but when I applied it to my hair it felt sticky and drying. The curl maintained its shape and it does seem to protect from frizz if enough is applied, but overall I think there are products available at the same level of quality for a better price.</li>
            <li> Used to use Pantene, but this gel/creme combo won me over. I like the soft texture it gives my hair, and I don&#x27;t need to worry as much about using too much since it softens curls, doesn&#x27;t leave your hands or sides of your face that are touched by the hair sticky after drying (i.e. if humid or rainy), and holds reasonably well. It&#x27;s not a restrictive hold like you would get with tons of gel or hair spray, but I liked this combo better than the mousse I used before and find the hold is enough for me. The pump is great, too - no need to shake an aerosol or squeeze a tube.</li>
            <li> Love the Evercurl line.  I have very naturally curly hair and it looks so much better and more manageable since I discovered this whole product line.  Works great and doesn&#x27;t make hair sticky or weighed down.  Really do love the product.</li>
            <li> I works so well for curly hair! It smells good and doesnt make my hair crunchy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It makes my hair crunchy and doesn&#x27;t stop the frizz as well as normal gel.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this.  One day I love it next not so much.  I have recently started using to keep hair combed straight and it works very well.  Not so great with my curly/wavy hair.  Will continue with product until finished to decide if I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best products for my hair, my hair is well moisturized, soft, and bouncy.  I love the whole hair care line,  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! My hair started to fall out because of my mother&#x27;s horrible balding genes. Although, I still hold out hope that it won&#x27;t completely strike for another 3-4 years. Better lock down the Ms. My hair is over 4in long, wavy to curly, and i&#x27;m able to make one of these bottles last about 2-3 weeks. The gel starts out a bit shiny but when it dries out, all it takes is a running of the fingers through your hair and the shine is gone. However, the form remains. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong hold with wind and long hair, although what hair product would. Get this stuff. Make it happen, today! Look better, feel better, add some confidence, be comfortable, form that dome with this stuff. And the ladies love the smell of it... Thats right. I&#x27;m a man.</li>
            <li> All of the L&#x27;Oreal products work well for me. Buying on line is convenient and since my hair came back from chemo really curly I have discovered that these hair products do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone with hair</li>
            <li> I use this product on my wet hair.  After I gently towel dry  my hair  I comb then use.  I let my hair air dry then put on diffuser on hair dryer and go finish.  That way not crunchy.  That I do not like.  Love this product.  Only use this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a week ago and its a pretty decent leave in for curly hair especially if you like a little more hold but don&#x27;t want crunchy curls. I like the fact that it&#x27;s a cream and a gel so it adds softness and hold. The smell is wonderful. It smells kind of tropical to me. I used it on my wet 3B curly hair and it made it soft but also kind of made it feel sticky. I really didn&#x27;t like the sticky feeling of my hair but I did love the hold and how pretty my hair looked when it eventually dried. I would recommend getting this if you want more hold for your curls without that crunchy feeling. I won&#x27;t probably re buy unless I crave more hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got long curly hair, mid back, and this product does the magic, it keeps my curls under control without making them stiff or heavy.</li>
            <li> Not sticky or heavy. Does not dry out, controls frizz nicely.  The cream is the best part!  Just gel products make my red, curly, coarse hair very dry and crunchy, L&#x27;Oreal added cream....LOVE that they did that!  Takes the frizz out, adds a nice feel too.  And kudos to Amazon..it&#x27;s like $3-4 cheaper than going anywhere else!</li>
            <li> Good product for thick curly hair</li>
            <li> No different from Garnier Fructis or any other household cheap brand - did not significantly or otherwise insignificantly revitalize my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, feels nice, my hair is not so fluffy anymore after using this (still a little bit). the hold is medium for my type of hair (3b/c). when dry my hair feels a little crunchy but when i run my fingers a little through my hair the crunchyness dissapears</li>
            <li> Keeps the curls locked and somewhat frizz free. I use this on says that I&#x27;m in a hurry to get out of the house. Also, I only use cleansing conditioner and it takes this right out in the shower. No residue.</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff. Not only does it do a great job of giving my fine curls body, but it also has a decent amount of hold to last throughout the day. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my curly hair that is permed.  Nice soft curls.</li>
            <li> Works well with my wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I love this cream gel!  I have tried other brands and they always leave my hair greasy. Evercurl holds my curls well with no frizz.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair and i really like all the EverCurl products except this one.  It makes my hair stiff and hard to get even fingers through. It feels like I have a paste on my hair.  I&#x27;ve used about 1/3 of the bottle and will throw the rest away as it is not worth the mess it leaves on my hair.  I use the EverCurl shampoo and conditioner as well as the Hydracharge leave-in cream and they are great.  My curls are soft and manageable and any frizz (I live in a humid area) is well under control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this curl gel on and off for about a year. I keep going back to it because it works and is not overly expensive (like deva curl or oidad)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it keeps my hair curly when I air dry and it doent dry it out. When I use a blow dryer, I can also get nice waves with it, too.</li>
            <li> I have curly thick hair. Its difficult to find hair products that can manage unruly curls but this defined my curls. Smelled great! The downside of this product is that it is sticky putting on and only managed my hair for half a day. As the day went on my hair slowly became frizzy. Hey any product that can manage my hair even if it was for half the day...I call it a win!</li>
            <li> I use the whole line of L&#x27;Oreal products for curly hair.  I don&#x27;t use this cream gel every day, but when the weather is humid, or my hair is just having a bad day, this product comes to the rescue.  It will help tame the more unruly curls, without making your hair look like it was sprayed.  Well done.</li>
            <li> This is a good curl defining gel, just be modest with the amount you use because it can leave the hair feeling sticky and crunchy, and looking wet even when its dry.  I have thin, type 2C swavy/curly hair it it really defined my curls giving them a nice hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do fine that it works really well on really wet/drenched hair.  I rake it through my hair after having divided my hair into sections, scrunching after raking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down size is that there isn&#x27;t a lot of product 5.0 oz so I will not be repurchasing this product only because I go through it too quickly but it works really well and it smell really nice too.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great on my thick wavy hair - actually makes my curls more ringlet-like.  It is a little sticky, so a little goes a long way; my hair goes to mid-back and I use 3 pumps.  I also have to be careful not to put this on the underside of my hair as I end up with a total rats nest underneath with the combo of the stickier hair rubbing against my shirt all day.  That being said, it gives great volume and I even wake up the next day with curls/waves that are ready to go!  A great replacement for the higher priced versions that do essentially the same thing.</li>
            <li> I did not get to use/try the product.  The bottle pump was broken when the package arrived. During my attempt at fixing the pump, the entire top popped off, sending cream/gel stuff flying everywhere... it smelled good&#x3D;1 star. I could have scooped what was left of the stuff out of the bottle... I elected to trash it because it appeared the pump was needed to mix the cream/gel stuff together upon dispensing, prior to applying to hair.... HUGE MESS</li>
            <li> My hair is long thick and curly. I&#x27;ve been looking for a product to help with the natural curl and frizz.  I found everything I want in this product.  It&#x27;s great at combating the frizz and my hair is in awesome large ringlets. I paired it with the leave in conditioner from the same line.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.  Does the job well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my naturally curly hair; it defines my curls and minimizes frizz without making it crunchy. Usually, the way I use this is that I&#x27;ll spread this all through my hair after washing it, and let it air dry (diffusing works too). It really makes a world of a difference, holy grail product for me.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness this stuff smells fantastic!(as do the shampoo and conditioner)&lt;br /&gt;That said, I would not otherwise recommend the hold cream. Personally, I think it&#x27;s too sticky. When trying to shape/scrunch my hair, the stickiness of my hands would  cause the hair to pull away from my head causing a look similar to the hair in the light socket.&lt;br /&gt;When used on damp hair I could see some curl, but as it dried my hair took to Houston Humidity like a dinosaur capsule you put in the tub that grows 4X it&#x27;s size. You all know what I&#x27;m talking about...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo/Conditioner/this product are labled as sulfate free.</li>
            <li> one of my go to products</li>
            <li> I use this like it says after shampoo and conditioner while hair is still wet. I do see a difference whether I leave my hair to air dry (curly) or I blow dry it straight it tames the frizz. I would purchase it again. Does not leave your hair stiff or sticky. The scent is wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> Same as I was used to</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I&#x27;ve found that works well on my hair. I expect that this is highly dependent on your hair type and the desired effect. I was looking for something that would condition my hair while enhancing the curl without making my hair crunchy. I have a lot of fine hair that is combination curly, wavy. I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that complain that the product is super sticky on your hands, and it is a bit sticky, but it washes off.</li>
            <li> I have fairly coarse curly hair and this did not hold the curl well.</li>
            <li> Favorite curl cream I&#x27;ve tried. My hair is somewhere between wavy and curly, with lots of frizz. This cream helps define the curls and control the frizz, without being too crunchy.</li>
            <li> Its little tacky I have very fine hair and this was too much for mine but if you have thicker hair it would probably work fine</li>
            <li> I have long, blonde, fine, VERY curly natural hair and this product did not work at all for me. I bought this in a moment of desperation because they were out of the gel I usually use (Herbal Essence Set Me Up). There simply was not enough hold to keep my curls defined so they got frizzy really quickly.  Maybe it would work for another hair type, but I tried it two days and ended up giving the rest away. The one pro for this product is that it smells great.</li>
            <li> My daughter gave me some of this and I really love how my hair feels and looks.  I bought 2 extra for my daughter.</li>
            <li> This left my curls dull and flat, maybe it was just too heavy of a gel/cream. I was really looking forward to it working. I&#x27;m going to try the spray oil next. Hoping for better results.</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of products to keep my curls under control without frizz. While it has helped better than others it still didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> No white after-effects. Works very well with blow-dryer.</li>
            <li> I used it according to the instructions on the container, and it did not work.  I would not reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair product I&#x27;ve had in a while!!! My hair is thin and curly, so this product is the best combo between a mousse and a hair gel. Keeps the hair in place and helps with making curls. Plus, prevents any frizz</li>
            <li> I have really baby fine curls that love to frizz. My hair absorbs moisture like crazy but it goes limp and lifeless if I moisturize too much. Heavy gels and creams are great for keeping my hair from flying off my head in all directions; unfortunately, they also weigh my hair down and I lose all my curls!! I bought this cream three days ago, and I am really impressed. I put about 2-3 quarter size dollops into my hair, and it still does not weigh my curls down! I am a curl fanatic that has tried everything from Moroccanoil, John Frieda, Nexxus, Paul Mitchell, Cury Girl, and Bumble &amp; Bumble. I do like the more expensive brands, but shelling out that kind of cash all the time is hard to do. Therefore, I have gone on a shopping spree to find affordable drugstore products that will work with my hair. So far I am using Tresemme Flawless Curls Hydration Lotion Cream (about a golf ball size globe) on soaking wet hair, then I wring out the excess water in my hair, pat with a towel, and then apply 2-3 quarter size dollops of L&#x27;Oreal Evercurl Sculpt &amp; Hold Cream-Gel. Finally, I scrunch, scrunch, scrunch!!! Presto! Three hours later I have soft, touchable curls that are NOT weighed down! I will say that I do still get a slight bit of frizz on a few of my top layers later on in the day, so when my hair is dry I spritz it with a satin hold hairspray to keep the little strands in check. Overall, I am very pleased with this product, but I would not recommend it for those who have really thick, curly hair as I don&#x27;t think it would have enough hold for them.</li>
            <li> the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that it&#x27;s got a strong fragrance and it aggravates my asthma</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and love the EverCurl Conditioning Cleanser so wanted to try this.  It was ok...but created a strange texture in my hair and weighed it down.  My go-to is any leave in conditioner + Loreal Melting Gel.</li>
            <li> If you have thicker hair you will need more than it says but I think it works just as well as the expensive Aveda stuff I was buying...only note don&#x27;t let it fall off your bathroom counter the top will easily break</li>
            <li> Adds control and shape without dry texture to my  color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again in the future and will recommend it to my friends.</li>
