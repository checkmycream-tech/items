            <li>I love these lip paints!</li>
            <li>Nice colors...would have given a Five Star, if it had a precision tip applicator to eliminate the need for a lip liner, making this formula easier to apply.</li>
            <li>It goes on glossy and pretty and even after a couple hours it turns more matte, but still looks great!</li>
            <li>Love the colors and the texture is nice and creamy.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and they have amazing color pay off.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use !</li>

            <li>My daughter was looking forward to the free earrings ,didn&#x27;t receive them</li>
            <li>i was hesitant to buy these because it is cheap make up</li>
            <li>plastic applicator on these is cheap looking and feeling on my lips.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!</li>
            <li>but the gloss is Amazing &amp; highly recommended üòç</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend too much on</li>
            <li>I am glad I ran across it though, very affordable.</li>
            <li>The only one that did not look good with my skin color was the orange tinted one.</li>
            <li>Its really no need to mix with any other colors because the colors are perfect on their own.</li>
            <li>Love these new colors!</li>
            <li>Super pigmented</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>but overall I love the colors!</li>
            <li>There is no disappointment here.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really control where it was going and it quickly turned into a disaster.</li>
            <li>Also the items came in a reusable pink bag that has come in handy.</li>
            <li>colors matched exactly like shown above.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very pigmented !</li>
            <li>Love the different colors!</li>
            <li>Products arrived in a timely manner and are just as great, if not better than described!</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it so much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them :) I&#x27;m going to buy different colors now haha</li>
            <li>Go on easy with a brush and really do have a bit of lasting power.</li>
            <li>a little messy to apply but great color.. wears off but use a lip liner you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and not too glossy.</li>
            <li>I really like the pigmentation on some.</li>
            <li>very comparable</li>
            <li>very pigmented,great price.</li>
            <li>Colors are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The others not so much.</li>
            <li>love this so much i ended up ordering other colors from them too.</li>
            <li>They have a very strong minty scent and because of that they have a little cooling effect on the lips.</li>
            <li>not only was it super watery to put on</li>
            <li>Love the colors just wish it lasted a little longer.  </li>
            <li>If you live life then prepare to reapply often.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear lipstick at all but told my self to start trying new things and the purples rock.</li>
            <li>:) All round, I would rate this purchase 8.75 out of 10!</li>
            <li>They last longer than my MAC does and the colors are really pretty.</li>
            <li>Colors are so rich and last on ur lip for a long time!</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is they move too much that is because they are lip paint.  </li>
            <li>very hydrated, doesnt dry out my lip at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased these and a few more of the other colors.</li>
            <li>long lasting and vibrant color!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m medium to dark skin tone and colors really compliment me.</li>
            <li>But these colors are exactly what you get and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>However, with the good there is always bad</li>

            <li> I purchased these and a few more of the other colors.</li>
            <li> long lasting and vibrant color!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m medium to dark skin tone and colors really compliment me.</li>
            <li> But these colors are exactly what you get and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> However, with the good there is always bad</li>
            <li> It was a complete mess as there wasn&#x27;t anything there to catch the extra that I squeezed out besides my lips and my face.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t last long wearing.</li>
            <li> I hate the plastic applicators makes it hard to apply the product is amazing just use a clean finger or brush to apply</li>
            <li> They are very thin and comfortable (non sticky) but they don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It lasts really long as well.</li>
            <li> That is the only downfall other then</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out lips.</li>
            <li> They do not dry down and just stay wet-sticky!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as pigmented as I&#x27;d expected and they smell/taste like melted crayons.</li>
            <li> then I expected</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s kind of annoying</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A little goes a long way with these colors.&lt;br /&gt;-Wonderful</li>
            <li> I like to combine them with some other lipstick I have already</li>
            <li> con&#x27;s r&lt;br /&gt;Application can be messy due to applicator(easily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit of a trick sometimes to blend it out evenly</li>
            <li> It was a bit weird for it was like the colour settled to the bottom for the clear liquid</li>
            <li> Not great lasting power</li>
            <li> You will need a brush to apply them because the applicator is not precise.</li>
            <li> I would have gave 5 stars but they are a little hard to apply.</li>
            <li> At first was slightly disappointed with the brown one.</li>
            <li> usually I&#x27;d buy some and they&#x27;d be a faded color on my lips than what the tube looks like.</li>
            <li> are on something crazy or they&#x27;ve never actually tried a Melted.</li>
            <li> Consistency seems a bit thin and potentially messy</li>
            <li> They tingle a little but nothing to bad.</li>
            <li> I had to rub it off and could still faintly smell it.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it went in the garbage</li>
            <li> I tried applying these with my finger, with a brush and just from the tube - I hate these!</li>

            <li> My daughter was looking forward to the free earrings ,didn&#x27;t receive them but the gloss is Amazing &amp; highly recommended üòç</li>
            <li> The pigment is unreal. They tingle a little but nothing to bad. I would have gave 5 stars but they are a little hard to apply. use a lip brush.</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading so many 5-star reviews. I did swatches of all the colors I received and these colors are so obnoxious looking! I tried mixing colors to get something that wouldn&#x27;t be so theatrical and clown looking. I tried applying these with my finger, with a brush and just from the tube - I hate these! When applied (whether by finger, brush or from the tube) they are so pasty-gooey and yet look grainy or like they&#x27;re separating on the mouth. They do not dry down and just stay wet-sticky!</li>
            <li> I hate the plastic applicators makes it hard to apply the product is amazing just use a clean finger or brush to apply</li>
            <li> i was hesitant to buy these because it is cheap make up but the reviews were really good. i got it for that vampy burgundy color. not only was it super watery to put on but i couldnt get an even coating. i tried 3 different kinds of lip brushes and no luck. never again.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase! I recieved exactly what I ordered within a few days! The lip colors are amazing!!!!!!!! Very pigmented and not too glossy. Its really no need to mix with any other colors because the colors are perfect on their own. Also the items came in a reusable pink bag that has come in handy. This is my 1st purchase from this seller. So far so good. Will def purchase through them again.</li>
            <li> I love these lip glosses. long lasting and vibrant color!</li>
            <li> Awesome fast shipper beautiful colors. Love love love it:)</li>
            <li> Consistency seems a bit thin and potentially messy</li>
            <li> like it . recomended!!</li>
            <li> Ew.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the only word needed to describe this lip glaze. I purchased one after reading rave reviews about how they compared to Too Faced Melted lipsticks, but at a fraction of the cost. This is definitely one of those instances where you get what you paid for.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic applicator on these is cheap looking and feeling on my lips. It was a complete mess as there wasn&#x27;t anything there to catch the extra that I squeezed out besides my lips and my face. I couldn&#x27;t really control where it was going and it quickly turned into a disaster. I looked like a clown.&lt;br /&gt;It also had a funky smell to it like plastic. I had to rub it off and could still faintly smell it. Needless to say, it went in the garbage and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend too much on it.&lt;br /&gt;Those who say these are a dupe for TF Melted are on something crazy or they&#x27;ve never actually tried a Melted. They may look similar in packaging, but that&#x27;s where the similarities end.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as pigmented as I&#x27;d expected and they smell/taste like melted crayons.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-A little goes a long way with these colors.&lt;br /&gt;-Wonderful minty feels on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to glide on when using a brush.&lt;br /&gt;-The colors matched exactly like shown above.&lt;br /&gt;-Surprisingly very hydrated, doesnt dry out my lip at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- best to use a lip brush to put these on (it will give you a more precise line)&lt;br /&gt;- have to blot off some of the colors or else it will stay sticky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price of $16 for all 6tubes i definitely recommend this over the Too Faced Melted which are $19-20 per tube!</li>
            <li> I love it although I found them brighter then I expected</li>
            <li> I love it! Super pigmented</li>
            <li> Nice colors...would have given a Five Star, if it had a precision tip applicator to eliminate the need for a lip liner, making this formula easier to apply.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty but they don&#x27;t last long wearing.</li>
            <li> LOVE i so so love this. love this so much i ended up ordering other colors from them too. i recommend this to any lipstick fanse. it goes on great and more you apply thicker color gets. The mint flavor is a added bonus. these i bought for the fall so i cannot wait to use them daily.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping! I love these lippies!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the LA Girl line and couldn&#x27;t wait to try these! They didn&#x27;t disappoint! Smooth application, great pigment, non-drying! The ONLY thing I&#x27;d change is the applicator, a doe foot would be easier. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I really really love the colors and how pigmented these are as well as the fact they aren&#x27;t sticky.  However, I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars because they don&#x27;t set at all.  Not great lasting power</li>
            <li> This product is good. I really like the pigmentation on some. Most were well pigmented and looked great on the lips. At first was slightly disappointed with the brown one. It was a bit weird for it was like the colour settled to the bottom for the clear liquid came out on top however after a while of leaving it alone it came out well! However, with the good there is always bad so honestly that&#x27;s fine with me. As with respect to the shipping, my product arrived quite swiftly and I was very very happy with that. :) All round, I would rate this purchase 8.75 out of 10!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this ! The colors come and great and it&#x27;s easy to use !</li>
            <li> Very pigmented ! If you cant afford Lip tars by OCC this would be you choice. very comparable</li>
            <li> Products arrived in a timely manner and are just as great, if not better than described!</li>
            <li> Great Great colors, my one issue is the slight smell it gives off, then that smell is right under your nose.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this! I like lipstick but I rather lip gloss and this is the perfect combination. It lasts really long as well. It goes on glossy and pretty and even after a couple hours it turns more matte, but still looks great! I would definitely recommend anyone try it and the price is also GREAT! I&#x27;m medium to dark skin tone and colors really compliment me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy I bought these and gave them a chance, I&#x27;ve never had lip gloss to show up this well. usually I&#x27;d buy some and they&#x27;d be a faded color on my lips than what the tube looks like. But these colors are exactly what you get and a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s a little bit of a trick sometimes to blend it out evenly but overall I love the colors! The tan color and the darker ones are my favorites. I like to combine them with some other lipstick I have already and it looks even better! But the colors by themselves look wonderful too. I highly recommend them :) I&#x27;m going to buy different colors now haha</li>
            <li> The pigments come up vibrant and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Colors are so rich and last on ur lip for a long time! I get compliments when I wear these! So addicting I have to have all the colors!</li>
            <li> Great set for fall! Love these new colors!</li>
            <li> a little messy to apply but great color.. wears off but use a lip liner you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the LA Girls lip paints. Go on easy with a brush and really do have a bit of lasting power.</li>
            <li> Love the different colors!</li>
            <li> It came well packaged. Colors are pigmented.</li>
            <li> Love them....very pigmented,great price. Came within time range. Moisturizing  etc...&lt;br /&gt;Only con&#x27;s r&lt;br /&gt;Application can be messy due to applicator(easily remedy this by using lip brush  n liner)&lt;br /&gt;And the color &amp;#34;Tease&#x27; has glitter in it that&#x27;s kind of annoying but the color is one of my faves!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat of a lip junkie...color payoff is great but for some reason they&#x27;re not my faves... Will continue to work with them and see if I&#x27;m just being hasty.  Had them for a month or two now...</li>
            <li> Very good products.&lt;br /&gt;Thx</li>
            <li> Love the colors and the texture is nice and creamy.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and they have amazing color pay off. anazing color select I.have 12 out of the 18 shades.</li>
            <li> I like the colors they are beautiful. However, it does run a lot. That is the only downfall other then that it is good</li>
            <li> Colors are very pigmented. Doesn&#x27;t dry out lips. I wear it all the time. Great value for your money</li>
            <li> OMG I love these! Will be buying more colors!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever put on my lips. It doesn&#x27;t stain &amp; it stays on alllllllll day. I love it, I love it, I love it. I could go on about it all day. It&#x27;s just that great. I recommend everyone to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Love them...THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best shiny lipstick I ever had. This need more than 5 stars</li>
            <li> These colours are great. Made review of them here http://youtu.be/LwFbgtsVI1E.</li>
            <li> I love these lip paints! Love the colors just wish it lasted a little longer.  If you&#x27;re not going to eat or drink then perfect.  If you live life then prepare to reapply often.</li>
            <li> Very nice pigmented lipsticks. You will need a brush to apply them because the applicator is not precise. They have a very strong minty scent and because of that they have a little cooling effect on the lips. They are very thin and comfortable (non sticky) but they don&#x27;t last very long. I like them.</li>
            <li> I wish I could order alllll of the color lines....I love every one.</li>
            <li> Love the purple colors for my complexion. The others not so much. I am glad I ran across it though, very affordable. I don&#x27;t wear lipstick at all but told my self to start trying new things and the purples rock.</li>
            <li> I love the lip glazed.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is they move too much that is because they are lip paint.  Overall, I love it so much</li>
            <li> I love, love, love these lipsticks. They last longer than my MAC does and the colors are really pretty. The only one that did not look good with my skin color was the orange tinted one. I purchased these and a few more of the other colors. There is no disappointment here. If they come out with more colors, I will purchase those as well.</li>
