            <li>love the herbal liquorice and chamomile taste of the PM more than anything.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have been a fan for many years and glad I can still find this on amazon</li>
            <li>I guess I should have known better than to argue...</li>

            <li>confident if you want to purchase and easy flip top.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t see a huge improvement with the whiteness of my teeth but the taste and feeling is enough and perfect to start and end your day &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t any better than most toothpaste, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, Crest whitening works just as good and much cheaper.</li>

            <li>Such a great product.</li>
            <li>Lovely minty fresh taste.</li>
            <li>Before I tried it I thought it was just some kind of overpriced, fancy-schmancy, tooth polish that probably wouldn&#x27;t do much more than standard Crest.</li>
            <li>Both flavors leave your mouth tasting and smelling fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>They have more fluoride than most toothpastes, and leave my breath still feeling fairly fresh when I wake up the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using Go Smile toothpaste will give you pearly whites with a fresh clean taste.</li>
            <li>and I still feel somewhat fresh after it&#x27;s been awhile.</li>
            <li>I have used this product and others from Go Smile</li>
            <li>I use the Go Smile system</li>

            <li>Nothing comes close to Go Smile.</li>
            <li>And she had me buy it again a few months later, so I imagine it works great because she is picky!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste makes my teeth feel smooth and clean, like I just left the dentist!</li>
            <li>When I first started using this product, I used the whitening kit as well.  </li>
            <li>May have to see how it goes after several more weeks.</li>
            <li>and I actually look forward to it most of the time now.</li>
            <li>Good cleaning but not sure teeth are any whiter.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for people who don&#x27;t want a super minty toothpaste who have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li>the PM one is .... very herbal.</li>
            <li>and taste somewhat different than a cheap colgate.&lt;br /&gt;$30?</li>
            <li>: Price is a bit much</li>
            <li>I like having a morning and evening toothpaste--they are very different--the morning</li>
            <li>one really perks you up</li>
            <li>IT MAKES MY TEETH FEEL CLEANER THAN TOOTHPASTE WITH BLEACH AND ITS MUCH GENTLER ON THE INSIDE OF MY MOUTH.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I have been using for one year. The whitening is noticeable and results are measurable.</li>
            <li> All the product in this line are awesome- I just love the toothpaste. I figured I&#x27;d mention, being that I didn&#x27;t care myself, that my husband dislikes the taste in these flavored kinds. The AM on is similar to eating a lemon head candy and the PM one is .... very herbal. If you&#x27;ve smelt Bath &amp; Body works herbal relaxing lotions, it is a lot like having that put in your mouth. I love it personally- it&#x27;s refreshing and nice to have a change from normal toothpaste. I haven&#x27;t ever noticed the taste lingering and I still feel somewhat fresh after it&#x27;s been awhile. Just food for thought.</li>
            <li> I love the taste and feel of my teeth when using this!!! A little goes a long way and they are very ample tubes!</li>
            <li> i bought 2, one for my girlfriend, the other for her sister.&lt;br /&gt;smell and taste somewhat different than a cheap colgate.&lt;br /&gt;$30? i mean, come on man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as useless as this thing is, it is still much more useful than the GF2 Lumix Camera i bought for her.&lt;br /&gt;say No to GF2</li>
            <li> I recommend this product very highly. I have used this product and others from Go Smile and they are excellent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for over a year now, and it is by far the best in taste and whitening. When I first started using this product, I used the whitening kit as well.  Now I just upkeep with the toothpaste.  I always get complements on how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Toothpaste for over 2 month keep my teeth white &amp; feels Fresh /clean I love it</li>
            <li> This toothpaste makes my teeth feel smooth and clean, like I just left the dentist! I&#x27;m not sure about the whitening, but that&#x27;s because my teeth really have no stains or discoloration. So, maybe they&#x27;ll stay that way :) Yes, I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I use the Go Smile system so thought I&#x27;d try the toothpaste. I like the taste of both, but after a couple weeks, can&#x27;t say how effective it is. However my whitening with the GS system seems to last extremely well between touchups.</li>
            <li> Just as good as before.</li>
            <li> good stuff love the flavor</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste discovered at a spa trade show and have been using it ever since!!!&lt;br /&gt;feel confident if you want to purchase and easy flip top.</li>
            <li> Pros: Tastes great (natural, almost citrusy), eliminates my sensitivity (much better than sensodyne)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Price is a bit much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a few friends try my toothpaste and they love it too :)  I recommend this for people who don&#x27;t want a super minty toothpaste who have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I like having a morning and evening toothpaste--they are very different--the morning one really perks you up</li>
            <li> This ombination hs helped me to maintain my teet father having them cleaned the dentist.  I am now planning to order the more e pensive whitening duo from Go Smile. Then I will agin flow it with the AM PM duo.</li>
            <li> And she had me buy it again a few months later, so I imagine it works great because she is picky!</li>
            <li> I hate mint toothpaste. I also like fluoride. I feel a little bad about being the sort of person who will buy two tubes of toothpaste that cost this much, but this is honestly my favorite toothpaste ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the herbal liquorice and chamomile taste of the PM more than anything. The AM is bright, slightly lemony, and pleasant. They have more fluoride than most toothpastes, and leave my breath still feeling fairly fresh when I wake up the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even feel a need for mouthwash with these. This is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve found to date.</li>
            <li> I purchase this item monthly. The Am &amp; Pm flavors are perfect. As I have always been a fan of Go Smile ampules. The toothpaste is absolutely amazing. Both flavors leave your mouth tasting and smelling fresh &amp; clean. Using Go Smile toothpaste will give you pearly whites with a fresh clean taste. I even carry the small sizes in my purse. Nothing comes close to Go Smile.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT. IT MAKES MY TEETH FEEL CLEANER THAN TOOTHPASTE WITH BLEACH AND ITS MUCH GENTLER ON THE INSIDE OF MY MOUTH. IT ALSO WHITENED THEM CONSIDERABLY. I WILLPURCHASE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste. I don&#x27;t breakout from it and it does help keep my teeth white along with regular whiting routine.</li>
            <li> Definitely is a very good toothpaste. Good cleaning but not sure teeth are any whiter. May have to see how it goes after several more weeks. No problems with the taste of either am or pm. Will revise this review after extended use.&lt;br /&gt;As always Amazon was A-1 on their service and delivery of this order.</li>
            <li> Regardless how many different toothpastes I try, I always end up going back to Go Smile because they are the only ones that actually make and keep my teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> Love it. Such a great product. I have been a fan for many years and glad I can still find this on amazon</li>
            <li> My beautiful Bride turned me on to this stuff. Before I tried it I thought it was just some kind of overpriced, fancy-schmancy, tooth polish that probably wouldn&#x27;t do much more than standard Crest. Needless to say she was right, and I was wrong. I guess I should have known better than to argue... like Dirty Harry said &amp;#34;a man should know his limitations&amp;#34; (white pearlys of wisdom). I&#x27;m still learning mine I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after 2 weeks this stuff is already working. AND... it makes your breathe kissing-fresh (wink, wink, nudge, nudge). Your lips (or your mates lips) will thank you.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t any better than most toothpaste, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, Crest whitening works just as good and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Lovely minty fresh taste. Makes brushing teeth more enjoyable and I actually look forward to it most of the time now. Can&#x27;t see a huge improvement with the whiteness of my teeth but the taste and feeling is enough and perfect to start and end your day &#x3D;)</li>
