            <li>So happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This is a great mascara -- from the applicator to the color to the waterproof aspect.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for a great product</li>
            <li>The brush itself is fairly perfect for not leaving clumps, but sometimes it&#x27;s nice to have that spare utensil (with no mascara on it) to aid the process.</li>
            <li>Great purchase.</li>
            <li>, I really love this Mascara, no clumping at all!!</li>
            <li>Not sticky,  not clunky,  its really good for me because I cry in theater &amp; my actin classes lol...</li>

            <li>The mascara was really good</li>
            <li>Good product &amp; trusted brand.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t bring myself to complain about too much of a good product though.</li>
            <li>I was always commenting on my friends lashes and how gorgeous they were.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I saw the good price</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>They are delighted with the quality.</li>
            <li>it looks great, but it can clump very easily.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and stunned that this works so well.</li>
            <li>She was very pleased that I bought it for her.</li>
            <li>this mascara wouldn&#x27;t use anything else, and love the shape of the brush!</li>
            <li>Look exactly as the photo and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I have to order more of it!</li>
            <li>amazing.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t realize how amazing until i bought a couple of mascaras that sucked.</li>
            <li>This mascara was effective in lengthening and defining (not thickening).</li>
            <li>It works like a nice thickening, lengthening mascara but is also waterproof.  </li>
            <li>I am so thrilled I found this and don&#x27;t have to spend a ton of money.</li>
            <li>It does not clump and does a nice job of separating the lashes.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product.</li>
            <li>The company has changed the brush to an unwieldy flexible one that juggles too much to be effective.  </li>
            <li>I liked the price but this mascara clumps from the start.</li>
            <li>Very bold and gorgeous look.  </li>
            <li>For the most part tho I would say it makes your lashes look nice</li>
            <li>Has a nice brush that grabs and coats all the lashes easily.  </li>
            <li>I get the look i want in 2 layers where with others i have had to more.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t used to this type of brush it will take awhile for you to master, but overall great product!</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>My all time favorite mascara</li>
            <li>favorite mascara which I buy in a bundle form</li>
            <li>With this one, I won&#x27;t for sure.</li>
            <li>This mascara has become my favorite after trying it about a year ago.</li>
            <li>I love Maybelline but for some reason, waterproof mascara never sits well with me.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This Define-A-Lash is comparable to a Loreal mascara I used for many, many years, but was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have so many tubes of mascara I&#x27;ve used one time and set aside.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>Been using for years and have a found anything else better.</li>
            <li>She will love it</li>
            <li>Not my favorite but would repurchasre on sale.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sooooooo in love with this.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I find that it works best if you put on several layers waiting about a minute between each layer.</li>
            <li>so I was thrilled when I found it here (and with free shipping).</li>
            <li>However, it seriously is gorgeous, and totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>this mascara is an outstanding product and should never been taken off the shelves of all the stores I shop</li>
            <li>I love this mascara</li>
            <li>It goes on good not clumpy and leaves my eyelashes looking so pretty.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new mascara that is waterproof and DOES NOT SMUDGE, I bought this because the price was great and had to start trying something.</li>
            <li>ITS REALLY GOOD MAKES YOUR LASHES HUGE AND CAME VERY FAST</li>
            <li>Applies easily to lashes.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove and doesnt bother my eyes.</li>
            <li>this mascare stays on all day and washes off so easy.</li>
            <li>But I think that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>thank u so much!! :)</li>
            <li>i choose this rating because i think it a fantastic product</li>
            <li>does a fantastic job for volumizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and does not clump.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to put in an order for more right now and keep a supply....</li>
            <li>WITH a lash brush or clean toothbrush for quick smoothing or light detangling.  </li>
            <li>She really likes this mascara, goes on good and stays on all day till your ready to take it off.</li>
            <li>It is a good product especially for the price.</li>
            <li>But other than that its a great mascara</li>
            <li>I wish I could find this in stores, but luckily can still find online.</li>
            <li>I got mine from this vendor so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Again, I have long lashes now, but they&#x27;re fair.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this in other stores, so I knew it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>The brush separates my lashes nicely and the mascara is completely, utterly waterproof.  </li>
            <li>It does everything it said and does it well, twenty dollar, fifteen dollar mascara and the four dollar one wins....</li>
            <li>I love this mascara because first of all, its definitely waterproof, second of all, it&#x27;s very cheap and most of all it doesn&#x27;t clamp my eye lashes whenever I put it on.</li>
            <li>The color is great too, very black is indeed that.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that after using my first one for a couple of days, I went back and ordered 3 more mascaras.</li>
            <li>I use this for volume, and their lengthening right after for longer looking lases.</li>
            <li>If you can apply this right</li>
            <li>Very very waterproof.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to remove, but does a great job of staying on in the pool.</li>
            <li>this is one of the first mascaras i ever purchased.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s exactly what it does, including</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really waterproof!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Yes, love it for the fact that its definitely waterproof but too waterproof.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for in a waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>was moderately priced, easy to apply long lasting and by far one of the best mascara&#x27;s i have used in the 45 years&lt;br /&gt;I have been using mascara.</li>
            <li>The one I previously owned went up in price so did some research and came across this one, saw it had decent reviews and a good price and went for it.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day it&#x27;s still fresh and new looking.</li>
            <li>My previous mascara was washable which I liked about it</li>
            <li>I have trouble taking it off even with my amazing eye makeup remover cream, so it never fully comes off</li>
            <li>I did some research and discovered a site where they had tested waterproof makeup and this product did very well.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, even with my eye shadow by the end of the day, my eye shadow is all in my crease.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It holds the curl very well, the whole day.</li>
            <li>i would really recommend it to anyone who wants waterproof mascara</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll stay throughout the whole day &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The reason being, this stuff is so waterproof that it dries FAST.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a dry formula which is perfect for thin lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first mascara I&#x27;ve used in years that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes at all.  </li>
            <li>It makes my lashes longer and slightly fuller which is always a plus, and it&#x27;s waterproof which is even better for someone like myself with watery eyes.</li>
            <li>I have always hopped around from mascara to mascara and have never had a specific but have FINALLY found one I love.  </li>
            <li>This particular container is clumpy.</li>
            <li>same positive experience i have been fortunate enough to experience.</li>
            <li>My lashes look full and long after 2 applications.</li>
            <li>Forward--I&#x27;ve now got my lashes really healthy and long, but until recently, had forgotten about this mascara.  </li>
            <li>it allows for a seamless stroke without clumping, and the lashes go on long and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have to hunt and waste money looking for a new favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is the only mascara that I use and it is definitely waterproof with the added benefit of washing off easily with soap.  </li>
            <li>Smelled too strong of chemicals, wasn&#x27;t the best but not the worst.</li>
            <li>New ans unused product.</li>
            <li>so I had to buy new one.</li>
            <li>This takes waterproof to a new level.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving it 2 stars because yes it looks nice on and is definitely water proof, but it&#x27;s the most uncomfortable mascara I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
            <li>May clump a little bit on the tip of the brush after long term use, but overall quality is still good.</li>
            <li>More waterproof than my previous mascara, but still not waterproof enough.  </li>
            <li>I love this Mascara really really hard to remove tho</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really water proof and makes my short eyelashes thicker and longer look.</li>
            <li>My old mascara was getting old</li>
            <li>It makes me angry that Maybelline would change a good thing.  </li>
            <li>i use on false eye lashes as well as my own.</li>
            <li>The applicator helps lengthen and separate your lashes and it is a true black color.</li>
            <li>I finally found this particular one and used it for a while then couldn&#x27;t find it in the store anymore.  </li>
            <li>If I need something I can depend on not coming back off I will use this again but in the meantime I&#x27;ll stick with my normal mascara.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes off easily with olive oil, so dont worry about having a hard time taking it</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not the same as having an entirely new tube, brush and all.  </li>
            <li>And there was no indication on the new package that anything was different, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it.  </li>
            <li>So pretty for anyone with a mid to long lash.  </li>
            <li>the very black makes my eyelashes look full.</li>
            <li>So since the mascara package was opened there is no other way to know if it was used or not.</li>
            <li>I guess I will have to order the red tube online now, which is a shame because you never know how old the package is.  </li>
            <li>I mean I have very, very oily skin!!</li>
            <li>For the first few applications out of the tube, I do need to remove some excess mascara from the wand before applying.  </li>
            <li>It really is waterproof, I need mac&#x27;s cleanse off oil to remove it and it defines my lashes without weighing them down.  </li>
            <li>I took the old brush and used it in the new green tube.  </li>
            <li>I try other new mascaras but nothing like this one</li>
            <li>It also came in earlier than what I expected which is in 2 days when it clearly says it&#x27;ll come within 3-5 days.</li>

            <li> this mascara is an outstanding product and should never been taken off the shelves of all the stores I shop</li>
            <li> I love this mascara</li>
            <li> It goes on good not clumpy and leaves my eyelashes looking so pretty.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new mascara that is waterproof and DOES NOT SMUDGE, I bought this because the price was great and had to start trying something.</li>
            <li> ITS REALLY GOOD MAKES YOUR LASHES HUGE AND CAME VERY FAST</li>
            <li> Applies easily to lashes.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove and doesnt bother my eyes.</li>
            <li> this mascare stays on all day and washes off so easy.</li>
            <li> But I think that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> thank u so much!! :)</li>
            <li> i choose this rating because i think it a fantastic product</li>
            <li> does a fantastic job for volumizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and does not clump.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to put in an order for more right now and keep a supply....</li>
            <li> WITH a lash brush or clean toothbrush for quick smoothing or light detangling.  </li>
            <li> She really likes this mascara, goes on good and stays on all day till your ready to take it off.</li>
            <li> It is a good product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> But other than that its a great mascara</li>
            <li> I wish I could find this in stores, but luckily can still find online.</li>
            <li> I got mine from this vendor so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Again, I have long lashes now, but they&#x27;re fair.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in other stores, so I knew it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> The brush separates my lashes nicely and the mascara is completely, utterly waterproof.  </li>
            <li> It does everything it said and does it well, twenty dollar, fifteen dollar mascara and the four dollar one wins....</li>
            <li> I love this mascara because first of all, its definitely waterproof, second of all, it&#x27;s very cheap and most of all it doesn&#x27;t clamp my eye lashes whenever I put it on.</li>
            <li> The color is great too, very black is indeed that.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that after using my first one for a couple of days, I went back and ordered 3 more mascaras.</li>
            <li> I use this for volume, and their lengthening right after for longer looking lases.</li>
            <li> If you can apply this right</li>
            <li> Very very waterproof.</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to remove, but does a great job of staying on in the pool.</li>
            <li> this is one of the first mascaras i ever purchased.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s exactly what it does, including</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really waterproof!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Yes, love it for the fact that its definitely waterproof but too waterproof.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for in a waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> was moderately priced, easy to apply long lasting and by far one of the best mascara&#x27;s i have used in the 45 years&lt;br /&gt;I have been using mascara.</li>
            <li> The one I previously owned went up in price so did some research and came across this one, saw it had decent reviews and a good price and went for it.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day it&#x27;s still fresh and new looking.</li>
            <li> My previous mascara was washable which I liked about it</li>
            <li> I have trouble taking it off even with my amazing eye makeup remover cream, so it never fully comes off</li>
            <li> I did some research and discovered a site where they had tested waterproof makeup and this product did very well.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, even with my eye shadow by the end of the day, my eye shadow is all in my crease.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It holds the curl very well, the whole day.</li>
            <li> i would really recommend it to anyone who wants waterproof mascara</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll stay throughout the whole day &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The reason being, this stuff is so waterproof that it dries FAST.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a dry formula which is perfect for thin lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first mascara I&#x27;ve used in years that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes at all.  </li>
            <li> It makes my lashes longer and slightly fuller which is always a plus, and it&#x27;s waterproof which is even better for someone like myself with watery eyes.</li>
            <li> I have always hopped around from mascara to mascara and have never had a specific but have FINALLY found one I love.  </li>
            <li> This particular container is clumpy.</li>
            <li> same positive experience i have been fortunate enough to experience.</li>
            <li> My lashes look full and long after 2 applications.</li>
            <li> Forward--I&#x27;ve now got my lashes really healthy and long, but until recently, had forgotten about this mascara.  </li>
            <li> it allows for a seamless stroke without clumping, and the lashes go on long and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have to hunt and waste money looking for a new favorite.  </li>
            <li> This is the only mascara that I use and it is definitely waterproof with the added benefit of washing off easily with soap.  </li>
            <li> Smelled too strong of chemicals, wasn&#x27;t the best but not the worst.</li>
            <li> New ans unused product.</li>
            <li> so I had to buy new one.</li>
            <li> This takes waterproof to a new level.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it 2 stars because yes it looks nice on and is definitely water proof, but it&#x27;s the most uncomfortable mascara I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
            <li> May clump a little bit on the tip of the brush after long term use, but overall quality is still good.</li>
            <li> More waterproof than my previous mascara, but still not waterproof enough.  </li>
            <li> I love this Mascara really really hard to remove tho</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really water proof and makes my short eyelashes thicker and longer look.</li>
            <li> My old mascara was getting old</li>
            <li> It makes me angry that Maybelline would change a good thing.  </li>
            <li> i use on false eye lashes as well as my own.</li>
            <li> The applicator helps lengthen and separate your lashes and it is a true black color.</li>
            <li> I finally found this particular one and used it for a while then couldn&#x27;t find it in the store anymore.  </li>
            <li> If I need something I can depend on not coming back off I will use this again but in the meantime I&#x27;ll stick with my normal mascara.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes off easily with olive oil, so dont worry about having a hard time taking it</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not the same as having an entirely new tube, brush and all.  </li>
            <li> And there was no indication on the new package that anything was different, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it.  </li>
            <li> So pretty for anyone with a mid to long lash.  </li>
            <li> the very black makes my eyelashes look full.</li>
            <li> So since the mascara package was opened there is no other way to know if it was used or not.</li>
            <li> I guess I will have to order the red tube online now, which is a shame because you never know how old the package is.  </li>
            <li> I mean I have very, very oily skin!!</li>
            <li> For the first few applications out of the tube, I do need to remove some excess mascara from the wand before applying.  </li>
            <li> It really is waterproof, I need mac&#x27;s cleanse off oil to remove it and it defines my lashes without weighing them down.  </li>
            <li> I took the old brush and used it in the new green tube.  </li>
            <li> I try other new mascaras but nothing like this one</li>
            <li> It also came in earlier than what I expected which is in 2 days when it clearly says it&#x27;ll come within 3-5 days.</li>
            <li> so I little disappointed this isn&#x27;t as easy to wash off, but nonetheless I still enjoy this.</li>
            <li> The new tube is green.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid that Maybelline is going to discontinue this product because every time I love a product, it gets taken away.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this tube is no longer available in the stores.</li>
            <li> I am desperately trying to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump or bend my eyelashes forward, since the one I used for years was discontinued many ions ago.  </li>
            <li> It also arrived earlier than expected date of delivery.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes long</li>
            <li> Its almost like its just been sitting around for a long time.</li>
            <li> The only con I can report is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long, about 2 months for me, daily wear, before slowly drying up.</li>
            <li> I have typical short thin and straight Asian lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long wear, minimal flaking even after 12 hours.</li>
            <li> Clumpy from the first application.. when I got the clumps out, it was thick and sticky.. made my eye lashes actually look shorter than they were because I couldn&#x27;t curl them well with this thick goop on them.  </li>
            <li> This stays on all day, hits my little lashes on the inside and outside (the brush is wider at the ends) and does not smudge!</li>
            <li> and i would consider it on other people.</li>
            <li> It does not run or smudge at all, unlike other &amp;#34;warerproof&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Tried other brands already.</li>
            <li> This product gets my highest rating but it won&#x27;t be around for long so buy a few while you can.</li>
            <li> Makes my very thin and short eye lashes very dark and much thicker.  </li>
            <li> My lower lashes are invisible, unless you place some mascara on them and bigger wands tend to clump a row of my weak lashes into two single ones.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> 1 or 2 quick layers for a long, natural look, or 2 to 4 for outrageous eyes.</li>
            <li> I do notice by the end of the day I tend to get a little on my eye lid, but I think it&#x27;s due to</li>
            <li> Bought brown and black</li>
            <li> The brush is odd, but that&#x27;s the point of it....</li>
            <li> then I end up sleeping in it and when it rubs off I get little black clumps all over my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dark</li>
            <li> when I got this is was all dried up.</li>
            <li> Mascara is supposed to be replaced every few months.  </li>
            <li> It was also hard to wash off, leaving heavy black smudges until using eye makeup remover pads.  </li>
            <li> It can be a little hard to take off though.</li>
            <li> and there was very little smudging</li>
            <li> One advantage for this product it that the brush seems to be unusable because of the teeth which are small and rigid.</li>
            <li> Usually I can feel mascara on my lashes, but this one I forgot I&#x27;m even wearing it.  </li>
            <li> drawback is that it has that usual hardening eyelash thing.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes so hard and stiff.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as defining as the One-by-One Volume Express which unfortunately has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> it stays on all day but its quite hard to take off when i tried</li>
            <li> Hard to remove, even with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> She let me on to her little secret that she uses this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t run in the least.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for at least 4 years.</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult cleaning it off without makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Because my lashes were shorter, I&#x27;d found this brush to be difficult, as it&#x27;s stiff and rubbery</li>
            <li> Read the reviews saying it was very hard to get off.</li>
            <li> i have thin eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Now just like any waterproof, the longer you leave it on, like if you sleep in it, the worse it gets.  </li>
            <li> This gives even all day coverage without irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> I used this mascara years ago but at that time my lashes were a bit shorter (poor habits like wearing mascara to sleep).  </li>
            <li> but sadly, it was so tough to remove that some of my lashes fell off even while using waterproof eye makeup remover!</li>
            <li> and I was SO sad to see that they dont make this one anymore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;can&#x27;t go wrong,</li>
            <li> This makes your lashes very hard (and dries them out and makes them prone to breakage too) and is almost impossible to get off, even with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about this mascara.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so mad they discontinued it.  </li>
            <li> Just very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Worst.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is one of the first mascaras i ever purchased. i have thin eyelashes. it makes my lashes look longer and thicker. amazing. didn&#x27;t realize how amazing until i bought a couple of mascaras that sucked. did this get discontinued? hope not.</li>
            <li> i choose this rating because i think it a fantastic product and i would consider it on other people. i think it is so comparable to the cover girl clump crusher.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and stunned that this works so well. I did some research and discovered a site where they had tested waterproof makeup and this product did very well. It is a good product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Happy with it. thank u so much!! :)</li>
            <li> The mascara was really good it stays on all day but its quite hard to take off when i tried</li>
            <li> works great and water proof and great price. I have actually purchased another. I get the look i want in 2 layers where with others i have had to more. very happy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new mascara that is waterproof and DOES NOT SMUDGE, I bought this because the price was great and had to start trying something. I was floored! This stays on all day, hits my little lashes on the inside and outside (the brush is wider at the ends) and does not smudge! I have larger cheeks and lashes often form a &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34; smudge after a day of smiling at the office but I went home after my 10 hour day with no shadow smudge. I will be back to buy this again.</li>
            <li> Makes my very thin and short eye lashes very dark and much thicker.  Very bold and gorgeous look.  If you aren&#x27;t used to this type of brush it will take awhile for you to master, but overall great product!</li>
            <li> I never wore mascara growing up, then I started to wear it about 4 years ago, I really love this Mascara, no clumping at all!! It separates my eye lashes perfect!! I do notice by the end of the day I tend to get a little on my eye lid, but I think it&#x27;s due to I have very oily skin, even with my eye shadow by the end of the day, my eye shadow is all in my crease. I mean I have very, very oily skin!! I love this mascara wouldn&#x27;t use anything else, and love the shape of the brush!</li>
            <li> My all time favorite mascara and I was SO sad to see that they dont make this one anymore. So I just buy it here haha&lt;br /&gt;It has great hold and the very black makes my eyelashes look full.</li>
            <li> Good product &amp; trusted brand. May clump a little bit on the tip of the brush after long term use, but overall quality is still good. Applies easily to lashes. Product arrived in a timely manner. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara that I use and it is definitely waterproof with the added benefit of washing off easily with soap.  For the first few applications out of the tube, I do need to remove some excess mascara from the wand before applying.  I can&#x27;t bring myself to complain about too much of a good product though.</li>
            <li> I have typical short thin and straight Asian lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds the curl very well, the whole day. From 10am to whenever I take my makeup off.&lt;br /&gt;It comes off easily with olive oil, so dont worry about having a hard time taking it off.&lt;br /&gt;It is a dry formula which is perfect for thin lashes.&lt;br /&gt;It does a fantastic job for volumizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite mascara which I buy in a bundle form amazon&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t know why I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore... Is it discontinued?</li>
            <li> The item was well packaged and arrived in time. New ans unused product. Look exactly as the photo and works perfectly. One advantage for this product it that the brush seems to be unusable because of the teeth which are small and rigid. The last mascara I used became stycky and I have to separate hairs of the brush to use it. With this one, I won&#x27;t for sure.</li>
            <li> Smelled too strong of chemicals, wasn&#x27;t the best but not the worst.</li>
            <li> This mascara was effective in lengthening and defining (not thickening). It also had great staying power throughout the day...but sadly, it was so tough to remove that some of my lashes fell off even while using waterproof eye makeup remover! Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dark and I went swimming with it on and there was very little smudging but it does tend to clump on your lashes.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be ordering this mascara again. I&#x27;m only giving it 2 stars because yes it looks nice on and is definitely water proof, but it&#x27;s the most uncomfortable mascara I&#x27;ve ever worn. It makes my eyelashes so hard and stiff. I have trouble taking it off even with my amazing eye makeup remover cream, so it never fully comes off then I end up sleeping in it and when it rubs off I get little black clumps all over my eyes. It claims to be no clump but that&#x27;s exactly what it does, including while I wear it, it makes me eyelashes stick together. Just very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It is ONE OF THE BEST MASCARAS I have ever came across. Loveddddd how my lashes turned out. It does however have some kinda ingredient that causes my eyes to get itchy after I have applied it. I thought I just wanted to sleep or so, but then I gave my mom to try them and she had a similar reaction.</li>
            <li> This mascara has become my favorite after trying it about a year ago. The brush is made of silicone so it reduces clumping and also separates lashes. The color is great too, very black is indeed that. Long wear, minimal flaking even after 12 hours. The only con I can report is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long, about 2 months for me, daily wear, before slowly drying up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about this mascara. I love Maybelline but for some reason, waterproof mascara never sits well with me.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find this in stores, but luckily can still find online. It is the best mascara out there!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a tear jerking show. Read the reviews saying it was very hard to get off. My dog died earlier in the day, and I can tell you, if you cry enough it will come off but will not leave you with raccoon eyes. I would say it does the job and does it well.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s really water proof and makes my short eyelashes thicker and longer look. It also arrived earlier than expected date of delivery.</li>
            <li> LIKE!!! ITS REALLY GOOD MAKES YOUR LASHES HUGE AND CAME VERY FAST i would really recommend it to anyone who wants waterproof mascara</li>
            <li> I use this for volume, and their lengthening right after for longer looking lases. Very very waterproof. WIll buy again.</li>
            <li> As you know, mascara cannot be shared with others. So since the mascara package was opened there is no other way to know if it was used or not. I couldn&#x27;t find this in other stores, so I knew it was too good to be true. The only reason why I can still find it online is probably because they&#x27;re used mascaras. 0/5 would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This mascara is a great price and works beautifully.  I have always hopped around from mascara to mascara and have never had a specific but have FINALLY found one I love.  Doesn&#x27;t run in the least.  Now just like any waterproof, the longer you leave it on, like if you sleep in it, the worse it gets.  I&#x27;ll wake up and my eye lashes will be clumped together or starting to flake. But that is NO detour-ant to keep me from using it.  It&#x27;s fabulous!!</li>
            <li> Awesome!! It&#x27;s really waterproof!</li>
            <li> This Define-A-Lash is comparable to a Loreal mascara I used for many, many years, but was discontinued.  I&#x27;m going to put in an order for more right now and keep a supply....just in case it gets discontinued also!!  Love it.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as defining as the One-by-One Volume Express which unfortunately has been discontinued. This particular container is clumpy.</li>
            <li> Please believe me when I say I have the thinnest lashes. My lower lashes are invisible, unless you place some mascara on them and bigger wands tend to clump a row of my weak lashes into two single ones. It really is waterproof, I need mac&#x27;s cleanse off oil to remove it and it defines my lashes without weighing them down.  I&#x27;m sticking with this one!</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
            <li> I have so many tubes of mascara I&#x27;ve used one time and set aside. I finally found this particular one and used it for a while then couldn&#x27;t find it in the store anymore.  So happy to find it on Amazon.  I buy 5 tubes at a time.</li>
            <li> If you can apply this right it looks great, but it can clump very easily. For the most part tho I would say it makes your lashes look nice but I will no longer be using this because I cannot wash it off! Yes, love it for the fact that its definitely waterproof but too waterproof. I cannot even remove it with my coconut oil. I don&#x27;t want to be washing my face for 20-30 minutes every night just to attempt at getting it off. If I need something I can depend on not coming back off I will use this again but in the meantime I&#x27;ll stick with my normal mascara.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara -- from the applicator to the color to the waterproof aspect.  The applicator helps lengthen and separate your lashes and it is a true black color.</li>
            <li> Magnífico,  mis pestañas ahora tienen mejor volumen.</li>
            <li> This has been the best waterproof mascara I have ever purchased.  It works like a nice thickening, lengthening mascara but is also waterproof.  It can be a little hard to take off though.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this! Clumps and sticks to your eyelashes for weeks!!! Waterproof yeah... but this stuff does not come out!!!! Makes your eyelashes fall out !!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Maybelline waterproof mascaras for years. This one caught my attention however, because it said it will last 12 hours. So I went ahead and gave it a try, and now its the only mascara I will buy. It does not run or smudge at all, unlike other &amp;#34;warerproof&amp;#34; mascaras. I am so thrilled I found this and don&#x27;t have to spend a ton of money. I just haven&#x27;t seen it in any stores yet.</li>
            <li> Love these. Been using for years and have a found anything else better.</li>
            <li> A girl just has to have this stuff. She will love it</li>
            <li> Really really good! Not sticky,  not clunky,  its really good for me because I cry in theater &amp; my actin classes lol...</li>
            <li> I like the way this defines and lengthens my lashes. Easy to remove and doesnt bother my eyes. Bought brown and black</li>
            <li> No problems at all with this mascara.  Has a nice brush that grabs and coats all the lashes easily.  It does not clump and does a nice job of separating the lashes.  Not my favorite but would repurchasre on sale.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. My old mascara was getting old so I had to buy new one. The one I previously owned went up in price so did some research and came across this one, saw it had decent reviews and a good price and went for it. It makes my lashes longer and slightly fuller which is always a plus, and it&#x27;s waterproof which is even better for someone like myself with watery eyes. It is a little difficult cleaning it off without makeup remover. My previous mascara was washable which I liked about it so I little disappointed this isn&#x27;t as easy to wash off, but nonetheless I still enjoy this.</li>
            <li> i use on false eye lashes as well as my own. this mascare stays on all day and washes off so easy. very good mascare and brush</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! The brush separates my lashes nicely and the mascara is completely, utterly waterproof.  It doesn&#x27;t flake or smear at all. It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for in a waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> lashes for miles.&lt;br /&gt;b-e-a utiful!&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t go wrong, perfect waterproof mascara!&lt;br /&gt;easy to apply and easy to remove. (i uses a baby wipe)</li>
            <li> Hard to remove, even with eye makeup remover. Next time will try the regular, not the waterproof</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid that Maybelline is going to discontinue this product because every time I love a product, it gets taken away. This gives even all day coverage without irritating my eyes.</li>
            <li> The first mascara I&#x27;ve used in years that doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes at all.  Usually I can feel mascara on my lashes, but this one I forgot I&#x27;m even wearing it.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for a lot of volume, just darkening so this works for me.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes long and that&#x27;s what I wanted. It does everything it said and does it well, twenty dollar, fifteen dollar mascara and the four dollar one wins....Trust me and try this first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback is that it has that usual hardening eyelash thing. But I think that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> My 4th or 5th order. Does not give raccoon eyes. Tried other brands already. People ask me what im wearing all the time.</li>
            <li> when I got this is was all dried up. Not worth it. Its almost like its just been sitting around for a long time. Not happy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best mascara ever!!!! I couldn&#x27;t believe I found it! I have to order more of it! Looove it!!</li>
            <li> I love this Mascara really really hard to remove tho I woukd recommend to buy a makeup remover! But other than that its a great mascara</li>
            <li> I love this mascara because first of all, its definitely waterproof, second of all, it&#x27;s very cheap and most of all it doesn&#x27;t clamp my eye lashes whenever I put it on. I love it so much that after using my first one for a couple of days, I went back and ordered 3 more mascaras. I&#x27;m sooooooo in love with this. It also came in earlier than what I expected which is in 2 days when it clearly says it&#x27;ll come within 3-5 days. I definitely recommend this especially when you go to school. It&#x27;ll stay throughout the whole day &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara. It goes on good not clumpy and leaves my eyelashes looking so pretty. The price is wonderful too. This is the second time I bought this product. (:  Thank you for a great product</li>
            <li> This takes waterproof to a new level. I use a remover that is made for waterproof makeup and have to scrub and scrub to get it off. Ugh.</li>
            <li> I was always commenting on my friends lashes and how gorgeous they were. She let me on to her little secret that she uses this product. I apply this one a day. It does not smear and stays on like a champ. My lashes look full and long after 2 applications. Even when I use my makeup remover, there is still mascara on my lashes. To fully remove residue, I wash my eyelashes in the shower. Great product!</li>
            <li> This makes your lashes very hard (and dries them out and makes them prone to breakage too) and is almost impossible to get off, even with coconut oil. Somehow, it also manages to give me raccoon eyes after five or six hours too. Worst. Mascara. Ever.</li>
            <li> A very good value. The thing I like best about this product is that it does not irritate my eyes. I find that it works best if you put on several layers waiting about a minute between each layer. It goes on smoothly and does not clump.</li>
            <li> Why did they discontinue this product?  I am now trying to find it everwhere I can on-line.  I got mine from this vendor so quickly.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this tube is no longer available in the stores. The new tube is green.  The company has changed the brush to an unwieldy flexible one that juggles too much to be effective.  I guess I will have to order the red tube online now, which is a shame because you never know how old the package is.  Mascara is supposed to be replaced every few months.  I took the old brush and used it in the new green tube.  But it&#x27;s not the same as having an entirely new tube, brush and all.  It makes me angry that Maybelline would change a good thing.  And there was no indication on the new package that anything was different, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it.  I supposed now I have to hunt and waste money looking for a new favorite.  What a shame.  This product gets my highest rating but it won&#x27;t be around for long so buy a few while you can.</li>
            <li> Clumpy from the first application.. when I got the clumps out, it was thick and sticky.. made my eye lashes actually look shorter than they were because I couldn&#x27;t curl them well with this thick goop on them.  It was also hard to wash off, leaving heavy black smudges until using eye makeup remover pads.  Perhaps I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> This is the best Mascara ever!!!! I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore so I was thrilled when I found it here (and with free shipping). It doesn&#x27;t clump and goes on smoothly. At the end of the day it&#x27;s still fresh and new looking. I would recommend this to all females that want to make their eyes pop!</li>
            <li> I am desperately trying to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump or bend my eyelashes forward, since the one I used for years was discontinued many ions ago.  This mascara is acceptable.</li>
            <li> I used this mascara years ago but at that time my lashes were a bit shorter (poor habits like wearing mascara to sleep).  Because my lashes were shorter, I&#x27;d found this brush to be difficult, as it&#x27;s stiff and rubbery and I felt I needed to get \\&quot;under the eyelash\\&quot; to begin the stroke, which frankly, would hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast Forward--I&#x27;ve now got my lashes really healthy and long, but until recently, had forgotten about this mascara.  Again, I have long lashes now, but they&#x27;re fair.  Anyway, I saw the good price and I decided to give it a try.  Can I just tell you....this stuff is awesome.  The brush is odd, but that&#x27;s the point of it....it allows for a seamless stroke without clumping, and the lashes go on long and smooth. So pretty for anyone with a mid to long lash.  Maybe even short (it&#x27;s just that my experience wasn&#x27;t the best)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;d recommend, give yourself 2 uninterrupted minutes to put it on....WITH a lash brush or clean toothbrush for quick smoothing or light detangling.  The reason being, this stuff is so waterproof that it dries FAST.  However, it seriously is gorgeous, and totally worth it.  The brush itself is fairly perfect for not leaving clumps, but sometimes it&#x27;s nice to have that spare utensil (with no mascara on it) to aid the process. 1 or 2 quick layers for a long, natural look, or 2 to 4 for outrageous eyes.</li>
            <li> Dryed up before I opened it, never buy it agagin</li>
            <li> More waterproof than my previous mascara, but still not waterproof enough.  Will try something else once I have gotten through this bottle.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mascara for my daughter. This is the only mascara she uses and she could not get it at the store we shop at, as it was always sold out. She really likes this mascara, goes on good and stays on all day till your ready to take it off. She was very pleased that I bought it for her. Great purchase. Fast delivery. Good product.</li>
            <li> this mascara is an outstanding product and should never been taken off the shelves of all the stores I shop in.&lt;br /&gt;It was moderately priced, easy to apply long lasting and by far one of the best mascara&#x27;s i have used in the 45 years&lt;br /&gt;I have been using mascara. I think it should definatly be put back on the shelves so that the next generation can have&lt;br /&gt;the same positive experience i have been fortunate enough to experience.</li>
            <li> Just love this Awesome mascara!! I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for at least 4 years. I try other new mascaras but nothing like this one</li>
            <li> it is very good quality. Wife bought gifts for her friends. They are delighted with the quality. thank you very much</li>
            <li> I love this mascara and I&#x27;m so mad they discontinued it.  Now I have to search around for the last remaining tubes!</li>
            <li> I liked the price but this mascara clumps from the start. It&#x27;s hard to remove, but does a great job of staying on in the pool.</li>
