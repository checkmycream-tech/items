            <li>Quality is good for the price.</li>
            <li>They seem to be a good VALUE for what the product is.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of removing hairs with GIGI wax</li>
            <li>it did not work good and . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really very good product, in a big quantity and with a excellent price...</li>
            <li>Very good product, glad to be able to wax in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li>I use these with sally hensen&#x27;s hair removal wax and these work better than th strips that came with it!</li>
            <li>Works perfect, pulls the hair superb, love the different sizes.</li>
            <li>You would think that you see things like this more often, i just wanted strips, nothing else!</li>
            <li>do you like more?!</li>
            <li>and we love it!</li>
            <li>I love these strips!</li>
            <li>I love these strips!</li>
            <li>I love the texture of the strips!</li>
            <li>These work better then the ones that come with my Gigi warmer kit!</li>
            <li>I love theses!</li>
            <li>Nice to have more strips than wax!</li>
            <li>The strips work great, come in two sizes and are cheap (in price, not quality).</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a real cheap product.</li>
            <li>and they worked amazing.</li>
            <li>These are thicker than any I&#x27;ve gotten in waxing kits, which is nice because when you press them against the wax, none of the wax leaks through</li>
            <li>no wax bleeding through when you wax nice pre cut pieces makes it easier too.</li>
            <li>All i can say is that they work and were a nice addtion to my BodyHonee hair removal kit.</li>
            <li>These feel like good quality and are just as good as the ones that originally come with my Sally Hansen wax kit.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say whether this is a good product or not, they charged me for it, confirmed that it was shipping, but never sent it out.</li>
            <li>well worth the money, great price.</li>
            <li>They are great material, they work like a charm and perfect sizes, I even cut them in half to make more...</li>
            <li>Good for clean up and keeping wax from dripping from heat unit to application spot.  </li>
            <li>these are good good price fast shipping</li>
            <li>i ordered these kuz they were very cheap compared to store costs.</li>
            <li>Fantastic item and quick business at a great value...</li>
            <li>and so you don&#x27;t ever get a sticky residue on the top side.</li>
            <li>The smaller ones are perfect for the face area.  </li>
            <li>They are more for your legs</li>
            <li>I have had these for almost 2 years now because I don&#x27;t have to wax more then once in a couple of months.</li>
            <li>but I cant say for sure.</li>
            <li>This works well, but is more like paper.</li>
            <li>But then it gets the job done most of the times...</li>
            <li>I like it :)</li>
            <li>These are not my favorite but work</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>If u know how to wax properly, they are the best tools!</li>
            <li>and I have to say that this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love these strips and they work well with Sally Hansen all-over body waxing.  </li>
            <li>To me these are better than the fabric one&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>HAve used better ones.</li>
            <li>These are slightly better than the strips that come with the BodyHonee wax, and you&#x27;re gonna need a ton more than what&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li>They just worked okay.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>i was extremely satisfied with the product..</li>
            <li>They never give you enough in the packet, but these wax strips work great!</li>
            <li>i recommend them :)</li>
            <li>Just glad I had no part of it.</li>
            <li>I will order more.</li>
            <li>LOVE THEM WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>, you can re-use the strip more than once to remove wax.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect for eyebrows, I use them with the nads facial pen.</li>
            <li>I was amazed on how many came in a package.  </li>
            <li>I love love love love these wax strips.</li>
            <li>Parisas are much better</li>
            <li>Their better quality than my wax lady&#x27;s one.</li>
            <li>but so much more wax than that</li>
            <li>great wax strips, work very well</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these for waxing, great deal for the price.</li>
            <li>Great quality, strong would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Great product, no problems, quick to ship, Item exactly as explained in the description.</li>
            <li>These are very good  Has different sizes&lt;br /&gt;Value</li>
            <li>However, for anybody who dislikes cloth strips for any reason - they are harder to cut, for example - then these non-woven strips by Fantasea are excellent.</li>
            <li>But these strips are really good at picking up hair and they feel pretty comfortable against the skin.</li>
            <li>They work good, got them right away and are a very reasonable price, I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Cleans up the wax quite easily without harming your skin</li>
            <li>it also arrived very quickly</li>
            <li>I will buy again, it was so easy to try on</li>
            <li>and they ate easy to cut to size too</li>
            <li>They are sturdy, strong and pick up the wax well.</li>
            <li>Gives me a nice crisp wax</li>
            <li>I use Gigi wax should work fine</li>
            <li>first we were using a strip per area or wax application and per session we were using around 10 strips or more but as you get more practice</li>
            <li>The strips seem fine, yet did not work well at all for me.</li>
            <li>Turns out I had judged the cloth ones too quickly - I ended up appreciating them a lot more than the woven ones.</li>
            <li>Overall I think its a great buy.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>so you cant focus on detailed areas...  </li>
            <li>But it gets wax off easily and leaves the skin clean.</li>
            <li>Cheap for the amount of strips.</li>
            <li>it was cheap and exaclty what i ordered...</li>
            <li>just started waxing myself and picked up a cheap pack of wax strips.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>They are strong and get all the wax off quickly and easily, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it seeping through and onto your fingers.</li>
            <li>Very good quality AND got a lot of them in the package compared to what other vendors offer.</li>
            <li>This makes things quick and easy.</li>
            <li>, this is my first time trying, sure will recommend</li>
            <li>I want my money back,waste of money.i was so excited to get it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taught myself how to wax, with some help of youtube etc, :), and these are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Better deal than in stores, thanks!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and worth the price.</li>
            <li>ripped my freakin skin off trying to clean the remaining wax all over.</li>
            <li>They are strong, rip right off</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy more of this.</li>
            <li>Works perfect with the Gigi hard wax systems</li>
            <li>These are a perfect complement for use with the Gigi Hard Body Brazilian Wax.</li>
            <li>These combined with Hard wax are the best method of hair removal I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This product works exactly as I expected, with great adherence to hair.</li>
            <li>I feel like the number of strips you get for the price was good, and I would definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li>Good solid strips that do no rip.</li>
            <li>Thank you for offering such a practical product at a good price.</li>
            <li>Excellent product as usual!</li>
            <li>so maybe the wax hardened too quickly?</li>
            <li>This strips are very convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great little strips.  </li>
            <li>It was worth a try for the money</li>
            <li>It was fun to watch them squirm and squeal as they ripped the hair from their bodies.</li>
            <li>(Old tee-shirt strips prolly better than this product).</li>
            <li>It worked at least as good as those ones, so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I will definitely get these again, I love being smooth for a fraction of the cost of the salon.</li>
            <li>Deffinately worth buying.</li>
            <li>i really like these strips they are perfect for waxing because they are really stiff which really helps removing the hair.</li>
            <li>With these Fantasea Non-Woven Strips, is may hurt just a  little bit more, but is better since it grabs pretty much everything and seems to pull more of the roots out, which is what I want.  </li>
            <li>am not sure how they compare to higher quality strips, but if you are looking for something that does a good job without any issues, this is it!</li>
            <li>When I got these they weren&#x27;t the right ones, but I figured, why not give them a go.  </li>
            <li>The wax strips are just the right size for face and body waxing.  </li>
            <li>They are precut to the right sizes.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d rather pay a little more for better quality.</li>
            <li>The larger strips are great for legs, arms, etc and can be easily cut down if needed.</li>
            <li>Arrived SUPER fast; and they seem to do the trick - no complaints.</li>
            <li>Came super fast.</li>
            <li>Good texture, but odd sizes.</li>
            <li>They work great for larger areas such as the armpits where you might be using a heavier coat of wax.  </li>
            <li>Great buy and should last me a while since I will only be using these strips for one area of my body!  </li>
            <li>I was not able to use it on both sides as few reviews said, but still I love them for they get the job done perfect</li>
            <li>I have bought so many different type of wax and the strips they give you</li>
            <li>Delivered fast!</li>
            <li>These work wonders with hot wax.</li>
            <li>Personally, I had much better results with muslin strips.</li>
            <li>okay will look for another brand next time.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>But after trying 5 different times and making sure I was doing it correctly.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t too sure when I ordered it cuz price is really low</li>
            <li>First time at home waxing.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is meant</li>
            <li>They do exactly what they are supposed to do without tearing.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and was exactly what was described in listing.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be ordering this again without a doubt!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>They work just as well being reused as they did with the first use.</li>
            <li>, so these plain dry strips go with it perfectly.</li>
            <li>The little strips are great for touch-ups and sensitive bikini areas, though I never used them on my face, so can&#x27;t rate them there.  </li>
            <li>More simply, it seems like you get more for your money by purchasing the Gigi strips as an AP member than to buy these lovely, cheap, yet expensive to ship strips.</li>
            <li>Pretty straight forward, gave me nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li>First off, knowy what you really want  before you buy.</li>
            <li>They are bigger than I expected and easy to cut, so I was able to use one of the large ones to cut into many smaller strips.</li>
            <li>I use the strips with my silk and smooth aloe Vera hot wax and they are even sturdy enough to reuse a couple of times.</li>
            <li>Convenient sizes and easy to cut smaller if needed.</li>
            <li>well this is definately a produst ive purchased several of already, and added plus: suer fast shipping, and work amazing with the waxes that never include enough strips ;)</li>
            <li>Very thick and great for home waxing.</li>
            <li>My husband complained that with the Muslin Strips he felt the wax did not adhere as good when doing a large area.  </li>
            <li>However the big ones are HUGE.</li>
            <li>My wife says, \\&quot;It saves me the the expense of having to spend a  whole lot of money trying to wax arms and legs.</li>
            <li>Also, eventually it will stunt the roots and stop growing all together which I have seen happen, much cheaper than electrolysis.</li>
            <li>Much easier to remove.</li>
            <li>These work very well.</li>
            <li>If you want pain, go ahead and use the whole thing.</li>
            <li>I am save so much money on waxing.</li>
            <li>they work very well.</li>
            <li>Very durable and does not shred during use.</li>
            <li>The paper absorbes the wax and does not stick very well to the wax.</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>and they work really well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment product as described</li>
            <li>They do a great job removing hair and do not leave any lint behind.</li>
            <li>I like the product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to remove hair with wax.  </li>
            <li>I purchased them after getting the gigi brazilian waxing kit and they help you save a lot on wax, its faster to remove it with the strips( much swifter)</li>
            <li>I really like how well these grip the wax.</li>
            <li>Much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Very gound wax strips.</li>
            <li>These strips do not seem to grip the wax very well.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t always get a good grip on areas with lots of thick hair though.</li>
            <li>The large size is really large, so I cut them in half, for a more manageable session.</li>
            <li>I originally bought these non-woven waxing strips because I didn&#x27;t like the cloth ones I had ordered earlier.</li>
            <li>You are better off with any other brand.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t let the wax soak thru to the other side and seem to attach to the wax better.</li>
            <li>About what I expected, easy to use</li>
            <li>So a decent choice.</li>
            <li>I only wish there was a third size that was more of a square.</li>
            <li>but I was surprised cuz it&#x27;s much better than wht I expected.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>But that could be because of the kind of wax I am using and perhaps a variety of other reasons related to the skin and the length of hair</li>
            <li>Strips a little thicker is better than this</li>
            <li>Came very fast.. but its rougher than what I thought it would have been.. and it still didnt help with the wax in fact it didn&#x27;t really stick to the wax and left the wax on my body and</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really judge these against professional wax strips.</li>
            <li>There soft yet durable and gently pull the unwanted hairs out.</li>
            <li>The smaller ones are a nice size for smaller areas such as around the face.</li>
            <li>Nice and thick so</li>
            <li>I will update this review when I&#x27;ve tried with my regular wax again, but based on current experience, I would strongly recommend using woven strips over these.</li>
            <li>I think this is an ok product, I honestly don&#x27;t like the fact that it&#x27;s too thick and has very little flexibility.</li>
            <li>Had to cut some down but works fine for me.</li>
            <li>I bought these and was finally able to use all the waxes I have collected over the past year or 2.</li>
            <li>for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were searching for the waxing strip which is not expensive and at the same time does the job!</li>
            <li>it hurt twice more than using other strips and it&#x27;s not something i would buy in the future.</li>
            <li>They are gorgeously inexpensive, but the cost of shipping puts them in the same league as the $8/$9 Gigi 100 LARGE Muslin strips (with free shipping for Amazon Prime members), while these strips are half large and half small.</li>
            <li>/just a little bit different texture than I expected, was looking for one&#x27;s like in the kit, but still a good product</li>
            <li>I use these with a cold wax and they work great.</li>
            <li>These work very well and are a must-purchase with the BodyHonee Hair Removal Waxing Kit, as the kit doesn&#x27;t come with anywhere near enough.</li>
            <li>Strips are soft and don&#x27;t rupture.</li>
            <li>These strips are terrific, and very well priced for the amount of product that you get.</li>
            <li>When I used to get my eyebrows done by a professional, who has been waxing for 20 years, she used these too.</li>
            <li>However, this could be the wax I use or just my body&#x27;s natural chemistry.</li>
            <li>I had never waxed before, either at home or professionally</li>
            <li>They take the hair completely off, not messy, etc.</li>
            <li>They feel like professional grade waxing strips.</li>
            <li>I do blame the All Natural BodyHonee wax.</li>
            <li>I use Parissa Sugar Wax, and have no trouble waxing when I use strips that come with their kit.  </li>
            <li>thick and soft, got many of strip</li>
            <li>This package come with really large ones that are big enough to do an arm or most of your leg and the smaller ones you can cut in half for eyebrows and mustache.</li>
            <li>IF I used the often enough, but alas I found that a razor is much faster :-)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I normally use Gigi muslin strips for wax and decided to try another product if only to compare.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to any other interested individual.</li>
            <li>Off late I struggle to use it as easily as I used to before.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re thick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Thick, quality made material, that is easy to use with any type of wax.</li>
            <li>This is a very good quality wax strip, thick enough that the wax does not go through the paper and get my hands all sticky like the tan woven cloth-like ones even though it seems to hurt a little bit less with them it does not seem to completely grab all of it.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient with both sizes ( large and small)</li>
            <li>The large strips are convenient for larger areas and the smaller strips for upper lip, eyebrows, etc.</li>
            <li>barely none on the strips..</li>
            <li>Barely removed any hair when waxing</li>
            <li>Works well with Completely Bare Wax.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve never used this strips before, I don&#x27;t know if this may be due to a new wax (Sally Hansen Natural Honey), which I&#x27;ve already been having issues with using.</li>
            <li>I cut the large strips down to size as well.</li>
            <li>Good product for an unpleasant job.</li>
            <li>Shipping came fast actually arrived earlier than expected!</li>
            <li>I wish they were available for free Prime shipping though. :(</li>
            <li>Our search at local pharmacy, super store did you yield anything substantial or was coming with other accessories which were not interested at all!</li>
            <li>These work great and may go with them as there is a little less residual fibers left behind when you pull it off of skin.</li>
            <li>It got a little better for me after the first few uses because I found that you have to do these a little differently than the other kinds but still not quite the results I wanted.</li>

            <li> You would think that you see things like this more often, i just wanted strips, nothing else!</li>

            <li> Nice to have more strips than wax!</li>
            <li> The strips work great, come in two sizes and are cheap (in price, not quality).</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a real cheap product.</li>
            <li> and they worked amazing.</li>
            <li> These are thicker than any I&#x27;ve gotten in waxing kits, which is nice because when you press them against the wax, none of the wax leaks through</li>
            <li> no wax bleeding through when you wax nice pre cut pieces makes it easier too.</li>
            <li> All i can say is that they work and were a nice addtion to my BodyHonee hair removal kit.</li>
            <li> These feel like good quality and are just as good as the ones that originally come with my Sally Hansen wax kit.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say whether this is a good product or not, they charged me for it, confirmed that it was shipping, but never sent it out.</li>
            <li> well worth the money, great price.</li>
            <li> They are great material, they work like a charm and perfect sizes, I even cut them in half to make more...</li>
            <li> Good for clean up and keeping wax from dripping from heat unit to application spot.  </li>
            <li> these are good good price fast shipping</li>
            <li> i ordered these kuz they were very cheap compared to store costs.</li>
            <li> Fantastic item and quick business at a great value...</li>
            <li> and so you don&#x27;t ever get a sticky residue on the top side.</li>
            <li> The smaller ones are perfect for the face area.  </li>
            <li> They are more for your legs</li>
            <li> I have had these for almost 2 years now because I don&#x27;t have to wax more then once in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> but I cant say for sure.</li>
            <li> This works well, but is more like paper.</li>
            <li> But then it gets the job done most of the times...</li>
            <li> I like it :)</li>
            <li> These are not my favorite but work</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> If u know how to wax properly, they are the best tools!</li>
            <li> and I have to say that this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Love these strips and they work well with Sally Hansen all-over body waxing.  </li>
            <li> To me these are better than the fabric one&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> HAve used better ones.</li>
            <li> These are slightly better than the strips that come with the BodyHonee wax, and you&#x27;re gonna need a ton more than what&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li> They just worked okay.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> i was extremely satisfied with the product..</li>
            <li> They never give you enough in the packet, but these wax strips work great!</li>
            <li> i recommend them :)</li>
            <li> Just glad I had no part of it.</li>
            <li> I will order more.</li>
            <li> LOVE THEM WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> , you can re-use the strip more than once to remove wax.  </li>
            <li> These are perfect for eyebrows, I use them with the nads facial pen.</li>
            <li> I was amazed on how many came in a package.  </li>
            <li> I love love love love these wax strips.</li>
            <li> Parisas are much better</li>
            <li> Their better quality than my wax lady&#x27;s one.</li>
            <li> but so much more wax than that</li>
            <li> great wax strips, work very well</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these for waxing, great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Great quality, strong would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product, no problems, quick to ship, Item exactly as explained in the description.</li>
            <li> These are very good  Has different sizes&lt;br /&gt;Value</li>
            <li> However, for anybody who dislikes cloth strips for any reason - they are harder to cut, for example - then these non-woven strips by Fantasea are excellent.</li>
            <li> But these strips are really good at picking up hair and they feel pretty comfortable against the skin.</li>
            <li> They work good, got them right away and are a very reasonable price, I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Cleans up the wax quite easily without harming your skin</li>
            <li> it also arrived very quickly</li>
            <li> I will buy again, it was so easy to try on</li>
            <li> and they ate easy to cut to size too</li>
            <li> They are sturdy, strong and pick up the wax well.</li>
            <li> Gives me a nice crisp wax</li>
            <li> I use Gigi wax should work fine</li>
            <li> first we were using a strip per area or wax application and per session we were using around 10 strips or more but as you get more practice</li>
            <li> The strips seem fine, yet did not work well at all for me.</li>
            <li> Turns out I had judged the cloth ones too quickly - I ended up appreciating them a lot more than the woven ones.</li>
            <li> Overall I think its a great buy.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> so you cant focus on detailed areas...  </li>
            <li> But it gets wax off easily and leaves the skin clean.</li>
            <li> Cheap for the amount of strips.</li>
            <li> it was cheap and exaclty what i ordered...</li>
            <li> just started waxing myself and picked up a cheap pack of wax strips.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> They are strong and get all the wax off quickly and easily, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it seeping through and onto your fingers.</li>
            <li> Very good quality AND got a lot of them in the package compared to what other vendors offer.</li>
            <li> This makes things quick and easy.</li>
            <li> , this is my first time trying, sure will recommend</li>
            <li> I want my money back,waste of money.i was so excited to get it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taught myself how to wax, with some help of youtube etc, :), and these are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Better deal than in stores, thanks!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and worth the price.</li>
            <li> ripped my freakin skin off trying to clean the remaining wax all over.</li>
            <li> They are strong, rip right off</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy more of this.</li>
            <li> Works perfect with the Gigi hard wax systems</li>
            <li> These are a perfect complement for use with the Gigi Hard Body Brazilian Wax.</li>
            <li> These combined with Hard wax are the best method of hair removal I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as I expected, with great adherence to hair.</li>
            <li> I feel like the number of strips you get for the price was good, and I would definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> Good solid strips that do no rip.</li>
            <li> Thank you for offering such a practical product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product as usual!</li>
            <li> so maybe the wax hardened too quickly?</li>
            <li> This strips are very convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great little strips.  </li>
            <li> It was worth a try for the money</li>
            <li> It was fun to watch them squirm and squeal as they ripped the hair from their bodies.</li>
            <li> (Old tee-shirt strips prolly better than this product).</li>
            <li> It worked at least as good as those ones, so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I will definitely get these again, I love being smooth for a fraction of the cost of the salon.</li>
            <li> Deffinately worth buying.</li>
            <li> i really like these strips they are perfect for waxing because they are really stiff which really helps removing the hair.</li>
            <li> With these Fantasea Non-Woven Strips, is may hurt just a  little bit more, but is better since it grabs pretty much everything and seems to pull more of the roots out, which is what I want.  </li>
            <li> am not sure how they compare to higher quality strips, but if you are looking for something that does a good job without any issues, this is it!</li>
            <li> When I got these they weren&#x27;t the right ones, but I figured, why not give them a go.  </li>
            <li> The wax strips are just the right size for face and body waxing.  </li>
            <li> They are precut to the right sizes.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d rather pay a little more for better quality.</li>
            <li> The larger strips are great for legs, arms, etc and can be easily cut down if needed.</li>
            <li> Arrived SUPER fast; and they seem to do the trick - no complaints.</li>
            <li> Came super fast.</li>
            <li> Good texture, but odd sizes.</li>
            <li> They work great for larger areas such as the armpits where you might be using a heavier coat of wax.  </li>
            <li> Great buy and should last me a while since I will only be using these strips for one area of my body!  </li>
            <li> I was not able to use it on both sides as few reviews said, but still I love them for they get the job done perfect</li>
            <li> I have bought so many different type of wax and the strips they give you</li>
            <li> Delivered fast!</li>
            <li> These work wonders with hot wax.</li>
            <li> Personally, I had much better results with muslin strips.</li>
            <li> okay will look for another brand next time.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> But after trying 5 different times and making sure I was doing it correctly.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t too sure when I ordered it cuz price is really low</li>
            <li> First time at home waxing.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is meant</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they are supposed to do without tearing.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was exactly what was described in listing.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely be ordering this again without a doubt!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> They work just as well being reused as they did with the first use.</li>
            <li> , so these plain dry strips go with it perfectly.</li>
            <li> The little strips are great for touch-ups and sensitive bikini areas, though I never used them on my face, so can&#x27;t rate them there.  </li>
            <li> More simply, it seems like you get more for your money by purchasing the Gigi strips as an AP member than to buy these lovely, cheap, yet expensive to ship strips.</li>
            <li> Pretty straight forward, gave me nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> First off, knowy what you really want  before you buy.</li>
            <li> They are bigger than I expected and easy to cut, so I was able to use one of the large ones to cut into many smaller strips.</li>
            <li> I use the strips with my silk and smooth aloe Vera hot wax and they are even sturdy enough to reuse a couple of times.</li>
            <li> Convenient sizes and easy to cut smaller if needed.</li>
            <li> well this is definately a produst ive purchased several of already, and added plus: suer fast shipping, and work amazing with the waxes that never include enough strips ;)</li>
            <li> Very thick and great for home waxing.</li>
            <li> My husband complained that with the Muslin Strips he felt the wax did not adhere as good when doing a large area.  </li>
            <li> However the big ones are HUGE.</li>
            <li> My wife says, \\&quot;It saves me the the expense of having to spend a  whole lot of money trying to wax arms and legs.</li>
            <li> Also, eventually it will stunt the roots and stop growing all together which I have seen happen, much cheaper than electrolysis.</li>
            <li> Much easier to remove.</li>
            <li> These work very well.</li>
            <li> If you want pain, go ahead and use the whole thing.</li>
            <li> I am save so much money on waxing.</li>
            <li> they work very well.</li>
            <li> Very durable and does not shred during use.</li>
            <li> The paper absorbes the wax and does not stick very well to the wax.</li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> and they work really well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment product as described</li>
            <li> They do a great job removing hair and do not leave any lint behind.</li>
            <li> I like the product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to remove hair with wax.  </li>
            <li> I purchased them after getting the gigi brazilian waxing kit and they help you save a lot on wax, its faster to remove it with the strips( much swifter)</li>
            <li> I really like how well these grip the wax.</li>
            <li> Much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Very gound wax strips.</li>
            <li> These strips do not seem to grip the wax very well.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t always get a good grip on areas with lots of thick hair though.</li>
            <li> The large size is really large, so I cut them in half, for a more manageable session.</li>
            <li> I originally bought these non-woven waxing strips because I didn&#x27;t like the cloth ones I had ordered earlier.</li>
            <li> You are better off with any other brand.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t let the wax soak thru to the other side and seem to attach to the wax better.</li>
            <li> About what I expected, easy to use</li>
            <li> So a decent choice.</li>
            <li> I only wish there was a third size that was more of a square.</li>
            <li> but I was surprised cuz it&#x27;s much better than wht I expected.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> But that could be because of the kind of wax I am using and perhaps a variety of other reasons related to the skin and the length of hair</li>
            <li> Strips a little thicker is better than this</li>
            <li> Came very fast.. but its rougher than what I thought it would have been.. and it still didnt help with the wax in fact it didn&#x27;t really stick to the wax and left the wax on my body and</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really judge these against professional wax strips.</li>
            <li> There soft yet durable and gently pull the unwanted hairs out.</li>
            <li> The smaller ones are a nice size for smaller areas such as around the face.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick so</li>
            <li> I will update this review when I&#x27;ve tried with my regular wax again, but based on current experience, I would strongly recommend using woven strips over these.</li>
            <li> I think this is an ok product, I honestly don&#x27;t like the fact that it&#x27;s too thick and has very little flexibility.</li>
            <li> Had to cut some down but works fine for me.</li>
            <li> I bought these and was finally able to use all the waxes I have collected over the past year or 2.</li>
            <li> for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were searching for the waxing strip which is not expensive and at the same time does the job!</li>
            <li> it hurt twice more than using other strips and it&#x27;s not something i would buy in the future.</li>
            <li> They are gorgeously inexpensive, but the cost of shipping puts them in the same league as the $8/$9 Gigi 100 LARGE Muslin strips (with free shipping for Amazon Prime members), while these strips are half large and half small.</li>
            <li> /just a little bit different texture than I expected, was looking for one&#x27;s like in the kit, but still a good product</li>
            <li> I use these with a cold wax and they work great.</li>
            <li> These work very well and are a must-purchase with the BodyHonee Hair Removal Waxing Kit, as the kit doesn&#x27;t come with anywhere near enough.</li>
            <li> Strips are soft and don&#x27;t rupture.</li>
            <li> These strips are terrific, and very well priced for the amount of product that you get.</li>
            <li> When I used to get my eyebrows done by a professional, who has been waxing for 20 years, she used these too.</li>
            <li> However, this could be the wax I use or just my body&#x27;s natural chemistry.</li>
            <li> I had never waxed before, either at home or professionally</li>
            <li> They take the hair completely off, not messy, etc.</li>
            <li> They feel like professional grade waxing strips.</li>
            <li> I do blame the All Natural BodyHonee wax.</li>
            <li> I use Parissa Sugar Wax, and have no trouble waxing when I use strips that come with their kit.  </li>
            <li> thick and soft, got many of strip</li>
            <li> This package come with really large ones that are big enough to do an arm or most of your leg and the smaller ones you can cut in half for eyebrows and mustache.</li>
            <li> IF I used the often enough, but alas I found that a razor is much faster :-)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I normally use Gigi muslin strips for wax and decided to try another product if only to compare.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to any other interested individual.</li>
            <li> Off late I struggle to use it as easily as I used to before.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Thick, quality made material, that is easy to use with any type of wax.</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality wax strip, thick enough that the wax does not go through the paper and get my hands all sticky like the tan woven cloth-like ones even though it seems to hurt a little bit less with them it does not seem to completely grab all of it.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient with both sizes ( large and small)</li>
            <li> The large strips are convenient for larger areas and the smaller strips for upper lip, eyebrows, etc.</li>
            <li> barely none on the strips..</li>
            <li> Barely removed any hair when waxing</li>
            <li> Works well with Completely Bare Wax.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve never used this strips before, I don&#x27;t know if this may be due to a new wax (Sally Hansen Natural Honey), which I&#x27;ve already been having issues with using.</li>
            <li> I cut the large strips down to size as well.</li>
            <li> Good product for an unpleasant job.</li>
            <li> Shipping came fast actually arrived earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I wish they were available for free Prime shipping though. :(</li>
            <li> Our search at local pharmacy, super store did you yield anything substantial or was coming with other accessories which were not interested at all!</li>
            <li> These work great and may go with them as there is a little less residual fibers left behind when you pull it off of skin.</li>
            <li> It got a little better for me after the first few uses because I found that you have to do these a little differently than the other kinds but still not quite the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> You get tons in the pack and they will last a long time if only being used for waxing eyebrows and smaller areas.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the kind I normally use and was confused by the poor reviews.  </li>
            <li> Wax applied thick, thin, hotter, medium...strips still fell apart on quick removal and little better than toilet tissue covered with paper towels.</li>
            <li> This package comes with large and small strips.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with them ripping or anything, in fact they felt a little bit thicker than my normal strips.  </li>
            <li> It has large and small strips, comes with 100 strips it last a long time too.</li>
            <li> Also small strips are very helpful in bikini wax .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much use for the small strips</li>
            <li> I have to say that I did try both sides and left it sit for a long time hoping it would work..</li>
            <li> theres a lot, so they&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> Real brazillian wax and still, poor quality, as far as I tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few of these but they are soft and worked for me.</li>
            <li> I wish there were more small strips (I ended up cutting the large ones).</li>
            <li> They last for a while, especially if you cut them down for smaller areas.</li>
            <li> The big strips are way bigger than what I expected!  </li>
            <li> The small ones are a fairly decent size already.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The strips are soft and both sides can be used by folding a little bit of the it in order to grab it.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long long time.</li>
            <li> Should have bought these a LONG time ago.</li>
            <li> Does not completely remove hair and the wax soaks through these sheets.</li>
            <li> They lift off the with ease if you pull in the opposite direction in which you smoothed them down.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that the small strips are smaller then  they appear in picture.</li>
            <li> Waxing is never painless but with high quality strips like this at least you never have to deal with uneven results which you’ll need to something about a second time.</li>
            <li> Even when the was doesn&#x27;t grip the hair properly I&#x27;m not left with a gooey mess.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind a little back waxing every now and again</li>
            <li> stupidly me, this has no wax, i guess you need your own wax</li>
            <li> but they were not what i expected.</li>
            <li> They are pieces of paper you stick wax on and stick to your body, not much to praise or complain about here.</li>
            <li> No mess left behind with this one.</li>
            <li> I wish the kit had all long strips instead of the long and small ones togther.</li>
            <li> These will last me years, probably, as I usually just wax my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I was expecting cheaper quality based on the price difference between these and the other strips I was looking at.  </li>
            <li> Did not work as well as other brands I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> We use it at home, I bought a wax warmer for my wife and we usually use just one per session as 1 strip can be used several times...</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying a new Sally Hansen Wax kit every time I used up all the wax strips.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother with this product because it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that it&#x27;s a bit stiffer than I prefer.</li>
            <li> No worth to buy it</li>
            <li> They are thick enough the waz don&#x27;t bleed through</li>
            <li> The smaller one is very small.</li>
            <li> The smaller strips are useless to me though, but there&#x27;s a lot of the bigger strips and it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I feel less pain using these to wax.</li>
            <li> They do not adhere to the wax at all, leaving a mess all over my skin.  </li>
            <li> During the small miracles where some wax is removed, absolutely no hair is.  </li>
            <li> I may end up cutting them in half &amp; using them for my bikini area! ; )</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about them not being what I wanted.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little messy when I cut them, but nothing that can&#x27;t be wiped up with a damp towel.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> There will be few instances where the layers of the paper come out, part of it will be in your hand and part of it still stuck to your skin.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of time, money, and effort.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not currently available.  </li>
            <li> These ones left behind a lot</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> but the strips it come with left strings behind and were messy.</li>
            <li> A half-hairy back just looks weird.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll ever use the mini-strips.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as my cotton tee shirts I usually cut up.</li>
            <li> I just got lazy and bought these.</li>
            <li> no more but hair for me</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the product, it didn&#x27;t really removed the hair</li>
            <li> The wax hardly sticks to it, therefore remains on the skin.</li>
            <li> Used with Gigi Brazilian hard wax..</li>
            <li> they did not absorb the hard wax well...</li>
            <li> these do not stick unless you press extremely hard because they are thick.</li>
            <li> Over time I feel that it loses the ability to pull off wax as efficiently.</li>
            <li> I find cutting them to smaller sizes to be easier to use.</li>
            <li> It arrived so late.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thick, sturdy and stick to the wax well.</li>
            <li> Strips are a bit thick..</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re alittle too thick</li>
            <li> Thick and salon quality.</li>
            <li> and they dont tear apart when ripping them off but not too thick to work with</li>
            <li> precut ... lazy persons dream !&lt;</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when making this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I tried these once using Body Honee wax and like them and give them 5 stars because the way the are made works well with that product-it doesn&#x27;t leave hardly any, if any, hair behind.</li>
            <li> Too thin strips.. Wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> do not grip the wax properly poor quality .</li>
            <li> I felt like they were a little on the thin side but wasn&#x27;t so bad that it seeped through.</li>
            <li> They make the process of waxing much less painful than the woven strips, will continue to purchase these.</li>
            <li> I realized I had the wrong ones.  </li>
            <li> Why is that so difficult?</li>
            <li> so these are useless for me</li>
            <li> You can go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> This is very very thin.</li>
            <li> that I wasn&#x27;t afraid to do it myself.</li>
            <li> but i tend to keep my home cold anyway...</li>
            <li> they are not flexible for waxing, so stiff and a horrible material.</li>
            <li> They work, haven&#x27;t failed me yet!</li>
            <li> I wont buy this one again. ~Sorry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible at hard wax</li>
            <li> It was painful.</li>
            <li> , however, I&#x27;ve always found it quite annoying when you buy the wax kits at WalMart or Target</li>
            <li> Can be annoying if waxing curves.</li>
            <li> I Hated These &amp; I Returned them&#x3D;</li>
            <li> SORRY!!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst strip brand I ever used.</li>
            <li> These strips were the worst.</li>
            <li> These are the WORST strips I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> TERRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> Never had anything worst.</li>
            <li> Horrible wax strips.</li>
            <li> these strips are horrible .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These strips are to be used with wax for hair removal. They are bigger than I expected and easy to cut, so I was able to use one of the large ones to cut into many smaller strips. These will last me years, probably, as I usually just wax my eyebrows. These are thicker than any I&#x27;ve gotten in waxing kits, which is nice because when you press them against the wax, none of the wax leaks through and so you don&#x27;t ever get a sticky residue on the top side. I would highly recommend these for waxing, great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.  Will order again!</li>
            <li> I do recommend it! Strips are soft and don&#x27;t rupture. Also small strips are very helpful in bikini wax .</li>
            <li> They work, haven&#x27;t failed me yet!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Go with the more expensive strips. They&#x27;ll actually work.</li>
            <li> These strips are great!  The smaller ones are perfect for the face area.  The big strips are way bigger than what I expected!  They are more for your legs I guess.  I may end up cutting them in half &amp; using them for my bikini area! ; )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;This is item has a deceptive description, the strips doesn&#x27;t have any wax on it, you still need to buy the WAX itself.</li>
            <li> This is the worst strip brand I ever used. The wax hardly sticks to it, therefore remains on the skin. Junk junk</li>
            <li> My wife says, \\&quot;It saves me the the expense of having to spend a  whole lot of money trying to wax arms and legs. This package comes with large and small strips. The large strips are convenient for larger areas and the smaller strips for upper lip, eyebrows, etc. It lasts a long long time. It is easy to use and worth the price. If you are trying to save money on waxing in the parlor, use this. However, I wonder if it deteriorates with time. I have had these for almost 2 years now because I don&#x27;t have to wax more then once in a couple of months. Over time I feel that it loses the ability to pull off wax as efficiently. Off late I struggle to use it as easily as I used to before. But that could be because of the kind of wax I am using and perhaps a variety of other reasons related to the skin and the length of hair but I cant say for sure. Overall I think its a great buy.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This works well, but is more like paper. There will be few instances where the layers of the paper come out, part of it will be in your hand and part of it still stuck to your skin.  But then it gets the job done most of the times...So a decent choice.</li>
            <li> These strips are terrific, and very well priced for the amount of product that you get.</li>
            <li> Good one !! Cleans up the wax quite easily without harming your skin</li>
            <li> They get the job done!</li>
            <li> They are so great. Happy to have them.</li>
            <li> Works great, a very good deal</li>
            <li> I use these with sally hensen&#x27;s hair removal wax and these work better than th strips that came with it! I like it :)</li>
            <li> These are not my favorite but work ok. Wax seeps thru them and gets my fingers all sticky.</li>
            <li> the item i ordered and the item i recieved were not what i thought they were.. tried to call distributer and ensure what i was ordering beforehand... distributor gave me manuf. num which no one answered.. so i ordered anyway and the product was not what i thought it was...</li>
            <li> Best wax strips whatsoever  If u know how to wax properly, they are the best tools! Very convenient with both sizes ( large and small) so you cant focus on detailed areas...  Very good price too... U can&#x27;t beat it  Definitely a must have</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it. My boyfriend has a hairy back. I don&#x27;t mind a little back waxing every now and again, however, I&#x27;ve always found it quite annoying when you buy the wax kits at WalMart or Target and they never give you enough strips. A half-hairy back just looks weird. Bought this pack of strips, and they worked great! I wish they were available for free Prime shipping though. :( Not sure if I&#x27;ll ever use the mini-strips. I wish they had an option of just 100 big strips.</li>
            <li> they work and are very nice, I would order again, IF I used the often enough, but alas I found that a razor is much faster :-)</li>
            <li> Product is great if used with Gigi Bees Wax. I recommend this product to anyone that waxes eyebrows or upper lip.</li>
            <li> These are some of the best wax strips I&#x27;ve used. When I used to get my eyebrows done by a professional, who has been waxing for 20 years, she used these too. They are strong and get all the wax off quickly and easily, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it seeping through and onto your fingers. On a side note, when I use these I notice that hair seems to grow back quicker than when I use woven cloth strips. However, this could be the wax I use or just my body&#x27;s natural chemistry.</li>
            <li> I have tried 4 different brands of waxing strips now and I have to say that this one is my favorite.  This is a very good quality wax strip, thick enough that the wax does not go through the paper and get my hands all sticky like the tan woven cloth-like ones even though it seems to hurt a little bit less with them it does not seem to completely grab all of it.  With these Fantasea Non-Woven Strips, is may hurt just a  little bit more, but is better since it grabs pretty much everything and seems to pull more of the roots out, which is what I want.  Also, eventually it will stunt the roots and stop growing all together which I have seen happen, much cheaper than electrolysis.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick so no wax bleeding through when you wax nice pre cut pieces makes it easier too.</li>
            <li> This set of strips has worked well for me. The strip itself has a waxy feeling when touched. But it gets wax off easily and leaves the skin clean. Good price for a good product. I will certainly buy more of this.</li>
            <li> I think this is an ok product, I honestly don&#x27;t like the fact that it&#x27;s too thick and has very little flexibility.</li>
            <li> Love these strips and they work well with Sally Hansen all-over body waxing.  Hansen kit does not give you a lot of strips, so these are great to have.</li>
            <li> Works perfect, pulls the hair superb, love the different sizes. It&#x27;s a great bang for your buck! Will order again in the future!</li>
            <li> These strips were the worst. They do not stick at all. I have tried them using two different waxes and they still do not work. It was a waste of time, money, and effort. Don&#x27;t even bother with this product because it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I find it nuts how all the drug store waxes have the crappiest strips. I have bought so many different type of wax and the strips they give you just don&#x27;t work well. I bought these and was finally able to use all the waxes I have collected over the past year or 2. Should have bought these a LONG time ago. They work great.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast! Works really good!</li>
            <li> Works great w/hard wax. Much easier to remove.</li>
            <li> These are the WORST strips I have ever used.  I thought I was ordering the kind I normally use and was confused by the poor reviews.  When I got these they weren&#x27;t the right ones, but I figured, why not give them a go.  TERRIBLE.  They do not adhere to the wax at all, leaving a mess all over my skin.  During the small miracles where some wax is removed, absolutely no hair is.  I wish I could go back and send these back the second I realized I had the wrong ones.  Please, please, please do not purchase these!</li>
            <li> These work wonders with hot wax.</li>
            <li> To me these are better than the fabric one&#x27;s. Gives me a nice crisp wax</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to buy this product again but it&#x27;s not currently available.  Great size, great product, good quality, and excellent price!  Bring it back on the market!</li>
            <li> Arrived SUPER fast; and they seem to do the trick - no complaints.</li>
            <li> Good price good quality</li>
            <li> I tried these once using Body Honee wax and like them and give them 5 stars because the way the are made works well with that product-it doesn&#x27;t leave hardly any, if any, hair behind. I totally recommend these for use with Body Honee wax.</li>
            <li> You would think that you see things like this more often, i just wanted strips, nothing else! Why is that so difficult? Ha well this is definately a produst ive purchased several of already, and added plus: suer fast shipping, and work amazing with the waxes that never include enough strips ;)</li>
            <li> i really like these strips they are perfect for waxing because they are really stiff which really helps removing the hair. the only thing is that the small strips are smaller then  they appear in picture. its a real good purchase</li>
            <li> Came super fast. Works great. Totally recommend it. The smaller strips are useless to me though, but there&#x27;s a lot of the bigger strips and it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
            <li> HAve used better ones. Does the job as stated. Does not completely remove hair and the wax soaks through these sheets. Prefer the muslin cloth sheets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert at waxing but I like to occasionally when I&#x27;d like to avoid razor bumps.  These strips have worked out well for me.</li>
            <li> I had never waxed before, either at home or professionally so I can&#x27;t really judge these against professional wax strips. These strips looked and felt identical to the ones that came in the Body Honee wax kit, and they worked just as well. I feel like the number of strips you get for the price was good, and I would definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> I was mislead or ignorant in the intent of this product. I thought they were the type with the wax included on the strips. not so. just the cloth</li>
            <li> Good solid strips that do no rip. Go well with Sally Hansen Brazilian Wax. Sizes of strips are optimal as well. Cheap for the amount of strips.</li>
            <li> These are slightly better than the strips that come with the BodyHonee wax, and you&#x27;re gonna need a ton more than what&#x27;s included. They&#x27;re thick and easy to use. I only wish there was a third size that was more of a square.</li>
            <li> Just strips...you can rewash and reuse if you use a sugar based wax</li>
            <li> I like this waxing strips because they are stiffer and easier to grip than the muslin strips that came with my waxing kit.</li>
            <li> Worked well to wax eyebrows</li>
            <li> The product does it&#x27;s job, what else is there to say? I originally bought these non-woven waxing strips because I didn&#x27;t like the cloth ones I had ordered earlier. Turns out I had judged the cloth ones too quickly - I ended up appreciating them a lot more than the woven ones. However, for anybody who dislikes cloth strips for any reason - they are harder to cut, for example - then these non-woven strips by Fantasea are excellent. I like that there were two sizes.</li>
            <li> Works great . No problems at all. Great price alsom</li>
            <li> Works perfect with the Gigi hard wax systems</li>
            <li> I was not able to use it on both sides as few reviews said, but still I love them for they get the job done perfect, this is my first time trying, sure will recommend</li>
            <li> /just a little bit different texture than I expected, was looking for one&#x27;s like in the kit, but still a good product</li>
            <li> These work very well. Very thick and great for home waxing. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with them ripping or anything, in fact they felt a little bit thicker than my normal strips.  I don&#x27;t have much use for the small strips but I like that they are included in the event that I may need them someday.</li>
            <li> I want my money back,waste of money.i was so excited to get it cuz if good reviews and affordable price.It doesn&#x27;t stick at all.I use Gigi wax should work fine but it didn&#x27;t stick and I have to remove the wax by my hands.It was painful.I don&#x27;t see why it has almost 5 stars on here.Id give a 0 if I can</li>
            <li> About what I expected, easy to use and there is plenty of them. However the big ones are HUGE. If you want pain, go ahead and use the whole thing. I find cutting them to smaller sizes to be easier to use. The small ones are a fairly decent size already.</li>
            <li> Excellent waxing strips! I prefer these over muslin strips. They&#x27;re thick, sturdy and stick to the wax well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really very good product, in a big quantity and with a excellent price... do you like more?!</li>
            <li> They just worked okay. Personally, I had much better results with muslin strips. These ones left behind a lot and I had to tweeze afterwards. It got a little better for me after the first few uses because I found that you have to do these a little differently than the other kinds but still not quite the results I wanted. It was worth a try for the money but I won&#x27;t purchase these again.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work as well as the strips that come with the Nad&#x27;s Eyebrow Shaper.  They do work okay will look for another brand next time.</li>
            <li> Great quality!! Daughter who just graduated esthetician school absolutely loved!! She was very excited about the great quality of these strips!! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The wax strips are just the right size for face and body waxing.  There soft yet durable and gently pull the unwanted hairs out.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. They are great material, they work like a charm and perfect sizes, I even cut them in half to make more...</li>
            <li> Fast shipping perfect product works great! I use them in my spa for waxing and work great with all types of wax I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> All i can say is that they work and were a nice addtion to my BodyHonee hair removal kit. Works as advertised!</li>
            <li> Came very fast.. but its rougher than what I thought it would have been.. and it still didnt help with the wax in fact it didn&#x27;t really stick to the wax and left the wax on my body and barely none on the strips.. I have to say that I did try both sides and left it sit for a long time hoping it would work.. it still nothing happens..</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am save so much money on waxing. Very easy to use.  I will recommend it.</li>
            <li> i was extremely satisfied with the product.. it was cheap and exaclty what i ordered... it also arrived very quickly</li>
            <li> Too thin strips.. Wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> Good for clean up and keeping wax from dripping from heat unit to application spot.  Didn&#x27;t work well for hair removal.</li>
            <li> Great quality for a great price. Loved the quantity. Will definitely buy these again to save money on my beauty care.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and always run out of wax strips before you run out of wax, this is the product! The strips work great, come in two sizes and are cheap (in price, not quality).</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I will buy again, it was so easy to try on that I wasn&#x27;t afraid to do it myself.</li>
            <li> stupidly me, this has no wax, i guess you need your own wax so these are useless for me</li>
            <li> Excellent product as usual! I always order FantaSea wax strips!! They are the best!</li>
            <li> Got these in addition to the Gigi student waxing kit. Wanted to try both types of strips. These work great and may go with them as there is a little less residual fibers left behind when you pull it off of skin.</li>
            <li> These are very handy and are of great quality. They last for a while, especially if you cut them down for smaller areas.</li>
            <li> They work good, got them right away and are a very reasonable price, I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Very good product, glad to be able to wax in the comfort of my own home. No mess left behind with this one.</li>
            <li> These strips ate not as good as others I&#x27;ve used but they work, I recommend buying wax removal as well</li>
            <li> Nair doesn&#x27;t give a lot of strips along with its roll on wax so I had to buy these. I must say, its a very good buy. Quality is good for the price.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the product, it didn&#x27;t really removed the hair all it did was it sucked up the wax like a sponge</li>
            <li> Use these with Sally Hansen waxing. They never give you enough in the packet, but these wax strips work great! I buy them all the time.</li>
            <li> Works great! A must when waxing. I use it for sugaring..</li>
            <li> bought these to work with my nair roll on wax. they work very well. theres a lot, so they&#x27;ll last a long time. i recommend them :)</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned. These strips to not work at all. I thought maybe they did not know how to use them. But after trying 5 different times and making sure I was doing it correctly. These strips did not pick up any wax or hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very durable and does not shred during use.</li>
            <li> They are everything I needed for the waxing to work I would recommend them to anyone needing to home wax</li>
            <li> It was fun to watch them squirm and squeal as they ripped the hair from their bodies. Just glad I had no part of it. lol</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t too sure when I ordered it cuz price is really low but I was surprised cuz it&#x27;s much better than wht I expected.</li>
            <li> epi strips ripped every time. Real brazillian wax and still, poor quality, as far as I tried. Wax applied thick, thin, hotter, medium...strips still fell apart on quick removal and little better than toilet tissue covered with paper towels. (Old tee-shirt strips prolly better than this product). I know they will remark user didn&#x27;t know this or that, hey, this isn&#x27;t rocket science, its hair removal. I wont buy this one again. ~Sorry!</li>
            <li> I Hated These &amp; I Returned them&#x3D;SORRY!!! Didn&#x27;t Work 4 Me&#x3D;SORRY About That~ I&#x27;ll Try the Rite Aid Store! Thanx!</li>
            <li> I felt like they were a little on the thin side but wasn&#x27;t so bad that it seeped through. Overall I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I would buy these again. Some in their write-ups for the GiGi Wax Wamer indicated they use bluejeans, etc. I would not want to go to that effort. This makes things quick and easy. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible at hard wax so I bought these strips.. Amazing. Used with Gigi Brazilian hard wax.. Amazing. Strips are a bit thick.. But it didn&#x27;t cause any problems, just different.</li>
            <li> This strips do not work. They pull three hairs and then, with next attempt, it sticks it back to the leg. Never had anything worst. If anybody has any tips, pls share.</li>
            <li> First time at home waxing. These are a must. I wish there were more small strips (I ended up cutting the large ones). I will order more.</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as I expected, with great adherence to hair. What else is there to say? Good deal!</li>
            <li> These are a perfect complement for use with the Gigi Hard Body Brazilian Wax. They are gorgeously inexpensive, but the cost of shipping puts them in the same league as the $8/$9 Gigi 100 LARGE Muslin strips (with free shipping for Amazon Prime members), while these strips are half large and half small. More simply, it seems like you get more for your money by purchasing the Gigi strips as an AP member than to buy these lovely, cheap, yet expensive to ship strips.</li>
            <li> LOVE THEM WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> These feel like good quality and are just as good as the ones that originally come with my Sally Hansen wax kit.  They are sturdy, strong and pick up the wax well.</li>
            <li> A+ Service and Product!</li>
            <li> These are great, no strings and pieces all over the place and they ate easy to cut to size too</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is meant for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were searching for the waxing strip which is not expensive and at the same time does the job! Our search at local pharmacy, super store did you yield anything substantial or was coming with other accessories which were not interested at all! So here was the stuff and we love it!</li>
            <li> thick and soft, got many of strip</li>
            <li> I just started waxing and bought the Gigi waxer kit. Love it but the strips it come with left strings behind and were messy. I saw these and they are awesome. I totally recommend.</li>
            <li> Just throw them out after you use it. The large size is really large, so I cut them in half, for a more manageable session. I would definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> Used this as a stand-in for the waxing strips included in the Sally Hansen All-Over Body Wax, as there weren&#x27;t enough strips included in that kit. It worked at least as good as those ones, so I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> These are inexpensive and still great quality.  You get tons in the pack and they will last a long time if only being used for waxing eyebrows and smaller areas.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when making this purchase.  I was expecting cheaper quality based on the price difference between these and the other strips I was looking at.  But I just decided to try it and I am so happy I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just started waxing myself and picked up a cheap pack of wax strips.  They would not come off or rip apart.  These do not!  They are strong, rip right off, you can re-use the strip more than once to remove wax.  It did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how they compare to higher quality strips, but if you are looking for something that does a good job without any issues, this is it!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for eyebrows, I use them with the nads facial pen. I cut the large strips down to size as well.</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as other brands I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Yup, wax strips. Pretty straight forward, gave me nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> They do exactly what they are supposed to do without tearing. Very good quality AND got a lot of them in the package compared to what other vendors offer.</li>
            <li> do not buy. what a waste of money. I have tried to use these and they have not remove one hair.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as my cotton tee shirts I usually cut up. I just got lazy and bought these.</li>
            <li> You can go wrong with this product. It has large and small strips, comes with 100 strips it last a long time too. My daughter and I use them.</li>
            <li> Just like what I was hoping for.  I was amazed on how many came in a package.  Great value for a great product.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few of these but they are soft and worked for me. Overall it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> I buy the cotton strips from Sally&#x27;s or Bed Bath and Beyond. This package come with really large ones that are big enough to do an arm or most of your leg and the smaller ones you can cut in half for eyebrows and mustache. Great price, will order again.</li>
            <li> I love love love love these wax strips. They make the process of waxing much less painful than the woven strips, will continue to purchase these.</li>
            <li> You definitely need wax strips.  THe waxing kit that I bought did not come with it.  The quality fo the strips is excellent and the price is good.</li>
            <li> I love these strips! They are exactly what I wanted. I&#x27;ve taught myself how to wax, with some help of youtube etc, :), and these are exactly what I was looking for. I was a little worried about them not being what I wanted. They take the hair completely off, not messy, etc. I love these strips! Shipping came fast actually arrived earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> These are great to use. I will buy again</li>
            <li> Product is just what I was looking for.  Thank you</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re alittle too thick</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was exactly what was described in listing. Better deal than in stores, thanks!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say whether this is a good product or not, they charged me for it, confirmed that it was shipping, but never sent it out. Then, keep on charging my bank account as if they never got payment, it&#x27;s been eight times now, and they are still trying. Had to put a hold on my account, file a fraudulent use claim, and a police report, who knows if I&#x27;ll ever get my money back, Amazon needs to just burn and go out of business all together!! I&#x27;ll be writing reviews on solo shopping sites that list them so people will actually read this, I know they won&#x27;t post it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a real cheap product. Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. You are better off with any other brand.</li>
            <li> i ordered these kuz they were very cheap compared to store costs. but they were not what i expected. it hurt twice more than using other strips and it&#x27;s not something i would buy in the future. i&#x27;d rather pay a little more for better quality.</li>
            <li> I like the strips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips are soft and both sides can be used by folding a little bit of the it in order to grab it.</li>
            <li> Ugh! Parisas are much better</li>
            <li> We use it at home, I bought a wax warmer for my wife and we usually use just one per session as 1 strip can be used several times...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first we were using a strip per area or wax application and per session we were using around 10 strips or more but as you get more practice you&#x27;ll notice that you can use the same strip several times per session...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good wax strips if you want to use them at home with wax or with sugar wax (sugaring)... We have used GiGi All Purpose Honee and our home-made sugar wax...</li>
            <li> These wax strips are great they are a must buy. Thick and salon quality.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the strips! Their better quality than my wax lady&#x27;s one. I feel less pain using these to wax.</li>
            <li> Works great, no issues.</li>
            <li> Fantastic item and quick business at a great value...The quality is perfect. Would highly recommend to any other interested individual.</li>
            <li> Great for home waxing. I use these with a cold wax and they work great. They feel like professional grade waxing strips.</li>
            <li> They work just like the strips that came in the Sally Hansen Body Wax Kit.  They&#x27;re a little messy when I cut them, but nothing that can&#x27;t be wiped up with a damp towel.  The little strips are great for touch-ups and sensitive bikini areas, though I never used them on my face, so can&#x27;t rate them there.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> The paper absorbes the wax and does not stick very well to the wax. I do blame the All Natural BodyHonee wax.</li>
            <li> What do I say... Nice!!!</li>
            <li> These are great strips for waxing that I do at home. The smaller ones are a nice size for smaller areas such as around the face. The larger strips are great for legs, arms, etc and can be easily cut down if needed. They lift off the with ease if you pull in the opposite direction in which you smoothed them down. I use the strips with my silk and smooth aloe Vera hot wax and they are even sturdy enough to reuse a couple of times. Great buy!</li>
            <li> The price is great and so is the quality! I will most definitely be ordering this again without a doubt!</li>
            <li> This is very very thin. Strips a little thicker is better than this</li>
            <li> These work very well and are a must-purchase with the BodyHonee Hair Removal Waxing Kit, as the kit doesn&#x27;t come with anywhere near enough.</li>
            <li> No issues. They are precut to the right sizes.</li>
            <li> Perfect companion for the Body Honee home waxing kits. The kit only comes with 5-10 strips but so much more wax than that, so these plain dry strips go with it perfectly. I will definitely get these again, I love being smooth for a fraction of the cost of the salon.</li>
            <li> It does the job. And I use both sides sometimes. Did not tear at anytime. I will keep buying these.</li>
            <li> i also got these strips because there are not enough strips in the sally hansen kit. the strips in the kit were perfect. these do not stick unless you press extremely hard because they are thick.</li>
            <li> This was just what i was looking for! works great and you get a lot of bang for your buck!!</li>
            <li> I got  with the purchase of &amp;#34;hard wax&amp;#34; which you technically do not need strips... But supposedly you CAN use. they did not absorb the hard wax well... but i tend to keep my home cold anyway... so maybe the wax hardened too quickly? I dunno. I just know while the wax sticks to f&#x27;ing EVERYTHING, these strips? Not so much.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is that it&#x27;s a bit stiffer than I prefer. But these strips are really good at picking up hair and they feel pretty comfortable against the skin.</li>
            <li> These strips are used for facial waxing (eyebrow, lip). Thick, quality made material, that is easy to use with any type of wax. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying a new Sally Hansen Wax kit every time I used up all the wax strips.  I gave these a try and they work really well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment product as described</li>
            <li> great wax strips, work very well</li>
            <li> works great for home wax and hair removal</li>
            <li> Great quality, strong would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These work better then the ones that come with my Gigi warmer kit! They don&#x27;t let the wax soak thru to the other side and seem to attach to the wax better.</li>
            <li> The smaller one is very small. So only on finger we can use it. No worth to buy it</li>
            <li> Nice to have more strips than wax! Convenient sizes and easy to cut smaller if needed. Thank you for offering such a practical product at a good price.</li>
            <li> First off, knowy what you really want  before you buy. I thought I was ordering wax strips, with the wax in them. These are not those. They seem to be a good VALUE for what the product is. Guess I need to use correcr terms when using Amazon search.</li>
            <li> These work great. I bought wax and didnt think I needed strips. When I realized I did I bought these and they worked amazing.</li>
            <li> Great little strips.  They work well!</li>
            <li> no more but hair for me</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. Really happy with it.I wish the kit had all long strips instead of the long and small ones togther.</li>
            <li> These are very good  Has different sizes&lt;br /&gt;Value for your money  I have purchased these before&lt;br /&gt;and will continue to buy them</li>
            <li> Does a good job of removing hairs with GIGI wax</li>
            <li> these are good good price fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great product, arriving before time estimated</li>
            <li> They are pieces of paper you stick wax on and stick to your body, not much to praise or complain about here.</li>
            <li> On time delivery. Product as advertised</li>
            <li> it did not work good and . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Works great. Exactly what I expected. Just wish it was a resealable container because they were constantly falling everywhere in the drawer</li>
            <li> Came.on time and works great. Had to cut some down but works fine for me. I recommend these strips to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was used to the woven cloth strips, but since trying these out I am sold. They do a great job removing hair and do not leave any lint behind.</li>
            <li> I used Gigi&#x27;s muslin cloth roll for waxing before I came across these. After giving these a try I will stick with em from now onwards.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-- Wax doesn&#x27;t bleed through (atleast Gigi&#x27;s all purpose honee wax doesn&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;-- precut ... lazy persons dream !&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-- Gets creased immediately if it gets folded. Can be annoying if waxing curves.</li>
            <li> I like the product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to remove hair with wax.  Good product for an unpleasant job.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Exactly what I needed. Very happy with my purchase. It arrived so late. I was patiently waiting but thankfully it works.</li>
            <li> These are great!! I purchased them after getting the gigi brazilian waxing kit and they help you save a lot on wax, its faster to remove it with the strips( much swifter) I love theses!</li>
            <li> I really like how well these grip the wax. Even when the was doesn&#x27;t grip the hair properly I&#x27;m not left with a gooey mess.</li>
            <li> This strips are very convenient and easy to use. Never had problems using them.</li>
            <li> I normally use Gigi muslin strips for wax and decided to try another product if only to compare. The strips seem fine, yet did not work well at all for me. As I&#x27;ve never used this strips before, I don&#x27;t know if this may be due to a new wax (Sally Hansen Natural Honey), which I&#x27;ve already been having issues with using. I will update this review when I&#x27;ve tried with my regular wax again, but based on current experience, I would strongly recommend using woven strips over these.</li>
            <li> Waxing is never painless but with high quality strips like this at least you never have to deal with uneven results which you’ll need to something about a second time.</li>
            <li> Horrible wax strips. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these. Barely removed any hair when waxing</li>
            <li> The greatest waxing strips ever!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product that covers all waxing job sizes.  They are thick enough the waz don&#x27;t bleed through and they dont tear apart when ripping them off but not too thick to work with</li>
            <li> Great product, no problems, quick to ship, Item exactly as explained in the description. well worth the money, great price.</li>
            <li> These strips are great. Much better than I expected. The price was great as well. After using these, I wash and later resuse them. They work just as well being reused as they did with the first use. Deffinately worth buying.</li>
            <li> If i could give it 0....these strips are horrible . do not grip the wax properly poor quality . they are not flexible for waxing, so stiff and a horrible material. ripped my freakin skin off trying to clean the remaining wax all over. DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> Very gound wax strips. Works well with Completely Bare Wax.</li>
            <li> Does the job and does not tear!</li>
            <li> It in perfect condition and I love it</li>
            <li> These strips do not seem to grip the wax very well. When I am done waxing there are still hairs there. I tried them several times. I did the prep correctly as always but they do not compare to the ones I buy from folica. I ordered now from folica and tossed these away.</li>
            <li> Good texture, but odd sizes.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for waxing my armpits.  My husband complained that with the Muslin Strips he felt the wax did not adhere as good when doing a large area.  These strips are thicker than the Muslin strips and different material.  They work great for larger areas such as the armpits where you might be using a heavier coat of wax.  Only used 1 strip per arm.  Great buy and should last me a while since I will only be using these strips for one area of my body!  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> These did not work for me.  At all.  I use Parissa Sugar Wax, and have no trouble waxing when I use strips that come with their kit.  But when I used these strips as a replacement to finish up wax I had left over, they did not work.</li>
            <li> These combined with Hard wax are the best method of hair removal I&#x27;ve tried. They don&#x27;t always get a good grip on areas with lots of thick hair though. I learned that it helps if you reach underneath the strip and grip the edge of the wax you&#x27;re about to pull up, instead of just pulling the strip itself.</li>
            <li> They get the job done for waxing.</li>
