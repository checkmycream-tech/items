            <li> Great goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are really great. They are pencil, but the color goes on very smoothly. I don&#x27;t have to burn the tip with a lighter, like you often have to with pencils. They are black and have not irritated my skin at all. Overall great quality and great price.</li>
            <li> Nice product...easy to use but only used them for a performance in a school play.  I needed this many for many characters.  So I did not use the pencil personally but my daughter says hers worked good.  I thought it was good quality and a decent price for the 12 pieces...I recommend!</li>

            <li> These are quality and affordable all in the same lil package!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth an doesn&#x27;t smear. Stays on good to. Like doesn&#x27;t dissappear after a while. Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> wonderful product and goes on very smooth.. will be ordering more</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I ordered but works great</li>
            <li> My wife found these on here for herself and thinks they work just as well as any name brand store bought eyeliner. The part that sold her was the price!</li>
            <li> I love eyeliner! This is the softest most darkest black eye liner ever! It glides right on without any force or pressure! I&#x27;m buying more!!!!! Thanks seller!!!!:)</li>

            <li> Way too many pencils. I&#x27;ll never use them all!</li>
            <li> These are great! I wish they stuck on a bit better. I have to constantly wipe away smears around my eyes.</li>
