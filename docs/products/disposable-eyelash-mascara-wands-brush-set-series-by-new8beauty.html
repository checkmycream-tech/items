            <li>This set came quickly and is of high quality.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the free beauty ebook &amp; the free mascara along with THE 50 MASCARA WANDS &amp; the pink thing.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping exactly as described.</li>

            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>They work very well.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t quite figured out the pink tool is supposed to work, but the little tiny comb teeth on the handle end are great  for separating lashes once the mascara is on!</li>
            <li>This video gives my thoughts on these particular mascara wands and shows you how to use them along with the mascara shield.</li>
            <li>Made of high quality materials.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived exactly as advertized and exactly when it was expected.  </li>
            <li>Along with the pink thing, the ONLY issue I had is I didn&#x27;t RECEIVED &amp;#34;The FREE Mascara Shield Applicator Guard Guide Comb &amp; Beauty eBook&amp;#34; ..</li>
            <li>The guard really helps with preventing accidental mascara smears under and above  the eyes.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not just for professional people.</li>
            <li>They are soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>As a professional make up artist</li>
            <li>I thought I needed to buy a new one, but apparently it was the brush that needed to be replaced!</li>
            <li>I do have a bit of a problem with the waste of using these just one time and throwing them away so will clean these with antibacterial soap and continue using them.</li>
            <li>Some mascara wands are sold at outrageous prices especially if they are really great quality, but the disposable mascara wands from this seller are top quality plus they are completely affordable.</li>
            <li>It makes a big difference in how mascara goes on when you&#x27;re not using an old brush.  </li>
            <li>The price was ok, but not great.</li>
            <li>The spoolly is narrow enough to get right in the roots of the lashes without poking out eyeballs.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t quite figured out the pink tool is supposed to work, but the little tiny comb teeth on the handle end are great  for separating lashes once the mascara is on!</li>
            <li> This video gives my thoughts on these particular mascara wands and shows you how to use them along with the mascara shield.</li>
            <li> Made of high quality materials.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived exactly as advertized and exactly when it was expected.  </li>
            <li> Along with the pink thing, the ONLY issue I had is I didn&#x27;t RECEIVED &amp;#34;The FREE Mascara Shield Applicator Guard Guide Comb &amp; Beauty eBook&amp;#34; ..</li>
            <li> The guard really helps with preventing accidental mascara smears under and above  the eyes.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not just for professional people.</li>
            <li> They are soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> As a professional make up artist</li>
            <li> I thought I needed to buy a new one, but apparently it was the brush that needed to be replaced!</li>
            <li> I do have a bit of a problem with the waste of using these just one time and throwing them away so will clean these with antibacterial soap and continue using them.</li>
            <li> Some mascara wands are sold at outrageous prices especially if they are really great quality, but the disposable mascara wands from this seller are top quality plus they are completely affordable.</li>
            <li> It makes a big difference in how mascara goes on when you&#x27;re not using an old brush.  </li>
            <li> The price was ok, but not great.</li>
            <li> The spoolly is narrow enough to get right in the roots of the lashes without poking out eyeballs.</li>
            <li> I broke the brush of an expensive tube of mascara that was still very full.</li>
            <li> Those did not last long</li>
            <li> so they last twice as long.</li>
            <li> I have allergy eyes so not having to use the same brush repeatedly worked extremely well for me</li>
            <li> I even told my eye doctor on a subsequent visit that I found them on amazon so that he could tell his other patients about them.  </li>
            <li> Was just as I expected.</li>
            <li> I have not tried to figure out the pink guard thing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get what I expected to GET</li>
            <li> I also like the pink mascara tool that comes with them &amp; the zip up bag they come in.</li>
            <li> I ordered these mascara wands because I was having eye issues due to contact lens usage.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> In use these for every day application because the built-in wand gets the mascara too heavy and clumped.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it from another website but that website is always out of stock</li>
            <li> Why do I buy such useless junk??  </li>

            <li> Surprisingly Very Nice Quality.  Nicely packaged.  Fast Service.  A+</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> These arrived so quickly and look to be perfect for my daughter, who helps her friends do makeup. We haven&#x27;t tried these mascara wands yet, so can&#x27;t yet vouch for their quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted/expected. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I recently took a makeup course and these were such a great deal.  I paid much more than this for some from Mac.  Those did not last long and so I ordered these.  These are great for doing makeup for weddings and groups.  They are made to be disposable but they do grab a good amount of mascara which makes using them fairly easy.  It is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> So many brushes and a free mascara applier is such a great deal! I loved this!</li>
            <li> The mascara protector could not get UNDER  my lower lashes enough to put mascara on.  It was no use.  But I love the brushes. .They are strong, sturdy and combs the lashes effectively.</li>
            <li> The Mascara Shield Applicator Guard Guide Comb actually worked. I did not get mascara on my eyelid. The comb allows the guard to fit right on your lash-line. The wands can coat your lashes better having a solid surface to brush on. The wands are good quality too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Made of high quality materials.  Very nice packaging and presentation.  I purchased to use for dying my eyebrows, adding castor oil to eyebrows and also switching out my mascara brush.  It makes a big difference in how mascara goes on when you&#x27;re not using an old brush.  Company really cares about customer satisfaction.  Nice ebook included.Thank you</li>
            <li> These mascara brushes are great.  I use them after washing my face to keep my eyelashes curling upwards.  They work like a good hairbrush works on your hair.  The guard really helps with preventing accidental mascara smears under and above  the eyes.  These are a definite keeper.</li>
            <li> These are great for home. They&#x27;re not just for professional people. I love them for travel!</li>
            <li> I use these mostly for my eyebrows, but also for separating my eyelashes after applying mascara.  My daughters love these so I am relieved because there really are a lot of them included in the package.</li>
            <li> The wands were exactly as anticipated.  I also liked the mascara applicator tool.  It was a nice addition to the wands.</li>
            <li> Good price for this pack, and depending on what you use them for, they could last quite a while. The free mascara shield is actually a pretty nice bonus.</li>
            <li> I was very very quick arrival time! also appreciate the free mascara applicator - it&#x27;s a nice bonus and super-helpful! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good value &amp; great quality mascara brushes.</li>
            <li> I use this at night for a home mix to help my eyelashs and eyebrows. It work great. I can throw the one I use away each night and keep things nice and clean. My home mix goes on easy. Will probably buy again when this supply runs out. Another winner, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bought these to apply home made lash building formula. While I was at it I replaced the brush from my mascara. I thought I needed to buy a new one, but apparently it was the brush that needed to be replaced!</li>
            <li> Just what I need for my eyebrow mousse. This goes with a product I ordered from Sephora. A very good price.</li>
            <li> I use these to comb excess mascara off of my lashes and I love them.&lt;br /&gt;I also use them to apply avocado oil to my lashes at bedtime...***Beauty Secret*** Avocado Oil helps strengthen lashes and helps fallen lashes grow back quicker. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m neutral-, it&#x27;s a mascara brush, nothing special. The price was ok, but not great. I didn&#x27;t get the free protector thing.</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying mascara - quick and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> Over priced! Not worth it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping exactly as described. Perfect for any make-up artist. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Received the product as promised. Great service!</li>
            <li> My mascara wands arrived in a neat reusable package for easy storage and travel. They were very full and I can see them being used for a variety of tasks from eyebrow grooming to cleaning up extra mascara on lashes. They are soft and flexible. This seller went to exceptional lengths to get my products to me and notified me at every step.</li>
            <li> did not receive the eyelash mascara wand brush set. Instead I had received some set of nail art tools/brushes</li>
            <li> arrived fast and love the brushes use them for my oils for eyelashes and eyebrows</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moPUQN5RJ4QA91]]I work as a professional makeup artist and keeping my tools sanitized and fresh is one of my top priorities. Some mascara wands are sold at outrageous prices especially if they are really great quality, but the disposable mascara wands from this seller are top quality plus they are completely affordable. I love that these wands also happen to come with a mascara shield which makes application a lot easier and neater. This video gives my thoughts on these particular mascara wands and shows you how to use them along with the mascara shield.</li>
            <li> Bought these to help keep mascara from growing bacteria, to remove clumps, and to dye eyelashes. The brushes were higher quality than I expected, the shield is awesome if you have long lashes or constantly get mascara on your eyelid when applying. The packaging was very nice as well, they came in a heavy gauge zip pouch. What these are really good for is tinting eyelashes without getting the tint on you. The shield makes it so much easier. You can get the brushes anywhere, but I have never seen the shield before. Seems like a good company that really wants you to be satisfied with your purchase. I would not hesitate to buy from them again. Good all around experience and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great! arrived quickly and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Was just as I expected.</li>
            <li> These wands were delivered as promised and are just what I needed.  They come in a nice neat package too.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and would order again.</li>
            <li> These brushes work very well for my home made mascara.  I have not tried to figure out the pink guard thing.</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying trendy mascara, cutting the bristles to your favorite shape or tight-lining and of course, applying castor oil before bed to condition &amp; grow &amp; thicken your lashes.  Perfect for sharing with friends while staying hygienic. So glad to have found these at a great price!  The seller has been lovely to work with.</li>
            <li> These disposeable mascara wands make my job so much easier. I usually buy it from another website but that website is always out of stock so I came across these and I am so glad that I did. There is a lot more wands so they last twice as long. I even use it for my personal use too.</li>
            <li> These are great quality for the price. It arrived quickly and was packaged nicely. Originally bought them to tint my lashes but now i also use them to separate lashes before and after applying mascara. Will definitely buy fron again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I especially love the shield!  The wands work well and I like the curve.</li>
            <li> I broke the brush of an expensive tube of mascara that was still very full. These brushes actually are better than the brush in the tube. They are real good at applying mascara on individual eyelashes and the corner of the eyes. Also good for removing a clump if I apply too much. I would buy them again!</li>
            <li> A lot came in the package and I still have a bunch left, they work great</li>
            <li> The Mascara! Wands! came! Along with the pink thing, the ONLY issue I had is I didn&#x27;t RECEIVED &amp;#34;The FREE Mascara Shield Applicator Guard Guide Comb &amp; Beauty eBook&amp;#34; ..I didn&#x27;t get what I expected to GET once I purchased an order form I didn&#x27;t get the free beauty ebook &amp; the free mascara along with THE 50 MASCARA WANDS &amp; the pink thing.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes - so easy to use.  So happy to find them!</li>
            <li> Very good quality.  Came really fast. Seller seemed very nice and proactive though I didn&#x27;t have any problem with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Items as described.</li>
            <li> These are what I was expecting.  Good for using to un-clump mascara.</li>
            <li> Nice disposable brushes.</li>
            <li> I RECIEVED MY ITEM ON TIME. EVERYTHING IS OK. I DIDN&#x27;T HAVE TO SPEAK TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! Works really good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than I expected. I am very impressed with the quality!  As a professional make up artist I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great product for many uses! I use one every evening to apply castor oil to my eyelashes and eyebrows! They are perfect for separating lashes after mascara applications, too!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use these for my makeup course at my cosmetology school. Excellent bulk size</li>
            <li> I have allergy eyes so not having to use the same brush repeatedly worked extremely well for me</li>
            <li> Great item! It does what it is supposed to do. Used it for the first time this morning without any issues.</li>
            <li> The product arrived exactly as advertized and exactly when it was expected.  It was nicely packaged and included a free gift, a mascara guard guide comb.  I was impressed with the product, the price and the service</li>
            <li> Well made great price using with recipe from you tube to lengthen lashes. Great to deal with, will order again.</li>
            <li> I ordered these mascara wands because I was having eye issues due to contact lens usage.  I ordered these so that on days I was wearing makeup I would not risk transferring any bacteria into the mascara tube.  They work very well.  The seller was great and they came quickly.  I even told my eye doctor on a subsequent visit that I found them on amazon so that he could tell his other patients about them.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> Great addition to my MUA kit. The spoolly is narrow enough to get right in the roots of the lashes without poking out eyeballs. Love!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs! I bought these to try a home remedy for growing thicker eyelashes. They have held up well &amp; don&#x27;t break easily. I also like the pink mascara tool that comes with them &amp; the zip up bag they come in. So helpful since I don&#x27;t need to transfer them to a ziploc bag after opening them. I&#x27;m a happy customer &amp; will be buying these again!😊</li>
            <li> I am so thankful these are available. They are well made. Has a long ,sturdy plastic stem, and the brush itself is of great quality I think.  I use the brush that comes with mascara, only as a lid closing for my bottle, that wand never touches my eye. This keeps the mascara inside clean and free of demodex mites that are always present on our face and lashes. I never &amp;#34;double dip&amp;#34; any wand. I then discard it and use another one the next day. This has made my use of daily (eye) contacts much more comfortable to wear as well.</li>
            <li> Why do I buy such useless junk??  One of those nothing else to do night&#x27;s when your still up at 4am.</li>
            <li> I have an eye infection which means I cannot put my mascara brush back into the tube without contaminating the mascara (which means I re-contaminate my eyes) so I have to go to disposal mascara wands.  This set came quickly and is of high quality.  Also love the eyelash guard.  Have never seen one of those.  I do have a bit of a problem with the waste of using these just one time and throwing them away so will clean these with antibacterial soap and continue using them.</li>
            <li> In use these for every day application because the built-in wand gets the mascara too heavy and clumped. I haven&#x27;t quite figured out the pink tool is supposed to work, but the little tiny comb teeth on the handle end are great  for separating lashes once the mascara is on!</li>
            <li> They are very durable and work great with home-made mascara.</li>
            <li> Very Good quality brushes</li>
