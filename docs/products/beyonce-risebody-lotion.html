            <li>Smells great and long lasting</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour or so.  </li>
            <li>I first smelled it in a kohls store and that is what made me want to get it</li>
            <li>I was really surprised because I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be genuine.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like how it smells at first</li>
            <li>Not only do I admire Beyonce, I love her perfume.</li>
            <li>Definitely an all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I love perfume, and have used a lot of different ones, and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>smell ok don&#x27;t think i will buy again does not last</li>
            <li>;) smells a bit floral not fruity like everything else out there.</li>
            <li>The bottle is too pretty to throw away.</li>
            <li>and it come sooo fast right on time</li>
            <li>I love how soft it is, but not too soft that it doesn&#x27;t stand out.</li>
            <li>It is too strong at first, but wait several minutes</li>
            <li>Soft and sweet just like me.  </li>
            <li>The scent is soft but not too sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>it not to strong or loud very soft fragrance Love$trongerDenPr!de</li>
            <li>Its strong enough that you continue to smell it but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It is a good size bottle but the smell does not last long.</li>
            <li>i really like it 2.....</li>
            <li>comments how much she likes it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>And it fades fast.</li>
            <li>hopfully she likes it thanks</li>
            <li>it got here fast...</li>
            <li>Beyonce&#x27;s line  is one my daughter really likes.</li>
            <li>I really like this product in this perfume.</li>
            <li>and i can tell you its so so sweet and its lasting</li>
            <li>The perfume arrived early and was the real thing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using my fathers account, and this product came within decent timing.</li>
            <li>Was not to thrilled with the scent although the price was pretty decent in comparison to worse scents out there.</li>
            <li>I love heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li>Sweet scent doesn&#x27;t stick around long.</li>
            <li>It has a powdery fresh scent to it and you must place it on pulse points for a longer lasting scent..</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a new perfume for some time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this fragrance was from a gift set I purchased on clearance after Christmas at a local store.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it took so long, but it did and on top of that the box was wet when I got it.</li>
            <li>so ill say this was a good experience to try something new.</li>
            <li>Musky and masculine and not at all what I smelled in the store.</li>
            <li>I wife uses it frequently and always</li>
            <li>The scent last whole day on you.  </li>
            <li>It makes me feel young again.</li>
            <li>i feel it classy and sophiscated.</li>
            <li>it was gentle enough for my nose.</li>
            <li>I guess she&#x27;s like all the other stars and just has to have a perfume scent that is&#x27;nt worth buying.</li>
            <li>It really smells good,and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li>I had to take a second shower for my husband to come near me.</li>
            <li>I could barely smell it on me.</li>
            <li>The last thing I wanted was an old spoiled rancid bottle of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Knowing I always save a few dollars, I found the exact perfume on Amazon and purchased it.</li>
            <li>the perfume really thought it would have been watered down</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is such a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Maybe baby fresh powder scent</li>
            <li> Nice scent but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Its worth the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to have a big bottle</li>
            <li> REALLY WORTH FOR MONEY.</li>
            <li> It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume and was surprised at the lovely bottle it comes in.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent by Beyonce this far.</li>
            <li> It is the second perfume I liked after calvin kelin euphoria.</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle</li>
            <li> and I was right.</li>
            <li> Beyonce has done it right with his Fragrences</li>
            <li> And most importantly lasts aaallll day long.</li>
            <li> The perfume is a large bottle not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Really modern, sweet, hippy</li>
            <li> i really like it and recommend to the people who like sweet smell</li>
            <li> Not sweet, is elegant and confident.</li>
            <li> It is light scented like I live my perfumes.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my grandmother, is so fresh you dont have to be a young women for enjoy it</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad it isn&#x27;t just another version of Heat but a completely different fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells great and long lasting</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour or so.  </li>
            <li> I first smelled it in a kohls store and that is what made me want to get it</li>
            <li> I was really surprised because I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be genuine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how it smells at first</li>
            <li> Not only do I admire Beyonce, I love her perfume.</li>
            <li> Definitely an all time favorite.</li>
            <li> I love perfume, and have used a lot of different ones, and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> smell ok don&#x27;t think i will buy again does not last</li>
            <li> ;) smells a bit floral not fruity like everything else out there.</li>
            <li> The bottle is too pretty to throw away.</li>
            <li> and it come sooo fast right on time</li>
            <li> I love how soft it is, but not too soft that it doesn&#x27;t stand out.</li>
            <li> It is too strong at first, but wait several minutes</li>
            <li> Soft and sweet just like me.  </li>
            <li> The scent is soft but not too sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> it not to strong or loud very soft fragrance Love$trongerDenPr!de</li>
            <li> Its strong enough that you continue to smell it but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It is a good size bottle but the smell does not last long.</li>
            <li> i really like it 2.....</li>
            <li> comments how much she likes it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> And it fades fast.</li>
            <li> hopfully she likes it thanks</li>
            <li> it got here fast...</li>
            <li> Beyonce&#x27;s line  is one my daughter really likes.</li>
            <li> I really like this product in this perfume.</li>
            <li> and i can tell you its so so sweet and its lasting</li>
            <li> The perfume arrived early and was the real thing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using my fathers account, and this product came within decent timing.</li>
            <li> Was not to thrilled with the scent although the price was pretty decent in comparison to worse scents out there.</li>
            <li> I love heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> Sweet scent doesn&#x27;t stick around long.</li>
            <li> It has a powdery fresh scent to it and you must place it on pulse points for a longer lasting scent..</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new perfume for some time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very natural.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this fragrance was from a gift set I purchased on clearance after Christmas at a local store.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took so long, but it did and on top of that the box was wet when I got it.</li>
            <li> so ill say this was a good experience to try something new.</li>
            <li> Musky and masculine and not at all what I smelled in the store.</li>
            <li> I wife uses it frequently and always</li>
            <li> The scent last whole day on you.  </li>
            <li> It makes me feel young again.</li>
            <li> i feel it classy and sophiscated.</li>
            <li> it was gentle enough for my nose.</li>
            <li> I guess she&#x27;s like all the other stars and just has to have a perfume scent that is&#x27;nt worth buying.</li>
            <li> It really smells good,and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> I had to take a second shower for my husband to come near me.</li>
            <li> I could barely smell it on me.</li>
            <li> The last thing I wanted was an old spoiled rancid bottle of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Knowing I always save a few dollars, I found the exact perfume on Amazon and purchased it.</li>
            <li> the perfume really thought it would have been watered down</li>
            <li> but then when i ordered here and got it the smell was totally different and didn&#x27;t last long like the one I sprayed on at the store.</li>
            <li> The big thing is it dont last long</li>
            <li> I wore it twice it doesnt last long.</li>
            <li> Smell was not strong or lasting I think this was OLD or expired</li>
            <li> The fragrances are what I have been wanting for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on long</li>
            <li> So I really do no use it and have put it on the back burner.</li>
            <li> It is softer than Heat and is sweeter and lasts just as long as Heat</li>
            <li> the smell is so different from other perfumes i have..</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last very long either as other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a very long time, I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I described all her fragrances as having a dry note.</li>
            <li> Not good quality but shipping was fast</li>
            <li> finally rather than the little travel size perfumes ive always gotten.</li>
            <li> It not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The other is Heat.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy this perfume or any other perfume of Beyonce&#x27;s again.</li>
            <li> I have used Beyonce&#x27;s Heat for over a year and was looking for the other fragarences and found Pulse here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Product was colored very dark and the fragrance was very limited.</li>
            <li> I have used Beyonce for a long time and this product did not even come close to equalling what I have used in the past</li>
            <li> Its pictured upside down.</li>
            <li> The pic is upside down.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s slightly citrus.</li>
            <li> It smelled a little rancid to me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any woman who doesn&#x27;t like heavy perfume.</li>
            <li> However,  its pointless to purchase being that it lasts for less than an hour.  </li>
            <li> The scent is decent, but it didn&#x27;t entices or made me crazy like Dior Addict 2 and</li>
            <li> I received a defective product that never should&#x27;ve made it past inspection.  </li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t help much when you don&#x27;t like the smell of it :(</li>
            <li> &quot; Anyway&#x27;s I sprayed on alot because it was hard to smell</li>
            <li> There are a lot of secondary ones after this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a perfume fanatic and this one smells like alcohol.</li>
            <li> I ordered the product new through Amazon to avoid sketchy resellers, and I&#x27;m so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I found it much less expensive on Amazon</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has little to no staying power.</li>
            <li> Yet, I  was a little skeptical of purchasing it online.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a men&#x27;s version of this stuff, but this is the exact one I ordered - the one on THIS page, and it is terrible!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a faint scent of something but not sure of what.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of Victoria&#x27;s Secret Dream Angels Heavenly.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, waste my money ;&#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Perfume arrived broken!</li>
            <li> Not much impressive</li>

            <li> Perfect for the price I love it</li>
            <li> awesome scent. i bought this perfume for my girlfriend and i can tell you its so so sweet and its lasting, you should try it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful scent, and not over bearing. It&#x27;s light, sensual and sexy. I would recommend this to any woman who doesn&#x27;t like heavy perfume.</li>
            <li> It smells very good and the size is perfect for a good present to a girlfriend or wife or just a friend.</li>
            <li> Not to bad but I hopefully is better perfume</li>
            <li> The aroma is marvelous.  Soft and sweet just like me.  Pulse is one of my favorite perfumes.  The other is Heat.  The fragrances are what I have been wanting for a long time.  Amazon offered them at a fantastic price and were delivered perfectly, right to my door.  You can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> absolutely love this! thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume...Also try Beyonce&#x27;s Heat!!!&lt;br /&gt;Both smells great. The scent lastes all day.</li>
            <li> excellent perfume smells very well recommend</li>
            <li> It another great perfume by Beyonce Knowles</li>
            <li> Excellent scent very light and feminine</li>
            <li> Thanx, purchase and deliverery went fine</li>
            <li> Not good quality but shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Smell was not strong or lasting I think this was OLD or expired</li>
            <li> Smells very good price was reasonable gots to get more fragrances from here nice size bottle luv it not to strong or loud very soft fragrance Love$trongerDenPr!de</li>
            <li> Pulse is an amazing scent for Spring where as Heat is amazing for Fall and Winter. I&#x27;m so glad it isn&#x27;t just another version of Heat but a completely different fragrance. Best part is, like Heat, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Thanks very good product recommended 100%</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of perfumes because strong smells give me headaches. I smelled this one at a local store and really liked the smell of it; sweet and light. I found it much less expensive on Amazon so I ordered it here. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells great and long lasting</li>
            <li> Love pulse by Beyonce come on time.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a new perfume for some time. My sister and her friend smelled this scent in-store and she called and told me to check it out. I also found it in a store and loved it! Knowing I always save a few dollars, I found the exact perfume on Amazon and purchased it. After reading reviews saying this scent is fruity and floral (which is what I thought in-store), I placed my order happily.  It arrived yesterday and it was AWFUL! I sprayed it on and hated it. I smelled like a man! I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a men&#x27;s version of this stuff, but this is the exact one I ordered - the one on THIS page, and it is terrible! Musky and masculine and not at all what I smelled in the store. I had to take a second shower for my husband to come near me. I am soooo disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is a great buy - a lovely fragrance in an ample size for such a reasonable price.  I gave it as a Christmas gift to a friend who loves this fragrance, and she was thrilled with it.  This is my second purchase of this perfume, and I will buy it again on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It&#x27;s my second time buying it. Sweet and semi light smelling. This is my go-to perfume.</li>
            <li> It not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This perfume is lovely! Smells soooo good. It has a very light airy feel and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like some fragrances do. It is also not an overwhelming scent. It&#x27;s very natural. And the best part is--it lasts all day!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Good seller and product</li>
            <li> It really smells good,and stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> Very nice low keyed smell. I like it!</li>
            <li> the scent is sweet perfect for everyday I really like it. I bought one for my grandmother, is so fresh you dont have to be a young women for enjoy it</li>
            <li> I am truly disappointed with the fragrance of this product.  I truly expected something than would wow me like Fancy &amp; Usher for women...</li>
            <li> Smells great, good for the daytime, very light smell. Made me feel sensual.</li>
            <li> I put this on at twelve noon and I could still smell it at nine p.m. I love the smell and the design of the bottle.  I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Liked the smell of this but it doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour or so.  Packaging is very pretty but it doesn&#x27;t work if you are looking for something that lingers a while.</li>
            <li> This is the perffect perfume for summer- light, sweet and fresh. It lasts for a very long time, I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> My sister and my mother love this perfume.. i really like it 2.....</li>
            <li> ecletente fragancia 100% recomendable</li>
            <li> Love it! Doesn&#x27;t stay on long and I&#x27;m not one to re-spray, but I do love the fragrance, and I&#x27;m just waiting for my grand daughter to ask me to buy her a bottle.</li>
            <li> Affordable and great perfume. Very strong scent, but excellent smell. A lot cheaper here then at a store. Nice box to</li>
            <li> The perfume is a large bottle not bad for the price. Perfume smells pretty good, but not better then be once&#x27;s orange kind.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this fragrance was from a gift set I purchased on clearance after Christmas at a local store.  I think it has a very nice, light fragrance and the price is a great value!</li>
            <li> It is an excellent very nice perfume with scent of fruits, very good choice for perfum&amp;eacute; diary</li>
            <li> I am wowed! This is such a nice scent. Really modern, sweet, hippy... Ideal for girls/young women. The box and bottle are simply gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Smells good. A good light fragrance but didn&#x27;t smell the way I thought it would . It kind of smells like baby power.</li>
            <li> love it,smell good,i recomend the product to any one it good and smell good,you will enjoy it and buy next tim</li>
            <li> I received a defective product that never should&#x27;ve made it past inspection.  The inside cap was caked with gray sludge that appears toxic.  I ordered the product new through Amazon to avoid sketchy resellers, and I&#x27;m so disappointed.  I had to give this to someone for Christmas, and of course she was disgusted.  Upon trying to return this product the process was halted with a shipping warning of flammable liquids....  Just great, and thanks for returning my faith in brick and mortar stores where a bill of sale actually means something.</li>
            <li> It smells great! it&#x27;s sweet but not too sweet, my girlfriend loves it, excellent purchase! And most importantly lasts aaallll day long.</li>
            <li> I use this cologne daily. You have no comparison what so ever to others. Its originality speaks for it self.The fragrance is light and pleasant and above all my exspectations. IT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF, YOU FEEL BEAUTIFUL, LIKE YOU CAN CONQUER ANYTHING. I JUST LOVE IT. IT TURNS HEADS AND AWESOME COMPLIMENTS.</li>
            <li> I just received Beyonce Pulse and it smells lovely. It is light scented like I live my perfumes. I never smelled it before I bought it but I thought it&#x27;s Beyonce she wouldn&#x27;t make anything that would smell bad and I was right. It smells Heavenly. It makes u wanna do the uh oh uh oh dance lol.</li>
            <li> Love this scent!  Always in style!</li>
            <li> Excelente lo recomiendo para Venezuela</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Not sweet, is elegant and confident. Will defiantly get more.</li>
            <li> Very nice understated scent. I wife uses it frequently and always comments how much she likes it.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me a bottle of this on Amazon. The price was great but there&#x27;s nothing special about the smell. It&#x27;s a faint scent of something but not sure of what. Maybe baby fresh powder scent but you can get that with \\&quot; LOVES BABY SOFT\\&quot; Anyway&#x27;s I sprayed on alot because it was hard to smell and it faded within in a couple of hours. I guess she&#x27;s like all the other stars and just has to have a perfume scent that is&#x27;nt worth buying.</li>
            <li> It is ok. I first smelled it in a kohls store and that is what made me want to get it but then when i ordered here and got it the smell was totally different and didn&#x27;t last long like the one I sprayed on at the store. So I really do no use it and have put it on the back burner.</li>
            <li> The big thing is it dont last long its nice but it  just fades into a floral  sweet thing going on lol</li>
            <li> Everything about this is perfect...</li>
            <li> smell was not what I anticipated</li>
            <li> This is a nice fruity scent. It is too strong at first, but wait several minutes and it evens out. Best for spring and summer wear. Unfortunately, it has little to no staying power.</li>
            <li> SCENT TOO SWEET!!! LIKE WEARING COTTON CANDY!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent. Love beyonces perfumes. Would recommend to all the ladies out there that want to smell sexy yet sensual. Men love it</li>
            <li> Product smells good but does not stay with you. You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I dont like the innitial smell but after a bit it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Was not to thrilled with the scent although the price was pretty decent in comparison to worse scents out there.</li>
            <li> Perfume arrived broken!</li>
            <li> Muy bueno, excelente precio</li>
            <li> Me llego rapido y en excelentes condiciones.</li>
            <li> smells sweet nice , but the smell diminishes in an hour or so</li>
            <li> I enjoy the perfume, and love the scent. A generous bottle that will last me for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Nice scent but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my son&#x27;s girlfriend. She loved it!</li>
            <li> excellent product I love</li>
            <li> For a woman in her 30&#x27;s who buys over $100 scents, I find this to be a fresh citrusy scent that is surprisingly pleasing. However,  its pointless to purchase being that it lasts for less than an hour.  Ive never had such an issue,  even when spraying clothing. But for $17 and such a big bottle,  wont hurt. Its best for anyone under age 27</li>
            <li> Its a Ok fragrance. Its light. I love heavy fragrance. I wore it twice it doesnt last long. But its just ok</li>
            <li> excellent product I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> The perfume arrived early and was the real thing! I was really surprised because I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be genuine.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. BIG BOTTLE. Great price! Will order again and again!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how it smells at first it&#x27;s slightly citrus. And vanilla. And it fades fast. Then just a hint of vanilla smell. It smells pretty cheap too.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner.  I love the smell of the fragrance. There are a lot of secondary ones after this one.</li>
            <li> ok item. Not much impressive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a perfume fanatic and this one smells like alcohol.</li>
            <li> The scent last whole day on you.  I love this perfume and I recommend persons to buy this. Its worth the price</li>
            <li> nothing special. Sweet scent doesn&#x27;t stick around long.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell of this perfume. It smelled a little rancid to me. I will never buy this perfume or any other perfume of Beyonce&#x27;s again.</li>
            <li> Not only do I admire Beyonce, I love her perfume. Especially this one. This is the perfect everyday scent. I love how soft it is, but not too soft that it doesn&#x27;t stand out. It&#x27;s the perfect balance.</li>
            <li> was so unhappy will never buy it again! I use it to spray my bed linens that is all I think it is good for!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> great product,great price</li>
            <li> Got this for my bday hopfully she likes it thanks it got here fast...</li>
            <li> Has a vey sweet and sensual smell. I described all her fragrances as having a dry note. Its strong enough that you continue to smell it but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Loved the scent of the perfume  Beyonce&#x27;s line  is one my daughter really likes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using my fathers account, and this product came within decent timing. One of the best smelling fragrances I ever smelled. Got many many compliments the first day I wore it. Definitely an all time favorite.</li>
            <li> Early delivery, smells amazing. It&#x27;s so nice to have a big bottle finally rather than the little travel size perfumes ive always gotten. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I love pulse perfume. Everyone who has smelled it loves it. It makes me feel young again. My husband loves it to. I love perfume, and have used a lot of different ones, and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> omg i love this perfume i just smelt this perfume in my moms rooms and i am in love withthe scent i feel it classy and sophiscated.</li>
            <li> I like my Beyonce Pulse, it is a nice warm and inviting smell, but i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s one i will run out and buy anytime soon again</li>
            <li> I bought it for my oldest daughter for Christmas and she was absolutely thrilled she loves the fragrance and the price was perfect for me! Thanks again Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Product was colored very dark and the fragrance was very limited. I have used Beyonce for a long time and this product did not even come close to equalling what I have used in the past</li>
            <li> smells so good, i got this last year, and i&#x27;m almost out so i&#x27;m going to have to order somemore!!</li>
            <li> 😀so pleased smell just like the perfume really thought it would have been watered down</li>
            <li> I really like this product in this perfume. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper than in stores It&#x27;s a great deal and it smells amazing &amp;#60;3 love it.</li>
            <li> LADIES YOU HAVE TO ORDER THIS .YOU WILL NOT REGRET BUYING IT .THIS SMELL SO GOOD.I WASH MY SHIRT AND THE SCENT WAS STILL IN MY CLOTHS.I WILL MAKE SURE I DON&#x27;T RUN OUT OF THIS</li>
            <li> Smells good, the bottle is cute and bigger than the way appear... it&#x27;s a nice and good gift. :) .</li>
            <li> smell ok don&#x27;t think i will buy again does not last</li>
            <li> The bottle is very beautiful and well designed. It represents what Beyonce is...beautiful, strong, and proud. The scent is decent, but it didn&#x27;t entices or made me crazy like Dior Addict 2 and Calvin Klein Euphoria. It reminds me of Victoria&#x27;s Secret Dream Angels Heavenly. It wasn&#x27;t too strong...it was gentle enough for my nose. It didn&#x27;t last very long either as other reviewers mentioned. I could barely smell it on me. I like fragrances that have that exotic, refreshing, crispy smell to it. This was one was just okay, but it came with a nice bag and pouch which was convenient for me. I look forward trying out her Heat and Midnight Heat fragrances.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, waste my money ;&#x3D;(</li>
            <li> the bottle is very original.And the scent is very nice i really like it and recommend to the people who like sweet smell</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS FOR MY WIFE. ITS REALLY LOOKS SO GOOD ,AND PACKED WELL MANNER. SHE LOVES IT LOTS REALLY WORTH FOR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and last all day. A very good deal.</li>
            <li> Very pleased all around and highly recommended.  Light, fruity, and unique scent.  Also, a good perfume at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> i bought this based on the reviews i read on amazon and let me just say I LOVE IT... it smells amazing and  the smell is so different from other perfumes i have.. i would buy this again when im running low.. i dont usually buy perfume without smelling it first so ill say this was a good experience to try something new.</li>
            <li> Ohh! Very good! Excelent product!! Than you.</li>
            <li> Beyonce has done it right with his Fragrences I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light and it&#x27;s last it makes you wanna have sex with yourself it smells so good.</li>
            <li> Like this perfume a lot...</li>
            <li> the perfume was great arrived when expect actually earlier then expect so was happy with that.  the smell is awesome and amazon did a good job of making sure I had everything nailed down for my Christmas.</li>
            <li> Love this unique bottle. Its pictured upside down. I guess so that you always get a good spray of mist. I love this parfum !!!!!!!!!!! Sexy as it gets ;) smells a bit floral not fruity like everything else out there. Love it !!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome hot weather fragrance, smells like an orange creamsicle!</li>
            <li> Excellent fruity smell that is fresh and new for all ages young women to older :) use it all the time</li>
            <li> i got this as a gift and its awesome. it was great value for money. and my sister loves this stuff. great seller.</li>
            <li> She love it thanks.... she wont more this is the best i got im going to buy more and it come sooo fast right on time</li>
            <li> It was worth every penny. And was really a great bargain. It lasted for about a year and I am about to try and order some more.</li>
            <li> Nice light scent but fades too quick</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume and was surprised at the lovely bottle it comes in. It smells ok but not as great as I expected it would. The Beyonce Heat smells a lot better than the Pulse!</li>
            <li> I have used Beyonce&#x27;s Heat for over a year and was looking for the other fragarences and found Pulse here on Amazon.  So I decided to give it a try since it had great ratings.  To my delight, I love it.  It is softer than Heat and is sweeter and lasts just as long as Heat so I am very happy I took the chance</li>
            <li> love it &amp; all of her srays</li>
            <li> I already knew I loved this fragrance. I smelled it in a dept store and its smells so lovely.  Yet, I  was a little skeptical of purchasing it online.  The last thing I wanted was an old spoiled rancid bottle of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I took a chance and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  SMELLS EXACTLY HOW IT SHOULD!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent by Beyonce this far. The scent is soft but not too sweet smelling. Perfect for me.</li>
            <li> It has a powdery fresh scent to it and you must place it on pulse points for a longer lasting scent.. The bottle is too pretty to throw away. The pic is upside down.</li>
            <li> Thank you I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells wonderful. It is a good size bottle but the smell does not last long.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS and the cheapest price anywhere checked all over THANKS AMAZON</li>
            <li> It is the second perfume I liked after calvin kelin euphoria.</li>
            <li> Nice and cheap, i enjoy this perfume so much</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle but doesn&#x27;t help much when you don&#x27;t like the smell of it :( It might be great for others, just not my thing.</li>
            <li> ....love the perfume however, it took forever to get here! I don&#x27;t know why it took so long, but it did and on top of that the box was wet when I got it.</li>
