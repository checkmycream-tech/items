            <li>But they just are too flimsy and cheap in the materials they are made of.</li>
            <li>These fit a bit snug.  </li>
            <li>Also comfortable to wear</li>
            <li>as cheap and nasty!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this gives me a quick and easy hair style for work when I don&#x27;t have time to fiddle with it</li>
            <li>Therefore I highly recommend them! :-)</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again but they are not bad.</li>
            <li>you are looking for an inexpensive way to dress up your wardrobe, these headband are not bad.</li>
            <li>I used to own these headbands several years ago when they were made strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I also think look more elegant than regular headbands.</li>
            <li>Very pretty headband</li>
            <li>Nice and wide, so it is great for holding the hair back.</li>
            <li>The plastic is very flimsy and easy to break.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re pretty, too!</li>
            <li>This is an exact replacement!</li>
            <li>They make wearing headbands during the week more fun and classy.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable, it holds the hair back off your face, and it&#x27;s stylish.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be good</li>
            <li>I have a lot of very fine hair, so many plain headbands just don&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li>great product hardly squeezes my head at all</li>
            <li>These are fantastic little headbands and work great for someone like me who is currently growing out my bangs.</li>
            <li>Broke on first use.</li>
            <li>One of them broke the first time I put it on my head.</li>
            <li>They are pretty and I occasionally wear one rather like a tiara sitting on top of my head</li>
            <li>exactly what is pictured</li>
            <li>broke one the first wearing --</li>
            <li>On the first day wearing one of the headbands, it broke.</li>
            <li>Great price too &amp; hold hair back comfortably &amp; with small &#x27;teeth&#x27; on the bands.</li>
            <li>I use them mainly when washing my face, but I have found myself wearing them when working out and sometimes just for fun, too.</li>
            <li>This head band is great for natural African American hair!</li>
            <li>Love the style and was so much looking forward to wearing for a long time to come....</li>
            <li>a small person with fine hair, so the fact that this didn&#x27;t fit my head, good luck with someone with more hair!&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll end up with indentations behind your ears and a head ache!</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really like these headbands.</li>
            <li>Headbands were very inexpensive; however, they are not as durable as others I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>Nice wide bands look expensive, very nice for the price.</li>
            <li>As many other rigid headband this product hurts my head.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very difficult to find headbands with a good grip and a product that can hold your hair in place; this product is ok, I wont purchase it again...</li>
            <li>I wear headbands frequently and I have never had headbands that hurt so much!</li>
            <li>Also, it seems really easy to broke if you dont be careful to put in and out.</li>
            <li>Love how they keep my hair in place without being too tight.</li>
            <li>Looks cute but is a bit tight.</li>
            <li>Not a headband I&#x27;d want to wear for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>I still rarely wear them, I only have about 30 headbands.</li>
            <li>Not at comfortable as some other headbands</li>
            <li>These are very small and don&#x27;t stretch when warm.  </li>
            <li>Like the new add on program</li>
            <li>I have worn this particular style for years and are by far my favorites.</li>
            <li>I use them especially to hold my hair back while I wash my face, but they&#x27;re cute enough to wear out as well.</li>
            <li>My daughter really likes these &amp; yet not others that I spent 2x as much on!</li>
            <li>Buy somewhere else or go for something a little more expensive but much better quality!</li>
            <li>The plastic was nice and flexible, but they were just a little too wide.</li>
            <li>but after all if I am wearing them on a daily basis, this is very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These were FLIMSY and ready to break in two any second.</li>
            <li>I can ridearound with the window down just taking in all the cool delights of a  wind</li>
            <li>Very flimsy, mine broke in half the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li>A little to tight for my head but look nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It hurts your head and if you try to open it a little more to stretch it a little it snaps straight</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not too stiff, so they&#x27;ll fit big heads (like mine.)</li>
            <li>I believe they last a last negative impression on  me. :).</li>
            <li>at any moment its gonna snap and not even opening it far.&lt;br /&gt;the pressure behind my ears hurt and i found myself taking it off most of the day, kinda bummed</li>
            <li>Simple yet with a little style to go with anything.. Arrived fairly quickly and with ease..</li>
            <li>This can stand up to the thickness of natural African American hair.</li>
            <li>These are very tight... would get headaches when I first started wearing.  </li>

            <li> This can stand up to the thickness of natural African American hair.</li>
            <li> These are very tight... would get headaches when I first started wearing.  </li>
            <li> I liked the design, but they turned out to be too narrow for me and too small and might be broken very soon</li>
            <li> I use these daily and they did not last very long.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have with them is they are plastic and hurt my head when I wear them long time.</li>
            <li> They are much too small and tight for an adult.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> Looks cute but too tight for me unfortunately</li>
            <li> I handled the second one very carefully, and it broke within 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult with a relatively small head.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money to send back</li>
            <li> Wore one for the first time yesterday and when I remove it found it was broken.  </li>
            <li> I bought a black headband like this from walmart once upon a time but never could find it again after my two year old broke mine in half.  </li>
            <li> Holds back my hair but too tight at the ends</li>
            <li> They are about the only ones that will actually hold my hair in place, I have thick hair any others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> The black one felt stretched out and didn&#x27;t stay on my head.</li>
            <li> These headbands are extremely brittle.</li>
            <li> Could be due to the product I put in my hair</li>
            <li> I handle them delicately to make them last longer</li>
            <li> so we have had a few months to evaluate &amp; they&#x27;ve passed the &amp;#34;test of time&amp;#34; - still totally in-tact &amp; STILL wearing them a few days a week!</li>
            <li> The broke within a week and a half of wear.  </li>
            <li> , I felt a slight pop...</li>
            <li> My grand-daughter previously had one</li>
            <li> They looked a little odd on me.</li>
            <li> You will need to use a dremmel type tool to grind off about half the little points that dig into your skull on the sides.  </li>
            <li> It fits way to tightly on the head.</li>
            <li> They are just too tight and make the sides of my head hurt.</li>
            <li> Are kinda tight</li>
            <li> Te tips did hug tight and I had to keep shifting it, by the end of the day, I had a headache.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re wide enough to hold back my hair, but not so wide that they look bad.</li>
            <li> Had a headache within minutes and the sharp teeth dug into my scalp when I tried to wear them in the usual way.  </li>
            <li> Narrow ones won&#x27;t do, as hair escapes or band falls off when bending head.  </li>
            <li> A Waste of Money!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> They are delicate in quality and I have to be careful how I wear them.</li>

            <li> don&#x27;t waste your cash</li>
            <li> Those of us with thick hair have a hard time finding wide bands.  </li>
            <li> I prefer Vidal Sassoon headbands, but have been unable to find them locally for a couple of years now.</li>
            <li> so well it could hardly be seen.</li>
            <li> works well with my thick hair and stays in place.</li>
            <li> They do start to feel uncomfortable half way through the day.</li>

            <li> not a good product.</li>
            <li> These bands are not sold as being for children, but they are so tight, my ears went numb.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have very, very thick hair it would cushion the tightness, but it would probably also give you a headache.</li>
            <li> Total crap.</li>
            <li> And it pinches behind the ears - something else it didn&#x27;t use to do.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These are lovely.  Unfortunately, they are also very tight and uncomfortable.  Maybe if you have very, very thick hair it would cushion the tightness, but it would probably also give you a headache.</li>
            <li> Those of us with thick hair have a hard time finding wide bands.  Narrow ones won&#x27;t do, as hair escapes or band falls off when bending head.  Happy with these, comfortable wearing, even with glasses.</li>
            <li> Nice wide bands look expensive, very nice for the price. And helped qualify for free shipping. Like the new add on program</li>
            <li> Very supportive, however the ends tend to bite into your head just being the ears.</li>
            <li> I wear headbands frequently and I have never had headbands that hurt so much!</li>
            <li> I love these headbands. I use them especially to hold my hair back while I wash my face, but they&#x27;re cute enough to wear out as well. They&#x27;re wide enough to hold back my hair, but not so wide that they look bad. They&#x27;re not too stiff, so they&#x27;ll fit big heads (like mine.)</li>
            <li> Cute style, but they hurt after about an hour.</li>
            <li> A little to tight for my head but look nice.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic little headbands and work great for someone like me who is currently growing out my bangs. I&#x27;ve been wearing them for awhile and am having to order another pack.</li>
            <li> Broke on first use. Total crap.</li>
            <li> The plastic was nice and flexible, but they were just a little too wide. They looked a little odd on me.</li>
            <li> Do Not Buy! A Waste of Money!&lt;br /&gt;I had headbands like these for 5 years; they were great. When they wore out, I ordered these without reading the reviews. BIG mistake. These headbands are extremely brittle. One of them broke the first time I put it on my head. I handled the second one very carefully, and it broke within 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Should have known better!  These are very small and don&#x27;t stretch when warm.  Had a headache within minutes and the sharp teeth dug into my scalp when I tried to wear them in the usual way.  They are pretty and I occasionally wear one rather like a tiara sitting on top of my head but they&#x27;re not what they should be.</li>
            <li> It fits way to tightly on the head. If I could find my receipt, I&#x27;d return them. Otherwise, I like the color and quality. They are just too tight and make the sides of my head hurt.</li>
            <li> You will need to use a dremmel type tool to grind off about half the little points that dig into your skull on the sides.  Once you do that, your headband can rate a 4, if you don&#x27;t have that ability, don&#x27;t purchase this.  It will give you a headache unless you have a tiny head.</li>
            <li> Superfast shipping and these head bands are just lovely!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very difficult to find headbands with a good grip and a product that can hold your hair in place; this product is ok, I wont purchase it again... breaks easy as well..</li>
            <li> These are great and hold your hair all day. I also think look more elegant than regular headbands. Great for work</li>
            <li> very beautiful,nicely made,a good buy,...thanks</li>
            <li> They keep my hair out of my face. They do start to feel uncomfortable half way through the day. I find that the wider the head band the more they squeeze my head.</li>
            <li> Very nice headbands, exactly what is pictured</li>
            <li> looks great but breaks very easily -- broke one the first wearing --</li>
            <li> Love how they keep my hair in place without being too tight. They are attractive enough to wear to work.</li>
            <li> These headbands look cheap because the plastic is too shiny and not great quality.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I&#x27;d passed them up.  There are others out there that are better.</li>
            <li> The black one felt stretched out and didn&#x27;t stay on my head. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again but they are not bad.</li>
            <li> Not at comfortable as some other headbands</li>
            <li> works well with my thick hair and stays in place.I can ridearound with the window down just taking in all the cool delights of a  wind</li>
            <li> Grandma likes them and so do I.</li>
            <li> I really like these headbands. I use them mainly when washing my face, but I have found myself wearing them when working out and sometimes just for fun, too. These are really good headbands for the price, and I&#x27;m very happy I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I had these only for a short time..and today one snapped and broke already. And I don&#x27;t misuse them. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> My hair is brown and the brown one blended in so well it could hardly be seen. However, after a few hours the ends started to bother me because a the tightness. Not a headband I&#x27;d want to wear for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy, mine broke in half the first time I wore it.I didn&#x27;t use any force to remove the head band, just cheap.</li>
            <li> I liked the design, but they turned out to be too narrow for me and too small and might be broken very soon and  also too tight and create uncomfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> Yes I recommend these hair bands. Simple yet with a little style to go with anything.. Arrived fairly quickly and with ease..Yes I would recommend this seller ..</li>
            <li> These are a set of okay headbands. They are made of plastic and have a wonderful design on them. They make wearing headbands during the week more fun and classy. I also like that they come in two colors. It gave me more of a variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although they have all this good, the plastic is not the best. They are delicate in quality and I have to be careful how I wear them. I handle them delicately to make them last longer but after all if I am wearing them on a daily basis, this is very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an inexpensive way to dress up your wardrobe, these headband are not bad.</li>
            <li> I like these headbands. The only issue I have with them is they are plastic and hurt my head when I wear them long time. So that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re just ok.</li>
            <li> very nice headbands, but easy to break</li>
            <li> I enjoy my headbands.  They fit snugly against my head and are sturdy.  I don&#x27;t like flimsy headbands so these were perfect and they&#x27;re pretty, too!</li>
            <li> Holds back my hair but too tight at the ends</li>
            <li> This head band is great for natural African American hair! It is comfortable, it holds the hair back off your face, and it&#x27;s stylish. This can stand up to the thickness of natural African American hair.</li>
            <li> these headbands are the size that i needed but when you do your hair then go to place it in you can hear the plastic creek&lt;br /&gt;like at any moment its gonna snap and not even opening it far.&lt;br /&gt;the pressure behind my ears hurt and i found myself taking it off most of the day, kinda bummed</li>
            <li> My daughter purchased when buying curling wand.  Needed certain colors for school and these hold her hair great with no headaches!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed. I use these daily and they did not last very long.  The broke within a week and a half of wear.  I believe the decor on the band weakens it.  Would not purchase again.  They were also painful to wear.</li>
            <li> Bought these to replace fabric hair bands that went all around your head.  I only needed something to keep my hair from my face, during cleansing.  These are perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult with a relatively small head. These bands are not sold as being for children, but they are so tight, my ears went numb. They are much too small and tight for an adult.</li>
            <li> Very pretty headband but my ears get sore from wearing it after a few hours. Nice and wide, so it is great for holding the hair back.</li>
            <li> not a good product. both bands broke after using twice. don&#x27;t waste your cash</li>
            <li> These are very tight... would get headaches when I first started wearing.  After a couple of weeks, they broke. Could be due to the product I put in my hair</li>
            <li> Looks cute but too tight for me unfortunately</li>
            <li> I used to own these headbands several years ago when they were made strong and sturdy. These were FLIMSY and ready to break in two any second. DO NOT LIKE THAT.  Cheap qualty, cheap construction. Cheap feel.  I wish they&#x27;d bring back their stronger, sturdier plastic they used to use for making these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would NOT recommend these to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad. I love the design on them. But they just are too flimsy and cheap in the materials they are made of. And it pinches behind the ears - something else it didn&#x27;t use to do.</li>
            <li> These fit a bit snug.  I thought I could put pressure on it to loosen it up some and broke the side of one.</li>
            <li> Headbands were very inexpensive; however, they are not as durable as others I&#x27;ve purchased. The plastic is very flimsy and easy to break.</li>
            <li> On the first day wearing one of the headbands, it broke. I wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews.</li>
            <li> I received the headbands on Wednesday.  I wore one of them on Thursday.  By noon time on Thursday it broke.  I didn&#x27;t touch it, I didn&#x27;t bump into anything.  I was sitting at my desk, I felt a slight pop... it broke.</li>
            <li> Nice looking headbands.  Are kinda tight and I don&#x27;t consider my head very big.  All and all it&#x27;s a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Wore one for the first time yesterday and when I remove it found it was broken.  Not worth the money to send back so I guess will be a reminder not to order again.  Love the style and was so much looking forward to wearing for a long time to come....</li>
            <li> Just as they look.  Also comfortable to wear</li>
            <li> Bought these After Christmas so we have had a few months to evaluate &amp; they&#x27;ve passed the &amp;#34;test of time&amp;#34; - still totally in-tact &amp; STILL wearing them a few days a week! (What else can you ask for?!)! Great price too &amp; hold hair back comfortably &amp; with small &#x27;teeth&#x27; on the bands. My daughter really likes these &amp; yet not others that I spent 2x as much on! Therefore I highly recommend them! :-)</li>
            <li> My grand-daughter previously had one but when she broke it I had to find another one similar. This is an exact replacement!</li>
            <li> These are great headbands, although one broke on me a week after I got it. I have really long hair and this gives me a quick and easy hair style for work when I don&#x27;t have time to fiddle with it</li>
            <li> I have been searching every store for these I ordered 6 haha I have a big head and I tend to break them so I will be set for a while</li>
            <li> They are very pretty, but seem to be made for very small heads. Will have to try these on before I buy in the future.</li>
            <li> They hurt my head but look good on.  One has cracked but I cannot say for sure if it was the headband construction or if it was something else (fell on the floor).  For me, i would not purchase again but i would not NOT recommend them.</li>
            <li> I bought these headbands to replace the one I had before. They are about the only ones that will actually hold my hair in place, I have thick hair any others I&#x27;ve tried popped out of place. The only bad thing is if you plan on wearing them along time they hurt your head.</li>
            <li> Love the headbands, they stay on and they look and feel great, too.  Just what I was looking for. Thank you for carrying the product.</li>
            <li> As many other rigid headband this product hurts my head. Also, it seems really easy to broke if you dont be careful to put in and out. I&#x60;m going back to my headbands with elastic on the back.</li>
            <li> Te tips did hug tight and I had to keep shifting it, by the end of the day, I had a headache.  My husband finally heated up the tips and bent them outward and covered them with and adhesive felt that matched.  I still rarely wear them, I only have about 30 headbands. I believe they last a last negative impression on  me. :).</li>
            <li> I prefer Vidal Sassoon headbands, but have been unable to find them locally for a couple of years now. I have worn this particular style for years and are by far my favorites. I have a lot of very fine hair, so many plain headbands just don&#x27;t hold. I like the two rows of &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; that these have as it allows them to stay in place all day. They are very comfortable and do not cause headaches like some do. I also love the scroll design.</li>
            <li> Looks cute but is a bit tight.</li>
            <li> If I could do a ZERO I would!!&lt;br /&gt;Because it was Vidal Sassoon I expected it to be good and yet here I am!&lt;br /&gt;Its as cheap and nasty!&lt;br /&gt;A headband from CVS or the dollar store would&#x27;ve been better!&lt;br /&gt;It hurts your head and if you try to open it a little more to stretch it a little it snaps straight away.&lt;br /&gt;Im a small person with fine hair, so the fact that this didn&#x27;t fit my head, good luck with someone with more hair!&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll end up with indentations behind your ears and a head ache! Buy somewhere else or go for something a little more expensive but much better quality!</li>
            <li> I bought a black headband like this from walmart once upon a time but never could find it again after my two year old broke mine in half.  Love them but keep them away 2 year olds!</li>
            <li> great product hardly squeezes my head at all</li>
            <li> These products met or exceeded expectations.  Please change word requirements on simple products, such as thiese headbands.  You would receive more reviews.</li>
