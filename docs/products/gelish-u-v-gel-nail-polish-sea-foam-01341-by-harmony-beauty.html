            <li> It was a little bit too dark for what i thought it was.</li>
            <li> It truly looks like sea foam which has a little hint of tan in it from crashing against the sand and bringing up some particles.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was tiffany green, not.  </li>
            <li> I love Gelish polish, but this color is horrible!  </li>

            <li> I have very pale skin (redhead)  </li>
            <li> This one goes on too thin.</li>

            <li> Beautiful color, cures beautifully and no shrinkage.  Gelish is the only polish I will ever wear.  2-3 weeks on fingers and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth. Perfect for the busy mom who doesn&#x27;t have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!</li>
            <li> I love Gelish polish, but this color is horrible!  I have very pale skin (redhead)  and this definitely didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  Maybe it would look better on darker skin but on me it looked like seaweed or algae.  I had it on for a day and had to take it off. (normally I wear my polish for 2 weeks).</li>
            <li> Love this color! I get a lot of complements when I wear it, however it needs at least 3 coats which sometimes makes it a little thick. Overall, I would definitely get this again.</li>

            <li> I am a big fan of the Gelish line of nail polish. Sea Foam is a really interesting color- it&#x27;s a cross between light green and light teal. It&#x27;s not completely matte, but wasn&#x27;t totally shiny either. It lasts about 10 days for me. I get a lot of compliments on the color- I think it&#x27;s best used in the springtime.</li>
            <li> Lighter than I expected,  but still in love with the color. I have gotten many compliments from the color of this polish.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Very opaque once applied and lasts the full two weeks, if not more. Looks really pretty when paired with Gelish &amp;#34;Izzy wizzy let&#x27;s get busy&amp;#34;.</li>
