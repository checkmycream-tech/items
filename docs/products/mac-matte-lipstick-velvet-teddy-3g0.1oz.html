            <li>Besides, I was so impressed with this that I purchased MAC&#x27;s &amp;#34;Twig&amp;#34; which is the exact color I was looking for... medium pinky nude about one shade darker than my own lips.</li>
            <li>Very happy new fave lipstick!</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, smells wonderful and color stays true.  </li>

            <li>I still love the color, almost...</li>
            <li>This prompted me to buy more Mac lipstick from their website.</li>
            <li>The color might work better on someone lighter.</li>
            <li>, I suggest mixing it with another color, also u have to put on 5 coats or more</li>
            <li>love the texture and color</li>
            <li>Definitely the perfect shade!</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick</li>
            <li>I purchased this because my friend had it and it looked lovely on her.  </li>
            <li>lick my lips a lot, so I have to apply it more often, but otherwise it stays on pretty good :)</li>
            <li>THE BEST COLOR EVER-CAME WHEN EXPECTED</li>
            <li>Most of the stuff I oderd said It will take a month to come in is that true?????</li>
            <li>This has become my new favorite lip color!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and just as advertised.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly the color was lighter than I had expected.</li>
            <li>If it wont fit you, there is at least one Girlfriend that will love you for this one :)</li>
            <li>It broke off the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>, color is almost exact shade of Melalucas nude.</li>
            <li>and everyone keeps asking me what wonderul shade that is.&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin (NC20 or &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; in Matchmaster) green eyes</li>
            <li>and it worked for me with blonde, ombre (light brown/blond) and almost black hair :) I am pretty much reccomending this!</li>
            <li>I really like the look and feel of this lipstick, but it has an orange undertone.</li>
            <li>would prefer a touch of pink and a bit lighter but still love it.  </li>
            <li>Nice color for black people!</li>
            <li>When all fails nude is always a good choice for any occasion!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really light on me (almost the exact same color of my natural lips).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my everyday lipstick for work, I love it very neutral color!</li>
            <li>It it&#x27;s darker than my natural lip color so I can shape them and make them look much fuller even without a liner</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for all skin tones &amp; lips sizes ,I was a little skeptical about getting this one ,thinking that the nude wouldn&#x27;t look right</li>
            <li>VERY NATURAL   LOOKING</li>
            <li>This looks very natural on me.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind I am very tan/caramel color (especially with the summer time sunshine!).</li>
            <li>OR IF YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING FOREVER TO GET THAT NATURAL LOOKING LIP COLOR  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s close enough to my natural color to still look very natural</li>
            <li>Works really well blended with other shades.</li>
            <li>I prefer only to wear this bare on part of my bottom lip.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> came in less then 3 days .</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s fake or not, it got to me</li>
            <li> broke &amp; the quality is bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> beautiful color thank you so much</li>
            <li> This has become my new favorite lip color! I love that it matches just about anything and everything I wear. It lasts so long that I don&#x27;t have to reapply until hours after eating my breakfast, drinking my coffee and after I&#x27;ve sipped on about four bottles of water.</li>
            <li> I bought it on amazon because it was sold out everywhere else. This is period my favourite Lipstick, it brings out my Lips the best and everyone keeps asking me what wonderul shade that is.&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin (NC20 or &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; in Matchmaster) green eyes and it worked for me with blonde, ombre (light brown/blond) and almost black hair :) I am pretty much reccomending this! If it wont fit you, there is at least one Girlfriend that will love you for this one :)&lt;br /&gt;I lick my lips a lot, so I have to apply it more often, but otherwise it stays on pretty good :) The feel is flawless and I dont even feel it (wich is the best, because it is not annoying you, in my opinion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will buy again :)</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a neutral lipstick because of my skin tone, (I&#x27;m Asian) After reading the reviews for this MAC lipstick, I decided to try it. SO glad I did, best neutral color ever! :)</li>
            <li> Authentic mac lipstick however being a medium brown skin tone this color was not flattering on me and I had to give it away. Oh well...</li>
            <li> I really like the look and feel of this lipstick, but it has an orange undertone. Having a painters visual pallet imbedded in my brain, things, even as little at that, stick out to me. I still love the color, almost... but I do need to color correct with a lipliner. Still on the look for the perfect color for me!</li>
            <li> Great color and went on easily. My mother&#x27;s Latino so I have trouble matching makeup to my white/olive/yellow skin tone.  This prompted me to buy more Mac lipstick from their website.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly the color was lighter than I had expected. Although I wished to wear it alone, I can&#x27;t because it&#x27;s almost invisible, so I have to blend it with MAC Crème Nude and Smashbox L.A. Lights Venice Beach to bring it to life. Keep in mind I am very tan/caramel color (especially with the summer time sunshine!). The color might work better on someone lighter.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s fake or not, it got to me broke &amp; the quality is bad</li>
            <li> Totally love the color!</li>
            <li> Omg love this lipstick!</li>
            <li> This lip color goes on well, is not drying or too moist so it stays on well and is a gorgeous color.  Use it with the MAC Soar color lip liner and its a great color for work or even nighttime.</li>
            <li> Too naked on the lips looks as if u have nothing on your lips, I suggest mixing it with another color, also u have to put on 5 coats or more</li>
            <li> Good good!! Nice color for black people!</li>
            <li> THE BEST COLOR EVER-CAME WHEN EXPECTED</li>
            <li> came in less then 3 days . I&#x27;m loving it !! it&#x27;s perfect for all skin tones &amp; lips sizes ,I was a little skeptical about getting this one ,thinking that the nude wouldn&#x27;t look right but it&#x27;s works perfectly with me !!</li>
            <li> love the texture and color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my everyday lipstick for work, I love it very neutral color!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Definitely the perfect shade!</li>
            <li> FOR WOMEN OF COLOR WHO THOUGHT THEY COULDN&#x27;T WEAR A LIGHTER COLORED LIPSTICK  OR IF YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING FOREVER TO GET THAT NATURAL LOOKING LIP COLOR  YOU&#x27;VE SEEN IN THE MAGAZINES &amp; ON T.V.  THIS IS THE ONE!!! VERY NATURAL   LOOKING AND I DO MEAN NATURAL, THIS SHADE MAKES YOUR LIPS LOOK THE WAY THEY DID BEFORE YOU _________________.   I CAN NEVER FIND THIS \\&quot;VELVET TEDDY\\&quot; IN THE STORES ANYMORE IT&#x27;S ALWAYS SOLD OUT.   SO THANK-GOODNESS FOR AMAZON.COM WHERE ALL THINGS  ARE POSSIBLE &amp; CAN BE FOUND!!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, I think it&#x27;s discontinued though.  Shipping was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> When all fails nude is always a good choice for any occasion! I love this lipstick</li>
            <li> I got this for an everyday look. It it&#x27;s darker than my natural lip color so I can shape them and make them look much fuller even without a liner but it&#x27;s close enough to my natural color to still look very natural so ppl see fuller lips but it doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing a bunch of lipstick! Beautiful matte finish. Lasted all night and thourgh dinner (eating carefully) with no touch ups. Very happy new fave lipstick!</li>
            <li> Most of the stuff I oderd said It will take a month to come in is that true?????</li>
            <li> I do like it but it&#x27;s a bit too dark so I mix it with a lighter pinker shade like please me and its perfect</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my friend had it and it looked lovely on her.  It&#x27;s really light on me (almost the exact same color of my natural lips).  But I figure it will be great for work, where I like a neutral look.</li>
            <li> It broke off the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this is definitely a nice base shade for those of us with brown skin.  I prefer only to wear this bare on part of my bottom lip.  Works really well blended with other shades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the same complex as Jennifer Hudson. This looks very natural on me. It&#x27;s not to pinkish or dull. If you want a plan look, here it is. Goodluck!</li>
            <li> Wonderful staying power but, color is almost exact shade of Melalucas nude.</li>
            <li> I now understand why everyone raves about MAC lipsticks.  Goes on smoothly, smells wonderful and color stays true.  It is a bit darker than the pic shows on my screen.  I would call it a darker brown tone nude.... would prefer a touch of pink and a bit lighter but still love it.  Besides, I was so impressed with this that I purchased MAC&#x27;s &amp;#34;Twig&amp;#34; which is the exact color I was looking for... medium pinky nude about one shade darker than my own lips.</li>
            <li> Perfect matte/nude lipstick</li>
