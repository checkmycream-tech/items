            <li>I bought it several years ago at TJMAXX for 10 dollars, now can&#x27;t find it for that price, but still cheaper than amazing grace.  </li>
            <li>After opening, I sprayed a bit on myself, it smells fresh and clean..like soap.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll wear it in the pri-vacy of my own home until I can afford to buy a different scent.</li>

            <li>Pure clean.  </li>
            <li>It does not smell like soap at all, first off, and it smells like it should be for a man at most, although I don&#x27;t think a man alive would wear it.</li>
            <li>It shipped/arrived very fast</li>
            <li>This will definately be my new CLEAN smelling fragrance.</li>
            <li>beware of buying perfume without a sample first.</li>
            <li>came very fast in mail,and was very well rap for mailing.</li>
            <li>but when I saw Demeter had a Pure Soap fragrance I wanted to try it.  </li>

            <li> It smells like a French whore at its worst and soapy, dirty bathtub water after you&#x27;ve finished your daily scrub at its best.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand how the other reviewer says that this doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about sending it back, tired of being promised one thing and getting something totally different.</li>
            <li> I am so mad at myself right now, until I can&#x27;t stand it!</li>
            <li> very strong and thick scent, not light or subtle at all unfortunately.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last too long on your skin, but if you spray it on you clothes the lasting power isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> $24.45 wasted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is heavy on the alcohol and water, and there&#x27;s NO fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Basically, you&#x27;re spraying alcohol and water on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not satisfied with our reviews, then buy a sample size.  </li>
            <li> was going to be wafting behind  me.</li>
            <li> It smells like I just bathed with an expensive, lovely-scented soap.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it might make my allergies act up</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad smell, by any means, it just doesn&#x27;t smell like soap to me.</li>
            <li> It smells like it went bad.</li>
            <li> I took a chance, and was not at all disappointed!</li>
            <li> Not for me, I&#x27;m very disappointed with it.</li>

            <li> I normally wear the Grace collection by Philosophy but when I saw Demeter had a Pure Soap fragrance I wanted to try it.  I am so glad I did!!!!!!!This is a great product and the price is even better.  It smells shower fresh and clean and the scent lasts all day.  Great for the office or casual wear.  This will definately be my new CLEAN smelling fragrance.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;Pure Soap\\&quot; cologne smells nice coming out of the atmosizer but the aroma soon vanishes. I am very dissappointed and would not purchase another product from this company.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on the 17th and recieved it on the 19th. It shipped/arrived very fast and I love demeter&#x27;s pure soap perfume and I love how cheaper it is from this seller compared to other sites online. I will be ordering from this seller again, I love the prices.. Overall Great Buy!!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. It smells like either an amplified diaper, or that bar used in men&#x27;s urinals. very strong and thick scent, not light or subtle at all unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I am so mad at myself right now, until I can&#x27;t stand it! I  took a chance and ordered this perfume,  It does not smell like soap at all, first off, and it smells like it should be for a man at most, although I don&#x27;t think a man alive would wear it. I sprayed a tiny bit on the back of my hand thinking maybe it had to sit for a minute, I tried to wash it off with soap and it&#x27;s still there. I read all the reviews about how much this smell like fresh soap, I&#x27;m sorry this ain&#x27;t a soap smell. $24.45 wasted. I thought the smell of soap and just a clean fresh  scent  was going to be wafting behind  me. beware of buying perfume without a sample first. I&#x27;m thinking about sending it back, tired of being promised one thing and getting something totally different. It smells like it went bad. Just found out that I can&#x27;t return it, bummer, tried to give it to my husband, and he didn&#x27;t want it. It&#x27;s not right that I can&#x27;t send it back.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like soap to me at all, it smells mostly like strong rubbing alcohol. In fact is smells just like one of those alcohol-based gel hand sanitizers (like Purel, etc) The alcohol smell is so strong that it gave me a headache. Yes, it is a clean smell if you like the scent of alcohol hand sanitizer. Not for me, I&#x27;m very disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> bought this for the wife,she loved use it all the time. will by more from demeter when she needs a new one. came very fast in mail,and was very well rap for mailing. very good product.</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent. Don&#x27;t buy if you don&#x27;t like to smell like soap! Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought 3 - one for a twelve year old niece, one for my 40-something sister, and one for me (of course), 50-something. Everyone is happy!  How can you not like this scent? Therefore, good gift material. Because some people - including me - are very picky about their scents :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand how the other reviewer says that this doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.  It&#x27;s really powerful clean smell that lasts all day.. I love it a lot, i have the amazing grace from philosophy and i get more compliments on pure soap and it&#x27;s cheaper.  I bought it several years ago at TJMAXX for 10 dollars, now can&#x27;t find it for that price, but still cheaper than amazing grace.  If you&#x27;re not satisfied with our reviews, then buy a sample size.  There&#x27;s sites out there that sell the samples.  trust me you&#x27;ll love love love this...</li>
            <li> Best scent I&#x27;ve ever bought from the Demeter collection.</li>
            <li> I try to find fragrances that are not overpowering and something I can put on daily.  THIS IS IT!  When people get close to me they comment that I smell so good and want to know what it is.  Perfect for every day use.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for myself, because it was #1 on the top 30 scents on Demeter&#x27;s website. I received it on time, packaged well. After opening, I sprayed a bit on myself, it smells fresh and clean..like soap. But is a bit masculine as well. I gave it to my husband, and he absolutely LOVES it, he wears it every day, even before his more expensive colognes. It smells delicious on him.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this fragrance.  It smells like I just bathed with an expensive, lovely-scented soap.  My husband loves this on me.  Great for working days or casual days.</li>
            <li> Spray lavishly after showering, it gives&lt;br /&gt;your shower that extra punch.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like \\&quot;pure soap\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;In fact has NO fragrance at all.&lt;br /&gt;This \\&quot;cologne\\&quot; has only 3 ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;SD Alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is heavy on the alcohol and water, and there&#x27;s NO fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Basically, you&#x27;re spraying alcohol and water on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Men and women will love this scent. Clean and fresh not perfume like.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Compliments galore.&lt;br /&gt;Try them !</li>
            <li> Ordered this product later than I wanted to for my friends birthday. Printed out a photo of the product, preparing to wrap it up with a bow as this was the only item she wanted for her gift. To my surprise, it arrived the day before I needed it. Fantastic, speedy service!</li>
            <li> A lovely soft scent! A pleasure to wear. I receive many compliments. Would recommend fragrance.</li>
            <li> The fragrance smell does not last</li>
            <li> I love this fresh smell. Its like just taking a shower but lasts all day. My husband thinks I smell wonderful without \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> I have some more of their scents; I&#x27;ve always loved their variety. I love this one, and &#x27;Laundromat&#x27;!!! So fresh! I took a chance, and was not at all disappointed!</li>
            <li> It smells like a French whore at its worst and soapy, dirty bathtub water after you&#x27;ve finished your daily scrub at its best. The top note is sweet soap, but the strong bottom note is dirty bathtub water. I fear I have purchased a scent that I cannot wear in public. Why, Demeter? Why??? Do you think money grows on trees? I guess I&#x27;ll wear it in the pri-vacy of my own home until I can afford to buy a different scent.</li>
            <li> Smells great but have to put on layers for it to last all day but I love the clean smell</li>
            <li> This cologne has a fresh but subdued scent. I must say that I like it. Apply liberally, because it does not last and touch ups are probably necessary during the day. I was afraid it might make my allergies act up as most cologne usually has that effect, but it didn&#x27;t bother me at all. For me this product works.</li>
            <li> Love this clean fragrance for the summer months.  Not too flowery in the heat.  Nice size  for me to use before I get tired of it.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. Smell so good and fresh, just like getting out of the bath.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like you just got out of the tub, this fragrance is for you.  Pure clean.  It doesn&#x27;t last too long on your skin, but if you spray it on you clothes the lasting power isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
