            <li>i think this brush might not be good to use at this time.  </li>
            <li>Heard good things about this Goody brush that provoked me into buying it.</li>
            <li>It took a good deal of elbow grease to get the pad on this baby to come off.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good news for me.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product.</li>
            <li>I thought I loved this brush, but when I straightened my daughter&#x27;s hair with a blow dryer, the bristles melted.</li>

            <li>she is very pleased.</li>
            <li>I used this Denman brush on my daughter&#x27;s afro 3a/3b hair and it detangled her very curly hair perfectly and didnt pull her hair out.  </li>
            <li>its nice</li>
            <li>My kids now prefer this brush, we own three.</li>
            <li>For the price paid, Goody hairbrushes can&#x27;t be beat and this product qualifies nicely.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, how are you supposed to be able to gradually work a tangle out without damaging your hair, if you can&#x27;t remove the brush from your hair without causing even more tangles (and pulling!</li>
            <li>It takes knots out very easily.</li>
            <li>It makes it very easy to curl the ends</li>
            <li>But when it was able to hold the two pieces together it did separate my curls nicely,</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this brush!</li>
            <li>Made very cheaply.</li>
            <li>The simple reason is, this brush is the best brush there is.  </li>
            <li>I like this brush a lot better than I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>and I must say that I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I absolutele love this brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Although this is my favorite brush style, I can never find it in stores.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This brush is so much better quality</li>
            <li>If they had had another on the rack I would have picked up one for my man, as this style of brush is now HIS favorite</li>
            <li>I hope thatthe smell will dissipate as I use it more often, but even so I&#x27;m not going to detract a star.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My mother had one like this years ago and wasn&#x27;t sure if Goody still made it.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush..</li>
            <li>All smiles :)</li>
            <li>Its an ok brush.. it has a smell to it..</li>
            <li>It works great at de-tangling my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Also the entire transaction from start to finish was without any problems and shipping was ideal.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush!  </li>
            <li>(this is important when your hands are covered in conditioner or oil).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that Goody is offering this style brush at such an affordable price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li>Brought as a substitute for much higher priced denman brush.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with purchase. :-)</li>
            <li>I love how it smoothes out my most often then not rough ends.</li>
            <li>when I thought I&#x27;d have to finally give up my beloved brush, and go settle for an inferior one, I managed to find these online.  </li>
            <li>This brush is my absolute favorite for detangling my curly hair.</li>
            <li>This one has a good solid feel.</li>
            <li>BIG TIP: makes sure you remove every other row of teeth for best results detangling kinky/very curly hair without pulling your hair-refer to utube to show you how.</li>
            <li>This brush works just like the denman brand and was sent quickly to me.</li>
            <li>As far as packaging,  it was secured nicely and came right on time as speculated.  </li>
            <li>The bristles separated from the handle the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I find that it reduces tangling FAR better than a Tangle Teezer and is significantly easier to hold and grasp</li>
            <li>I was glad to find a new one here on Amazon, since Walmart was no longer carrying them.</li>
            <li>As long as it is available, I will NEVER buy another kind.</li>
            <li>I have tried almost every style of brush and this one by far is my favorite.</li>
            <li>The quality of the replacement was poor at best, seems like a knock-off.</li>
            <li>Packaging was perfect and the brush detangles my hair when it&#x27;s wet or dry.</li>
            <li>They is pretty much identical to my original except for color</li>
            <li>I love the product far too much to do that.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much indeed.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my scalp without tearing out too much of my hair like other brushes.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future</li>
            <li>My first one lasted me 7 years before the rubber broke.</li>
            <li>This brush works great for thick hair.</li>
            <li>-the rubber did not move AT ALL when I attempted to remove the pad to check and make sure that it was an actual Denman-style with removable bristles.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I have used this hairbrush for many years and when mine finally needed to be retired I found this one on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice size for blow drying medium length hair, and unlike some other brushes, the bristles won&#x27;t melt from the heat.  </li>
            <li>Ordered it based in all the positive feedback.</li>
            <li>It works just as good if not better then the Denman brush.</li>
            <li>Have been using this very style brush for over 20 years now.</li>
            <li>He is very picky what it comes tobrushes</li>
            <li>Fast service too.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t pull out my hair..</li>
            <li>I have very long fine hair.</li>
            <li>I bought these to replace a similar Goody that I have had for many years but which is starting to show it&#x27;s age.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t understand why the cost is so high and why I cannot just buy it in the store.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay the high prices of a denman brush</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s helped me through my natural transition and onto many other styles</li>
            <li>Great brush for thin hair!</li>
            <li>It works really well with my natural 3a hair.</li>
            <li>I left mine at my dads and it was worth it to me to buy another to replace it.</li>
            <li>Finally after a year found this brush online and ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this particular type of Goody brush for pretty much my entire life.  </li>
            <li>So I eventually threw the cheap version away and was resigned to having to pay $10 for an actual Denman at Sally&#x27;s when I was wandering the aisles of WalMart one day and saw this brush-the very last one on the rack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush is easy to clean out (without those weird plastic tips like on other hairbrush bristles) and gets the tangles out of my long, wavy hair quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>This is the brush I have used for th past 10 years and love the results.</li>
            <li>When one brush would get old and the rubber would start to crack, we&#x27;d go out and buy another just like it.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d rather not have to replace it frequently</li>
            <li>and i havnt really used it because my transitional hair is so fragile</li>
            <li>I bought this brush to use when i go completely natural.  </li>
            <li>I gave 5 stars because my whole family uses these brushes and they last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>Our hour+ long detangling sessions are over thanks to this brush!</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive with the same results...</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for my old brush that just became old.  </li>
            <li>The rubber pad on the Halsa was extremely flimsy and not well made and the bristles were cheap; several rows snapped right in half when I modified it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember ever using a different brush, and I&#x27;m 34 years old!  </li>
            <li>My father as well will use no other.</li>
            <li>And the hard rubber bristles are totally smooth, without those pesky balls on the ends, like a lot of the so-called \\&quot;detangling\\&quot; brushes out there.  </li>
            <li>It has small &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; that feel great against my scalp and they can hold up to my very thick wavy hair without breaking...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother buying that expensive denman brush, this does the same thing and is much nicer on the pockets :)</li>
            <li>I bought this goody brush as a replacement brush that I had for (8yrs) After an attempt to find it locally and no success, I looked for it on line and Amazon had exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super thick honey blonde, and naturally curly</li>
            <li>I bought it originally for my 6 year old curly girl who has long thick curls and coils</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American female with natural,</li>
            <li>So I bought a few, and when they finally start to give in to age and use, I&#x27;ll buy a few more.  </li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t consider my hair all that difficult to brush, as it&#x27;s very fine and</li>

            <li> Finally after a year found this brush online and ordered it right away.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this particular type of Goody brush for pretty much my entire life.  </li>
            <li> So I eventually threw the cheap version away and was resigned to having to pay $10 for an actual Denman at Sally&#x27;s when I was wandering the aisles of WalMart one day and saw this brush-the very last one on the rack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is easy to clean out (without those weird plastic tips like on other hairbrush bristles) and gets the tangles out of my long, wavy hair quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> This is the brush I have used for th past 10 years and love the results.</li>
            <li> When one brush would get old and the rubber would start to crack, we&#x27;d go out and buy another just like it.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather not have to replace it frequently</li>
            <li> and i havnt really used it because my transitional hair is so fragile</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to use when i go completely natural.  </li>
            <li> I gave 5 stars because my whole family uses these brushes and they last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> Our hour+ long detangling sessions are over thanks to this brush!</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive with the same results...</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my old brush that just became old.  </li>
            <li> The rubber pad on the Halsa was extremely flimsy and not well made and the bristles were cheap; several rows snapped right in half when I modified it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember ever using a different brush, and I&#x27;m 34 years old!  </li>
            <li> My father as well will use no other.</li>
            <li> And the hard rubber bristles are totally smooth, without those pesky balls on the ends, like a lot of the so-called \\&quot;detangling\\&quot; brushes out there.  </li>
            <li> It has small &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; that feel great against my scalp and they can hold up to my very thick wavy hair without breaking...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying that expensive denman brush, this does the same thing and is much nicer on the pockets :)</li>
            <li> I bought this goody brush as a replacement brush that I had for (8yrs) After an attempt to find it locally and no success, I looked for it on line and Amazon had exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a super thick honey blonde, and naturally curly</li>
            <li> I bought it originally for my 6 year old curly girl who has long thick curls and coils</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American female with natural,</li>
            <li> So I bought a few, and when they finally start to give in to age and use, I&#x27;ll buy a few more.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t consider my hair all that difficult to brush, as it&#x27;s very fine and</li>
            <li> Searched stores high and low but had trouble locating this product.  </li>
            <li> It was to my waist by 3rd grade, and past my bum in high school.  </li>
            <li> Eventually, stores stopped carrying them, and although I had a few, they were all disintegrating just the same, as they were probably a decade old at the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush is larger than I expected it to be - it has 9 rows of nylon bristles.  </li>
            <li> For so long they stopped carrying this brush in the store, so I ordered it online.  </li>
            <li> They are almost extinct and are rare in todays market.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend has pin straight, thick, waist length hair and the brush would detach when I would brush his hair for him too.</li>
            <li> My kids are half African American and we are picky with our brush choices</li>
            <li> My hair has always been very long.  </li>
            <li> They had changed the color to black, but that was definitely MY brush!  </li>
            <li> I was thinking about paying for the expensive version when the Goody&#x27;s brush was exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Takes out tangles out of wet hair with ease without tugging hair.</li>
            <li> I like to use this brush either in the bath while I detangle my hair or after a shower when my hair is sopping wet to ensure the product is distributed evenly.</li>
            <li> All other brushes can pack it up and go home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know of a lot of other naturals who have stated that this brush pulls out their hair</li>
            <li> It goes through my wet hair without a problem and without snagging!  </li>
            <li> I guess the rubber but other than that I would recommend..</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick and this brush definitely gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> It was annoying and it would become detached right in the middle of a section of hair.</li>
            <li> All my life, we basically just trimmed the dead ends and kept it even.  </li>
            <li> I need a brush that can tackle the thickness, get the tangles out, and not hurt me in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The firm rubber pad of this brush</li>
            <li> I searched everywhere for a full size rubber base Goody Brush and could not find any at a retail store.</li>
            <li> is that it REEKS of raw rubber.</li>
            <li> I happen to like this because my hair is thick and slightly wavy.</li>
            <li> (cut to shoulder length, grew it out again, cut again and donated it a couple of years ago, and it&#x27;s now past my waist again)  </li>
            <li> (IE I hate the big teeth, and all the other brushes with small teeth break off into my hair in some way).</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone to at least try.</li>
            <li> Sometimes generic isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find this in stores in my area.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very hard and the rubber base doesn&#x27;t have any \\&quot;give\\&quot; to it.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The price is not to bad either.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a TERRIBLE knock off Denman (Halsa brand) at the 99 Cent store, but the problem was that brush would literally fall apart while detangling or brushing my curls.</li>

            <li> I have been using this particular type of Goody brush for pretty much my entire life.  I can&#x27;t remember ever using a different brush, and I&#x27;m 34 years old!  When one brush would get old and the rubber would start to crack, we&#x27;d go out and buy another just like it.  Back then, the handles were cream-colored, but it was the same brush.  Eventually, stores stopped carrying them, and although I had a few, they were all disintegrating just the same, as they were probably a decade old at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when I thought I&#x27;d have to finally give up my beloved brush, and go settle for an inferior one, I managed to find these online.  They had changed the color to black, but that was definitely MY brush!  So I bought a few, and when they finally start to give in to age and use, I&#x27;ll buy a few more.  The simple reason is, this brush is the best brush there is.  All other brushes can pack it up and go home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me... My hair has always been very long.  I never even had an actual haircut until I was 26. (cut to shoulder length, grew it out again, cut again and donated it a couple of years ago, and it&#x27;s now past my waist again)  All my life, we basically just trimmed the dead ends and kept it even.  It was to my waist by 3rd grade, and past my bum in high school.  It&#x27;s a super thick honey blonde, and naturally curly (though the weight pulls the curl so it just looks wavy).  And I&#x27;m tenderheaded.  I need a brush that can tackle the thickness, get the tangles out, and not hurt me in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The firm rubber pad of this brush means there&#x27;s no wiggling around.  It&#x27;s solid.  It&#x27;s on the job.  And the hard rubber bristles are totally smooth, without those pesky balls on the ends, like a lot of the so-called \\&quot;detangling\\&quot; brushes out there.  Honestly, how are you supposed to be able to gradually work a tangle out without damaging your hair, if you can&#x27;t remove the brush from your hair without causing even more tangles (and pulling! Ouch!)?  This brushis where it&#x27;s at.  This is a kickass brush.  As long as it is available, I will NEVER buy another kind. Ever.</li>
            <li> We have both denman and goody brushes. The goody brush is a lighter weight, but still works great for my kids. My kids are half African American and we are picky with our brush choices</li>
            <li> I have very long fine hair. I have tried almost every style of brush and this one by far is my favorite. It takes knots out very easily. My father as well will use no other. Great on all types of hair.</li>
            <li> Have been using this very style brush for over 20 years now. Very glad they continue to make them.</li>
            <li> detangles my kinky coily hair like a dream with minimum tugging and pulling. great product that i recommended to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I like this brush a lot better than I thought it would.  I&#x27;m an African American female with natural, 4a/4b hair and I must say that I love this brush.  I know of a lot of other naturals who have stated that this brush pulls out their hair but I haven&#x27;t had that problem.  My hair is really thick and this brush definitely gets the job done.  Would recommend it to anyone to at least try.</li>
            <li> This brush is my absolute favorite for detangling my curly hair. It goes through my wet hair without a problem and without snagging!  It&#x27;s also great to get product evenly dispersed through your hair.  I love, love, love this brush!</li>
            <li> This brush is larger than I expected it to be - it has 9 rows of nylon bristles.  It&#x27;s a nice size for blow drying medium length hair, and unlike some other brushes, the bristles won&#x27;t melt from the heat.  The bristles are very hard and the rubber base doesn&#x27;t have any \\&quot;give\\&quot; to it.  I happen to like this because my hair is thick and slightly wavy. This brush definitely penetrates it.    I would not recommend it to someone with curly hair because I don&#x27;t think it would go through the hair without pulling and causing breakage.</li>
            <li> I saw rave reviews on the Denman brush&amp;wanted to try one. Almost broke down&amp;bought one when I saw a review on the Goody version. Searched high&amp;low before I found it here. I got two for the price of 1 Denman brush!!! It has made detangling a breeze! If you want a Denman,but not the price. Buy this brush!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the brush I have used for th past 10 years and love the results.Will buy more in the future</li>
            <li> I absolutele love this brush I was thinking about paying for the expensive version when the Goody&#x27;s brush was exactly what I needed! I&#x27;ve recommended this brush to everyone I know with curly, wavy, or kinky hair. A must have!</li>
            <li> Made very cheaply. Can&#x27;t believe Goody put out a product like this. Ordered it based in all the positive feedback. Looks like it will fall apart after one use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this type of brush for over 8 years. My first one lasted me 7 years before the rubber broke. I was glad to find a new one here on Amazon, since Walmart was no longer carrying them. The brush is easy to clean out (without those weird plastic tips like on other hairbrush bristles) and gets the tangles out of my long, wavy hair quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> I used this hairbrush almost daily for about two years and then the rubber began to tear at the corners where the bristles are inserted.  I didn&#x27;t abuse the brush in any way and the rubber hadn&#x27;t deteriorated.  And I don&#x27;t consider my hair all that difficult to brush, as it&#x27;s very fine and straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this style of brush but I&#x27;d rather not have to replace it frequently so I think next time I&#x27;ll buy one from a different manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This product works as well as my Denman brush. It works great at de-tangling my naturally curly hair.I was very pleased with this product and will be ordering another one.</li>
            <li> This brush works wonderfully.  It brushes out all of the tangles without scraping the scalp.  Thank you very much indeed.</li>
            <li> I used this Denman brush on my daughter&#x27;s afro 3a/3b hair and it detangled her very curly hair perfectly and didnt pull her hair out.  Now my hair is kinky 4b/4c and i havnt really used it because my transitional hair is so fragile i think this brush might not be good to use at this time.  I bought this brush to use when i go completely natural.  I have heard great things aboout this brush&#x27;s ability to detangle kinky hair. BIG TIP: makes sure you remove every other row of teeth for best results detangling kinky/very curly hair without pulling your hair-refer to utube to show you how.</li>
            <li> 3 years later and this brush is still my bestfriend! great purchase, it&#x27;s helped me through my natural transition and onto many other styles</li>
            <li> Heard good things about this Goody brush that provoked me into buying it. I&#x27;m pleased with the results. It works just as good if not better then the Denman brush. Sometimes generic isn&#x27;t bad at all. Atleast not for me.</li>
            <li> Although this is my favorite brush style, I can never find it in stores.  It has small &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; that feel great against my scalp and they can hold up to my very thick wavy hair without breaking...best of both worlds! (IE I hate the big teeth, and all the other brushes with small teeth break off into my hair in some way).</li>
            <li> I gave 5 stars because my whole family uses these brushes and they last a pretty long time. I cant find these brushes at any of the stores around me so its nice that i can just order them from here. The price is not to bad either.</li>
            <li> Excellent value.  We are very pleased with this product.  This one has a good solid feel.</li>
            <li> The bristles separated from the handle the very first time I used it. Somewhat of a disappointment. But when it was able to hold the two pieces together it did separate my curls nicely,</li>
            <li> I searched everywhere for a full size rubber base Goody Brush and could not find any at a retail store. They are almost extinct and are rare in todays market. I&#x27;ve had and owned one for decades till it recently gave out on me. I ordered two just in case.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace a similar Goody that I have had for many years but which is starting to show it&#x27;s age. They is pretty much identical to my original except for color so I already knew I was going to like them.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It&#x27;s the only type I&#x27;ll use.  It feels good on my scalp without tearing out too much of my hair like other brushes.  My daughters use it also.  As far as packaging,  it was secured nicely and came right on time as speculated.  :)</li>
            <li> Came on time. This brush works great for thick hair. I will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, no problems with it.</li>
            <li> I have waist length thiick curley hair and this bursh is the perfect one for me!! I left mine at my dads and it was worth it to me to buy another to replace it.</li>
            <li> I bought this goody brush as a replacement brush that I had for (8yrs) After an attempt to find it locally and no success, I looked for it on line and Amazon had exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> My choice for the last 40 years</li>
            <li> Great product but I don&#x27;t understand why the cost is so high and why I cannot just buy it in the store.</li>
            <li> Great brush for thin hair!</li>
            <li> Started using this type of brush 20 yrs ago and nothing else compares. My kids now prefer this brush, we own three.</li>
            <li> This brush works just like the denman brand and was sent quickly to me. Packaging was perfect and the brush detangles my hair when it&#x27;s wet or dry. Since it&#x27;s plastic do not use any heat or the teeves will melt in your hair. These kinds of brushes our never meant to use when blow drying your hair on any setting. I recommend this seller and the brush for all hair types ( great detangler).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thinking about purchasing another brush for a standby or to get one for my mama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Searched stores high and low but had trouble locating this product.  Finally after a year found this brush online and ordered it right away.  Takes out tangles out of wet hair with ease without tugging hair.</li>
            <li> I naught this for my husband . He is very picky what it comes tobrushes and he was very happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> best brush i have had for a while will keep buying this brush gets tangles out really easily. no complaints</li>
            <li> I was SO HAPPY to find a cheaper option of this Denman-style brush! It&#x27;s essentially a knock-off Denman. I like to use this brush either in the bath while I detangle my hair or after a shower when my hair is sopping wet to ensure the product is distributed evenly. I find that it reduces tangling FAR better than a Tangle Teezer and is significantly easier to hold and grasp (this is important when your hands are covered in conditioner or oil). I had purchased a TERRIBLE knock off Denman (Halsa brand) at the 99 Cent store, but the problem was that brush would literally fall apart while detangling or brushing my curls. The rubber pad on the Halsa was extremely flimsy and not well made and the bristles were cheap; several rows snapped right in half when I modified it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem with the Halsa brand brush was that the pad would move around while I was detangling. It was annoying and it would become detached right in the middle of a section of hair. It wasn&#x27;t because of my hair texture- my boyfriend has pin straight, thick, waist length hair and the brush would detach when I would brush his hair for him too. So I eventually threw the cheap version away and was resigned to having to pay $10 for an actual Denman at Sally&#x27;s when I was wandering the aisles of WalMart one day and saw this brush-the very last one on the rack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I snatched it up IMMEDIATELY. It was also under $5! AWESOME. This brush is so much better quality-the rubber did not move AT ALL when I attempted to remove the pad to check and make sure that it was an actual Denman-style with removable bristles. It took a good deal of elbow grease to get the pad on this baby to come off. That&#x27;s good news for me. I&#x27;m happy that Goody is offering this style brush at such an affordable price. If they had had another on the rack I would have picked up one for my man, as this style of brush is now HIS favorite too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have with this brush is that it REEKS of raw rubber. I hope thatthe smell will dissipate as I use it more often, but even so I&#x27;m not going to detract a star. I love the product far too much to do that.</li>
            <li> I love how it smoothes out my most often then not rough ends. It makes it very easy to curl the ends and I like the results after I use the brush. Don&#x27;t bother buying that expensive denman brush, this does the same thing and is much nicer on the pockets :)</li>
            <li> This is a really good product. I bought it for my daughter&#x27;s birthday,&lt;br /&gt;and she is very pleased. Fast service too.</li>
            <li> Been using this brush for years.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this brush!  I bought it originally for my 6 year old curly girl who has long thick curls and coils (3a/b hair) that are prone to tangling.  Our hour+ long detangling sessions are over thanks to this brush!</li>
            <li> For the price paid, Goody hairbrushes can&#x27;t be beat and this product qualifies nicely.  I like the color and bristles and everything else.  This is my only choice for this type of product.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what I was looking for.  My mother had one like this years ago and wasn&#x27;t sure if Goody still made it.  Very happy it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li> I thought I loved this brush, but when I straightened my daughter&#x27;s hair with a blow dryer, the bristles melted. There were no directions on the packaging, but I was just using a blow dryer like I always do. I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was purchased to replace one of the same where the rubber piece had cracked after years of faithful service. The quality of the replacement was poor at best, seems like a knock-off. Would not purchase again</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive with the same results... I love this brush.. It works really well with my natural 3a hair. Very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t pull out my hair.. All smiles :)</li>
            <li> Its an ok brush.. it has a smell to it.. I guess the rubber but other than that I would recommend.. it does help get the tangles out</li>
            <li> For so long they stopped carrying this brush in the store, so I ordered it online.  I was very happy with it, but then I found them in the stores agian.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find this in stores in my area.  This is a replacement for my old brush that just became old.  I will be buying this again if needed.</li>
            <li> Brush came packaged well, as pictured. Brought as a substitute for much higher priced denman brush.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with purchase. :-)</li>
            <li> I have used this hairbrush for many years and when mine finally needed to be retired I found this one on Amazon.com.  I was thrilled.  Also the entire transaction from start to finish was without any problems and shipping was ideal.</li>
            <li> great brush for the price. It does a good job of detangling without pulling out your hair. I would recommend this for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to pay the high prices of a denman brush</li>
    </ol>
