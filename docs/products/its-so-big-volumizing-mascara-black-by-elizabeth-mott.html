            <li>Very happy to have found this mascara : )</li>
            <li>My search for the best mascara in the world is over :) (Australia)</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my lashes look and best of all...</li>
            <li>I find the brush the perfect size for both top and bottom lashes</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful, much better than the &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; department store brands.</li>
            <li>I tried for almost 13 years to find the best drugstore mascara that could lengthen, thicken, curl, and most of all, STAY ON.</li>
            <li>Sincerely the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li>Very happy with this mascara :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this was the product that came in, I am very satisfied with this mascara, and will be buying again!!</li>
            <li>Love the brush, no clumps, love it!!!!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone wanting some really nice mascara!</li>
            <li>nice!</li>
            <li>This is the best waterproof mascara I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used many brands;  you name them, I have tried them.  </li>
            <li>Love Love this Mascara!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the perfect mascara for many years now, so when I stumbled upon</li>
            <li>The lash level was excellent and much better than anything else I have used.  </li>
            <li>Best part, it&#x27;s &#x27;beauty without bunnies&#x27; - cruelty free!</li>
            <li>I notice that I get a fair amount of volume and great lengthening.</li>
            <li>Most awesome mascara ever!</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with this awesome mascara!</li>
            <li>Love this, great price!</li>
            <li>Love it, worked great!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s spectacular!</li>
            <li>Every mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried has been at best OK..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most perfect mascara I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I had never heard of this mascara before but searched on amazon for best mascara and this was at the top.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do the world&#x27;s greatest job of thickening, but maybe I just need to put on more coats of it.</li>
            <li>I love the brush for this mascara, it&#x27;s perfect for adding volume while preventing the clumping together of eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It makes them look nice though!</li>
            <li>Plus no allergic reaction, which is nice!</li>
            <li>I have tried to find the perfect mascara since my go to  went out of production many years ago.</li>
            <li>Very impressed :-)</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the perfect mascara for what seems like most of my makeup wearing life.</li>
            <li>The product is OK, it is not the best.</li>
            <li>This has to be one of the most perfect mascara ever.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look great and it removes easily with soap and water, yet stays on and stays on looking good until it&#x27;s time to take it off!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice and comes off with water very easily but doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge!</li>
            <li>Never had a mascara that lasts and looks good - this does - Love it!!</li>
            <li>Granted, they are not luxurious, beautiful lashes I&#x27;ve always dreamed of having, but compared to having none, and not being able to wear mascara for two decades, it is welcomed!.</li>
            <li>This one was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>Awesome mascara, easy to wash off</li>
            <li>Easy to remove and best of all</li>
            <li>I was happy to find that Amazon carries this mascara that I have come to love!  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply and remove!  </li>
            <li>It looked as good at 8pm as it did at 5am when I applied it.</li>
            <li>That being said, I guess I need to find a good eye makeup remover that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to have it all and fit in the gym at your lunch break this is the best mascara.</li>
            <li>Looks good at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>The color is good, but it seems to clump up on my lashes.  </li>
            <li>This mascara was so good that I went to the lower reviews just to see how or why they gave it one or two stars.</li>
            <li>I like the wand, the shape is a good idea.</li>
            <li>You do need a good waterproof mascara remover.</li>
            <li>It was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the good: this stuff LASTS.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to layering up on mascara like putting on sweaters in a snow storm, but it wasn&#x27;t much good here.</li>
            <li>Someone else may find this product satisfactory and be delighted with the outcome.</li>
            <li>/&gt;People said it looked really good</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>This looked so good on my lashes...</li>
            <li>I bought one for myself and one for my mom who also loved it.</li>
            <li>and this fit the bill perfect.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to wear anything else with it (eyeliner, etc) because it makes my lashes look so good.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product after reading all the good reviews.</li>

            <li>I was looking for a mascara that was cruelty-free and this one got really good reviews so even though I wanted a waterproof mascara, I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>This product is good to me</li>
            <li>I wanted to give a fair review.  </li>
            <li>I loved this Mascara</li>
            <li>Really loved the way the brush was designed.</li>
            <li>The brush is not as good as the buxom mascara brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even as good as a $7 mascara you&#x27;d buy in a drugstore.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t even as good as those</li>
            <li>This mascara is good.  </li>
            <li>it does look good</li>
            <li>but i think you could find one just as good for cheaper</li>
            <li>I dont notice any smell, and the staying power is good.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all, which is good.  </li>
            <li>I loved this mascara, but I&#x27;m going to toss it because I try to avoid putting toxins in/on my body</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good mascara.  </li>
            <li>I always look for really good mascaras and have tried everything from Maybelline to Sephora and this one outshines them all.</li>
            <li>I have told everyone who is looking for a GOOD mascara to buy this.</li>
            <li>Stays on, doesn&#x27;t flake or crumble, for a good 24 hrs.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Two coats and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mascara because it received good reviews...</li>
            <li>Stays on nicely and looks great throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, good luck taking it off.</li>
            <li>At some point the formula must&#x27;ve change because the product is not as good as it was, I still like it</li>
            <li>My sister tried it out and loved it</li>
            <li>Very clean, smudge proof, great lashes and CRUELTY FREE!!!</li>
            <li>Washes off so easily!!</li>
            <li>Mascara stays on all day, no running, no smearing, and comes off easily when it&#x27;s time to wash your face!!</li>
            <li>Also comes off easily with my makeup wipes !!</li>
            <li>Plus it also comes off easy!!</li>
            <li>I was so impressed by this mascara after receiving a sample that I bought the full size.  </li>
            <li>I had a trial of this product and was very impressed and so purchased full size product.  </li>
            <li>It beautifully separates &amp; lengthens your lashes, and also thickens to your desire, depending on how many coats you apply.  </li>
            <li>It also washes off relatively easy with soap and water, although make-up remover is ideal.</li>
            <li>This mascara glides on, gives exceptional volume, and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE this awesome mascara -- not &amp;#34;goopie&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;flakie -  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the product as well as the quick processing of my order.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real,&amp;#34; and find that to be exceptional in every way.</li>
            <li>, second, it builds, lenghens and curls my lashes, and doesnt flake, smudge or smear, and Lasts allllllllll day and the best part is, it washes off very easily with water!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Simply the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, hands-down, and that it&#x27;s cruelty-free makes it perfect.  </li>
            <li>I just love it, love it, love it!!!!</li>
            <li>This is really great mascara - I heard about it from a good friend who goes for a bit more made up look than I do</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t super impressed.</li>
            <li>It lasted through tears of happiness, dancing, and a warm day and looked as good at the end of the day as at the start of the day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many since Avon discontinued my favorite, and this one is without a doubt the best.  </li>
            <li>The wife loved it and says most of all it doesn&#x27;t clump!</li>
            <li>And perhaps the best part for me is that this is the very first mascara that doesn&#x27;t require makeup remover.</li>
            <li>This mascara does a really good job of making my skimpy lashes longer, thicker and more defined!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lengthen the way I had hoped but it&#x27;s very nice mascara - washes off beautifully - does not smudge and the brush is cool.  </li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE LOVE this!!!  </li>

            <li>This mascara is very lovely.  </li>

            <li>I am very pleased and like a lot of you out there have been searching for that mascara.</li>
            <li>Great formula, staying power, and NO flaking (which is a problem I have with most waterproof mascaras).</li>
            <li>Since this product had so many great reviews I thought I would try it out</li>
            <li>This one magically opens up your eyes and does a great job adding length and volume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;;ve been using this mascara and am very pleased with the volume it has given to my lashes</li>
            <li>I could not be more happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>I am beyond baffled as to why this mascara has so many great reviews.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>That is its best quality, and worth buying for that reason</li>
            <li>you will be very pleased as it doesn&#x27;t run/smudge at all.</li>
            <li>but then when u apply more and more coats your eyelashes look really nice!!</li>
            <li>Went on vacation right after I started using it, and it was awesome.</li>
            <li>The best part is that soap and water will take the mascara right</li>
            <li>This product is better than some brands that cost more!!</li>
            <li>Very nice, lightweight mascara :)</li>
            <li>Definitely not the best ever....but certainly very good.</li>
            <li>I bought this based upon the great reviews and am not disappointed!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s cruelty free and the brush is great!</li>

            <li>This is absolutely one of the best mascaras I have ever used.  </li>

            <li>Also seems to stay on nicely too - at the end of the day</li>

            <li>If someone asks me what kind of mascara</li>
            <li>, she was thrilled to know she doesn&#x27;t have to apply</li>
            <li>and it provides a nice, lengthening coverage.</li>
            <li>Both give nice length.</li>
            <li>one of my 6th graders asked me what kind of mascara</li>
            <li>They are nicely separated.</li>
            <li>It has a nice brush too.</li>
            <li>I threw it in my makeup bag and never tried it because I had a mascara that I liked.  </li>
            <li>I treat it as a tubular and take a warm wash cloth and squeeze my lashes with it</li>
            <li>I really liked it but did not want to spend that kind of money on mascara</li>
            <li>but it does provide a nice definition and added length.</li>
            <li>They send a nice size sample.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that this company does not do testing on animals and they make a superior product.</li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of Blinc--even though it&#x27;s not \\&quot;waterproof\\</li>
            <li>It really IS the best!</li>
            <li>I wish I could return the item honestly</li>
            <li>Or if you&#x27;ve ever used Milani infinite eye liquid eyeliner, the texture is kind of like that product, a bit thinner though.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It goes on really nicely, and STAYS on without smudging, clumping, or flaking.</li>
            <li>Nice added length to lashes</li>
            <li>Thanks again for a great product!!</li>
            <li>look nice and seperated.  </li>
            <li>It really is the best mascara</li>
            <li>Washes off with warm water and Neutrogena Foaming face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I have spend much more money and not had as good of results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update----I am still loving this mascara.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best mascara that I have ever used!!!  </li>
            <li>Not the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used but far superior to store bought.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thinner mascara, so it coats the eyelashes nicely without clumping at all and gives them a really nice length.</li>
            <li>Nice coverage, no raccoon eyes in 80 degree heat.  </li>
            <li>she begged me to buy her one of her own.</li>
            <li>Effective and no clumps.  </li>
            <li>The brush does a nice job of separating the lashes while coating them thoroughly -- no lumps, no smears.</li>
            <li>This mascara really is the best.</li>
            <li>I have used every kind of mascara and this is up there as one of my favs.</li>
            <li>Warm water and face wash or a makeup remover works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a good product</li>
            <li>when you check yourself in the mirror, it&#x27;s not the broccoli in your teeth that&#x27;s catching your eye, it&#x27;s that damn mascara all smudged under there . .</li>
            <li>It goes on flawlessly and does NOT clump or flake the whole day.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake or smear, and comes off nicely at end of day.  </li>
            <li>Many happiness.  </li>
            <li>I got kind of gooped together lashes</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the great product!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really the perfect mascara!</li>
            <li>I am continually looking for a nice mascara that does not clump, elongates your lashes and does not smudge.</li>
            <li>After a popular company discontinued my go-</li>
            <li>Really good mascara, probably the most effective</li>
            <li>This product is good, but I was hoping for something more.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still using this mascara exclusively and loving it.</li>
            <li>Kind of just a tint and lengthens.</li>
            <li>I am neither thrilled or disatisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li>Though I did not get the volume I would have liked, the product went on nicely and did not smear through the day.</li>
            <li>It really works great!</li>
            <li>Nice build-able consistency without getting clumpy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going on nicely,</li>
            <li>Nice mascara</li>
            <li>I kind of look like a doll hah.</li>
            <li>Good mascara, better than any drugstore mascara I have tried.</li>
            <li>Honestly did not get the hype of this mascara.</li>
            <li>My friend really liked it.</li>
            <li>This mascara does a nice job thoroughly coating lashes.</li>
            <li>I actually really liked this mascara.</li>
            <li>I liked that this mascara didn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>Wow....it is so nice to check the mirror at lunch time and not see raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li>A really good purchase :-)</li>
            <li>So for that reason I did not find it any better than a good drugstore brand.  </li>
            <li>It works great but there are more out there with a more affordable price.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and close together</li>
            <li>mascara is a nice inky consistency that ensures you wont end up with hideous chunks and clumps.  </li>
            <li>It does add volume, the brush is nice and it catches lashes nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest,</li>
            <li>I have been loving this mascara.</li>
            <li>It makes my own look fuller and longer...</li>
            <li>I love that they are clearly good people.</li>
            <li>However, I really liked it, while it lasted.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really add any volume or definition to my lashes...not impressed.</li>
            <li>This brand is the absolute best.</li>
            <li>It does not run onto my skin, lasts all day, and washes off with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this mascara.</li>
            <li>A nice feature - the hourglass brush gets into the corners without poking yourself with a pointed end.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice mascara.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely THE BEST mascara I have ever, ever worn in my life.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t clump which is nice.</li>
            <li>It has a nice liquidy formula so it lets go of the brush, but clings to your lashes.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t feel like the brush &amp;#34;combed through&amp;#34; my eyelashes as I would have liked them to.</li>
            <li>I have been on a quest to find a good lengthening mascara,that does not flake,or pull out even MORE of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s extremely happy with it, price was great and delivery was fast as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!  </li>
            <li>Love love love this mascara!!</li>
            <li>no clumping and super easy to apply... and the product itself is great!</li>
            <li>Every woman wants to have their eyes looking sexy after all this is what is noticed by everyone!!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY WORTH THE PRICE!!!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!!!</li>
            <li>This mascara is absolutely terrific, best I have ever used honestly!</li>
            <li>It stays on great giving full lashes and washes off nicely.</li>
            <li>It was at my door within 48 hours which is awesome, but after trying it on I didn&#x27;t exactly understand why there&#x27;s so many 5 star ratings.</li>
            <li>It removes very easily with warm water.  </li>
            <li>this is such a good mascara, doesn&#x27;t flake, stays on until you take it off, and the best part, its cruelty free!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is the best mascara I have EVER used and believe me, I&#x27;ve used them all from drug store brands to high end department store brands.  </li>
            <li>Happy to pay $20 for the full size.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and looks great, and even better, it comes off easily (without leaving eye lashes on the cleaning cloth!</li>
            <li>requested a sample from Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s site and they ended up sending me all three samples, which is very sweet!</li>
            <li>My new favorite mascara!!!!!</li>
            <li>All that is great, but then add on top of it that it doesn&#x27;t flake, it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, it doesn&#x27;t clump, it goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, it goes on smooth and adds great volume.</li>
            <li>Heard good great things about this mascara but found it to be less than impressive  for the price...  Going to stick to L&#x27;Oréal telescopic mascara,  way better and cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this mascara because it goes on easily and is a good volumizer.</li>
            <li>Absolute favorite mascara, great product!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara because it&#x27;s easy to apply, easy to remove, never ever flakes or smudges, lasts all day, and looks incredible.</li>
            <li>Easy to layer for gorgeous lashes.</li>
            <li>For a non-waterproof mascara, it has good staying power but washes of easily.</li>
            <li>For anyone writing reviews where they haven&#x27;t had a good experience it could be in the way they apply their mascara - I use a back-and-forth motion starting at the  bottom of my lashes working up and it works perfect every time.</li>
            <li>We used to use BENEFIT - they&#x27;re real &amp; as much as we loved that mascara , we tried this one and love it even more.  </li>
            <li>Great mascara and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>And I loved that it is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>And best of all, for my very sensitive eyes.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>In fact, it is very easy to take off.</li>
            <li>it comes off very easily when I was my face a night.</li>
            <li>Very easy to remove as well.</li>
            <li>It comes off very easily with a make-up remover wipe or with soap and water, but I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about it running.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t come off very easy.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very easy to wash off</li>
            <li>It also lasts all day but is very easy to take off when need to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought one and immediately bought two more to make sure I don&#x27;t run out!</li>

            <li>I have been searching for a good mascara that is also cruelty free.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>

            <li>NOTHING has ever lasted more than two hours on me, and I&#x27;d given up hope that I could find a brand that would have any kind of staying power.  </li>
            <li>I wish you could build on the length more than you can, but it does give nice length.</li>
            <li>So far, this is the best I have found.  </li>
            <li>I continue to try mascaras and this is the best so far - it doesn&#x27;t end up under my lower lids, on my skin.  </li>
            <li>company contacted me almost immediately in response to this review, and gave a me a stunning, amazing, and generous response (which included a replacement bottle).</li>

            <li>The best mascara I have used so far is the CoverGirl Volumizing Lash in the orange tube you buy at any ole drug store.</li>
            <li>Amazing. :)</li>
            <li>Being an ex makeup artist, I will tell you this formula to me is up there with the top brands at sephora and did give my lashes volume and like promised didnt budge until i applied warm water</li>
            <li>But the most amazing thing to me is the staying power.</li>
            <li>I wash it off every night with Purity (from Philosophy); I doubt that most normal face washes would take it off well, so probably best to use eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>First and foremost - CRUELTY FREE - what a beautiful thing, thank you for this!!!   </li>
            <li>It really is awesome and my new favorite.</li>
            <li>The design of the wand it great too making for easy, clump free application.</li>
            <li>I have very fine lashes</li>
            <li>I was looking for and it easily washes off without any scrubbing!</li>
            <li>said that it was easy to remove and its NOT!</li>
            <li>But somehow also manages to be easy to take off!</li>
            <li>Comed off easily yet stays all day!</li>
            <li>And then at the end of the day, it comes off easily as well!</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and DOES NOT FLAKE!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to wash off!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product as it is easy to apply and stays applied throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I have very fine eyelashes and watery eyes</li>
            <li>Love love love this mascara!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this mascara!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this mascara!</li>
            <li>You will love, love, love this!  </li>
            <li>And the best part, there are no dark smudges under my eyes when I wake up in morning.</li>
            <li>I even slept in it and woke up excited how good they still looked with no smearing or raccoon eyes at all,</li>
            <li>The mascara is good: very high quality, looks good on my lashes etc.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>At my age, I use a good amount of undereye moisturizers, and that was causing smudge even with waterproof mascaras that were a nightmare to try to clean off at night.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a fat but natural look, or I can layer on more for some POW if I want it.</li>
            <li>I mention this as the majority of time there I was not only in the water a great deal of the time, but I there was also a great deal of heat and humidity at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far superior to Great Lash</li>
            <li>(if you get a good tube) is really that good that I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>but so far both times the mascara went on great and did a good job of separating my lashes.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, so far it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras and this is by far the best yet.</li>
            <li>If you want not only a great product but also a great after sales service</li>
            <li>I started out wiping the brush as clean as I could without good results.</li>
            <li>It feels great on my lashes, not clumpy, lasts all day and makes my lashes long and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I love that i put it on, it stays and comes off very easy with out having to rub my eyes.</li>
            <li>Dior doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to this no clump miracle in a bottle :) Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and great product</li>
            <li>Builds nicely for either a clean (not clumpy!)</li>
            <li>I think, regardless what I do, I save that for special occasions and leave myself a good 10 minutes to apply the mascara.  </li>
            <li>Great product thanks!</li>
            <li>Great mascara and fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>The first two tubes I got were great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty great about defining your lashes and not clumping.</li>
            <li>when I applied this great mascara, it looked awesome, didn&#x27;t curl my top lashes down or bottom lashes up on the ends like some do, but really looked great</li>
            <li>Great lengthening without clumps and super easy to remove - no smearing or smudging either.</li>
            <li>Recommended to all my beauty loving friends and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great mascara.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly with no clumps.</li>
            <li>The mascara is very smooth and glides on.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are very light.</li>
            <li>The mascara goes on very smooth.  </li>

            <li>Very smooth application.</li>
            <li>the mascara is very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Amazing mascara ams easy to remove.</li>
            <li>not sure if its the best Volumizing mascara, but it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Doesnt smear in the water and can remove easily with warm water.</li>
            <li>Nice brush with a curved shape to it makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also does not flake, run, clump, or come off until you want it to, and then it rubs off easily with warm water.</li>
            <li>This one goes on easy and has a nice brush that separates lashes.</li>
            <li>applicator is easy to use and the mascara goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>It washes off easily, which is nice since I don&#x27;t have to tug at my lashes to get the mascara off.</li>
            <li>Still, a nice product that goes on well and stays put throughout the day yet removes easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove at night-just use warm water.</li>
            <li>It washes easily with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m from Australia, and finding a cheap, loved mascara isn&#x27;t always easy.</li>
            <li>Nice product and quick delivery!</li>
            <li>Especially nice for someone older whose lashes don&#x27;t seem quite as full as they once were.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone who likes their lashes to look longer, thicker, and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>This mascara makes my lashes huge and does not clump!</li>
            <li>After going through several mascara&#x27;s that kept flaking on my skin throughout the day, I am so happy to have found this one!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE</li>
            <li>Lovely mascara.</li>

            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>, more just interesting</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>but I like my L&#x27;oreal volumizing better.</li>
            <li>Move on to something better.</li>
            <li>Love this product it does what it says</li>
            <li>I love it, goes on without clumps</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not labeled as waterproof but I have cried so many time while wearing this</li>
            <li>but as for the ones that cost more than drugstore,prices  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve found the better mascara.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I get much better results using cheaper department store mascara.</li>
            <li>Have tried Better Than Sex and now this.  </li>
            <li>Have to put on too many coats.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the mascaras&lt;br /&gt;out</li>
            <li>This gives me awesome, lasting volume.</li>
            <li>The lengthening ability is amazing and it goes on smoothly with literally no clumping whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Many drugstore-cost mascaras are better for me.  </li>
            <li>I have made it a point to tell family and friends about this, because that&#x27;s how much a love it.</li>
            <li>Trying to take it off at night takes more than soap and water - you need product remover to get this mascara off.</li>
            <li>How are there so many rave reviews for this mascara?</li>
            <li>; by Benefit until I find one that works better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t end up on them during application like most.  </li>
            <li>So many mascaras give the volume</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Put it on just this morning and thought again how much I love it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara and don&#x27;t have to use power at all</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Thank you Elizabeth Mott for coming up with such a great product!</li>
            <li>I have modeled for many years and have had many makeup artist tell me,  after I inform them off my mascara issue,  &amp;#34;ohh</li>
            <li>so many suggest</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>and this is my favorite in years.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the product for 2 weeks I started to notice that my eye lashes began to clump together and no matter how many times I washed my eyes</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m madly, deeply in love with this stuff that I will continue buying it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Since switching, I am able to wear my mascara even during my sneeziest days.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>Just okay.</li>
            <li>I found the Physicians formula is better...</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li>When you apply more than one coat, you don&#x27;t get the Gabore Look...</li>
            <li>So I would classify this as waterproof for sure.  </li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I will probably repurchase :)</li>
            <li>Forever or Benifit works better for me.</li>
            <li>Never used anything better.  </li>
            <li>I love the skinny wand:</li>
            <li>I thought I would LOVE it like everyone else seemed to...</li>
            <li>I received a travel sized version of this mascara in my Ipsy bag and fell completely in love with it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many mascaras.  </li>
            <li>Most mascaras are so so</li>
            <li>I wear contacts and I have tried many brands of mascara at twice the price</li>
            <li>I will never switch again! :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE MASCARA</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I are using this mascara and love it.</li>
            <li>And the $8 Mascara is way better than this one.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how it works, but I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this mascara, but it just wasn&#x27;t as great as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>Especially great with lash lengthening, thickening is better after several uses.</li>
            <li>The mascara wand is well thought out and the opening of the container makes it so you don&#x27;t have to scrub a bunch of mascara off in order to use it, like many others.</li>
            <li>Lashes appear longer and fuller for sure.</li>
            <li>and it is our famliy favorite.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the L&#x27;Oreal Volumizing.  </li>
            <li>, i came upon this mascara buy accident and i&#x27;m so glad i did, all you need is one coat and the mascara</li>
            <li>This mascara is OK.  </li>
            <li>a must better job.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic mascara!</li>
            <li>Best máscarever, this is my second time buying it</li>
            <li>i love the thickness and length of my lashes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many types over the years, from drug store brands through pricey designer brands.</li>
            <li>Application and volume is just ok -</li>
            <li>but I love this product.</li>
            <li>I even fell asleep with it last night and when I woke up it still looked perfect!   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for about 2 weeks now and love it.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful mascara, I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay as surely as Dior Show waterproof, but I think that I prefer this better.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I finally found the perfect mascara.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wearing, I&#x27;m sure as heck not going to tell them &amp;#34;It&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I love the hourglass-shaped brush too.  </li>
            <li>My lashes have never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with Its so Big.  </li>
            <li>The brush could be better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting more based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Because it is truly fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Mabelline&#x27;s Falsies and Mega Plush are both much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love mascara and love to try them all this one was ok but would not get again</li>
            <li>I am enjoying wearing it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product since it doesn&#x27;t leave smearing under your eye.</li>
            <li>really defines them, and gives great length.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I found this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what magic is in this tube</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay product but</li>
            <li>It claims to be a volumizing mascara, which is what I need, but I found it to be more of a lengthening mascara.  </li>
            <li>any $5 mascara from CVS or Walmart is million times better quality.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I also think this is a better lengthening mascara than a volumizing one</li>
            <li>Love this and if it lasted longer I&#x27;d give it a 5 star review</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li>This mascara is just OK.  </li>
            <li>I started off with a sample of their mascara and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I have seen better results from the Maybeline Power Volume 24 H mascara.  </li>
            <li>I have almost no eyelashes and this perks up the ones I do have :)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so many drugstore brands and styles and formulas to choose from, why would I ever spend more than $10 on a mascara?</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mascara connoisseur; I&#x27;ve been using mascara for many years.</li>
            <li>I really love the brush and this does not clump at all</li>
            <li>so I love how it separates my lashes</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found a better brand in the drug store</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>it curled my lashes more, but I guess I could just use a curler...</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE Benefits</li>
            <li>I also really love Fiberwig mascara by Imufiju</li>
            <li>I love with this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I can confidently wear just this when I don&#x27;t want to put on all my war paint.</li>
            <li>And my favorite thing about it?</li>
            <li>did an in depth review of my top 4 favorite mascaras on my blog: http://www.newlyag.com/the-final-four/&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE Benefit&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Then, I finally tried this, and let me tell ya, ITS AWESOME.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I really love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>This is ok I will not buy again.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>No smearing or flaking, and most of the time</li>
            <li>Oh, well, it&#x27;s still much better than alternatives I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many different types of mascara,  this one is the best!</li>
            <li>I just ordered some more.</li>
            <li>Drugstore brands work better.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara....</li>
            <li>I very much enjoyed the make up</li>
            <li>However this mascara is very persistent and tenacious, which is a great feature in some regards but not for removal.</li>
            <li>I will for sure be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>I also love how it doesn&#x27;t clump together when applying.</li>
            <li>I love the way my lashes look and feel.</li>
            <li>I would have given it a five, but is like it to do more thickening in addition to the lengthening.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of macara&#x27;s and none have worked better then this one.</li>
            <li>I have used both Urban Decay and Clinique makeup removers to take this off and both worked perfectly to fully remove this</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li>I have read many posts about how it stays on in rain and humidity.</li>
            <li>and I feel more volumizing.  </li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>but I cannot force myself to put anything else on my lashes any more</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>SIMPLY THE BEST MASCARA</li>
            <li>MANY)- no problem here -</li>
            <li>So I gave it a try once more</li>
            <li>For my lashes, too many layers are needed and I end up with the spider look.  </li>
            <li>This is ok.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Found this and LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li>Bought more than I needed to give as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have had better results with drug store mascaras.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s made of magic :)</li>
            <li>No raccoon eyes and love that it stays in place all day 😀</li>
            <li>I really love this mascara.</li>
            <li>but I think this is way better.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, I had friends using/selling the 3-D lashes</li>
            <li>So why do I LOVE it...</li>
            <li>1) I have been searching for a masacara for about a year (tried many)</li>
            <li>I am about to order another one for my travel bag!! :-)</li>
            <li>I love the brush.</li>
            <li>Should have stuck with Two Faced&#x27;s Better Than Sex Mascara.</li>
            <li>you remove it with eye makeup remover, you need to take some time to remove it well, depending on how many coats you applied.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a mascara I REALLY love, but this comes close to what I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am particularly impressed with the size it makes my lashes look with only two applications.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you take it off with eye make-up remover every day.</li>
            <li>This mascara makes them look like the lashes of my youth &amp; I love that.</li>
            <li>It peaked my interest, finding mascara with so many 5 star ratings.</li>
            <li>I like the price for ISB better</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Better than most drugstore brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>This mascara is ok, better than most grocery store mascaras I&#x27;ve tried since my favorite brand changed</li>
            <li>This is the only mascara I will ever buy - excellent product!!!</li>
            <li>FINALLY I FIND THE PERFECT MASCARA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>TO MAKE SURE YOUR WAND IS LOADED.&lt;br</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>Product is awesome and I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li>The mascara, unlike most formulas, is a bit more viscous and allows for better defining and building.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a mascara that was cruelty free, volumizing, and wasn&#x27;t a bear to get off of my face when I was done with it!  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of this and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>Love this mascara</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love the wand on this brush.</li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite wands I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Does not run or smudge like so many others do.</li>
            <li>the product lasts longer than most.</li>
            <li>For me, a $20 investment in a mascara I love is cheaper than continuing my quest for the perfect mascara and wasting money on 2 or 3 different ones annually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this type of applicator, 2)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It became my favorite mascara</li>
            <li>better than most..</li>
            <li>However, compare &amp;#34;Clinc&amp;#34; which I used to use it, the &amp;#34;Elizabeth Mott&amp;#34; does lighter job, and i don&#x27;t feel it gives more volume</li>
            <li>My go-to mascara for sure</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great quality mascara!</li>
            <li>It does lengthen more than volumize but it does volumize.</li>
            <li>I like this one better.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much better.</li>
            <li>The more I use it the more I like it.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is the way it comes off.</li>
            <li>but I can now wear one mascara on both top and bottom.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara because it checks off all the needs</li>
            <li>Like many others, I received this via Ipsy.  </li>
            <li>LOVE.  </li>
            <li>My I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>This one does it and more.  </li>
            <li>It does not work better for me than my Loreal Voluminous Million Lashes mascara from Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>This mascara is fabulous!</li>
            <li>husband noticed the difference also! :-)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you Elizabeth Mott for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>mascaras are better.</li>
            <li>you can get 2 or more for the price of this one</li>
            <li>A better name will be minimum mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love this part.  </li>
            <li>love love love this.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>The way that I was able to remove it was to be in the shower and literally rub my eyelashes with my face wash.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the everlasting look of this mascara.</li>
            <li>, I love this mascara</li>
            <li>(so many brands claim this</li>
            <li>Love that they use a fiber brush (can&#x27;t stand the rubber, silicone ones).</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love the product and buy it, just like I am.  </li>
            <li>I have used so many brushes and mascaras over the years.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews I had read, I was hoping for much more from this mascara.</li>
            <li>All-in-all, love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Request a sample if you are unsure, but I can guarantee that you will love it.</li>
            <li>We now are able to talk about the weather.  </li>
            <li>thank you Elizabeth for making such an awesome product!!!!!</li>
            <li>but none was able to meet my demands.  </li>
            <li>I immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>It worked better than any mascara I had ever tried.</li>
            <li>On top of that I serve in the US Army Reserves.</li>
            <li>but I love it for my Army life.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the applicator brush, but seems to do well.</li>
            <li>I love the brush....</li>
            <li>Love,</li>
            <li>So glad I found this.  </li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a mascara I really love.  </li>
            <li>This one is okay.  </li>
            <li>gives me the most volume as well as length &amp; doesn&#x27;t flake of at all.</li>
            <li>BadGal lash mascara by Benefit :)  </li>
            <li>I have tried many brands, but always ended up with raccoon eyes by the end of the work-day.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>i will buy again for sure</li>
            <li>I was sent a free sample of this mascara, this is nice stuff.</li>
            <li>One of the better mascaras I have bought online.</li>
            <li>I think it may be a matter of fewer clumps or maybe just a more flexible</li>
            <li>Not glam, but good...natural looking but better.  </li>
            <li>I love this Elizabeth Mott</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product, but I can&#x27;t say that I do.  </li>
            <li>I. Love.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried more than 4 coats.</li>
            <li>I have purchased all the top line mascaras, but this one (in the price range) is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>I love this product it does what it should be doing.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic,  I will keep purchasing it!</li>
            <li>Back on the market looking for that perfect mascara again.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s more fancy than practical.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more time consuming to apply mascara than it would be if the brush were just...</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I have tried SO many mascaras, from drugstore cheapies to designer/Sephora goodies.</li>
            <li>I almost was talked into buying the latest direct-sales mascara trend until I did some research and stumbled across this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought mascara that was cheaper and much better than this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So no raccoon eyes :-)</li>
            <li>This is one of the better ones I tried and would buy again.  </li>
            <li>It lasts all day and is not terrible to remove.</li>
            <li>You couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li>I love this macara.  </li>
            <li>Like most of U I have used many mascaras over the years.</li>
            <li>I wan&#x27;t expecting much better from this item</li>
            <li>but, Thanks Gals, it had so many great reviews I decided to give it</li>
            <li>It stays on all day without any flaking, which is my favorite part.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Although this is called volumizing, I feel it is more lengthening...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but seems to take a lot of going over and over.</li>
            <li>My 6 dollar tube is so much better....</li>
            <li>I now recommend this to all my friends who use mascara &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t clump</li>
            <li>Nothing else will do. : )</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>I love the way it comes off with no tugging or pulling with just water.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve everpaid for a mascara.</li>
            <li>but I think this is better than most I&#x27;ve used in that regard.</li>
            <li>I thought this mascara was going to give my lashes more volume.</li>
            <li>Glad I took the leap.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t change the formula, all I ask, please! :)</li>
            <li>Finally I have found the perfect mascara!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have used many different types of mascara and have to say that this is one works great!</li>
            <li>The brush really helps to reduce clumps and in addition to lots of volume, I also get great length.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>Better than any department store mascara I have used.</li>
            <li>I just love this mascara...</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>What I like most is</li>
            <li>Love love love this mascara...</li>
            <li>fantastic mascara!  </li>
            <li>Although the mascara is marketed as “volumizing”, I found that it lengthens better than it</li>
            <li>best part is its ease of removal with either a facial towlette or cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Simply the BEST mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li>After years of searching I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many brands I&#x27;ve lost count.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, I won&#x27;t buy anything else from now on.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>My favorite was benefit&#x27;s</li>

            <li>Fabulous product!</li>

            <li>I love the mascara.</li>
            <li>It is truly fantastic!  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve never been the most skilled at applying mascara, this one creates the illusion that I know what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li>was I pleased.  </li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more when I run out.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I wish the brush was better.</li>
            <li>I might like this mascara more than &amp;#34;Better Than Sex&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I know I still am, until I find something even better.</li>
            <li>I will be returning this mascara, since it didn&#x27;t give my lashes more volume.  </li>
            <li>MORE SMUDGES,</li>
            <li>but I love my Bobby Brown Waterproof that my daughter took from me.  </li>
            <li>Save your money go to CVS and buy a 6 dollar one you will like it better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had way better mascaras than this...</li>
            <li>I love how it lasts all day</li>
            <li>Top all of that off with it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s So BIG is great!  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with look</li>
            <li>And if anyone has suggestions for a volumizing mascara better than the two I already listed</li>
            <li>and I love the eye shadow and liner that was sent.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>My favorite for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li>An all-around win.</li>
            <li>I will say that I thought it would be a bit more volumizing than it is.</li>
            <li>, I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin and most mascaras end up smearing.</li>
            <li>Plus, you can layer it for a more glam look.  </li>
            <li>I love when it&#x27;s time to wash off your eyes mascara</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>THIS stuff is sooo much better than any of them.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it not smudge or flake, it looks great all day and into the night!</li>
            <li>I have tried many mascaras over the years and many of them do what they claim to do</li>
            <li>I use cheaper mascaras and get much better volumizing from them.  </li>
            <li>Better than Dior.</li>
            <li>Love the brush.</li>
            <li>How refreshing.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will work better for my friend.  </li>
            <li>Could not ask for anything more from a mascara</li>
            <li>I would say this is a bit better than Great Lash, but really does nothing to thicken or lengthen my lashes.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many in all price ranges and</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Makes my lashes look fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I would say this mascara is more lengthening than volumizing.</li>
            <li>Great, except that doesn&#x27;t really work, because the product doesn&#x27;t layer well.</li>
            <li>Many of the mascaras I&#x27;ve tried are too clumpy or make me have caterpillar lashes, which is not the look</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give me the volume that I&#x27;d like, but it does okay.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>but maybe I just need to apply more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a person who takes time to write reviews on any product but this is an outstanding product which MERITS a review.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>love love love..</li>
            <li>I love how it does not smear nor does it shed.</li>
            <li>Is also way better and giving length than those &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; mascara&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I have ever found and I have tried many mascaras.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>And when you fall in love with it,  tell all your friends so that this does not become another make up product</li>
            <li>you fall in love with that</li>
            <li>Both Cover Girl and L&#x27;Oreal have better products.</li>
            <li>When I apply most mascara, it tends to clump, even when the brand claims no clumps.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Thought I would try and I absolutely LOVE this.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Once I realized the value of this mascara, I&#x27;ve never been able to go with another mascara.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews thought it would be better.</li>
            <li>Hi Ladies :-)</li>
            <li>I just bought 2 more &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Mascara :-)</li>
            <li>and I had to reapply more often than I would expect with a volumizing waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>I had better</li>
            <li>While it does build some volume, it is not any better than Revlon or Loreal.</li>
            <li>Love dis mascara</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always trying different brands and still searching for the perfect one.</li>
            <li>But this stuff is smooth and creamy, doesn&#x27;t irritate and wears almost like waterproof!</li>
            <li>Most mascaras add volume OR definition.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried tons of different mascaras and this is the best.</li>
            <li>i love how you can change your look with more coats.</li>
            <li>will be returning for more :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s So Big Mascara really is awesome,</li>
            <li>Mostly claim to be &amp;#34;smudge</li>
            <li>Iconic Overcurl--DS on one eye</li>
            <li>Its just OK, it does not ass volume to my eyelashes</li>
            <li>Fabulous product!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>so I ordered more.</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>It was just ok.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li>My favorite  mascara EVER.</li>
            <li>and I still love it.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is OK.</li>
            <li>this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>but then most mascaras smudge and end up darkening under my eye area - not this one.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I have bought much better mascara from Target.</li>
            <li>This is an ok mascara.</li>
            <li>Perhaps works better for people with longer, curlier lashes?</li>
            <li>if you want more drama, go over again.  </li>
            <li>This is now my go to mascara. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I will be using both :)</li>
            <li>Like so many others, I&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t clump my eyelashes together, it separates them and keeps them looking natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real and it looks great and better.</li>
            <li>It stays on, that&#x27;s for sure. :)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>it going to give you magically longer lashes?</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; is much better, although it&#x27;s $5 more.</li>
            <li>However, any drugstore brand that lengthens will give you better results than &amp;#34;It&#x27;s so Big&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Any mascara would Volumize with that many coats.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s THAT much better.</li>
            <li>LOVE this mascara -</li>
            <li>It does tend to clump lashes together if you layer, but I love it anyway and prefer it over anything I have used.  </li>
            <li>Used to use MAC and CHANEL, this is a much better bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not 100% sure I would pay $20 for it again though.</li>
            <li>Even better customer service.</li>
            <li>The 1st one I ordered was defective, but Alice worked with me and sent me a replacement free of charge!</li>
            <li>Its light weight, holds its shape and lasts all day!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s top quality is it does not smudge, even after a shower.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>The Elizabeth Mott mascara NEVER smudges but also fills in my lashes and lengthens them better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>so glad I bought it based on feedback.</li>
            <li>I bought this one to see if there was anything better out there, turns out there isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The length it gives is ok, the fullness it gives is also just ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I have never fallen in love with a mascara...</li>
            <li>This mascara is absolutely astonishing.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for.</li>
            <li>I love the hour glass shaped brush--it really does a great job at both thickening and lengthening my lashes.  </li>
            <li>For the price of this, I can go to Target and get a better mascara for $8-9.  </li>
            <li>during storage &amp; shipping), and it does seem to be better.</li>
            <li>a feature I LOVE.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara to date - and I&#x27;ve tried so many.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t run in the shower or when you wash your face.</li>
            <li>This is a great product I love that I can wear this mascara the whole day and it will not smudge.</li>
            <li>Better than over the counter brands.  </li>
            <li>I would like to see it elongate the lashes more</li>
            <li>I love the length and separation.</li>
            <li>I am able to accentuate my lower lashes without the clumps.</li>
            <li>It looks better and lasts longer than the store bought brands like revlon and maybelline.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s So BIG mascara is the BEST mascara ever....</li>
            <li>Definitely is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The best thing I can say for this mascara is that it definitely darkens the lashes.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;I was sent was a million times better than what I paid for.</li>
            <li>sure if I&#x27;ll order again though.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I tried many others which also ran.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many things</li>
            <li>This Mascara is OK...</li>
            <li>Great product and fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It provides more length than volume and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>Love the brush.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE &amp;#34;It&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I love the brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many over the years</li>
            <li>L&#x60;oreal works way much better...</li>
            <li>I am ordering more.</li>
            <li>love this.</li>
            <li>Just spend a bit more for this mascara and it won&#x27;t rub off and it doesn&#x27;t take as many layers.</li>
            <li>I like this one better.</li>
            <li>I have tried mascara from department stores, sephora, all the top brands and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>so I would know :)</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara ever.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with the product.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I was able to&lt;br /&gt;get</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy something better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>In LOVE with it and will always buy this for myself and recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>Some great qualities are that it glides on well with no clumps, and it only requires 4 or 5 swipes for a good look.</li>
            <li>but this mascara is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I is just like imju fiber wig but with more product</li>
            <li>I really love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>OK mascara, nothing fancy.  </li>
            <li>I love....</li>
            <li>or else I&#x27;ll for sure have racoon eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I simply love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve bought 5 more to stock up.  </li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t clump and depending on how many coats you put on, seems to do the job of 8.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off going to Walmart and spend $2.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give this a try and am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used $1 mascaras that work better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Will  purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara</li>
            <li>Better than any of the Benefit or Dior top line products.</li>
            <li>Works better for me.</li>
            <li>I use a volumizing mascara and this one on top to make them longer....</li>
            <li>bought it for my gf, said she likes it alot but its not quite her favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend any money on it - for me</li>
            <li>and i love how it makes my lashes look.</li>
            <li>Would love to see you make one without the toxins</li>
            <li>what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras over the years and have found issue with just about all of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this item and will definitely be repurchasing !</li>
            <li>I use this as a top coat to the Younique 3D Fiber mascara to lengthen lashes and prevent smudges.</li>
            <li>I did not see the results I was hoping for...no better than my L&#x27;oreal Volumnious mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it has so many reviews.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used drug store mascaras that work better.  </li>
            <li>Not my most favorite.  </li>
            <li>But, much better than OTC.  </li>
            <li>love this mascara ...</li>
            <li>however there could be improvement if the tube had a better more thorough way of removing the excess mascara from the wand when its withdrawn from the tube ..</li>
            <li>, I think its okay</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>and I love the style of the brush.  </li>
            <li>There have been many mascara brands on my lashes, both drugstore and designer brand.</li>
            <li>The brush I think is the key to the wonderful way it manages to catch and separate your lashes.</li>
            <li>I can safely say that it lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>It does not smudge throughout the day which I love as well.</li>
            <li>This was not my favorite, not as dramatizing as I would expect from a 20 dollar mascara.</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of make-up counter mascaras, and my favorite is still voluminous by loreal.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Love love love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I discovered this mascara.</li>
            <li>It is a lot like better then sex mascara which I love.</li>
            <li>My expectations were more than exceeded.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Love how well it works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>This mascara is more waterproof and lifeproof than any &amp;#34; waterproof&amp;#34; mascara I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find many that I can say I LOVE .  </li>
            <li>Maybes line makes a better one for 5 dollars</li>
            <li>Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It cost about $10 more than the Maybelline mascara that I have been using and it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes stand out.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, no clumping</li>
            <li>so you can do as many layers as you want</li>
            <li>LOVE THAT.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>I also love the name</li>
            <li>making them look better then ever.</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m glad I took this one.</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This mascara for me was just okay</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>One coat does the trick for most days and the max I&#x27;ve ever needed to apply for a night out is two.  </li>
            <li>Cover Girl and Loreal make much better ones for 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li>I paid more for the Department Store brand I used to</li>
            <li>I have been buying various mascaras for years, hunting for the perfect all-in-one that would thicken, curl and lengthen all without clumps.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and like I have way more than I do.</li>
            <li>Fantastic mascara!  </li>
            <li>The only brand I buy now as it is the best!</li>
            <li>Love this mascara, this was a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li>It doesn’t clump up either :)</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>love it ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>A brush that is more shaped like</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Even better, no flaking or raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>over-all, satisfied.</li>
            <li>i am in love.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it like I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used cover girl mascara that was better</li>
            <li>Your better off with a $7 mascara from a drugstore</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>It adds a tasteful amount of volume, layer-able for more if you&#x27;re headed for a night out, stays put, and doesn&#x27;t make a mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For someone with ultra blonde eye lashes this is a great mascara!</li>
            <li>Faced Better Than</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>mascara makes my lashes look fantastic and does not smudge!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara...</li>
            <li>We both love Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I will order again for sure.</li>
            <li>Applies easily without clumps, no flakes, stays on all day without smudging, washes off very easily.</li>
            <li>A very good mascara running usually use Lancôme and this mascara is just as good at a better price!</li>
            <li>The best part, it does not bleed under my eyes or rub off on my upper eye lid, not even during the hot Texas summers!!!</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and clean, very smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how it even survives an intense HIIT workout at the gym!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty easy to take off which is great.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of the mascara in my Ipsy bag and loved it right away.</li>
            <li>It stays put when I Crossfit, which is a first!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!!!!!</li>
            <li>I tried a sample of this mascara and used it until it was gone and just had to buy a full sized mascara to keep the love going!</li>
            <li>My lashes still straighten out flat, but very good at keeping the smudges off my eyes - no raccoon eyes with this mascara!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this mascara ladies, you must try it, and I know you will be very pleased!</li>
            <li>honest ok, nothing special</li>
            <li>This is the best mascara I have used and by far true to its description.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute most amazing mascara ever!  </li>
            <li>It also has amazing staying power, yet washes off clean without residue.</li>
            <li>mascara/brush is excellent at separating out every lash so they look full &amp; lush.  </li>
            <li>It also goes on cleanly and nicely.</li>
            <li>I have tried pretty much every mascara, from drugstore brands to high-end, and this is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I am a 1 coat of mascara girl myself and I love that this looks as good at 5pm as it does at 5 am when I first put it on.  </li>
            <li>Not unlike what you get with a $4 tube of classic Great Lash.  </li>
            <li>I put the mascara on, it is very easy to apply, is not clumpy and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Super sexy volume and length!</li>
            <li>I get tremendous length from it and get so many compliments on my lashes!</li>
            <li>It always makes me happy to find a new favorite brand.</li>
            <li>have so happy that my new found love</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, the color is a perfect jet black</li>
            <li>and it was easy and fast with great customer service.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves to have perfect lashes all day long.</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive feedbacks from this product, I honestly thought that it would have been amazing.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a HUGE HUGE HUGE bonus in my book!!</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re mine!&amp;#34;, all thanks to this amazing mascara!</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, and my lashes are amazing !</li>
            <li>I HAD to buy the full size product, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey compared to what I normally buy, but if it lasts for 3-4 months I will be happy.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is pretty good in some ways.</li>
            <li>makes my eyelash long and beautiful!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect mascara for a long time.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happier with, but this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li>And it creates a beautiful, natural look, defining each and every lash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cool when you wash it off, it kind of flakes off.</li>
            <li>With one coat you get definition and a beautiful natural look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product but wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was wanting (fuller lashes).  </li>
            <li>I have no time to get them myself but want long beautiful lashes too!</li>
            <li>My lashes were as long, voluminous and flawless as when I walked in!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>All in all, a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Lengthens eyelashes pretty good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; as it could be, but still pretty good.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.  </li>
            <li>- I tried others since my first purchase - not as good as this one</li>
            <li>Pretty good mascara.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good mascara.</li>
            <li>and it is as good as on the first try.</li>
            <li>Unless you have naturally long lashes with a curl, you need a lash curler to achieve the best results.</li>
            <li>No clumping, stays put, gives me nice full eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I have pretty good length already</li>
            <li>when I first got this mascara, it was in a box from people magazine, I absolutely loved the product and continue to buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very nice mascara, not a ton of volume, but it doesn&#x27;t clump and adds decent length.  </li>
            <li>Every product that Elizabeth Mott puts out I fall in love with, but this mascara is something special!</li>
            <li>It makes big beautiful lashes and is very easily removed with water.</li>
            <li>Really good mascara is hard to find, but this product is the perfect mascara!</li>
            <li>They also stand out significantly in photos too!</li>
            <li>I was not optimistic at trying a new brand, but am oh so happy that I did.  </li>
            <li>I wore it yesterday (after using my new Eyelash Curler - INSTA-CURLER by FUCHSIA Line, which is the bomb-diggity) and the mascara itself is great.</li>
            <li>The brush is great, but the mascara itself is very watery, and comes out onto the brush in huge globs.</li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros, you can get a free sample, lengths, and separates, clump free, amazing product, can be found on sale</li>
            <li>This one was one that looked great no matter what, was safe on my sensitive eyes and also was cruelty-free.  </li>
            <li>But my favorite feature is that it is easy to remove at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>It washes off nicely with a mild soap in the shower and</li>
            <li>Also, love the way it wears like waterproof mascara but is so easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Love the brush and how easily it glides on my eyelashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the coverage AND the way it washes off easily (but doesn&#x27;t lose volume all day or night).</li>
            <li>Not waterproof but sure does seem like it and washes off easily</li>
            <li>But one thing i really love is how easy it is to remove.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not tested on animals and it washes of easily, but does not smudge at all.</li>
            <li>Its OK won&#x27;t wash off easily</li>
            <li>What I really love is it is SOOOOOOOO easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply more than one coat without clumping and lashes sticking together.</li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on, stays on, and how easily it is removed.</li>
            <li>and this is by far my favorite formula with a great price.</li>
            <li>all this is a great mascara, far better than departments store brands.</li>
            <li>Honestly I love love this mascara, it stays on all day, makes my eyes look fabulous</li>
            <li>This mascara is great and seller is very professional</li>
            <li>This is the single greatest beauty find since botox.  </li>
            <li>Colorstay Overtime is also pretty good at that, but this mascara is more comfortable for me to wear.  </li>
            <li>Ok, love this seller - takes full responsibility for any issue, unlike most companies theses days.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST mascara I have used for long full lashes without clumping!  </li>
            <li>My new favorite mascara!!</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;ve already found your perfect mascara but (like so many of us) continue your hunt since you think the grass MUST be greener on the other side, you may want to re-evaluate this one.</li>
            <li>So Big pleasantly exceeds it&#x27;s value in pricing and expectations!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really fussy about it, I can get some of the best lashes I&#x27;ve ever had out of this brand, but it did take some practice to get used to this particular product.</li>
            <li>This is right up there with Lancome Definicils maybe even better!</li>
            <li>LOVE, love, love this mascara so much!!  </li>
            <li>On the bright side, it did not clump at all and felt very lightweight.</li>
            <li>I know most of you are already, but for those who find that curling contraption terrifying...muster your courage and please reconsider because it makes a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy :-)</li>
            <li>This mascara greatly enhances the length and volume of your natural lashes.</li>
            <li>I use a light coat of this mascara during the day and when I want more lash</li>
            <li>If you like the natural, glam look this is a great product</li>
            <li>Great product and I like that its all natural.</li>
            <li>Most importantly it stays put.</li>
            <li>I HAD to have this one, as the reviews made it sound better than sliced bread.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many mascaras...from cheap to pricey.</li>
            <li>I feel like the travel sized brush has better coverage than this full size, but I still love the product</li>
            <li>This is a nice balance for me as usually tubulars seem to work best for me.  </li>
            <li>It added incredible length and somehow adhered to tiny lashes</li>
            <li>This mascara is absolutely fabulous, and i&#x27;ve tried some well known and seemingly pricey brands that were supposed to be all that and more.  </li>
            <li>General on the lashes and just beautiful.</li>
            <li>Fell in love with how long, full and awesome</li>
            <li>This mascara is the most fabulous mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It lengthens and thickens my lashes and even more importantly it stays on throughout the day.</li>
            <li>and cruelty free :)</li>
            <li>Great if you have naturally curled lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried the free sample before buying this.  </li>
            <li>I see my mother regularly and on her own she even commented how nice my lashes looked!  </li>
            <li>Love how light this mascara feels on my lashes.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty sure it also layers and builds nicely.  </li>
            <li>Surprised to find this to be a really great product.</li>
            <li>Its not that this mascara doesn&#x27;t work, its just that the cheap one does a better job.</li>
            <li>I also love that this mascara is cruelty free and does not test on animals.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
            <li>For the most part though it stays on nicely, and I&#x27;m pretty picky about mascara.</li>
            <li>I was using the djv beautenizer mascara before trying this one and loved it so much that I ordered another one.</li>
            <li>I received this mascara as a gift and loved it so much I bought another for myself once it ran out.</li>
            <li>The good reviews really are because it gives them really good lengthening for those of us with almost nonexistent lashes and yet is also really wearable long-lasting and doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge so you can wear it all day and night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not averse to spending money on a good product, but this one really disappoints.</li>
            <li>It was nice to try, but I don&#x27;t think it was worth it</li>
            <li>This is a great mascara, it makes my eyelashes look bigger, it stays all the day, but it is also easy to remove without damaging my eyelashes!</li>
            <li>It goes on very clean and doesn&#x27;t smudge or settle in my fine lines.</li>
            <li>The formula allows you to lengthen so easily, and multiple coats add a perfect amount of volume for natural-looking but full lashes.</li>
            <li>At $10 less than Younique, and $10 more than L&#x27;Oreal, this is the perfect mascara.</li>
            <li>So I stopped ordering that brand and decided to give Elizabeth Mott a try because of all the positive reviews!!!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re so FINE eyeliner because I am thus far very pleased with your products!</li>
            <li>they kind of just peel right off your lashes.</li>
            <li>The way it comes off reminds me of blinc mascara, you can use warm water and some pressure and it comes right off.  </li>
            <li>Hubs noticed it right away, and liked it.</li>
            <li>This stuff slides right off your lashes with warm water.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast so its quick and easy to make your eyes look great.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best mascara available &amp; that includes even the high end ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also love that you can get a free sample (that arrives super quick!!)</li>
            <li>Truely!  </li>
            <li>other than that, its been great!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to pay more for mascara, but it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li>best masacar ever-will not buy any other mascara</li>
            <li>I only need 2 swipes and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li>pretty much love it!</li>
            <li>I have oily eye lids and most mascara ends up under my eyes after a couple hours, so I&#x27;m always excited when I find one that doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using and really love it!</li>
            <li>I think my original order was a dud or maybe sitting around in inventory because I love this stuff</li>
            <li>This mascara is perfect and doesn&#x27;t need to be used with other mascara.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t smudge after you brush it on and every coat consistently adds more layers and volume to your lashes!</li>
            <li>I have purchased a full size already!</li>
            <li>i had gotten a sample, and used it up quickly, so i ordered the full size, and i like it even better!</li>

            <li>I have taken it to photoshoots with me and suggested it to the makeup artist,  they liked it so much they were asking me where they could order it!  </li>
            <li>And better yet, my lashes look so full and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to order a full size and one more for my sister.</li>
            <li>it leaves my lashes full and sexy.  </li>
            <li>My opinion is totally different: the mascara makes my, not existent, lashes beautiful.</li>
            <li>I quickly fell in love with it and had to buy the full size!</li>
            <li>This is hands down the BEST mascara ever for NO smearing or racoon eyes!!!!</li>
            <li>hands down BEST mascara</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best mascara i have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, THE BEST mascara I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>should:  goes on smoothly, non-clumping, easy to apply, stays on all day, easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>Best mascara, hands down.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Ok, I never write reviews, but I am soooooo in LOVE with this new mascara I bought!!!</li>
            <li>It is smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this at first, but I came to really love it and will be re-ordering.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, this mascara truly is superior to anything I&#x27;ve tried in the past -  everything from $7 Maybelline Great Lash to $40 Dior.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is fine</li>
            <li>I just use a lash brush and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, smooth and lengthens my lashes.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with results - I have sensitive eyes and most mascaras</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, I had to buy a full size.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s extremely important that the formula removes easily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>it does voluminize but on me it falkes in less than 3 hours, not so impressed for the cost it shouldnt flake</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, washes off easily.  </li>
            <li>such as it doesn&#x27;t clump, it doesn&#x27;t smudge even when sleeping in with it on, and best of all if i go for a swim without washing my face first</li>
            <li>After years of avoiding mascara because it seeped into fine lines, I decided to give it another try.</li>
            <li>I have fine lashes and this mascara thickens and lengthens them.</li>
            <li>I loved the sample so much, I bought the full size here.</li>
            <li>Does not flake off easily, which is important since I wear contacts, but also not like a waterproof mascara where you have to scrub and scrub to get it off.</li>
            <li>Just a smooth and easy application</li>
            <li>It makes my fine lashes pop.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t get clumpy.</li>
            <li>It is also slightly waterproof which is great for outdoor wear and pool season!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even ordered samples for my girlfriends and the customer service has been  excellent - they responded within 2 hours or less on both of my inquiries.</li>
            <li>Also, fabulous customer service - they responded very quickly when I submitted a question.  </li>
            <li>less money and am happy with that too!</li>
            <li>Maybe stick with three coats and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>It would be absolutely perfect if a darker black.</li>
            <li>Its fine</li>
            <li>I was expecting this mascara to make my fine lashes appear thicker and longer - it does neither.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t perfect - I started getting smears under my eyese by mid-afternoon, but that was after about 6 hours, not 1 or 2 like the previous products.</li>
            <li>I have super fine lashes and has tried many mascaras.</li>
            <li>I used to use the cheap Maybelline mascaras which kept me content for a while, but whenever I try to remove it with makeup wipes, it was NOT an easy job.</li>
            <li>Still worthy of five stars, but let this serve as a warning!</li>
            <li>Having it Prime is a plus and super convenient!</li>
            <li>Will be loyal to this brand from now on :)</li>
            <li>The style of the brush takes a biiit of getting used to, but it&#x27;s a quick adjustment!</li>
            <li>I bought this one and another brand that is more bold</li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipped quick, too!</li>
            <li>What I like most is that this mascara dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t smudge around my eyes.</li>
            <li>and I am still super satisfied.</li>
            <li>One good coat will stay on pretty good until the next day.  </li>
            <li>Really couldn&#x27;t ask for a better mascara!</li>
            <li>It has a good strong color to it yet has a slightly natural look to it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to layer to create a high volume look or you can use just a few strokes for an great length and beautiful definition.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a 1-step, non-smearing, easy to apply mascara that would make a significant difference to my fine eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>so when I found this mascara to be effective, it was pretty significant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been subscribed to ipsy for a while, and received many great products, but none of them were great enough to convince me to shell out big bucks for a full size product.</li>
            <li>Came very fast!!</li>
            <li>Very quick and friendly service.</li>
            <li>My eyes look brilliant again, dark lashes but not goth-black, easy application, wears well throughout the heat and humidity, easy to remove, no flaking, no itching, no fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily (the shape of the brush is unique and seems to keep the mascara from clumping on your lashes)</li>
            <li>Long full lashes that wipe of with water!!!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump, wand is great for lower lashes, and nice rich black color c</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I ordered a full size right away!</li>
            <li>The mascara comes out in one huge glob around the brush.</li>
            <li>I have to scrape the brush along the opening to get the huge excess off every time before applying it.</li>
            <li>Makes my eyes look huge, but I can&#x27;t ever feel that I have it on.</li>
            <li>I do not need to curl my eyelashes with this mascara, which is a huge time saver for me.  </li>
            <li>Either way, I am thrilled with this product, and I really hope that it stays available for years to come.  </li>
            <li>It feels amazing and soft when you apply it, which I love.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m also a huge fan of their mascara tool:</li>
            <li>I have a huge issue with mascara smudging.</li>
            <li>But So Big wears so lightly, it feels great.  </li>
            <li>There is a huge difference immediately.  </li>
            <li>the difference was HUGE.  </li>
            <li>I can apply a nice coat to every lash, even the shrubbery in the outside corners of my eyes - and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Goes on clean and smooth, stays all day, washes off with water easily at night.</li>
            <li>It applies very well and makes the eyelashes look amazing.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li>I wish it were great, but it simply does not add volume or depth to lashes in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The only thing that kept this from being a one-star review: The ultra-black pigmentation was great...</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Better Than Sex wins.</li>
            <li>I received a free tube of this mascara in a gift box along with my People Plus magazine subscription.  </li>
            <li>It not only looks great when you&#x27;re wearing it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and liked it so much</li>
            <li>This stuff has a smooth application but that&#x27;s where the positives end.</li>
            <li>I called and got the free sample of this mascara because of all the Amazon reviews on it.</li>
            <li>This was worth every dollar, I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I was going to buy the 3D but read such great reviews</li>
            <li>I was not given this product for free in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li>It has to be both the brush and the formula that are fantastic.</li>
            <li>The name doesn&#x27;t fit the product.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is, in a word, FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>So BIG Volumizing&amp;#34; I still have to use my 3D Fibers lol</li>
            <li>Great mascara overall.</li>
            <li>I figured, what the heck, I&#x27;ll spend a bit more just to see if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and is not clumpy at all.  </li>
            <li>The lengthening is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It does not clump and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, DOES NOT FLAKE, SMEAR OR CLUMP, even after a 12 hour day.</li>
            <li>Awesome mascara, I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>The page says they will send you a free sample</li>
            <li>I put it on at 6:00 a.m. and take it off at 10:00 p.m. with no smudging, no flaking, just amazing lashes the whole day</li>
            <li>I have become a walking billboard for the stuff, to the point of if I notice someone has some mascara smudge going I tell them about this mascara and give them detailed instructions on buying it.</li>
            <li>THAT IS AVAILABLE</li>
            <li>When you wash it off with warm water, you can literally gently pull off the mascara, as it seems to coat your lashes rather than just paint them.</li>
            <li>I was also thrilled with how fast I received the product.</li>
            <li>The mascara goes on smooth and I like that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>This mascara is flake free and does not run.</li>
            <li>Not a crazy plastic brush like many others.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>I started using a cheap mascara for the thickening aspect</li>
            <li>My lashes looked great, although I do think you should use a eyelash curler prior to using this mascara.</li>
            <li>* Happy to report that I can already update my initial review.</li>
            <li>I asked for the free sample.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great mascara that she will buy again.</li>
            <li>Not sticky or clumpy, goes on smooth .</li>
            <li>The formula is light, but still lengthens my lashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an all around fabulous product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this mascara has such great reviews.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth...</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it and have just received my 3rd tube.</li>
            <li>wish it was available in the stores.</li>
            <li>This product makes my light lashes PIGGITY-POP without &amp;#34;leaking&amp;#34; color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m hooked and will likely never switch to something else.</li>
            <li>Works well, smooth, Does not come off.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate that it&#x27;s a cruelty free</li>
            <li>but my eyes are light and my skin gets really light during the winter, it adds the definition and contrast</li>
            <li>I wear contact lenses and that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I was looking for cruelty free mascara.</li>
            <li>Overall if your looking for a great mascara this might be the one for</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>This mascara goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>This mascara was great, but would still smudge some, especially if I used something like foundation or moisturizer on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the cheap ones from drug stores</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, no clumping or bleeding and my lashes just get longer and longer with each pass.  </li>
            <li>The second mascara worked great</li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t bleed or flake.</li>
            <li>but they are light in color and therefore don&#x27;t stand out without mascara.  </li>
            <li>I also took advantage of the free sample offered on the website.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is fantastic--</li>
            <li>I received a faulty tube and they immediately contacted me and replaced it for free.</li>
            <li>Fabulous brush----best</li>
            <li>I thought only Sephora and Nordstrom&#x27;s had the Great Products.  </li>
            <li>AND the ethics of product testing is really important to me.</li>
            <li>I am 55, blue-eyed, with lashes so light</li>
            <li>For me one of the important factors in a mascara is that it stays put and doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s cruelty free</li>
            <li>My tip: volume is not as important.</li>
            <li>I registered on Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s website for a free mascara sample and forgot about it until a surprise package in the mail.</li>
            <li>(it was a free sample).  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see as much volume as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Fantastic mascara - lengthens lashes, doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it, and the maker is lovely as well.  </li>
            <li>When my package got lost, she insisted on sending me another tube for free.  </li>
            <li>is smooth.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money :)</li>
            <li>Or go to the website and get a free sample and try it.</li>
            <li>I much prefer 2000 Calorie mascara for its reasonable price, great application, and making my lashes look fabulous.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I do not get much in the way of volume, but I do get nice definition and length.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, the second i received my item, I tried it on, hoping for the great results everyone was talking about.</li>
            <li>This would be awesome for a few days of camping.</li>
            <li>The brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look fantastic.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you are missing out on a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased another one for a present because I want to share this great</li>
            <li>I have tried many different mascaras and this is by far the best out there!  </li>
            <li>also let me know that they give free samples.</li>
            <li>I used about 4 coats and I used an eyelash comb which I think is important to achieve that look.</li>
            <li>The last tube I ordered was great</li>
            <li>but overall this mascara is great.</li>
            <li>The product went on smooth and without clumping.  </li>
            <li>I work as a hiking guide in Alaska, and I like to maintain some girliness in my work and part of that includes having fabulous lashes while hiking the windy ridges.  </li>
            <li>Over time, the mascara does get thicker and tends a bit toward clumping but this is still a great product overall.</li>
            <li>This one is perfect for everyday and reminds me of the 2000 calorie mascara by Maxfactor (which isn&#x27;t sold in the US anymore).</li>
            <li>My lashes stay curled and fabulous all day</li>
            <li>It is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Overall: Great for a one-time buy</li>
            <li>However, they are too light, never lengthened my lashes</li>
            <li>I have always been a confirmed Lancome mascara user.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this mascara about 2 weeks ago, and have used it 8 times.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s no different than Maybelline Great Lash, and I would have been furious if I&#x27;d dropped $20 on a tube of this.</li>
            <li>Fabulous stuff.  </li>
            <li>but really all you need is warm water and a washcloth.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth with no clumps</li>
            <li>Its really and truly amazing.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and does not clump or flake off.</li>
            <li>After research I found this &amp;#34;BIG&amp;#34; cruelty free.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes in the slightest and it makes my lashes look fabulous.</li>
            <li>and this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>, it looks great all day until I remove it with a facial cleaning cloth at 9pm.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly surprised by all of the good reviews on here.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this mascara in a gift box and liked it so much I ordered another tube from Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure to do more than one coat to really see a difference.  </li>
            <li>My Maybelline from the drugstore is a far superior product.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for making such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Imagine my delight when I used this mascara and found long beautiful lases again.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a great product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I got one that was old, but i don&#x27;t understand the good reviews.</li>
            <li>Just got this and so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good though.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>It has a nice brush and it goes on smoothly but it doesn&#x27;t do much for volume, thus the 3 star review.</li>
            <li>Does not smear, nice brush, BIG Volumizing, beeswax gives it a nice texture.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands that are cheaper and just as good.</li>
            <li>Good for a natural Look</li>
            <li>My Covergirl mascara is far superior.</li>
            <li>I searched online for a good mascara and read many reviews on different mascara brands.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good for my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>Great mascara, makes my lashes look very full and long!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t need a primer, it goes on beautifully and is super easy to build, it never, ever runs, it comes off easily with makeup remover (or even water and a washcloth if you&#x27;re in a pinch), and it never irritates my eyes or makes me feel like I have dry lashes.</li>
            <li>It comes off very easily with just warm water - I lightly rub my eyelashes at the sink in the evening between my index finger and thumb with some warm water, since the mascara contains fibers to build volume they come off like little tubes</li>
            <li>What I like best is that it looks great after application and all day long but removes easily with plain soap and water.</li>
            <li>again-originally received this in a People VIP gift and right away fell in love with it and ordered another one.</li>
            <li>L. F. Waterproof.)&lt;br /&gt;It is my favorite right now.</li>
            <li>I fell in love right away.</li>
            <li>It is so very beautiful and very black.  </li>
            <li>(This is my favorite part and haven&#x27;t experienced this with any other mascara.)</li>
            <li>Comes off really easily with water, but for me that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li>It actually makes a huge difference in highlighting my eyes!!!</li>
            <li>Really???!!!  </li>
            <li>I have sooo much looove for this mascara!!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!  </li>
            <li>and she loves it as much as I do!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more!!</li>
            <li>Being an older woman with skimpy eye lashes, I have finally found the perfect Mascara!  </li>
            <li>This is seriously the best, most foolproof mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It looks fabulous on and its super easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Only thing I do not like about it is that it sometimes clumps my eyelashes but other than that great mascara with no smudging and provides good volume!</li>
            <li>Love this mascara &amp; highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many mascaras and after reading the reviews I had high hopes for this one.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several high dollar mascaras waiting for the perfect one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands both high end and drug store brands and all</li>
            <li>Clinique and Mac have a few that are perfect but not waterproof, or they are waterproof but nothing special.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, but didn&#x27;t make my lashes much longer and the formula makes the lashes stick together</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake off throughout the day, stays put (even when tears are involved), and builds nicely during application so you can get some decent lashes.  </li>
            <li>so applying in a rush is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>Stays on all day without smudging or flaking but comes off super easy with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Received a sample in an ipsy subscription, liked it so much that I ordered the full size version.</li>
            <li>and I have to say this particular item is so deserving of me taking the time to leave a review</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to take off with just water and a quick swipe with cloth (in case you forget your makeup remover).</li>
            <li>The mascara comes of super easily too.</li>
            <li>It wears well all day, and comes off easily with a mild face soap.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking (off and on) for a mascara that I would like as much as my beloved Full N&#x27; Soft by Mabelline since I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>For me, this mascara didn&#x27;t clump and it washed off super easy in the shower, no soap or ripping out eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The process of removing the make-up it quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>Comes off super easy in the shower.</li>
            <li>This is a nice mascara certainly worth trying if you&#x27;re at all interested.</li>
            <li>Overall,  it stays when and where it needs to stay, is easy to clean off when that time comes &amp; it does not irritate my eyes at all!!!</li>
            <li>However, it washes off very easy with gentle soap and water.  </li>
            <li>I really like how well it stays all day, without flaking, but washes off very easily.</li>
            <li>No other mascara I&#x27;ve used is as good as this one.</li>
            <li>Now this mascara is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>This is without a question my new favorite product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite mascara!</li>

            <li>In a nutshell... this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>My new favorite!</li>
            <li>I understand why it&#x27;s a high end price because it&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li>You know when you buy department store mascara for $30, you are getting luxe, amazing quality item that warrants the high price tag.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite mascara, and I&#x27;ve tried too many to count.</li>
            <li>My new favorite mascara. :)</li>
            <li>Editing my initial review, as Elizabeth Mott has provided me a new bottle that worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>This is one of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve ever tried and continue to go back to it even though I like to try new mascaras.</li>
            <li>and I could see a huge difference in length right away!</li>
            <li>and I enjoy using it on special occasions.</li>
            <li>Excellent volumizing mascara that really works and lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li>It went on super smooth and light</li>
            <li>Super happy with results after trying a couple different &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34</li>
            <li>What I also love is that it is so easy to remove and you don&#x27;t need to be rubbing your eyes much when removing your makeup.</li>
            <li>but what I really like is how easily it comes off.:)</li>
            <li>This mascara looks great giving me length, volume and absolutely no smudging but washes off easily.</li>
            <li>My third time buying his amazing mascara!</li>
            <li>I also sweat a lot and boy does it stay put - but total washes off easily - amazing!</li>
            <li>So Big mascara is so far the best I have used and not at a HUGE price.  </li>
            <li>I also love love love the contour of the brush which is so helpful especially when applying to lower lashes.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the cost!</li>
            <li>Suffice it to say that I am not disappointed in my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Super fine, defines lashes, not clumpy.  </li>
            <li>And the price is worth it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still love this mascara, it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed do</li>
            <li>I love this mascara so much!</li>
            <li>This mascara is definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I mix it with another mascara for a great long wearing,long lash look.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews for this mascara, I excitedly placed an order for a sample on the company&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>It is so worth it!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve tried it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth purchasing!</li>
            <li>I was NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li>That did NOT happen with the original mascara.</li>
            <li>Originally got this mascara in one of my subscription boxes (forget which one).  </li>
            <li>Friendly seller and prompt shipping.</li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>I am pretty pleased with this mascara.</li>
            <li>GIven the reviews, I was so excited to get this.  </li>
            <li>Original</li>
            <li>At first it took me awhile to love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many, many mascaras and this is the only one that is volumizing and leaves no smudges.  </li>
            <li>This mascara makes my lashes look long and attractive, stays on all day</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>Soon after leaving my review I was contacted by a friendly rep from Elizabeth Mott, she apologized and offered to send replacement mascara.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, they also refunded the $20 I originally paid.</li>
            <li>All mascaras run on me except original Blinc...</li>
            <li>but well worth it!  </li>
            <li>I first received this mascara in my monthly ipsy bag and I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I just use normal face soap, too--the kind that doesn&#x27;t hurt the eyes--and wash all over.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Amazon review, and I buy stuff through Amazon all the time - that&#x27;s how much I love this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more interested in lengthening.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this mascara</li>
            <li>First tried it through my ipsy glambag subscription and had to buy more.</li>
            <li>It is well worth $20 a tube!</li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t figured out the trick yet, but all and all its a WONDERFUL product and probably the only mascara I will be purchasing in the future :)</li>
            <li>Originally received a sample size of this product in an ipsy bag.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a teacher so any product has to be able stand up to a pretty rigorous reality.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I originally got a sample of this mascara from Ipsy.</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited to see how well this mascara held up.</li>
            <li>Lasts quite a long time, great applicator, and DOESN&#x27;T FLAKE.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>This unique hour glass brush distributes the mascara evenly, without clumps and adds volume and length.</li>
            <li>but this one is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I usually use two coats and my lashes look great!</li>
            <li>The Mott company reached out to me about the refund and sent me a full size mascara free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s So Big and am thrilled that I did!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price ! </li>
            <li>I received this mascara originally by being a VIP with People magazine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the $20!</li>
            <li>My eyelashes need all the help they can get to even be visible, and this did a nice job of making them look normal.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara so much!</li>
            <li>The price is great and it wears ALL day long.</li>
            <li>I first tried it when I received a sample through an ipsy box and fell in love with it since then.</li>
            <li>I received a sample in a beauty bag subscription and it was love at first use.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t run or clump and is by far one of my very favorite.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>But the difference in the look of my eyelashes is worth the drawbacks!</li>
            <li>the first time I applied it, I thought it was okay.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li>I was more interested in volume than in added length, but this mascara does both.  </li>
            <li>I lost more than five hairs after taking it from first use.</li>
            <li>This one wins!</li>
            <li>It is also unique in that when you take it off, it doesn&#x27;t run,  </li>
            <li>: Been using this mascara ever since I originally ordered it.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about trying your mascara.</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to try it on.</li>
            <li>Cover Girl - Lash Exact would be better for me.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a great product like this for a long time.</li>
            <li>Worth to try!</li>
            <li>That might change after this success!</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money if you don&#x27;t need true waterproof mascara!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY other mascaras and this on is the best by far.</li>
            <li>Gives your lashes great length and definition, lasts all day long with NO SMUDGES!  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many other mascaras through the years and this one is by far the best for volume and  length with no clumping or flaking.  </li>
            <li>It just looked like my eyelashes got a nice new shiny paint job.</li>
            <li>What I love even more, no messy removal.  </li>
            <li>It washes completely clean with soap and water.</li>
            <li>I am sure you will enjoy it as much as me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had far better mascara for a way better price at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>I will go back to Lamcome which is the best so far</li>
            <li>I was not blessed with full, long eyelashes and have been searching for a great mascara to help volumize and elongate them.</li>
            <li>Overall alone it kind of created spider lashes after so many coats.</li>
            <li>This is a good product but doesn&#x27;t quite fit the description of BIG volume.</li>
            <li>Went on smoothly with no clumping and after a nine hour shift it looks as good now as when I left the house.</li>
            <li>Overall, a really nice mascara that coats evenly on both top and bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li>Prior to this happening I thought this mascara was OK, nothing amazing.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump, lengthens, stays on and washes clean with soap and water..</li>
            <li>and it still looks clean.</li>
            <li>Honestly it did nothing more than any standard drug store mascara.  </li>
            <li>I like that the mascara is easy to remove, but it clumps, and I&#x27;m not crazy about the application brush.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t stand having to clean up around my eyes after applying;</li>
            <li>This mascara can be put on to be natural looking or nice and bold; easily layered to suit your needs.</li>
            <li>Well, let me say, as most other reviewers, this is pretty much the perfect mascara.  </li>
            <li>but when I saw how many positive reviews this one had, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>and this one is by far my favorite!  </li>
            <li>This mascara is far better than Dior Show!</li>
            <li>My 54-year old eyes never had better looking, flirtier eyelashes without using those falsies from the 80&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>I get more product on my lashes thanks to the big, contoured brush, and the results are spectacular!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for volume, won&#x27;t add super long length though.</li>
            <li>I love love love it, it makes my lashes full and long.</li>
            <li>And easy to remove with water, mine peels right off in the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very particular about making sure</li>
            <li>This is really good mascara--not dry or clumpy even after a month of use; it goes on gently and makes even my lashes amazing.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know why this mascara has such good ratings!</li>
            <li>I am always looking for better mascara; this stuff is really good, I have not had any issues with flaking or smearing; my mother tried it out the other day, and said &amp;#34;Where</li>
            <li>I still use this (1-2 coats) under my Max Factor mascara (that one still gives me more volume quickly), but the Max tends to clump a little more (so using them together leads to the best outcome for me personally).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product; I&#x27;ll certainly order it again.</li>
            <li>Nothing special at all...</li>
            <li>nothing outstanding and certainly inferior to Mally, Tarte and Lancôme mascaras.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to use a special eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Instead, I gave it as a gift to the special people in my life.</li>
            <li>But nothing special.</li>
            <li>so I went right in the bathroom and applied my shadow and liner and then - this mascara  NO CLUMPING!  </li>
            <li>Overall great product and will be back for more!</li>
            <li>Application is great, not much clumping, and clean up is a cinch.</li>
            <li>So I was super excited to get this mascara because I read all the reviews</li>
            <li>I hardly even have to think about it and best of all, no battle against the dreaded forces at the mall/nearest makeup counter.</li>
            <li>But when my attending shows up in the morning my lashes still look great, and no one can tell how rough my night was.  </li>
            <li>I first experienced it through my ipsy bag and knew I would be a regular customer.</li>
            <li>great product after I used it the first time I reorder a second tube that day</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews and expected great mascara.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to pay more than I usually do for mascara if it held up to my expectation.</li>
            <li>Received the first one as a gift from People magazine and was happy to track the second one on Amazon because none of the department stores sell it</li>
            <li>and it is truely amaziing.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but it is well worth the money, trust me (and I&#x27;m cheap).  </li>
            <li>It provides full lashes without clumping.</li>
            <li>I never completely liked them but they were the best I could find until now.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara so much though.  </li>
            <li>Very volumizing, one of the better mascaras I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I bought the sample to try out -- then bought the full size.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve tried more than 20+ mascaras and came across this one, and after reading all the rave reviews really wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real Mascara&amp;#34; and I love it</li>
            <li>It really pumps up my skinny lashes better than fancy department store brands or drugstore favorites.  </li>
            <li>I love the way the brush separates my straight lashes</li>
            <li>More of a straight forward mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went ahead and ordered it because....I really like it.</li>
            <li>Still looks good the next AM!</li>
            <li>and I still love it just as much.  </li>
            <li>I make all of my own skincare products and all of the makeup I wear from natural products to be frugal-</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the perfect mascara since I was in my late teens</li>
            <li>It coats your lashes and will not smear or smudge, but comes off completely with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li>I know they&#x27;ll be buying the full size soon.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and shipped appropriately.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m cool with that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for full lashes.</li>
            <li>The only good part about this mascara is there is a lot of product in the tube.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara, but I love the shape of the wand used.  </li>
            <li>Brush was good at reaching my shortest inner lashes too.</li>
            <li>My mother, who&#x27;s very critical of beauty products, even loved it.</li>
            <li>My lashes were full and it the mascara lengthened it beyond belief.</li>
            <li>I immediately bought the full size mascara</li>
            <li>It was way bigger than the sample size which was surprising.</li>
            <li>I love that I can wear this mascara the whole day and it will not smudge or give me raccoon eyes since I also wear it on my bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>I notice no flaking after a full day in the water world of dentistry.</li>
            <li>I ordered two full size from Elizabeth Motts website.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also so lightweight that your lashes stay soft and nice to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I threw away the packaging because I really thought Id love it</li>
            <li>and Amazon fast shipping what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t really had many issues resulting from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got a sample size in my Ipsy Glam Bag, and had to order the full size.</li>
            <li>I received a sample in my Ipsy bag and I have since purchased two full size mascaras through Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not to thick, perfect texture!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably return this if it wasn&#x27;t such a hassle - not that it isn&#x27;t a good mascara, because it is.</li>
            <li>or They&#x27;re Real by Benefit, which have been my favorite brand since forever.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, and so much cheaper than Lancome.</li>
            <li>The full size is clumpy and flakes off my lashes.</li>
            <li>:-)&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky about mascara, but will never switch brands again.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara, really thickens and lengthens lashes.  </li>
            <li>I can not say enough good things about the customer service.</li>
            <li>Needs a mild eye makeup remover to clean off  </li>
            <li>They stopped making it a year ago and since then, I&#x27;ve accumulated a drawer full of mascaras that did not deliver as promised.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my Dior Show and realized how superior that brand is compared to this Elizabeth Mott stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the product and was shipped very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>Received a sample in my ipsy bag and had to order the full size.</li>
            <li>Really made my lashes look fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I have found that as I age, mascara just isn&#x27;t a sure thing anymore, no matter how much I spend on it.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>I have many requirements when I look for a mascara, as it is the most important cosmetic for me personally.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this product.  </li>
            <li>so it has to be true, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t totally blow me out of the park, but it has some really good points.</li>
            <li>But best of all, it doesn&#x27;t make them clumpy thick -- look caked on.</li>
            <li>but it just seems to be good, standard mascara.</li>
            <li>I have been trying different mascaras for years (my favorite was discontinued) from cheap mascaras to top brand name mascaras</li>
            <li>The wand has an interesting shape which allows you to really work the product into your lashes.</li>
            <li>Full coverage, plenty of volume and length.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good about this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I got a sample as part of my ipsy subscription, and replaced it with a full size tube as soon as it ran out.</li>
            <li>Applying makes most of my lashes stick together and look very clumpy.  </li>
            <li>True to review.</li>
            <li>You need to spend a good minute scraping the brush against the tube so all that extra mascara doesn&#x27;t get all over.  </li>
            <li>and she needed 15 coats just to get enough on the lashes to do any good.</li>
            <li>Every claim they make is true.  </li>
            <li>I like how full it makes my lashes look</li>
            <li>The way the brush is shaped really reaches more of my lashes as I&#x27;m applying the mascara.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not really bad</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>The mascara its self however is not bad.</li>
            <li>Best mascara I have ever used hands down!!!</li>
            <li>Love it, not clumpy and natural looking!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li>It washes off easily with just warm water but comes off in small pieces; kind of reminds me of washing latex paint off of a brush, but easier.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of satisfied customers on here that have stated otherwise, and if you&#x27;re looking for a new volumizing mascara and are comfortable with the price tag</li>
            <li>I really liked this mascara and felt it was worth trying out something new.</li>
            <li>I loved how it separated my lashes, made them look nice and full, didn&#x27;t smudge or smear, and was super easy to wash off with regular facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It goes on so easy and smooth and really lengthens.</li>
            <li>I not only liked how this held up, the application was easy and even.</li>
            <li>Although this is a product my wife bought, When I asked her, she absolutely loved it, color was what she expected, easy to use</li>
            <li>Finally - A mascara that goes on, stays on, doesn&#x27;t smudge and comes off easily with a warm washcloth.</li>
            <li>This mascara is nice, gives some good volume and all, but it still clumps just as much as any other cheaper mascara I&#x27;ve tried from the Drugstore.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and stays on pretty well, however is tends to flake a tad towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Legitimately the first mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump, is easy to take off, and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>It doesnt make my eyes water, it comes off pretty easily</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump and it has a pretty easy application.</li>
            <li>Pretty easy to remove with just soap and water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to remove with make-up remover, and has a slim and pretty case.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge and it was pretty easy to wash off</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried them all- from high end to the famous - drug store- &#x27;pink one&#x27; great lash-</li>
            <li>I am THRILLED with this product, its well worth the couple extra bucks to not have to use two mascaras that aren&#x27;t near as good to begin with</li>
            <li>Just as other reviewers have said, this is great mascara.</li>
            <li>If you have trouble keeping your mascara on, then this one is a good one to try!</li>
            <li>somewhat of a gel, and goes on without the clumping and flaking I have experienced with other mascara&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this mascara as long as it&#x27;s available and look forward to trying many more Elizabeth Mott cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I feel like it strengthens my lashes rather than damage them as I have experienced with other mascaras.</li>
            <li>other than that it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li>It gives me full and long looking lashes, doesn&#x27;t clump, does not smear, and my favorite aspect about this mascara is that it is SO easy to remove!</li>
            <li>love my new mascara!</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best mascara I have ever tried!</li>
            <li>Seriously the best mascara I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>This is the best if you want some serious volume.</li>
            <li>Seriously the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome love it much better than the lancome product I used previously and half the price</li>
            <li>I too, have searched far and wide for the best mascara.  </li>
            <li>Super, I just bought because of reviews</li>
            <li>It did not do anything extraordinary to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried an unreasonable number of mascaras trying to find one that doesn&#x27;t smudge on my super oily skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly with no clumps, not heavy if I want more I just put another layer on.</li>
            <li>Most have left me dis-satisfied, hence trying to find something better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loyal to two types, this is one of them.</li>
            <li>its so light that its perfect for those with UBER THIN LASHES.</li>
            <li>I bought this mascara because of the Prime access, however it was nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li>I went to the website to get the trial size offer and it shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Love the product itself, no Racoon eyes after hours of wear, only reason not 5 star, the brush could be designed better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal</li>
            <li>so Big is not a miracle worker, when you are blessed with short lashes, but it is the best my lashes have ever looked.  </li>
            <li>It can quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily, this product doesn&#x27;t screw up my eyemakeup if I get it on my lids.</li>
            <li>This mascara works, but it&#x27;s not anything super extraordinary.</li>
            <li>I was quickly sent a replacement bottle and it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>And as she says it is a super mascara.</li>
            <li>quick delivery too.  </li>
            <li>The seller delivered the product quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s adequate.</li>
            <li>Quick Delivery</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many different mascaras over the years in search of the &amp;#34;perfect one&amp;#34; and I can truly say my search has ended!!</li>
            <li>The sample arrived quickly and gave me some assurance before making a purchase.  </li>
            <li>When I have FINALLY found the perfect mascara, it&#x27;s cause for celebration and a big thank you for creating this masterpiece.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many many mascaras and this one is totally IT!</li>
            <li>, there is just a few of us that can&#x27;t get good results with most mascaras.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly</li>
            <li>It goes on quickly and makes my lashes look longer.  </li>
            <li>I usually am a loyal user of Blinc Mascara, which is a tube mascara.  </li>
            <li>but I love it so much I am willing to pay the higher price.</li>
            <li>But a quick swipe of coconut oil takes care of that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super  clumpy.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>Since I fell pregnant in April I have become allergic to all the make up</li>
            <li>But I only do 2-3 coats, and according to the box, you could do many more coats to get that volume.</li>
            <li>It made my lashes stick together, look super sparse and clumpy.  </li>
            <li>I have tried to many different mascaras I would never be able to keep track.  </li>
            <li>but you must work quickly or it gets clumpy.  </li>
            <li>Im 8 months pregnant and</li>
            <li>I did find a good one that I like by Lancôme for a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>My advice, continue using what you currently have for Mascara, you will be more pleased.</li>
            <li>The brush has an interesting shape, so you never apply more product than necessary to eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It layers on as much or as little as you want it to make your lashes bold and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes that water very easily, so it can&#x27;t irritate my eyes or run</li>
            <li>I have many other pretty good mascaras in my collection</li>
            <li>One positive is that it does stay on you lashes and all day without flaking and easy to take off.</li>
            <li>I know from experience that products highly reviewed by others often aren&#x27;t satisfying for me at all, but thought I&#x27;d give this brand a try after googling Elizabeth Mott.  </li>
            <li>Better then high end leading brands.</li>
            <li>they stopped growing at all after so many pulling spells in high school.</li>
            <li>Makeup removers don&#x27;t work very well to take this off, but plain ol&#x27; water works just great!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy it for super long and over coated lashes for length  and volume that some reviewers want, I just want a good product that stays on my lashes.</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly &amp; didn&#x27;t mind spending a bit more than I normally would.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t run, comes off easily with makeup remover, doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my lashes look nice and long.</li>
            <li>This mascara has great coverage, doesn&#x27;t clump or leave dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty and feels light on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I have tried other masacaras of this calibre but this one by far works best.</li>
            <li>I had been using blinc which I also liked over other products but find this even better.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I was expecting something great and it was just average.  </li>
            <li>you can decide exactly how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; you want your lashes by adding additional layers of the smooth formula.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with It&#x27;s so BIG Volumizing mascara!</li>
            <li>My lashes are long and full, and even better it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or leave me with raccoon eyes :)</li>
            <li>Received it first as a free sample from a magazine</li>
            <li>Funny - received a free sample in a People Magazine VIP reward.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>I have long and good lashes</li>
            <li>Elizabeth Mott was kind enough to send me a sample, which I absolutely loved, and so I went ahead and bought the BIG one</li>
            <li>However after I used this mascara I knew the full size product would be well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I will never use false lashes again, this works just as great and is more comfortable than falsies.</li>
            <li>I sometimes don&#x27;t even use my lash curler and lashes are long and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Has no unpleasant odor, as some mascaras do.</li>
            <li>I like that it is healthier to use than many others and though it might not be unique in the way it looks, it is a great alternative and stands against other major mascara&#x27;s quite well.</li>
            <li>It shipped out right away too, so I could use it in time for a special occasion I was attending.</li>
            <li>My FAVORITE ALL TIME mascara they no longer sell in stores &amp; I have to buy on Amazon as its only sold in Europe now; Max Factor 2000 Calorie GREAT, Amazing, Truly volumizing, thick coverage, no caking, non-smearing.</li>
            <li>I have very straight and short lashes so a good mascara is a must.</li>
            <li>It gives my eyelashes so much volume and you can apply it in many layers without it ever getting clumpy if you love big huge lashes like I do.</li>
            <li>The brush is just perfect and the formula goes on so silky smooth and really does last all day (&amp; into the next morning - NO RACCOON EYES!)</li>
            <li>Great black color with some shine to it, looks very pretty.</li>
            <li>And you do not need to use special lotion to remove it in the evening, just warm water is enough.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands...from drugstore to luxury brands, and Elizabeth&#x27;s Mott&#x27;s volumizing mascara has quickly become one of my new favorites (if not my favorite!).</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look fuller and longer with this mascara, and even though it isn&#x27;t waterproof, you can survive a good cry without looking like a hot mess. :)</li>
            <li>Read about it in the newspaper and thought I&#x27;d try it, the price is reasonable and it&#x27;s excellent, really does make your lashes look thicker and not as clumped as other brands.</li>
            <li>It is my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love my new mascara.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be adventurous and try a new mascara product and chose this based on the reviews I read</li>
            <li>My new favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite</li>
            <li>You will love your new look!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daphne</li>
            <li>this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Have to say, it is my new favorite</li>
            <li>is definitely my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>Overall very very pleased...and no bunnies had to suffer!!!!</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, does not clump &amp; stays looking nice all day long on.  </li>
            <li>Loved the mascara, so purchased another to have on-hand when first one was getting low.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to put on, and it makes my lashes look thicker, fuller and much longer.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of this mascara in an Ipsy bag and liked it enough to give the full size a try.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it at first, but after playing around with it I really began to like it.</li>
            <li>I was able to receive a sample first just because I was very hesitant.  </li>
            <li>Several beautiful layers can be applied with no &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; look, and my lashes feel soft all day.</li>
            <li>Stays on very well, while surprisingly easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and makes my lashes really stand out.  </li>
            <li>This mascara never rubs off during the time I need it, but it washes off easily and gently.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t apply more than 2 coats and my lashes look very natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also very sensitive to eye make up and get allergic reactions to most products.</li>
            <li>This mascara give a very natural full-lash look without the clumpi-ness of most volumizing mascaras.  </li>
            <li>I expected a lot more for a high priced mascara but it&#x27;s not even as good as a $7 drug store one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is by far, hands down, the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The good thing is this mascara comes off easily in the shower and does not run down your face!</li>
            <li>This mascara is my ultimate favorite!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Really works to lengthen!!</li>
            <li>I doubt I will ever buy any other kind now!</li>
            <li>Favorite Mascara by far!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mascara!!!</li>
            <li>I wore the first day I tried this!  </li>
            <li>No Racoon eyes, exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this mascara!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never even considering buying a different brand, love it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is EXACTLY what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more of this!</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara by far!  </li>
            <li>I am really enjoying it so far!</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it can indeed cluster your eyelashes together, but I still love it!</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a phenomenal product!</li>
            <li>I was surprised, this mascara was pretty good, made my eye lashes look longer and didn&#x27;t clump as much as some others.  </li>
            <li>fantastic mascara gives you beautiful length, and looks like light false lashes.</li>
            <li>Great product, if you&#x27;re anything like me trying a new mascara seems like such a risk!</li>
            <li>, it comes off easy, it just comes off different than most mascaras.</li>
            <li>, it comes off easy, it just comes off different than most mascaras.</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with most soaps although I have had to struggle occasionally to get it off with just soap depending on the soap.</li>
            <li>I think I get a very natural look with this mascara, like I was blessed with long beautiful lashes, not a makeup look.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly, so you don&#x27;t start getting smudges right away.</li>
            <li>I VERY rarely give one star, but I can&#x27;t find anything positive to say about this product.</li>
            <li>I also love that it washes away easily with warm water so that you&#x27;re not rubbing your eyes/damaging the delicate skin with a cleanser.</li>
            <li>my new favorite, and quick shipping, thanks!</li>
            <li>This is good mascara, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about is the mascara has a large clump on the end of the brush when you pull it out of the tube.</li>
            <li>Originally I had written a review complaining about how clumpy and unimpressed I was with the formula - but a representative reached out to me to apologize and offered to send me a new tube for free.</li>
            <li>The brush was perfect, the liquid had just the right viscosity, not too runny not to thick, and it went on SO smoothly,I could apply coat after coat without any clumps!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this mascara based on all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>The shape of the wand is amazing, I can finally get the corner lashes without getting mascara all over my face and under my eyes!</li>
            <li>This mascara goes on smoothly and really lengthens my lashes.  </li>
            <li>It takes a couple of coats to thicken the lashes, but gives you great length with just a few coats.  </li>
            <li>You really will receive a free sample and it will arrive within two days.  </li>
            <li>It makes your lashes look amazing and 1 tube will actually last you quite a while!</li>
            <li>The customer service is fabulous and very prompt.</li>
            <li>Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s It&#x27;s So Big mascara and read all the amazing reviews I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Fabulous Product and very affordable.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this mascara a 2nd time because it is so AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Elizabeth Mott for making such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>But overall I didn&#x27;t feel like my lashes didn&#x27;t look that amazing</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look twice as big, it is quite amazing, this one is worth every $.</li>
            <li>The most amazing thing is, you would think you would need some heavy duty soap or eye makeup remover to get it off of your lashes</li>
            <li>It stays on all day looking as fresh as when it was applied.</li>
            <li>GOOD FOR BOTTOM LASHES, BUT NOT REALLY</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Really liked it, but after about six months, the inner ring came out and now I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I hoped for something far better.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$.</li>
            <li>Worth the $</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;ve had success with cheaper mascaras in getting volume--</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>This one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re asking yourself if $20 for mascara is worth it</li>
            <li>mascara is by far way better.</li>
            <li>I was going on a cruise and really wanted a good waterproof mascara as mascara would be my only daytime eye makeup</li>
            <li>This looks way more natural and lasts way longer.</li>
            <li>This brand seems to stay fresh longer without clumping or drying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given this at least a month before writing and the conclusion is that this really is the BEST mascara!</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth checking out.</li>
            <li>Worth the money to me.</li>
            <li>It is worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li>Amazon user (I almost never shop in stores anymore!) and never write reviews, but this one is truly worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early fifties and have tried many mascara products over the years.</li>
            <li>Bobbi Brown&#x27;s Smokey Eye is FAR better.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend $20 on mascara, especially if it didn&#x27;t fare any better than the cheap stuff I buy at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This mascara is so worth it.</li>
            <li>SO WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>It is not a heavy mascara so those who want more of an impact may need primer.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>so I am running around and rarely get to look in any mirror to check the makeup status.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>the price, it was not at all worth it.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, it really works very well.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara thus far.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny</li>
            <li>It does have fall out but the way it makes your lashes look its so worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just as the name of the product &amp;#34;BIG&amp;#34;  this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used...and I tried all off them no matter how expensive they were or cheap</li>
            <li>It wears well on 2 morning coats during the entire day, and it washes off nicely in the shower.</li>
            <li>No smudges, it lasts all day, my lashes look longer and are more clearly defined.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for the perfect mascara for a long, long time.  </li>
            <li>I am 64 years old and wanted a mascara that would make my eyes pop more.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Applies really nicely, doesn&#x27;t clump, even after several layers applied.</li>
            <li>But worth it..</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Buy it - it&#x27;s totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>May be it works better for people who have naturally curly eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It was worth the price that it cost..</li>
            <li>I am a Maybelline Colossal fan and have been for about 6 years.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the premium price</li>
            <li>but this is certainly worth the $20.i</li>
            <li>Unsure yet whether the price is worth the product,</li>
            <li>This is a really nice mascara, especially the brush.</li>
            <li>I want my cake, and I want to eat it too because what fun is cake if you can&#x27;t eat it?</li>
            <li>, def worth the buy.</li>
            <li>So worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I just received a personalized email from elizabeth mott, which was pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Great product coworkers thought I had false lashes :)</li>
            <li>The clumping is minimal, and it does a good job of volumizing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitly worth the moeny.</li>
            <li>I love this product--I rarely write reviews--especially beauty products, but this mascara never clumps and looks natural.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re worth</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Especially one with this kind of price tag...</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t tell which product was on which eye...not fresh in the morning or 12-14 hours</li>
            <li>I loved the sample so much that I purchased the regular product.  </li>
            <li>but this mascara is totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li>must admit that is pricey, but it is all worth it.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite mascara by far.  </li>
            <li>I like to look fresh.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I have tried every mascara you could think of from cheap to expensive and this one is the best!  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Nope... The only thing I liked about this mascara is that it stays put.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I like the design of the wand, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the gooey mascara.  </li>
            <li>so I had to find a backup in order to keep my nice long, full lashes.</li>
            <li>This mascara is my favorite by far....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the hour glass shape -</li>
            <li>I never would have thought I would spend $20 on a mascara, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve spent more on buying mascaras and throwing them away in my search for mascara nirvana.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>now THAT is worth every penny!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This mascara gives more of a natural look than a glamorous one.</li>
            <li>(makeup gets absorbed through the skin).  </li>
            <li>My lashes didn&#x27;t curl and even after using an eyelash curler they weren&#x27;t as nice as when I use a different mascara I have.</li>
            <li>the brush is not the usual shape that i prefer but it works beautifully ..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think parabens are absorbed through lashes, and as I said, it doesn&#x27;t smudge so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s now, so I have tried and searched many mascaras.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, this won&#x27;t be a popular review, but in case someone else out there is searching for the same reason I was, I hope this is helpful.does</li>
            <li>Like I said, this won&#x27;t be a popular review, but in case someone else out there is searching for the same reason I was, I hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and have tried many mascaras, at every price point.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give me as much volume as it says, but I still really like it and will be buying more once I run out.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump on my lashes and actually separates them nicely.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s a bit pricey for a mascara, I truly believe it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than Maybelline in the pink tube (costs more, too).</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll probably pay it for the full tube when my sample runs out ;)</li>
            <li>I bought it because it was cruelty free and had good reviews, I have very small and fine eyelashes</li>
            <li>Got the sample, and was more than pleased with the outcome; it lengthens my lashes pretty well and it doesn&#x27;t take me very long to put it on.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes very long and full, and the things it doesn&#x27;t do make it that much more fabulous...</li>
            <li>I love this mascara easy goes on and makes my eyelashes look really long</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really dark, goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t flake or melt, and it comes off easily.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, makes my lashes look 3x longer and fuller, and at the end of the day, a little warm water gets it right off!</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with just normal washing with the face cleanser</li>
            <li>/&gt;You only need one coat, and it comes off super easy with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge fan!  </li>
            <li>I have used Tarte, Dior, NYX, and many, many other brands,</li>
            <li>as other reviewers mention, it does have some &#x27;fiber&#x27; that comes out on the end of the wand, but overall, it is the best I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked for other similar products on the market, but best I can tell they don&#x27;t exist.  </li>
            <li>Got this only because it had such a good rating &amp; Boy!</li>
            <li>and it is not saturated as much with color as I would like, other than that great mascara.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love and stand by my previous comment only adding good to the last use.</li>
            <li>Waterproof formula is great for hot weather, and those who like to apply a little makeup when going to the gym.</li>
            <li>Instead, the mascara removes beautifully, like little tubes that just gently come off of each eyelash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not disappointed, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Makes your lashes look long and lovely!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about ordering this mascara because the cost was more than double of what I normally pay.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be pretty cool if this were also available in a waterproof version one day, but it&#x27;s not going to deter me in the mean time. :P</li>
            <li>- thick gorgeous  Lashes to die for!  </li>
            <li>But never the less, I am always happy to leave positive reviews when warranted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with my ethically conscious and high quality mascara.</li>
            <li>It literally just slides right off your lashes.</li>
            <li>I find now that my lashes clump right away so matter what I do.</li>
            <li>and it slides right off.  </li>
            <li>Right off.</li>
            <li>I notice if I reapply right away my eyelashes uncurl.</li>
            <li>I just purchased this mascara and applied it right away.</li>
            <li>For one thing, it comes right off with water, without streaking or smudging or leaving any residue.</li>
            <li>BUT the mascara comes right off.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>am I not doing it right?  </li>
            <li>marketing was right.  </li>
            <li>reviews were right.  </li>
            <li>I read reviews before using and they were right.</li>
            <li>The mascara itself is clumpy and does not apply right.</li>
            <li>Miracle Mascara right here.</li>
            <li>I washed out off right after I put it on.</li>
            <li>And it just washes right off.</li>
            <li>I made the right choice</li>
            <li>I will go leave my positive review now!</li>
            <li>I live in a large city and haven&#x27;t been able to locate this product anywhere.  </li>
            <li>This mascara makes my eyelashes a mile long - but more important, it doesn&#x27;t flake off or smudge or spend the day wandering from my eyelashes to my under-eye area.  </li>
            <li>Long sexy and smooth (not clumpy).</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t speak to how long it lasts, but so far I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I say this with confidence because you most likely will end up buying the full size.</li>
            <li>This mascara thickens, lengthens, doesn&#x27;t clump, and most importantly, stays put all day long with no flaking or bleeding onto the skin.  </li>
            <li>I am so in love with this product, full lash separation with massive volume!!!</li>
            <li>Has a nice dark pigment and a smooth texture.</li>
            <li>They do give GREAT Volume and Long Natural looking Lashes.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I ordered this is the reviews were true that this is the BEST mascara; however I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li>Full disclosure: I do rotate mascaras with the cheap stuff, but this is by far my favoritemascara.</li>
            <li>comes off very easily when washing your face or in the shower but be warned: Don&#x27;t try to wipe it off with makeup wipes because you&#x27;ll inevitably take some eyelashes with it.   </li>
            <li>It separates my lashes and lengthens them like no other mascara has been able to before.</li>
            <li>I prefer a thinker more bristley large round brush, but that formula is so amazing it still works wonders.</li>
            <li>The formula is really something special.</li>
            <li>What I love about this mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t smears or leaves under eye black marks :)</li>
            <li>Many market mascaras clump or bunch my lashes together, causing less of a volume and more of a</li>
            <li>I get compliments frequently, many people asking if my eyelashes they are real or if I am even wearing mascara because they are not clumpy and look very natural.</li>
            <li>Happy to report that I look like linebacker no more.</li>
            <li>I was caught in a rainstorm, got soaked, it didn&#x27;t run, but did wash off very well with soap and water, (this is not the waterproof mascara), It is not clumpy, and did not flake, as some reviewers have stated, and made my lashes look full again.</li>
            <li>I have long lashes already, but this mascara increases the length of my lashes amazingly.  </li>
            <li>It stays on and does not run, even after an intense spin class after a full day at work.  </li>
            <li>I never expected to find a mascara that I can say I really love at this stage of my life....</li>
            <li>I usually sweat mascara off but this stuff is really great.</li>
            <li>think the $20 price I paid was worth it and not expensive at all.</li>
            <li>It goes on really nice and stays put a long time.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good dark color.  </li>
            <li>It makes my eyelashes look thick and beautiful.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look nice and long and mascara stays through  the day without any problems.</li>
            <li>This is a good mascara but definitely not worth the $20.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this in my monthly beauty subscription haul a couple of years back and absolutely FELL IN LOVE!</li>
            <li>No clumps, nice long lashes that make my skimpy ones look almost like falsies.</li>
            <li>Nothing had compared to the beautiful, thick lashes that I once had as a result of</li>
            <li>; I love it!&amp;#34; It really makes your lashes look lush!</li>
            <li>on good but not worth the price</li>
            <li>IS ONE SUPER LARGE SIZE MASCARA TUBE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on easily without clumping, makes lashes look long and full, and it does not smudge!</li>
            <li>My lashes are very fine and short.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of different mascaras and for a long time was loyal to Lancôme, then flipped 180 degrees on cost and went to Maybelline Great Lash.  </li>
            <li>This mascara gives a little more length than most.  </li>
            <li>I will gladly spend a little more for a product that works well.  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m happy with it as a product, it really wasn&#x27;t worth the money I spent VS a normal Covergirl mascara.</li>
            <li>It also washes off more easily than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Amazing long curled lashes and no smudges!</li>
            <li>The brush is awesome and grabs every little lash (top AND bottom) for a perfect application and the formula is not too thick or too thin.  </li>
            <li>I respect spiders, but I certainly don&#x27;t want my eye lashes to resemble them!</li>
            <li>After just two coats my eyelashes are large and in charge!</li>
            <li>and it certainly makes my lashes look longer!</li>
            <li>This mascara works exactly as promised right from the beginning</li>
            <li>My lashes look amazing and VERY long.</li>
            <li>It is a great black color, easy to layer without caking or getting gross.</li>
            <li>I put several coats and have to really wiggle the brush to get any kind of volume.  </li>
            <li>Am learning to layer quickly, as it dries fast, but it gives the length I need without clumping.  </li>
            <li>This product not only gives me beautiful lashes, but also and most importantly, is the only product that doesn&#x27;t smudge and leave what appears to be dark circles under my eyes (without the use of any lash primer).  </li>
            <li>This mascara lengthens and is more natural looking, but doesn&#x27;t give as much volume.</li>
            <li>does not dry out, love it.</li>
            <li>Not to mention shipped and delivered super fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really different compared to others; doesn&#x27;t smudge, comes off easily and clean.</li>
            <li>I bought it based upon previous review that the product should have good volume.</li>
            <li>The texture of it is so different from all others I have used - it&#x27;s light and smooth.</li>
            <li>The wand makes for easy, seamless application, and the formula has zero clump.</li>
            <li>(one night I forgot to take it off &amp; it still looked good in the AM), &amp; is easy to take off, (flakes off instead of smearing black into my sensitive skin under my eyes).</li>
            <li>found a MUCH cheaper one that is far better on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;(E.</li>
            <li>I am actually using it without an eyeliner on my upper lids and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>once dry the mistakes just kind of fall</li>
            <li>AT A GREAT PRICE, COMPARED TO THAT OF THE BIG LOCAL BEAUTY STORES.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite mascara... Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I would take off half a star because once in a great while I do get fallout, if I try and add more once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>I have searched far and wide for a great mascara.</li>
            <li>This mascara is easy to apply and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I have slept in it accidentally only to find that it looks great the next day too!  </li>
            <li>*: It is still not the most volumizing mascara that I have ever used, but at the suggestion of the VERY HELPFUL Elizabeth Mott President &amp; customer service people, I received a tube directly from their company (as they noted that the Amazon product may have been affected by heat/cold/etc.</li>
            <li>I eventually had to use makeup remover (I&#x27;m used to my old brand coming off easily with cleanser) twice to get all the flakes off my lashes and face.</li>
            <li>I need a product that provides volume, length, stays put, and comes off completely and easily at night.</li>
            <li>biggest issue is that my eyes water all the time, especially when I smile (which I often do :)), and even with waterproof mascara I always have a smudging problem.  </li>
            <li>and it looks natural and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this amazing mascara,I have my femininity back!</li>
            <li>It is mostly lengthening, but if you put on a few coats it becomes much more voluminous, too.</li>
            <li>Amazing Long Lush clump free lashes.</li>
            <li>The only issue you need to know is that it takes quite a bit of time to apply if you want a super full clean look.  </li>
            <li>my first purchase was fantastic, it must have been a new mascara tube.  </li>
            <li>Then when I get home it comes off easy with a little warm water and some gentle rubbing.  </li>
            <li>Nice true black color.</li>
            <li>It comes of nice and easy with my usual make-up remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would also love it if Mott would create another formula with fibers for super long party eyes.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very light and makes my eyelashes SO BIG!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>I have very straight lashes that refuse to keep a curl.</li>
            <li>Only thing I didn&#x27;t like, was that it goes on very light and takes awhile to build up the length</li>
            <li>I have very straight lashes.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>I very much like a mascara that can hold up to watery eyes and</li>
            <li>I am able to workout w/o it running down my face, but it easily washes off w/facial cleanser &amp; water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s So BIG is really lovely.....easy to apply, light as a feather, no clumping and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Works better for way less $$$ and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>What I like most about this product is that it is easy to remove and does not leave me with racoon eyes; a bunch of black gunk under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I hesitate to order another, but I did like the first one very much.</li>
            <li>Looks great, works well, hard to remove</li>
            <li>Others have great wear but are so hard to get off I lose lots of lashes.</li>
            <li>I am seriously not the type to leave a review, but this is by far the best mascara I have tried in the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li>so they coat your lashes well, and the &#x27;flail&#x27; is great for accessing those hard to reach areas around the corners of your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I searched for a new brand and discovered it&#x27;s so BIG and let me tell ya, this mascara is better!</li>
            <li>Super fun to have wow lashes again!</li>
            <li>My lashes didn&#x27;t look huge, but there clearly are thickening fibers in the product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but towards the later part of my work day it starts to irritate my eyes a bit.</li>
            <li>But I had to study those at first to make sure my actual eyelashes weren&#x27;t coming off.</li>
            <li>I love my current mascara and this was recommended to me.</li>
            <li>This was my first non-drug store mascara</li>
            <li>It is a bit more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; than I&#x27;m used to and the first application left me rather discouraged.  </li>
            <li>The first mascara I have ever worn that didn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes after a day of wearing it.</li>
            <li>This is my first time going away from drugstore mascara</li>
            <li>I have blonde lashes, so I need lots of color on the top and bottom lashes to see them.</li>
            <li>I first tried it at my daughter-in laws, and now I am hooked.</li>
            <li>I rarely ever review an item,  but this product really attention.  </li>
            <li>Comparable to Lancome at a much lower price!</li>
            <li>Even washing it off with a cleanser is pretty painless.  </li>
            <li>I initially thought it was not as advertised but having now used it for 2 weeks I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>My consistent go-to would be loreal voluminous.</li>
            <li>; being that it really does NOT budge!</li>
            <li>The formula isn&#x27;t waterproof but it takes extensive patience for me to be able to remove ALL of it from my lashes.</li>
            <li>No matter how many extra coats I tried, my lashes remained stubbornly stick-ish.</li>
            <li>I will purchase two more as back up, now!</li>
            <li>No flaking, no smudging, no weird spider lashes.  </li>
            <li>now teach yoga, which gets me pretty hot...</li>
            <li>product ;)  </li>
            <li>Really does work!</li>
            <li>Performed exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>First off, I want to say...</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say Benefit gives more volume, but also clumps.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t smudge!  </li>
            <li>but this \\&quot;It&#x27;s so big\\&quot; is a hot item too.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy this again!</li>
            <li>I love big lash!!</li>
            <li>I really appreciated that!</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know that my eye allergy was being caused by this mascara.</li>
            <li>I am going to order more because this is the only mascara for me!</li>
            <li>This is the first mascara I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t smudge.  </li>
            <li>This really is a holy grail mascara!</li>
            <li>but THIS... this is something I am willing to continually splurge on.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it does not go on cakey and gross looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used an array of different brands over the years, and this is the first one to ever leave me 100% satisfied every time I&#x27;ve used it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Never any clumping, looove the application wand shape (which I initially didn&#x27;t think I would), and, for once, actually love my lashes!&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will get home from whatever you were doing all day and it will look exactly as it did that morning when you put it on.</li>
            <li>After many years of searching for a mascara I can finally say that I have found a &amp;quot;keeper&amp;quot;.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal!</li>
            <li>I use it daily and am completely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>If I use it with a different applicator, I get better results.</li>
            <li>I first got a sample of this mascara and have been using while I travel for work.</li>
            <li>First purchased this product in December 2014.</li>
            <li>almost as the end-of-use of the first one.</li>
            <li>next best thing&amp;#34; in mascaras only to toss it to the back of a drawer and continue the search.</li>
            <li>And the delivery was FAST!</li>
            <li>but overall i still like loreal more.  </li>
            <li>Most mascarras end up actually straightening out my eyelashes even after I use the eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I did not like the odd-shaped brush, though I was willing to try it.  </li>
            <li>Really liking this product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already received compliments from two co-workers in the first week of using this product.</li>
            <li>You lashes definitely are more defined.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands and this stuff</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for in a mascara for years.</li>
            <li>Glad I finally found it.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever bought a mascara online and not in a drug store off the shelf.</li>
            <li>I thought since it has wax in it it would be more likely to stay and be somewhat waterproof.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate my eyes, and doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge after 10 hours of working in humid hot conditions.</li>
            <li>It has two types of bristles and that really helps &amp;#34;fan out&amp;#34; easier!</li>
            <li>They were just that pretty.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Not fake lashes look though.</li>
            <li>first, I  thought it might just be an overpriced eye lash curler, but no-</li>
            <li>and it had me at first use.</li>
            <li>I hesitated to purchase this mascara at first because of the price, but I read the reviews and was convinced to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It makes your eye lashes looks funny</li>
            <li>Everyone raves about this stuff, and I really didn&#x27;t like it!</li>
            <li>It does make those funny flakes when washing it off....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first mascara I can say that about.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real!).</li>
            <li>It was exactly as the seller described.</li>
            <li>and they really pop!</li>
            <li>It lengthens and thickens my lashes very well!</li>
            <li>I first tried a sample of this mascara that came in my monthly Ipsy box.</li>
            <li>Ok so the last few I have gotten have been good and this mascara</li>
            <li>I first got this in my monthly beauty subscription bag.</li>
            <li>Like others have said, it really doesn&#x27;t smudge!</li>
            <li>I used a curler first and then applied the mascara</li>
            <li>This is the first time I am using this mascara</li>
            <li>Stays on all day, I will definitely be buying this again :)</li>
            <li>I first discovered it in a subscription make up box</li>
            <li>Really plumps up your lashes!</li>
            <li>Honestly for a mascara called BIG I expected more.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the brush and the size of the tube of the So BIG Volumizing Mascara, but it does tend to flake...</li>
            <li>At the end of each hot, humid day in Hawaii, I can always count on</li>
            <li>thank you sooooo much its like heaven on my lashes!</li>
            <li>Going back to Buxom or even the drugstore brands as they are even better than this mascara.</li>
            <li>Though overall, I really love the mascara.</li>
            <li>This is the FIRST mascara that I have ever used that does not smudge.  </li>
            <li>It is more similar to waterproof mascara without being a pain to remove.</li>
            <li>I ended up swapping the brush to a different one and it works MUCH better.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real!</li>
            <li>From some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I think I&#x27;ll try taking it off first with Coconut Oil.</li>
            <li>This one comes very close!  </li>
            <li>This BIG MOTT mascara has been the first out of the last 8 attempts to replace my LANCOME Defincils mascara that has been successful.</li>
            <li>I was using Fairy Drops Scandal Queen Mascara which is my ultimate FAVORITE.</li>
            <li>It does not fail.</li>
            <li>But unlike Blinc, It&#x27;s So BIG has a way better formula.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the mascara the wand snapped off the lid and is stuck in side the tube.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I definitely need more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mascara now for several months -- probably six or more.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is very sticky &amp; never drys!</li>
            <li>Actually Loreal is better than this.</li>
            <li>it gives you the mod falsies look!  </li>
            <li>Love the BIG mascara!  </li>
            <li>So at this point I&#x27;m still experimenting, but I most definitely notice longer lashes!,</li>
            <li>I am really dissapointed in it!  </li>
            <li>I curl my lashes first</li>
            <li>only quibble is that the product removal (as you draw the brush out of the tube) could be a bit more complete/cleaner</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Ordering 2 more tubes, and extra for myself and one for my college age daughter!!  </li>
            <li>Let me say, this is the first formula I have tried that is not waterproof yet won&#x27;t leave me looking like a raccoon.</li>
            <li>Recieved my first</li>
            <li>Big is always better..</li>
            <li>I tried the sample first because I was apprehensive about spending $20 on a mascara without knowing how well it would work.</li>
            <li>I love trying lots and lots of different brands of mascaras.</li>
            <li>When I first saw it, I emailed the company to get a sample</li>
            <li>The first time my friends saw me with  this on they thought I had caved and gone to a lash  bar.</li>
            <li>When I first got it (was used 2 days)</li>
            <li>I add powder to my lashes first.  </li>
            <li>It really does make your lashes look thicker too!</li>
            <li>So glad I found a product that actually does what it says it does.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s worth the $20, though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s up there with dior show, they&#x27;re real, and my holy grails eyko and RiRi!</li>
            <li>However, this product was more like Blinc Mascaras that use &amp;#34;tube-technology&amp;#34; to form tiny water-resistant tubes around lashes for amplification &amp; hold, rather than painting them.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re expecting something that will transform unnoticeable lashes to noticeable, you&#x27;re better off using the aforementioned Revlon Grow Luscious brand --</li>
            <li>Prior to using Elizabeth Mott, my favorite brand was Benefit&#x27;s</li>
            <li>and I hear nothing but compliments and &amp;#34;are those fake lashes?&amp;#34; Great product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking I guess, but first I&#x27;ll use up this one.</li>
            <li>I feel like they look bigger and better than ever.</li>
            <li>Most mascaras either left me with smudges or flakes on my face.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t need any other mascara, I have found my favorite!</li>
            <li>It does seem to last most of the day without clumping on your lashes or flaking.</li>
            <li>It also comes off much easier!</li>
            <li>I had ordered one and went back and ordered two more in addition to the gel eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>What more could you possibly ask for?  </li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the better mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It does help, of course, to curl your lashes first.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for letting me brag on this product!</li>
            <li>You can add extra coats for more volume and it doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li>But WOW....this stuff is exactly as the reviews are telling you....</li>
            <li>I went with a sample first and immediately ordered a full-size tube.</li>
            <li>I first discovered this mascara after receiving it in an ipsy bag.</li>
            <li>I first bought one to try it out.</li>
            <li>Yes, FINALLY :-)</li>
            <li>I have to wipe almost all the mascara off of the brush first.  </li>
            <li>So, at first, I was looking for a mascara to give length and volume.</li>
            <li>Overall I love it.</li>
            <li>It takes two coats over the primer, and my lashes are exactly everything I&#x27;ve ever searched for.</li>
            <li>Fabulous and lush mascara -</li>
            <li>This is the first mascara I have used that does NOT leave smudges under my eye.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I knew this was the mascara I had been looking for</li>
            <li>how favorite products are suddenly NLA!!!!)  </li>
            <li>*cough cough Smashbox cough cough*).  </li>
            <li>First time trying it.</li>
            <li>Tarte and Benefit have better mascaras for the same cost.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I am always looking for something bigger and better in the makeup world</li>
            <li>However, this is the first time I&#x27;ve had this type of response from a company - and I will update my review upon trying the replacement bottle of mascara.&lt;br</li>
            <li>4/22/14&lt;br /&gt;I received my replacement, and it appears my first bottle was a dud.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different types of mascara from Sephora, Ulta,</li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li>Not even sure this actually mascara.</li>
            <li>The first day I wore it</li>
            <li>The first is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to smudge or flake.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>My lashes are thicker and more voluminous, I never have any smudges at the end of the day, and washing it off is so simple--</li>
            <li>This is the first that does not.</li>
            <li>My lashes are also not sticking together like they were with the first tube.</li>
            <li>thanks Elizabeth Mott!    </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also priced well for the quality - definitely better than drug store brands which are similarly priced.</li>
            <li>I got my first taste of this mascara in a beauty box and haven&#x27;t used anything else since.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well-</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara!  </li>
            <li>This mascara did exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>Not so for Elizabeth Mott, and so this was my first puchase from this company.</li>
            <li>This mascara really is all its cracked up to be and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Much of the success of the product comes from how you hold the wand and manipulate it.</li>
            <li>and I love that this one stays on in the presence of tears and contact solution but can be washed off with regular face wash, without need for a separate eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>I use a blow dryer on my eyelash curler first.  </li>
            <li>Will most definitely purchase again &amp; tell my friends!</li>
            <li>I have a more oily skin, especially around the t-zone and eyes, and this does not smear for me.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake and only clumps with too many coats.</li>
            <li>Very lengthening, product doesn&#x27;t clump and I like the brush!</li>
            <li>Thanks Elizabeth!</li>
            <li>With all the rave reviews I expected something spectacular with this mascara</li>
            <li>Actually that works better than the non-oily mascara remover.  </li>
            <li>During the day, I&#x27;ll apply a couple coats and have a nice professional look but for a night out, a few more and my lashes stand out like they should.</li>
            <li>I first found this as a sample and immediately baca me a devotee.</li>
            <li>If I want more oomph I put on a second coat.</li>
            <li>FIRST MASCARA</li>
            <li>No clumping, makes my lashes longer and so pretty.  </li>
            <li>You will thank me later.  :)</li>
            <li>I first received this mascara in a trial size from monthly Ipsy Glam Bag.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad that will not be an issue for me as I&#x27;ve finally found the one.. or The BIG one :)</li>
            <li>is the first mascara that does not smudge-</li>
            <li>My first time using this product</li>
            <li>Stays in all day but is not difficult to remove at night.</li>
            <li>I havent tried 10 coats of it yet, like it suggests,  Im thinking I might not be able to keep eyes open</li>
            <li>this is the first mascara i&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t smudge on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t glump up like many others, always stays fluid.  </li>
            <li>Really lengthening!</li>
            <li>I lost my first mascara before I could use it, it fell out of my purse.</li>
            <li>but they have gotten more sparse in middle age.  </li>
            <li>I love how this goes on and especially how it stays on during the day and doesn&#x27;t leave any crease marks on my eyelids, like even the waterproof mascaras do, because I still have oily eyelids.</li>
            <li>This mascara really does what it says it does!</li>
            <li>I like the mascara, it definitely makes them more noticeable</li>
            <li>only eat at your pulling desire even more.</li>
            <li>It is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>I am fully aware of that....</li>
            <li>I am fully aware of that....</li>
            <li>This is the first Amazon review I&#x27;ve written but felt compelled.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Flash to 4 months later and STILL IN LOVE with this.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes pretty</li>
            <li>Woke up ready to go, no need to reapply!</li>
            <li>I ran out recently and had to buy more.</li>
            <li>and this is my current favorite.</li>
            <li>Ordered one of these awhile back and fell in love as it did what it promised.</li>
            <li>First use...seemed to lengthen.</li>
            <li>Would have returned, but threw out packaging and paperwork after first use.</li>
            <li>My first tube did not clump.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore the brush applicator!</li>
            <li>I will be restocking later. :)</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara!</li>
            <li>And to top it off, not only does it make my eyes pop, but it stays throughout an 8 hour session of hot and sweaty salsa.</li>
            <li>It makes my skinny non-existent lashes and really makes them pop!</li>
            <li>It  absolutely rocks my world!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and really like it!</li>
            <li>Eyelash curler is the only sure way I&#x27;ll get any curl.  </li>
            <li>I first recieved this product as a sample.</li>
            <li>I bought a MAC mascara and loved how it looked but would always flake off and smear after a few hours.  </li>
            <li>Had to apply few times,but still good.</li>
            <li>This is a good everyday mascara.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product, have been using for a few months now, will never go back to old mascara!!!</li>
            <li>It goes on clean and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>#34;I don&#x27;t know what you are talking about.&amp;#34; I quickly swiped my fingers under my eyes, and discovered no black!!!</li>
            <li>Very pleased that this mascara doesn&#x27;t melt down my face, even in the 90 degree South Florida heat, running around all day with my children.</li>
            <li>I have eyelashes, and they&#x27;re clump free, flake free, long and dark and lovely!</li>
            <li>I am happy w/the product, it goes on smoothly and the black is not a harsh black color as many mascaras are.</li>
            <li>The color is a nice dark black that stays put &amp; can easily be applied layer on top of layer and so on</li>
            <li>The color is nice dark black and it stay put and can easily applied layer on top of a layer and so on.</li>
            <li>I read a ton of Amazon reviews before I made my purchase and this one seemed to have the highest number, and most positive reviews, overall - and I can see why.  </li>
            <li>and I saw so many positive review of So BIG that I figured I would try it.  </li>
            <li>The mascara can get very clumpy and it&#x27;s hard to remove, leaving my lashes feeling crispy; however, I do think that the mascara does a great job of lengthening your lashes and the wand is different from many others.</li>
            <li>But, after chemo and low thyroid took their toll, my nearly invisible lashes needed more!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a great mascara and finally found it!  </li>
            <li>You barely need any to make you lashes look super long, love it!</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes look super long, and washes off easily  </li>
            <li>It is also very easy to take off with just water, although I usually use an oil free makeup removers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really wear much other make up other than mascara, so the mascara that I choose to use needs to look awesome, well, this does it.</li>
            <li>This mascara goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t glue my lashes all together or need endless separating.</li>
            <li>Not as nice as other mascaras(in the volume department)</li>
            <li>The brush is nice and makes my lashes longer and fuller than any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smear or flake, no matter what I&#x27;m doing (it actually holds up better to swimming than most waterproof mascaras, even though it isn&#x27;t a waterproof formula), but comes off fine with my facial cleansing cloths or regular face wash.</li>
            <li>I would hands down compare it to my favorite so far NUTROGENA HEALTHY VOLUME mascara.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it does a better job than a few other products so while it&#x27;s a good product, I do not think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Although this is a very wet formula, they help my lashes stay curl, while providing nice length and volume.</li>
            <li>Still haven&#x27;t found anything near the excellent maybelline lash stylist mascara, which they stopped making years ago (should be criminal -</li>
            <li>For the last year or two, I started layering regular mascara with waterproof on top, to get it to come off easily and still stay on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this mascara, compared to Benefit, MAC, and store brands this is by far my favorite for a dramatic lasting look.</li>
            <li>It definitely works and doesn&#x27;t clump, but it does appear to smudge off easily with sweat which I don&#x27;t love, I switched back to my waterproof XXL one for the summertime</li>
            <li>My mascara was pretty dry at first, but now it seems to be covering much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never paid this much for a mascara before, but I am convinced I will never be able to go back to drug store brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but very time consuming to apply, 2 different things to apply, and can get chunky</li>
            <li>It appears that I&#x27;m much pickier than the most of the public when it comes to mascara...</li>
            <li>It can be a bit clumpy and doesn&#x27;t really separate, especially when I use more than one coat in hopes of increased volume.  </li>
            <li>This is coming from someone whose eyelashes are not thick or long looking on their own.</li>
            <li>so I am always on the move when I am working, constantly lifting things and working up a good sweat, especially in the summer time.</li>
            <li>Comes off with warm water, no left over residue like my old mascara</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great natural looking mascara for everyday.</li>
            <li>Especially now that price is more reasonable.</li>
            <li>It leaves my lashes long, full, clutter free and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>and I have finally --- FINALLY --- been able to absolutely just forget about being concerned whether I had darkened raccoon eyes as the day goes on.</li>
            <li>After searching for a long while I ran across this one and must say I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good buy, and I would compare it favorably with big department store mascaras.</li>
            <li>My lashes are too short to curl, but the mascara looks just as good 12-14 hours later as it did in the morning when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>It goes on even and smooth and makes my lashes long and full.  </li>
            <li>this is a really thin formula that delivers, at best, a lengthened natural look.  </li>
            <li>and this adds so much volume and makes my eyelashes appear incredible that they almost look false.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara, and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every affordable mascara and paying just a little bit more for this one is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>, it lasts all day, is nice and black, and just looks pretty.  </li>
            <li>The positive reviews seem to be exaggerations of its benefits.</li>
            <li>so that is a positive in my book.  </li>
            <li>The positive reviews I read about this mascara were spot on.  </li>
            <li>On the  positive side,  it comes off well with soap and water.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could leave positive feedback</li>
            <li>I have to say I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to apply and how my lashes had much more volume than some of the other brands that I use.</li>
            <li>This is great going on, a little hard to remove, but overall I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li>easy to apply, lasts all day, comes off easily with a little makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments about how long my lashes look</li>
            <li>I have tried tons of different brands from the cheap to the expensive and this stuff is the best.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and every other kind I&#x27;ve tried always smudges and gets all over my eyes.</li>
            <li>This is the first mascara that really works and NEVER FLAKES.  </li>
            <li>makes my lashes look so much longer and thicker than any other kind.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, it makes my eyelashes long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every drugstore mascara on the market, and I&#x27;ve always had issue with both clumping and flaking.</li>
            <li>After removing them my lashes were pretty much non-existent.</li>
            <li>Just got my first real sized mascara.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty goopy, and the wand shape doesn&#x27;t help, but its very waterproof</li>
            <li>This product made my long sexy eyelashes</li>
            <li>I like my mascara to thicken and lengthen, and most of all, I do NOT want it to smudge after a long day.  </li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my lashes long but not clumpy :-)</li>
            <li>really works to help my dwindling eyelashes seem so much fuller and longer!</li>
            <li>It got here pretty fast</li>
            <li>First of all, it absolutely does not go on evenly.</li>
            <li>I have been using Maybelline  Full N&#x27; Soft.</li>
            <li>I usually use Lancome&#x27;s Definicils and this product was easily as good but at a lower price point.  </li>
            <li>It happens to me a lot &amp; usually with good reason.</li>
            <li>Nice, dark lengthen mascara.  </li>
            <li>but it is FAR superior to any other luxury or drugstore brand I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading the reviews I was excited to try it, but it didn&#x27;t give me much volume or length which really surprised me.</li>
            <li>Nice dark color, not too clumpy, and cheaper than some department store brands that don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>I had heard about it, ordered a sample directly from her site and then purchased the full size on amazon.</li>
            <li>It works nicely, staining my lashes and making them look dark and feathery with no clumps.</li>
            <li>Having been diagnosed this past summer with severe iron deficiency,I lost a good bit of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Also, so far I don&#x27;t believe any mascara has the true ability to curl lashes--</li>
            <li>I live in HOT, HUMID South Carolina, and, yay!</li>
            <li>My eyelashes luge huge  and super long!</li>
            <li>The mascara is SUPER BLACK, which I love.</li>
            <li>which if i got while wet was super easy.  </li>
            <li>No smear, no moving, just fabulous LONG pretty lashes!  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and cannot do many waterproof mascaras without major irritation.</li>
            <li>Have only been using a few days, but this seems to be an excellent mascara - it goes on smoothly without any flaking and with minimal glooping (is that a word?)  </li>
            <li>Since I have tried literally every mascara on the market....whether an expensive department store brand or cheaper drugstore brand, I can honestly say that It&#x27;s So BIG Mascara is definitely one of, if not the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend thismascara and hope you all have the same experience with it as I have!  :)</li>
            <li>I feel like there needs to be more quality control on this product, especially for the high price tag.</li>
            <li>And very easy to remove, unlike other non-smudging mascaras.</li>
            <li>Comes off very easily without causing eyelashes to fall out like some other mascaras can cause.</li>
            <li>I Love how long it makes my lashes!</li>
            <li>Big mascara - which comes off so easy with just face soap and a washcloth in threadlike pieces so</li>
            <li>Also, because it easily flakes off, I have to apply multiple times throughout the day...</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and my lashes are BIG as stated.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive eyes and have tried every mascara from drugstore to YSL and Chanel.</li>
            <li>The shape of the mascara wand makes it really easy to reach the tiny lashes in the corners, and the mascara lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This is the only mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried that both stays put without smudging and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>The It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara has never smudged and it easily wiped off at night -</li>
            <li>I am a makeup junkie who really just wants to find a product that works consistently.</li>
            <li>I also have short and somewhat skimpy lashes, and these can easily be layered on.</li>
            <li>it is very appropriate, very black (don&#x27;t let that scare you-we need it).  </li>
            <li>I almost wanted to be a tad bit more dense or perhaps even dry.</li>
            <li>THIS mascara gives me the same lengthening effects, but it is so lightweight, is easy to remove at the end of the day and NO flaking or running.  </li>
            <li>It does not give enough volume and smudges easily.</li>
            <li>I use my face wash followed by cleansing wipes and it comes off easy enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not nearly as good as my Urban Decay Canon Ball, which is the best waterproof mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, but that one is 25 bucks.  </li>
            <li>The only thing this product did as promised is that it is smudge proof and easy to come off.  </li>
            <li>But the only reason I gave it four stars is because it does not come off easily with make up remover.</li>
            <li>I eventually stopped buying mascara after becoming an ethical vegan and trying cruelty-free brands - the last one I bought was Aveda, and I might as well have worn nothing.  </li>
            <li>It comes off fairly easily with my facial cleanser and water.</li>
            <li>No smug, no flaking - ALL DAY and comes off easily with just your facial cleanser and water.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, lengthens my lashes like lash extensions and doesn&#x27;t leave me black under eyes.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily, with just my facial cleanser, and water.</li>
            <li>sure you go on there website for a free sample if you are not sure</li>
            <li>Easy and lasting.</li>
            <li>It also makes it easy to apply The only two drawbacks</li>
            <li>The only positives were it did not flake throughout the day and was easy to remove.</li>
            <li>I like it because it goes on easily without clumping and lasts throughout the entire day without flaking!</li>
            <li>This mascara went on smooth and never clumped, and instantly after the first swipe I saw a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>Comes off easy enough with make up remover.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about my mascara and have pretty much tried everything from cover girl to Chanel.</li>
            <li>but because it ranks up there with pretty much any mascara you can get at the drug store much cheaper.</li>
            <li>but because it ranks up there with pretty much any mascara you can get at the drug store much cheaper.</li>
            <li>super soft lashes.</li>
            <li>Love how it doesn&#x27;t leave smudge marks and really makes my lashes long looking.</li>
            <li>This excellent mascara makes my eyelashes thick, long</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for work; but if I am going out after work I generally need a little more.</li>
            <li>As always, I curl my lashes prior to mascara but with most brands, including high end, by midday my lashes are sagging and almost straight.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t flake off (ever), and comes off like magic with a single swipe of eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>for it, I feel certain you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers &amp; Shine On,  Zoe</li>
            <li>but it certainly did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>If you are using this for evening wear you may certainly apply over your day application and it will not clump.</li>
            <li>it’s good, but not as rich and dramatic as the others.  </li>
            <li>I feel very deceived by all the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li>I had been using Maybelline big lash and another one in a pink container thats newer, and it was pretty good -</li>
            <li>mascara from Ipsy a few months ago and fell in love with this mascara!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried the sample that the company offers before I spent $20 on the full size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty expensive and so far I had not found the perfect one.</li>
            <li>So Big Mascara is now my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>After about a month of using the product the &#x27;ring&#x27; at the top of the opening that serves to remove the excess mascara from the brush when it&#x27;s pulled out to apply came loose and is now stuck on the brush, not on the bottle where it should be.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump or apply too heavy, and the huge brush allows for easy and even application.  </li>
            <li>it is easy to remove with a simple gentle cleaner.</li>
            <li>It went on easy enough but it was almost like there wasn&#x27;t much mascara on the brush, and I tried two coats to no avail.</li>
            <li>have very little lashes and this mascara lengthens them significantly hense why I purchased two more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to remove with regular washing, so you do need an eye makeup remover, which is another thing I don&#x27;t love, but hey - you can&#x27;t have everything and with this product you get pretty much what you ask for.</li>
            <li>Second and third coats to outer lashes makes you look sexy!</li>
            <li>The price on It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara is at the higher end for what I want to pay for makeup, but I&#x27;m going to continue to purchase it for the unique qualities it has.</li>
            <li>For me it lengthened fine, and definitely made my lashes darker...</li>
            <li>The fine brush applicator reaches all the lashes creating a BIG voluminous lashes.</li>
            <li>At first brush, it definitely extends the length of your lashes significantly.  </li>
            <li>I never considered this issue when I was younger, so any mascara was fine.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it acts in the same manner as Blinc, only better!  </li>
            <li>Better to spend more on a quality product or less on one of the same quality.</li>
            <li>But, if I&#x27;m using 2 decent drugstore mascaras, that&#x27;s costing me close to $20 anyways!</li>
            <li>I use this particular mascara first.</li>
            <li>(seriously NO smudges - ever!)</li>
            <li>I did some research on mascaras, and since this one had very high ratings, I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>It is a great product, but alas... how many hours do YOU have to work to afford a single tube of mascara?</li>
            <li>It does not lengthen much and certainly does not give volume.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the kind of mascara that comes off in little tubes, with some water and rubbing.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked it to be a little thicker or bolder.  </li>
            <li>A little clumpy but effective.  </li>
            <li>I tried a sample first and loved it, but I purchased a different product because I didn&#x27;t want the parabens and other chemicals in my mascara.</li>
            <li>and the price is pretty high.  </li>
            <li>it is that great, especially for the price, a little pricy for me.</li>
            <li>really like this sample size, my full size is super dry though.</li>
            <li>And one of the coolest things about this mascara is that it looks tremendous on lower lashes if you have a light hand and are careful with your brush!</li>
            <li>The latter effect is huge because my lashes don&#x27;t curl.</li>
            <li>If you are happy with this price point, but not happy with the product, I would recommend Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real -</li>
            <li>Wears really well</li>
            <li>It stays on really really well -- through exercise, through sleep, through the whole day - no flaking or smudging.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really do that.</li>
            <li>I run a lot and it doesn&#x27;t smudge one bit even with sweating so much.</li>
            <li>Works really well but doesn&#x27;t clump</li>
            <li>Not all that really.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really does make your lashes look longer and thicker without clumping.</li>
            <li>Too much comes out on the brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost wondering if I was duped and not giving the real thing when I purchased this.</li>
            <li>Too much work if you ask me.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.  </li>
            <li>sometimes wash my whole face except my eyelashes, apply vitamin C, retin-A, oil of olay, palmers cocoa oil, what have you, leaving the mascara intact,</li>
            <li>Really does the trick.</li>
            <li>I do not wear much makeup anyway</li>
            <li>I still think the price is too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about mascara</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real by Benefit or in a pinch Lash Blast by Cover Girl.</li>
            <li>I think the price is absolutely out of control for what it is.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>It is not waterproof, but stays on very well (even in shower or pool if you don&#x27;t rub your eyes).</li>
            <li>Me, not so much.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It layers really well and doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake.</li>
            <li>Really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>I get the same results from cheap drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real by Benifit.</li>
            <li>so I ordered it without much</li>
            <li>You have to be careful if you&#x27;re applying more than one coat as it starts to clump.</li>
            <li>But, It does flake if you touch your eyes too much.</li>
            <li>This mascara is so much more than I expected.</li>
            <li>It really does lengthen and fatten the lashes.</li>
            <li>Stays on all day, through every activity, and then washes off with a gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather buy $8 mascara at the store, than go through the hassle of using this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I am sure about this because I have spent probably thousands of dollars buying mascara in hopes it wouldn&#x27;t smudge off on me.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t lengthen much and my eye lashes clumped together.  </li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>My lashes look like they did in high school!</li>
            <li>This mascara is fantastic if you use it underneath a product that actually does what its job.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wash off very well</li>
            <li>so my eyes really pop.</li>
            <li>Fast and product was as described</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never clumpy but very lengthening.</li>
            <li>and they feel very brittle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about mascara</li>
            <li>Once, all I really needed was the mascara that didn&#x27;t smudge and flake, because that gets to be a literal pain, as I wear contacts.</li>
            <li>This really makes my eyelashes look fuller.</li>
            <li>This really does lengthen your eyelashes and separates them really well.</li>
            <li>REALLY well.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real, but I couldn&#x27;t justify $24 a tube for mascara.</li>
            <li>I really like this one.  </li>
            <li>The L&#x27;Oreal mascara I&#x27;ve used for years gives me much longer and thicker lashes than this.</li>
            <li>Really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>but this product didn&#x27;t really do much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way more volumizing than expected</li>
            <li>Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real mascara and had recommended it to friends, but now I am recommending this product.</li>
            <li>Extends my lashes so much, they brush against my eyeglasses.  </li>
            <li>Before 4 Months--------&amp;#62; waterproof...easily removed with soap and water and gently grasping  eyelashes in the shower...great for contact lens wearers no flaking...</li>
            <li>It did not plump up or lengthen my lashes very well.</li>
            <li>It was very clumpy...</li>
            <li>OMG where has this been my whole life.  </li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t want to hassel with the process</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and thought it would really blow me away.</li>
            <li>This mascara is really overpriced for what it does.</li>
            <li>buy it, for real.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it doesn&#x27;t really make my lashes look thicker, just longer</li>
            <li>I have been trying to decide if I really like this mascara</li>
            <li>Being very hopeful to find &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;, I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li>My lashes looked very individual and lightly coated with mascara.</li>
            <li>I found that two coats was all that I really needed.</li>
            <li>Really works like it said.  </li>
            <li>I expected the product would produce a greater volume of lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky with mascara.</li>
            <li>I was getting ready to try Latisse to grow my lashes because I wasn&#x27;t getting the results I wanted with mascara.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara a lot.  </li>
            <li>Really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It is smooth and does not clump, even after applying multiple coats.</li>
            <li>I feel responsible to warn people about this product.</li>
            <li>I sent for a free sample of So BIG Volumizing Mascara and couldn&#x27;t have been happier with the product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump or run--and, depending on layers, really makes lashes look thicker.  </li>
            <li>Something about my eye shape and skin texture, I have a real problem with 99% of mascaras smudging, except with this one.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it goes on very well</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a reasonably priced well made mascara.</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>Really lengthens lashes...</li>
            <li>I will never buy another mascara again and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>(I buy generic Latisse, an eye lash growing serum for alldaychemist.com, an Indian Pharmacy for CHEAP).</li>
            <li>so I can really tell on the coverage of a mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a shame that this isn&#x27;t available in ALL Sephora and Ulta stores..</li>
            <li>mascara layers very well</li>
            <li>It acts much like the ever-popular &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; but without the raccoon effect.  </li>
            <li>and my eyelashes are very sparse...</li>
            <li>but it makes them straight.</li>
            <li>The one thing it didn&#x27;t really do for me was create volume.</li>
            <li>and she doesn&#x27;t need to re apply it very often.</li>
            <li>We were called to deploy and the job is intense.</li>
            <li>I really like the product.  </li>
            <li>Well, they really will send you a sample to try before purchasing.  </li>
            <li>really do like the appearance of my lashes when wearing this mascara but</li>
            <li>you know she really studies me – said “</li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>and if I didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;d wake up in the morning with very irritated eyes.</li>
            <li>I really wish this wasn&#x27;t the case or my search for &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; mascara would be over...</li>
            <li>really think we have a winner here, folks...</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t do anything really for my lashes.</li>
            <li>and I really have to scrape it otherwise my lashes get clumpy.</li>
            <li>Really adds volume and thickness</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t feel like I got as much of a volumizing effect as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mascara!</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>But for me, i really like this.</li>
            <li>The mascara goes on very evenly</li>
            <li>It never clumps and it really separates your lashes.</li>
            <li>I use 2 coats for work - I don&#x27;t think 1 is really noticeable.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara - the shape of the brush, and it really stays put.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real instead.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Very uniform application -- the brush shape really helps separate lashes, and helps application.  </li>
            <li>like that this product really holds up during the day with no smudging or flaking.  </li>
            <li>In addition, this company&#x27;s commitment to creating cruelty free products is a big plus in my book.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li>I found it very drying and did nothing to help the volume of the length of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>gentle foaming face wash.  </li>
            <li>much so that often I just dab on a bit of bronzer with this mascara and head out the door feeling Gorgeous!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like my Elizabeth Mott mascara</li>
            <li>I went back to my Mabelline Stiletto which is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Really like this Mascara.  </li>
            <li>mascaras as smearing/smudging is a real issue for me, and this doesn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s really important to me is that it doesn&#x27;t smudge later in the day.</li>
            <li>lashcard--it really does help to elongate my lashes with no clumps).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It lasts a reasonable amount of time too.</li>
            <li>I used to use Chanel but refuse to spend so much on makeup these days.</li>
            <li>and I really like the result.  </li>
            <li>It really lengthens and thickens her eyelashes.</li>
            <li>extend eyelash very well.</li>
            <li>very natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I see high standards!</li>
            <li>Much longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>I would purchase this one again and it is a reasonable price too.</li>
            <li>It really lengthens my lashes.</li>
            <li>but a couple of coats to see a real difference.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>However, it still works very well.</li>
            <li>I do really like the way the mascara wand applies the product.  </li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>It really makes my lashed pop and lengthens them.  </li>
            <li>I have bever had much luck with mascara.</li>
            <li>Thanks Elizabeth Mott.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff</li>
            <li>It REALLY makes my lashes stand out.  </li>
            <li>High Recommended!</li>
            <li>I thought the product was going to add volume &amp; lengthen my lashes, much like I get when I use Revlon&#x27;s Grow Luscious mascaras</li>
            <li>I work 13hr days then head straight to the gym</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use mascara much</li>
            <li>Plus it really lengthens and plumps up my lashes.</li>
            <li>I give the product two stars, because shipping was really fast</li>
            <li>and I watched my lashes become straight again</li>
            <li>It is very volumizing and buildable without clumpiness.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li>THANKS Elizabeth Mott.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara</li>
            <li>It really takes me a couple coats to really get it to look how I want</li>
            <li>so my lashes really pop.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for about two months now, and I really want to like it,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very drying, making my lashes break</li>
            <li>I have never paid this much for a mascara before.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my mascara.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take much to give them a boost.</li>
            <li>Plus it is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is very comparable and 1/2 the price.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re ready to walk out the door.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know where to start really.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about mascaras flaking, stay on power.</li>
            <li>It seems to really hold up and it doesn&#x27;t glop on the lashes like lots of brands</li>
            <li>It really does volumize my lashes without making them clump together.</li>
            <li>I was so worried to spend this much money on a brand that I&#x27;d never tried-</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I&#x27;m a woman with fairly straight eye lashes and for me to get any curly length, I have to use an eye lash curler along with waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>For this price, Macy&#x27;s Landcomb is so much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really, who does That anymore?&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Much expectations exceeded.</li>
            <li>Very impress lengthening.  </li>
            <li>Very buy now.</li>
            <li>It lengthens AND thickens without clumping which I feel like most brands say they do but really do not.</li>
            <li>I was really intrigued by the reviews.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t do much for them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how much mascara costs me, I will pay the price if does everything I want.</li>
            <li>And I find the price quite reasonable.</li>
            <li>But this one really deserves its 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Makes your eyelashes so much longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara is surprisingly light.</li>
            <li>really like the wand of Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I really did not like this mascara at all.</li>
            <li>Takes me that much longer to get ready for work in the morning.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any real volume or length, although I did see a bunch of fibers around my face.</li>
            <li>This product stays put very well.</li>
            <li>I have straight, medium length lashes.</li>
            <li>I like it ... will absolutely repurchase.</li>
            <li>I was hoping with all the great reviews that I may have broken my Lancome habit, but</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look much longer</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>decided to get a free trial of this stuff and now have an order on the way because I have finally found my solution.</li>
            <li>It works very well; no smudges, goes on evenly; no clumps.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this mascara.  </li>
            <li>For this price I expected more.</li>
            <li>However, it took 4 coats to get some real volume.</li>
            <li>Then I rubbed it with my finger, and very well, it came off.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It does lengthen my lashes and define them very well.</li>
            <li>You really need makeup remover to get it off.</li>
            <li>Washes off really well with just water.</li>
            <li>Very recommend.</li>
            <li>I paid way too much and it doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clot or flake and does;t smudge much.  </li>
            <li>(I think I must have very oily skin undr my eyes).</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Still highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different mascaras after running out of the bottle I purchased after using up my sample and haven&#x27;t found anything that I love more than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really made my lashes look longer and thicker.</li>
            <li>It really lengthens the lashes and it never smudges.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too much of a hassle to return.</li>
            <li>They also sent me their shadow crayon which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I much prefer the Benefit</li>
            <li>I have been using this mascara for a while, for some reason this one I just ordered is very flaky?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the difference between whole milk and skim milk -</li>
            <li>It dries really fast on your lashes and stiffens up.</li>
            <li>I have very puny lashes</li>
            <li>I really like the wand</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love&amp;#34; It&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I found that it clumped after 1 week of being opened and did not add much volume to my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I wish it didn&#x27;t&#x27; clump so much the thicker</li>
            <li>I have even washed my face gently around the eyes (not washing my lashes) and it stayed on without flaking or smudging.  </li>
            <li>It defines, separates and lengthens very well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would help the appearance of my thinning lashes (over 50).</li>
            <li>Thanks reviewers for getting me to try this (THUMBS UP).</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t do it much justice.  </li>
            <li>Have straight eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This product works very well</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend it for its price and purpose!</li>
            <li>It coats evenly without clumping, and it really makes my lashes longer.</li>
            <li>I found it to be very close to cover girls lash blast, which is what I have been using.</li>
            <li>Didnt care for this mascara,it was very clumpy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This mascara was a huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;For a $20 mascara I expected much more than your regular Loreal, Maybelline and the like.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It curls lashes, it raises them, which is absolutely awesome!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I am very picky about mascara.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and speedy.  </li>
            <li>This mascara doesn&#x27;t flake off into my eyes, it never runs, and it really fills out my sparse eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>It really does keep the lashes separated and that in itself, helps makes the lashes look even longer.  </li>
            <li>~ I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Would not buy again, and feel that the advertising is very misleading.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t add length and not too much volume either; I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>For the price I expected more.</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for my lashes.  </li>
            <li>thanks Elizabeth</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.!</li>
            <li>would purchase this again if needed, but I want to find something to keep my eye lashes curled rather than having them point straight out when applying my mascara.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are just very resistant and stubborn.</li>
            <li>The company very generously supplies a sample upon request, so I tried it</li>
            <li>I like applying multiple light coats and the brush works well for this (although I do wipe off any excess mascara that tends to gather at the end of the brush before applying.)  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really been put to the &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to my cheap brand.</li>
            <li>This mascara really separates lashes and extends lashes waaaaaayyy.out.  </li>
            <li>My wife just absolutely loves this.  </li>
            <li>I know this is going to be a very unpopular review, but I have to be honest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have a really embarrassing hair pulling disorder called trichotillomania.</li>
            <li>And it really doesn&#x27;t flake off.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted a waterproof.</li>
            <li>I would like a straight wand instead of</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>really helps give them volume and some length.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like the way it seperates all lmy lashes and is never &#x27;cakey&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It really did nothing for my lashes.</li>
            <li>I tried it on and it didn&#x27;t seem to change my lashes much</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s really it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear much make-up, but I never go without using this mascara.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really run or flake off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes a gentle rub with an eye makeup remover to take it off.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t found anything that beats Lancome.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as volumizing as I hoped, but it really does define, and it&#x27;s smudge proof.</li>
            <li>And it seems to have real staying power.</li>
            <li>It makes my unimpressive lashes really stand out.</li>
            <li>I apply it when getting ready for work each morning at 6am</li>
            <li>Stays on all day and makes lashes look much longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my fav and the only one I have purchased more than once.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve received some pretty cool stuff with these gift boxes, this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever sought out and purchased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of different mascaras over the years and this is by far my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I have thin, short lashes and this is the best mascara I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This mascara doesn&#x27;t seem to have any particular clumping advantage over Covergirl or Revlon mascaras I&#x27;ve tried, and doesn&#x27;t do a better job of creating more definition between each eyelash, especially some of the slightly longer ones.</li>
            <li>It is so difficult to find a good mascara, add to that finding one that is cruelty free</li>
            <li>I am 47 years old and have tried many different brands.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is with every penny and is the last kind I well likely ever try.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not one of those &amp;#34;touch up your make-up in the middle of the day&amp;#34; kind of people - simply don&#x27;t have time.)  </li>
            <li>but I have found that works best for my thin short lashes.</li>
            <li>, I decided to just keep piling it on to see what kind of thickness it produced, what a joke and what a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that kind of time to waste every morning.  </li>
            <li>but I am always at least trying to find a good mascara that adds length and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes.</li>
            <li>What I love about &amp;#34;its so Big&amp;#34; not only does it not flake it gives me the volume but in a natural looking way.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, looks great with a single coat for the day and is smooth enough to use multiple coats for a more dramatic night look.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s worth having slightly thinner lashes to know that a make up company places a high priority on respect and love for animals.</li>
            <li>I want a mascara that dries quickly, requires very few coats, lengthens, voluminizes, does not smudge, does not irritate my eyes and is a bold rich color.  </li>
            <li>; is the ONLY one that stays puts throughout the whole day and night!!!</li>
            <li>WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>I feel feel like I have young eyes again after applying!!!</li>
            <li>It gives me very full, very long looking lashes that are not caterpillary.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve use all the ones Sephora carries plus half the ones in the drug store.</li>
            <li>My wife said that even with the best mascaras she often ends up with some spots of black or runny spots from her mascara after working all day and not touching up her make up.  </li>
            <li>Took a long time to dry between coats....not good if you are in a hurry to get going.  </li>
            <li>I love trying different mascara products, (I do revisit the pink original Maybeline often)</li>
            <li>I have never found a product that makes my lashes look so long AND full!</li>
            <li>It makes my eyelashes so long and full!</li>
            <li>makes them look so long and full!</li>
            <li>I have only used the product a few times but, so far so good!</li>
            <li>I was looking at buying Latisse to enhance my eyelashes, but decided to try a new mascara first</li>
            <li>I live in a hot, humid climate.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and comes off easily with coconut oil.</li>
            <li>After reading all the other reviews I expected this to be a great lengthener - it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and leaves lashes looking long and sleek.</li>
            <li>My other mascara allows me to build layer on top of layer, as much as I want, but I think my lashes &amp;#34;got used&amp;#34; to my go-to mascara and started looking loppy.</li>
            <li>I did give it two stars due to the fast shipping and cute packaging.</li>
            <li>However, I went back to this mascara because it&#x27;s superior to the other that I tried.</li>
            <li>Thanks Elizabeth Mott and thanks Amazon for having product reviews on new products!</li>
            <li>I sometimes dust my lashes with some light powder from bare essential prior to using mascara for more fullness .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard many makeup artists say that mascaras are pretty much the same and you&#x27;re just buying a different brush that you like.</li>
            <li>I live in the SW and most mascara&#x27;s dry out in a month</li>
            <li>a little soap and water and light massage takes it all right off!  </li>
            <li>Is 19 bucks worth losing the quick dry and the volume?  </li>
            <li>But it is the dramatic awesome length that you get from department store brands such as Dior, Guerlain, Lancome?</li>
            <li>This product proves to be one of the most difficult mascaras to remove, which is great because you can go clubbing in it and not worry about looking like a hot mess!</li>
            <li>Works really well -- lengthens and volumizes lashes with just a few coats, and washes off very easily.</li>
            <li>I have had better luck with other mascaras than with this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands that are way better.</li>
            <li>My other favorite &amp;#34;Mally&amp;#34; mascara does</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better with other brands; the no-smudging is what&#x27;s keeping me sold on this product.</li>
            <li>I think this one gives a cleaner look, while the other brand gives more volume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s different than any I&#x27;ve used before, and worth the money!</li>
            <li>Unfortunatly due to too many morning of eye irritation I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li>My bottom lashes stand out more from this mascara than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I put it on for work, got done, went out, and woke up the next day with lashes that looked freshly done!</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said, I do believe it does more for length than volume</li>
            <li>This product really is better than i expected!  </li>
            <li>Better than all other drugstore mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I read all the other reviews and decided to try it, but it is just OK.</li>
            <li>Currently, I use &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; by Benefit, and I love it, but I feel that a tube of that stuff usually lasts me 2 weeks before it starts having to take alot more coats.  </li>
            <li>Never thought I&#x27;d like any other mascara more than Maybelline&#x27;s The Falsies.</li>
            <li>Ive had way better mascaras and this one does make my lashes longer but itx not consistent with the thickness of the application if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li>I already have pretty long and full eyelashes, but wanted something that made them really stand out.</li>
            <li>This mascara definitely adds a significant amount of length.</li>
            <li>Compared my other eyelashes, which had $7 Stiletto mascara on them, this mascara did NOT make my lashes look any better.</li>
            <li>It does lengthen and volumize, however I do think other mascara&#x27;s do it better.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this after reading the rave reviews,  and then learning this this product is not tested on animals (that&#x27;s what the 2nd star is for).&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the unique brush is terrific!  </li>
            <li>You ladies who can rock just one coat of mascara and look normal, I envy you!</li>
            <li>and we both have said to each other about the many compliments we receive whenever we wear it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes your lashes comparably nice to other regular brands which cost under $10, plus it dries up easily and flakes after just a few hours, which is a huge NO-NO in my book.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do love the way it goes on, but with a brand new tube, it does clump up on the brush where you have to clear the brush off to apply it properly.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this mascara mainly because it was quite reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>My eyes tend to dry out fairly easily, I have not felt itchy eyes or irritated eyes with this product.</li>
            <li>This mascara has it all, it does not flake or clump, goes on really smooth and really does make your lashes look extremely long.</li>
            <li>Really enjoyed it for the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly but the tube was relatively dry after I opened it.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t need false lashes with this mascara because it looks like I have beautiful natural ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on easily with minimal clumping (never met any that didn&#x27;t clump to a certain degree).  </li>
            <li>I have mostly used lancome or other high end mascara due to irritation of eyes with most of drug store brands.  </li>
            <li>Makes my lashes look incredible and washes off so much easier than other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>it is decent, but I have used other cheaper mascaras that I like more.  </li>
            <li>With the high praises i was really dissapointed in this.</li>
            <li>This is a really highly-rated mascara, and the volume of high ratings influenced my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Too much clumping with the application of this mascara, although I really wanted to try a new product.  </li>
            <li>Paired with my Shu Uemura eyelash curler, ice been getting compliments left and right!</li>
            <li>Volumizing is definitely the right word for this mascara!</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product, and the reviews got me so excited</li>
            <li>I know it is a little expensive, but why buy the cheap when you can have the best!</li>
            <li>It looks natural enough and comes off relatively easily when I wash my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian and like most Asians I have very straight, but long eye lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lengthening (little tubes on the ends of your lashes) and cleans off easily, but not clumpy when applying (which is...amazing!).</li>
            <li>I have naturally very long but fine eyelashes</li>
            <li>However, the subsequent tries have been much better!  </li>
            <li>Great mascara for my thin lashes and sensitive eyes!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy wearing it alone without any other eye makeup because it makes that much of a difference!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got long lashes already, so it&#x27;s not my primary goal here, but let&#x27;s face facts.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this, but when it arrived I first noticed the pink box opened.  </li>
            <li>I have long, light lashes</li>
            <li>I will continue ordering this mascara as long as it available.</li>
            <li>so normally I don&#x27;t notice much difference between makeup brands.  </li>
            <li>So Big Mascara make my lashes look and full of volume.</li>
            <li>I also love the dark color this provides.</li>
            <li>It was not horrible, just average.</li>
            <li>I tried this after getting a sample in my Ipsy bag and finally had to buy a full size tube.</li>
            <li>I like this better than the MAC and as much as the Urban Decay although the effects are different.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most mascaras, this one does not leave dark smudges under my eye at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I ordered the sample off of their website as suggested by others and came back to by the full version.  </li>
            <li>I have long lashes that are light and not particularly thick, so I really need a mascara that creates volume.  </li>
            <li>It was more waterproof then the average brand, but it did not add volume or length</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay but not worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>So Big is like a dream come true for my lashes.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how it does on its own, but my friend says it doesn&#x27;t smear for her</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t quite understand the hype - it wasn&#x27;t until I was in a situation where I ended up pushed in a pool unexpectedly where this mascara truly shined.</li>
            <li>Better than your average grocery store mascara.</li>
            <li>the It&#x27;s So Big - is true to its name.</li>
            <li>I liked my past mascara, but saw all the reviews on Amazon and thought I would try it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok as mascara goes, but not worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is the first mascara that stays put through my busy day.  </li>
            <li>Honestly after reading all the reviews i couldn&#x27;t wait to get the product… Usually i use LANCOME  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a major step in the right direction.</li>
            <li>But on the other hand, that&#x27;s kind of a good thing because I can layer it as much as I want, and either have a natural look or a really dramatic look.</li>
            <li>It layers very well, spreads out your lashes, doesn&#x27;t smudge (very important to me), lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Hands down, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>But it goes on easy, the brush is not too big or small, the color is dark black, it is super buildable, and the best part, IT DOES NOT SMUDGE OR FLAKE!!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in my naked lashes on the left eye versus the mascara&#x27;d lashes on the right eye.</li>
            <li>Very easy to remove and long lasting with no clumping</li>
            <li>Although I will continue to try new products, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; is the front runner for now!</li>
            <li>It one of my new favorites!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on a quest for a new mascara that will make my eyelashes look longer!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping an eye on this company for ANY new products that pop up!</li>
            <li>To be clear, this mascara isn&#x27;t really like my old Full n&#x27; Soft.</li>
            <li>But comes off easily with plain old face cleanser and water (no need for special eye makeup remover).</li>
            <li>hope this is available for a long time and never changes!</li>
            <li>It seems to work better when there is less product on the brush.</li>
            <li>usually put on one coat, then go back and put on another coat, which better thickens, defines and lengthens&lt;br /&gt;my fine lashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been comparing with others I typically used and this is much better.</li>
            <li>Better product can be bought for less at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>But my favorite part is that I  never get the black residue under my eyes</li>
            <li>I love it because it doesn&#x27;t wear off, smudge or make those black marks under your eyes</li>
            <li>I like my L&#x27;Oreal mascara much more, and it&#x27;s half the price.</li>
            <li>Much better than the lancome product I used previously &amp; half the price</li>
            <li>Did not smear or clump, but have had drugstore mascara do more for much less cost.</li>
            <li>I had found much better mascara at drugstores for a lot less money.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and has lasted about 1.5 months before it started to dry out in the tube a bit.  </li>
            <li>And my main thing to get use</li>
            <li>My main problem has always been specks of mascara ending up all around my eyes within an hour or two.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different types of mascara with hopes of finding one that would not bleed on my upper eye lid or under my eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In sum, if you&#x27;ve got decent lash volume and just need something that will stick with you all day</li>
            <li>If you already have decent lashes, it will probably work for you.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely reorder in future.</li>
            <li>Like seriously, I&#x27;ve never had lashes like this before.</li>
            <li>The test was last Saturday as I was the wedding planner for my daughters wedding and running ragged puts it mildly.</li>
            <li>You can layer it easily without any problems so you can have a day look with one or two layers and a more dramatic look with 5 plus layers.  </li>
            <li>I can make a really decent job on them with this mascara.</li>
            <li>It comes off quickly, you don&#x27;t have to rub it, and it doesn&#x27;t smudge all over your eyes like regular mascara.....</li>
            <li>I use mostly MAC make-up overall, but since I started using SO BIG Volumizing Mascara by Elizabeth Mott, I haven&#x27;t used anything else.</li>
            <li>The results from using this mascara are decent; however, I don&#x27;t like the application brush.</li>
            <li>Really decent mascara.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different mascaras - Covergirl, Lancome, Sephora, Urban Decay, Clinique, you name it.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and does lengthen,but does not really thicken the lases much.</li>
            <li>I can find decent mascaras, but they will smudge under my eyes after a while.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to love it, but I guess I&#x27;m with the few it didn&#x27;t work for.  </li>
            <li>All in all a decent purchase.</li>
            <li>I went back recently and ordered 2 more because the price had dropped $5.00 each.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok..not a &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; but decent.  </li>
            <li>so I ordered the sample size which is a decent size.</li>
            <li>Basically, they&#x27;re not thick but they&#x27;re not thin... just normal).</li>
            <li>so I could have decent looking lashes.</li>
            <li>It goes on thick and lush, doesn&#x27;t smear, doesn&#x27;t flake, and is a good price.</li>
            <li>But we wear it because we want beautiful, long, thick</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little gloopy at first, so I use an eyelash comb to easily catch any globs.</li>
            <li>but it still washes off very easily with water and a little eye-makeup remover!</li>
            <li>Short lashes become long and strong!</li>
            <li>It did provide some length but didn&#x27;t have the wow factor I was expecting from all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>but once a day and NO black eyes at the end of the day!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to apply because it makes my lashes look extra long and huge.  </li>
            <li>So then I try to layer a bit more on to create some depth, and it just sticks and clumps on my lashes, making a bit of a mess.</li>
            <li>This mascara was true to the reviews and it is now my new daily mascara.</li>
            <li>It was supposed to be the greatest mascara ever, but it was a little dry and not very lengthening or volumizing.  </li>
            <li>This mascara gives a natural long lash look and is easy to remove with soap &amp; water so I recommend it.</li>

            <li>I really wanted to like this mascara because of all the great reviews, but alas this did nothing for my straight asian lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried drugstore brands to high end department store brands.  </li>
            <li>It has replaced all my fancy high end mascaras.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Highly Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>For everyone else, I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you are looking for a lengthening mascara.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>You can tell it is high quality</li>
            <li>I work in a high pace environment and</li>
            <li>Amazon users rated it highly and so did Makeup Alley.</li>
            <li>This one passes the test and I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I rarely buy makeup and/or skincare twice since I am constantly buying new things and trying so much</li>
            <li>While this is my new favorite mascara, this last tube seemed a bit different.</li>
            <li>No need to try others, this creates clean, long lashes.</li>
            <li>The second coat with the other brands go on nicely and make my lashes pop.</li>
            <li>The only other issue is when you wash it off it gets kind of clumpy under your eyes.  </li>
            <li>It has a wet kind of gel quality that builds and doesn&#x27;t dry too fast so that you can build up volume and length.</li>
            <li>If your lashes are naturally curled, you would probably like it (as the many other 5-star reviewers do).</li>
            <li>and I thought I&#x27;d splurge on a little bit more high end mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not waterproof but it does take a little more than water to get it off.</li>
            <li>When I came out of the water my mascara looked the same exact way it did as when I went in!</li>
            <li>The product is ok, but it&#x27;s a little too liquidy for my liking.</li>
            <li>I like this mascara, but wish it added a little more volume.</li>
            <li>It can be a little clumpy, but it&#x27;s not awful.</li>
            <li>I got my first sample of this mascara in my Ipsy bag, and there is just no other mascara like</li>
            <li>Once I tried it I fell a little bit in love.</li>
            <li>I was expecting big things from this mascara after all the rave reviews on Amazon, but after using it for the first time today, I wasn&#x27;t as wowed as I hoped!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The not so good:&lt;br /&gt;It went on a little clumpy; I had to manually separate out some of my top lashes after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The price is a little more then I would like to spend on mascara</li>
            <li>I like Nutrogena&#x27;s wand a little better</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews are a little gushy and over the top.</li>
            <li>You think they&#x27;re all basically the same, but this one does exactly what it&#x27;s name states!</li>
            <li>It stays looking nice the WHOLE DAY long, and I can&#x27;t say that about other mascaras I have used.</li>
            <li>It is fine - not sure it is worth $20.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wear or smudge, and I&#x27;ve tested it on several long and warm days so far; but it comes off easily with coconut oil and my regular facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply, I don&#x27;t need 5 coats like other brands,</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t run and washes off easier than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>trust me during summer, you want this because it stays on like water proof, but it comes off easy like any other mascara.</li>
            <li>It easily adds volume and length to your curls, although not to an extreme extent.</li>
            <li>Some of my other favorites went on well but had a strong chemical odor.</li>
            <li>I have normal to long eyelashes, but I like them to look full and vibrant and this product does the trick.</li>
            <li>Really like it very much and have bought several for gifts.  </li>
            <li>I really like how this product goes on overall; but found it hard to get a good amount of it on.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay attention to the bad reviews, this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>not thick or clumpy.</li>
            <li>My lashes are defined,  soft,  volumizing,  I really gave it a test yesterday and put it on before my workout.  </li>
            <li>I just (sadly) ran out of my discontinued Lash Length mascara by Mary Kay and decided to buy this because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Lancôme is too expensive for what you get, and with Great Lash, you get what you pay for (which includes lots of flaking/smudging).  </li>
            <li>About two years ago my usual brand of mascara was discontinued and had still not found a suitable replacement when a sample of this arrived in my ipsy bag.</li>
            <li>The wand is also great for lengthening and doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look weird and spidery or clumpy, like some mascaras will do.</li>
            <li>It really gives NATURAL looking volume to skimpy lashes.</li>
            <li>I do like the fact that it is not thick and clumpy.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be my dream mascara after all the great reviews, but it seems some of us have the wrong lashes or something.</li>
            <li>I have tried almost every brand of mascara my whole adult life trying to find one that doesn&#x27;t result in racoon eyes.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews, I expected fantastic eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>makes my lashes appear MUCH longer, but still natural and not clumpy.  </li>
            <li>I have spent more than 30 years and no telling how much money seeking my HG mascara and have finally found it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used (and liked) benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;bad gal lash&amp;#34; and lately a mascara from Elizabeth Arden, but I don&#x27;t care for this mascara at all.  </li>
            <li>this mascara makes them look full and long.  </li>
            <li>It is still worth the $20 price-tag simply because it doesn&#x27;t flake off!</li>
            <li>Also, makes lashes look full and long.  </li>
            <li>I was having difficulties finding a mascara that was  making my lashes look long and full.  </li>
            <li>I do need more than my usual gentle cleanser to remove</li>
            <li>Like others have said, the mascara is flaky and I&#x27;m not used to this, as my normal mascara doesn&#x27;t do this.</li>
            <li>It stays on and it doesn&#x27;t clump and it makes my lashes look long and full.</li>
            <li>I had full, long lashes until getting lash extensions.</li>
            <li>OK, as long as they are making It&#x27;s So BIG, I&#x27;ll be buying it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO many mascaras and there always seems to be one missing piece--</li>
            <li>First off, you dont feel this mascara your lashes stay soft and natural feeling</li>
            <li>for me, I will go back to my long standing favorite:  </li>
            <li>Full, long lashes without clumps and does not irritate.  </li>
            <li>like the way the brush &amp;#34;finds&amp;#34; all of my lashes and gets them all looking long and full.</li>
            <li>I find Loreal&#x27;s Voluminous mascara to actually perform better in the thickening department, but it did manage to stay on a long time.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t believe how full and long my lashes are.  </li>
            <li>I believe I bought this for $20... and the Urban Decay mascara is $22 - WELL worth the price.</li>
            <li>After curling my lashes as I normally did, I applied one coat of this mascara</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes look soooo long and full.</li>
            <li>It made them look long and full.</li>
            <li>I laugh at the picture on the box,which shows massive volume depending on the number of layers you use.</li>
            <li>My favorite everyday mascara...</li>
            <li>but it overall it was worth it.</li>
            <li>This definitely does not - the first one that I have found that really doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li>Washes off with my normal face cleanser or by the shampoo while taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can sleep in it and it&#x27;ll still look fresh the next morning.</li>
            <li>This is worth it big time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to my Clinique mascaras not leaving anything when I wash my face, but this is probably a normal occurrence.</li>
            <li>Gives me long, full lashes with no smudging or clumps.</li>
            <li>totally worth it, as it actually volumizes.  </li>
            <li>Great product, creates long thick lashes with no clumping.  </li>
            <li>I only wear mascara during the day - no liner or coverup, and I rarely take the time to wash my mascara off before I workout.</li>
            <li>And since my lashes are already long, when looking for a mascara I focus on volume and a nice consistency that is not too wet.</li>
            <li>Makes my eyelashes long and full.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the thick fiber-filled mascaras, this one would not be what you&#x27;re looking for; however, it stays on longer and thickens up nicely when you layer it on your lashes.</li>
            <li>It has a nice thick coat that separates and defines my lashes...</li>
            <li>It is a nice thick look, and resists clumping.</li>
            <li>For volume and lash separation with a good brush, I&#x27;m sticking with my Max Factor False Lash Effect mascara.</li>
            <li>I have always used drugstore mascaras and was a little hesitant to spend more than eight bucks to try something new out</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite mascara hands down!</li>
            <li>I was looking for something more dramatic like the L&#x27;oreal Paris Voluminous Original Mascara.</li>
            <li>no clumping, flaking or difficult removal, just awesome long lashes, a winner!</li>
            <li>This mascara has not only has a great glossy black finish, but it does not smudge even during a long workout at  gym.</li>
            <li>I have always looked for a long lasting, gentle and  easy to take off waterproof mascara</li>
            <li>Took a little while to get used to the unique shape of the brush, but now I really like it!</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical to buy sit since I never heard of this brand before and its price is comparable to other more popular ones.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have to worry about raccoon eyes after multiple dips in the ocean or pool; this mascara stays where it&#x27;s supposed to, yet comes off super easy with a little eye makeup remover at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It is only &amp;#34;BIG volumizing&amp;#34; when you wear several coats, but is does not smear and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>And the big bonus is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and I can just wipe it off with my regular face cleansing wipes at night easily.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you let it dry before adding multiple coats, otherwise you may get some lashes sticking together.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I&#x27;m finding that it doesn&#x27;t get too thick and dry towards the end of the supply like some mascaras do.  </li>
            <li>I also like that when you wash it off, it doesnt make big black smudges under your eyes, rather it just kind of chips away.</li>
            <li>Nice consistency to apply, not too dry to too wet.</li>
            <li>The wand is tapered in the middle, making it easy to reach the inner, and outer corners of your lashes.</li>
            <li>This mascara makes my lashes very full - I was hoping for slightly longer</li>
            <li>I do wish this mascara made my lashes look a little thicker and a little longer, but I already have pretty good lashes</li>
            <li>I like my lashes to look curled, separated, full, and long!</li>
            <li>It gives me full long lashes (not clumpy at all!)</li>
            <li>My thinning middle-aged lashes haven&#x27;t looked so full and long in years!</li>
            <li>My make up remover, and other, more traditional soaps/face washes remove it very well.  </li>
            <li>Everyone else says it slides right off, but I definitely do not have that experience.</li>
            <li>left &amp; right eyelashes had comparable volume and length.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I have long and full natural lashes, no curling or falsies!</li>
            <li>It was super clumpy and overpriced and I have long eyelashes</li>
            <li>You’re lashes look super long today”.</li>
            <li>Gives me long dark lashes :)!</li>
            <li>this technique gives me super long lashes.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are fine and grow in such a way that they tend to criss cross.</li>
            <li>Does a decent job of separating lashes, but I usually still use a lash comb to separate even more.</li>
            <li>It also washes off very cleanly and I appreciate not having to waste a lot of time with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>The cheap ones don&#x27;t show much difference and the bottle doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li>What I love: gives LONG, thick, clump free lashes and NO FLAKING AT ALL.</li>
            <li>the other reviews made it sound like it was some miracle mascara</li>
            <li>For the last 30 years I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal Lash Out and more recently L&#x27;Oreal Bare Naturale mascara, and nothing else.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and stays on throughout the day with absolutely no smudging!  </li>
            <li>I still try to use mascara, since it only makes my lashes appear even fuller and longer, but in general I can only apply a bit on the inside corners, mostly the bottom row.</li>
            <li>Other mascaras I&#x27;ve purchased from high- end make-up stores went on great but thought out the day I would get dark circles under my eyes (raccoon eyes) and was constantly having to wipe under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I think the Clinique High Impact Mascara works better, not sure if it is the brush.</li>
            <li>Comparable to high end mascaras that sell for the same price or higher.</li>
            <li>Although the goggles I wear are only the first defense against the high ninja winds, and my eyes do nothing</li>
            <li>Definitely my new go to mascara.</li>
            <li>and MAYBE it is just because this is a new tube.</li>
            <li>(Sometimes new mascaras need to be &amp;#34;broken-in&amp;#34; in my experience).  </li>
            <li>This is a new brand for me</li>
            <li>I assumed it was because of my new eye shadow.</li>
            <li>Even after I washed my face, I still had new flakes around my eye.  </li>
            <li>I ride horses all day, live in the pacific northwest where it rains ALOT, and no problem with&lt;br /&gt;it staying in place.  </li>
            <li>I have found my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new go to mascara.</li>
            <li>is my new mascara for life</li>
            <li>and I tried it and new</li>
            <li>My new mascara for life.</li>
            <li>My new mascara obsession.</li>
            <li>Brand new product.</li>
            <li>but I can live with that.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t even try any new mascaras I receive in my sample bags.</li>
            <li>I found my new mascara</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new mascara that would not clump, flake, or smear and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a new mascara that would&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the new product for quite awhile now, and even with age the mascara is not clumping--</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>I found a new mascara.</li>
            <li>I had heard about all the new lash extending mascaras</li>
            <li>Each time a new mascara would hit the market, I&#x27;d have to run out and get it ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to mascara &amp; will be recommending it to friends &amp; clients.</li>
            <li>I buy a new one every 12 weeks or so.</li>
            <li>Its hard to get more than 2 coats on because it dries so fast.</li>
            <li>There is no flaking or clumping and it makes my eyelashes look super long!</li>
            <li>Makes your lashes look super long and never clumps!</li>
            <li>to remove just by washing my face, which was nice - with my usual mascara (Sephora full action extreme effect), if I try to just wash it off it ends up smudging under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>rarely do I buy the same makeup twice because I am always looking to try something new, but I have gone through two tubes of this mascara so far</li>
            <li>In the last year, I have been only using samples  to try out every higher end brand to find the right one.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended...works better than the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried also!  </li>
            <li>It was okay, but clumped a HUGE amount and was extremely difficult to remove.</li>
            <li>It removes easily in the shower and doesn&#x27;t leave any black under my eyes after the shower.</li>
            <li>Lashes are fuller longer thicker without smudging and easy to remove  without irritation or black eye look</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave black circles under my eyes but it comes off easily with just water (just like the description said).</li>
            <li>My previous Almay mascara was not as length-extending but it also didn&#x27;t smudge, came off easily and cost $10 max.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many brands of mascara, from cheap to expensive</li>
            <li>in all, I would say this mascara would be good for someone who does not want anything dramatic at all.</li>
            <li>It makes my tiny eyelashes be more noticeable with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>I can tell you I&#x27;ve spent way more money on high-end mascara that doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to So BIG.</li>
            <li>despite its staying power, it comes off completely with just regular eye-makeup remover - no racoon eyes in the morning, when we start fresh.</li>
            <li>The mascara is nice, but Seriously?  </li>
            <li>This mascara gives you full, long lashes that look natural.</li>
            <li>Also, it must dry quickly because I never have any stray marks after I am done applying it.</li>
            <li>which really helps define those tiny lashes you don&#x27;t get at with a straight wand.</li>
            <li>My lashes look long naturally not &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34; I also love the brush because of its shape it catches the end of my lashes and extends them evenly with the rest of my lashes.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more on base all good reviews .</li>
            <li>I loved the lengthening effects of They&#x27;re Real, but it was prone to flaking and was difficult to remove at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Good to use as a base coat before your favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky on my mascara and am always in the search of something good but not too expensive and this hit the mark.  </li>
            <li>This is a good mascara if your lashes are thick and you need length only.</li>
            <li>My typical day consists of going to work, the gym, home and it stays on strong with no issues.</li>
            <li>I still use my 3D for date night or other special occasions, but I love this one for everyday use.</li>
            <li>No smudge, no flaking, makes lashes soooo long and really opens up your eyes!!  </li>
            <li>I wear contacts, have allergies and live in a hot climate and can really endorse this product as long wearing!  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes/skin and always need products that are hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>My eyes are also very sensitive but no irritation with this product occurred.</li>
            <li>This stays put all day and defines the lashes in a very natural way.  </li>
            <li>Looks very natural and not clumpy</li>
            <li>It does make your lashes look longer and very natural.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>The result is a very natural look, and it seems that my lashes are getting thicker since I&#x27;ve been using this.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive greasy eyes lids...</li>
            <li>Thank you very much, will definitely order again and also give as gifts.</li>
            <li>It has never irritated my eyes which is saying a lot as I have very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to those fibers that flake off and fall in my eye and blur my vision.</li>
            <li>Leaving a very natural but volume  lash.  </li>
            <li>Both look very natural.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive watery eyes</li>
            <li>Now, I don&#x27;t have very many or very thick lashes</li>
            <li>The company was kind enough to replace my first order within a few days after I emailed them about my problems, however there was no change in the second mascara I was sent.</li>
            <li>However, the description claims it easily washes off with water -- that is not true at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, no clumps, no goopy mess.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something different and always willing to try something new.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smart enough to be used for work and it is flirty enough to use for those fun nights.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super watery the consistency is loose and if you like the clumpy look</li>
            <li>Long lasting, does not smudge, easy to take off.</li>
            <li>Despite the long wear, it&#x27;s still easy to remove with a standard eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and makes the lashes long and big yet gives you a wispy look.</li>
            <li>If you wet a piece of toilet paper with warm water and gently pull your lashes with it, the mascara slides right off in a sort of goo that you can roll into a little ball and throw away</li>
            <li>This is the first mascara I&#x27;ve used that makes my lashes look several times longer and thicker WITHOUT the too-often typical unevenness and clumping that I&#x27;ve experienced with other (lesser) mascaras.</li>
            <li>I apply 2 coats to my lashes in the morning and done - huge lashes for the rest of the day without any dark circles or flaking under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Great mascara, you won&#x27;t look like a panda if it gets wet because it comes out the whole thing as if it is a thin cover to your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I also judge a mascara on how hard it is to get off, and it comes off easy with my makeup remover, home run!  </li>
            <li>and I was leery of paying extra for something that wouldn&#x27;t necessarily work any better than my current mascara.  </li>
            <li>So when I first tried this product I thought it worked well, but didn&#x27;t see how it was any different than cover girl lash blast.</li>
            <li>the product in general didn&#x27;t produce much thickness.</li>
            <li>I can soak it with a hot wash cloth for a minute and only a smidge comes off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty low maintenance</li>
            <li>No smudging or flaking so far!</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t spend more than 10$ on mascara</li>
            <li>This is the first mascara that actually stays on me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s So Big and tried it yesterday for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Love the mascara, and will totally have to try out the other products from this company.</li>
            <li>--with most other brands I feel like I am constantly wiping underneath my eyes with my fingers.  </li>
            <li>This product adds WOW!  </li>
            <li>Most mascaras claim to do both, but usually lack in one way or another.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a busy woman always go, go, go!</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t clump or flake, so the lashes appear dark, smooth, well-defined.</li>
            <li>Was hesitant to buy, as it seems as though when I get samples, they far outshine the normal sized product.  </li>
            <li>I have finally found a mascara that I really like!  </li>
            <li>Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara first came to me by way of my Ipsy Bag.  </li>
            <li>Looks the same as when I first put it on this morning.</li>
            <li>Always searching for a mascara that lasts all day with the same volume as when first applied.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price, and one tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>They are average length and light.  </li>
            <li>Based on the reviews, I thought I was going to be impressed with the lack of clumpy, gross-looking lashes, but I was actually fairly disappointed.</li>
            <li>so it does make you look like you have more eyelashes than usual.</li>
            <li>This worlds better than some of the designer exspensive ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>OH WOW!</li>
            <li>This is the first mascara I have used that actually did what it said!</li>
            <li>I have never spent this much money on mascara</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate my contacts and when I forgot to take it off my eyes weren&#x27;t all goopy (happened with an all natural mascara!).</li>
            <li>use Physicians Formula organic mascara first for fullness and then immediately add the Its So BIG on the tips for length.&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Might need to order another tube as my 16 year old daughter keeps taking it!</li>
            <li>by far!</li>
            <li>Here is my mascara background: not sure why, but most eye products smear and smudge on me.</li>
            <li>Goes a long way and is well worth the $20.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, to me, no smudging!</li>
            <li>a miracle worker, the magic mascara for eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;Women look no more</li>
            <li>I guess my truthful answer is I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li>I only need one coat to get the look I want, where other mascaras need about three or more.</li>
            <li>I first received It&#x27;s So BIG mascara as a bonus item with another mascara that I ordered.</li>
            <li>I know to get the most out of this product, but every time I&#x27;ve used it I look like I forgot to put on mascara, and end up putting my usual mascara over it.  </li>
            <li>I officially get to stay pretty while sweating it up with clients in the back country of Alaska.  </li>
            <li>This is the first mascara that I have ever used that causes no irritation and stays where it belongs (on my eyelashes only!)</li>
            <li>This mascara is so much better than the ones I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>definitely curl your lashes first.  </li>
            <li>They were lifted a bit higher, but if you use a curler before you put the Stiletto on, you will get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>I, like many others, have scan the endless types of mascaras in places like Target trying to decide which one will FINALLY be the one for my eyelashes...</li>
            <li>Have searched and searched for good mascara and still searching!! :(</li>
            <li>I have short lashes and this mascara is EXACTLY what I needed.</li>
            <li>I have tried more mascaras in the past six months than I care to admit.  </li>
            <li>I will prob not order again just due to the type of eyelashes I have and will stick to Better Than Sex, which is the brand I currently use.</li>
            <li>Okay so I bought this mascara after reading the reviews however I am not really in love with mascara.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive than drug store brands but totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>I have purchased my second tube (my first would have lasted longer</li>
            <li>It smelled like really old mascara!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already placed a second order for this mascara, so I&#x27;ll have it when it&#x27;s time to replace the first one I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive it based on all the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes, for the first time in 20 years, are back!</li>
            <li>This mascara is so soft!  </li>
            <li>And it looks so natural, not clumpy at all!</li>
            <li>After reading the other reviews, I was excited to try this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Any definition they may have had from my curler was done seeing as how facial steam in my goggles straightened them but the volume on the lashes themselves was as they were when first applied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect 2 coats for casual look but easily builable for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily with little clumping.  </li>
            <li>The little clumping that sometimes occurs when applying it is easily remedied with a Qtip.</li>
            <li>it- goes on easily, gives volume and little bit of length without clumping.</li>
            <li>Easily removed with a little coconut oil before I wash my face at night.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing mascara on a dry day in a less than 50% humidity climate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m rather frugal (read: cheap) and am in no way let down by this mascara.  </li>
            <li>To keep it short and sweet, I am ALWAYS on the lookout for a new mascara, but now that I found this one I am never going back.</li>
            <li>However, in order to get volume you have apply many layers, which ends up getting very messy and clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are: no smudging/flaking, contact friendly, dark black color, able to create moderate to high drama, and preferably comes off with soap and water.</li>
            <li>I am always trying new mascara to make my natural lashes look longer and fuller.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for the right mascara for a long time...</li>
            <li>I was hoping I could find something that I liked more and was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to my trusty Loreal, which makes my lashes look great for less than half the price of this stuff...</li>
            <li>If I lightly rub my eye it leaves a lot of black &amp;#34;crumbs&amp;#34; on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I am going back to my cheap one because it doesn&#x27;t clump and it makes my already long lashes even longer.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, no clumps, it doesn&#x27;t straighten my just curled lashes, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; leaving me with raccoon eyes, it washes off easily.</li>
            <li>Looks pretty natural overall.</li>
            <li>overall, voluminous make the lashes thicker, and its so big makes them longer but not as full.</li>
            <li>I have short straight lashes and by brushing them up, without a curler, my lashes look five times their normal size.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are exceptionally long, and I have spent many years looking for mascara that does not give me raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of the few women that have lots of nice, long lashes... except when I put this garbage on it</li>
            <li>I was looking for an alternative to buying Smashbox Full Exposure, which is slightly more expensive, but</li>
            <li>I have fairly full eyelashes, I end up plucking a few in the corner because they tend to tangle no matter how much I curl or shape them.</li>
            <li>The product lengthens my lashes beautifully and doesn&#x27;t feel thick or too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I came across this mascara on Amazon and decided to give it a try, based on the numerous positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seriously have tried 20 different mascaras ranging from cheap to expensive and I have to say this is the BEST!</li>
            <li>In the case of this mascara I think that maybe you have a large pool of 5 star reviewers that are just hitting the market place &amp; really haven&#x27;t been test-driving mascara&#x27;s for long enough to REALLY know when they&#x27;ve found one of the &amp;#34;Greats&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Most mascaras irritate me like crazy after a full days wear, but not this beauty!</li>
            <li>So this is by far one of my favorites out there I&#x27;ve bought as far as mascara goes in a longggg time!</li>
            <li>product is probably great for people that already have thick, long lashes, &amp; need a mascara that will last all day.</li>
            <li>It also comes off easily for me with a few rounds of soap and water (In flakes, not black smears, yay!).  </li>
            <li>My lashes don&#x27;t necessarily feel more voluminous, but they do appear much longer than usual</li>
            <li>spin brush as you coat your lashes for a full wide eyed look!</li>
            <li>I used up the small sample which actually did last me for a  good amount of time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not bad - just not as life changing as some of the other reviews seem to claim.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mascara itself is more dry feeling, rather than wet which</li>
            <li>I have been on what seems to be an impossible search for the perfect daily wear mascara.</li>
            <li>It really makes your eye lashes look thick and it&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>
            <li>It dried quickly, which I appreciated.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very black, it lengthens your lashes and comes off easily with make-up remover.</li>
            <li>No flaking, drooping or smudging no matter how sweaty the workout, how long the work day or how many endless flights I&#x27;ve been on.</li>
            <li>You can put on less for a more natural look, or vamp it up with extra coats.</li>
            <li>The only drawback to me is that it doesn&#x27;t wash off as easily with regular facial cleanser or soap and water as some brands.  </li>
            <li>It does not clump, it is easy to apply and goes on very very very black.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay but not nearly as volumizing as other mascaras I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Many other brands go on smooth at first, but start to dry out and clump after only a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so incredibly easy to clean off with no black sludge left on my face like other more expensive mascaras.</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara&amp;#34; again,</li>
            <li>This Elizabeth Mott mascara, however, goes on smooth and lasts all day, with little to no undereye smudge.</li>
            <li>Multiple coats makes them thicker, bolder, and more dramatic for night / special occasions.</li>
            <li>It separates my lashes so nicely and within a few coats (let the lashes dry in between each coat), my lashes are longer than ever almost like I&#x27;m wearing falsies!</li>
            <li>It is very goopy at first and is hard to clean the brush off enough to even apply it.  </li>
            <li>You have to use make up removeror work a little harder with the wash and warm water to get it off</li>
            <li>My problem is that I want more fullness and this product helps a little bit&lt;br /&gt;But enough.</li>
            <li>If you dare to try to put on more than one coat, your lashes look like gross little insect legs.  </li>
            <li>Find it a little clumpy, but overall satisfied.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m 42, so my eyelids are starting to droop a little and sometimes touch my top lashes.  </li>
            <li>Gave this a 4 star because it is a pretty decent mascara, though there are similar ones for a lesser cost, that is why I did not do a 5 star.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard time being able to take the mascara off my lashes once it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li>No black eyes or smudging!</li>
            <li>Still love the formula, but the brush IS hard to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super goopey, clumpy, and gets on my eyelid every time it apply it, no matter how careful I am!</li>
            <li>Quick easy application thick long eyebrows.</li>
            <li>My lashes look long and beautiful but at the same time are not overly stiff and dry.</li>
            <li>Yes, a few little flakes, but overall it still looked great.</li>
            <li>This product easily compares to the other midpriced prestige brands of makeup out there that are around the same price.  </li>
            <li>Just started using this product - easy to apply, no big clumps like other volumizing mascaras that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Very average product for a huge price.  </li>
            <li>I did find it seems to dry out a little rather quickly, but I just add a couple of drops of water (did that with my prior mascaras as well) and it rehydrates and applies easily.</li>
            <li>It has been over a week and is just beginning to clear up.</li>
            <li>(Clearly you are too, or you wouldn&#x27;t be reading the reviews.)</li>
            <li>I was pretty disappointed after using this mascara a few times, especially after reading so many great reviews.</li>
            <li>I am a resident doctor in a busy county hospital.  </li>
            <li>I tried, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; mascara with doupts and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This is the only mascara that really delivers.</li>
            <li>but it seems to have strengthened my natural eyelashes and made them a bit thicker.  </li>
            <li>This product is natural, but does not compromise quality.</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I like the soft bristle brush and the hourglass shape.</li>
            <li>Several coats did not lengthen my lashes as much as a couple swipes with my Revlon mascara.</li>
            <li>I got this in an Ipsy glam bag, I used it completely...</li>
            <li>I wish it was darker, but its all natural and does leave mine longer looking.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>With Benefit They&#x27;re Real, you definitely get volume, but also tons of clumping...</li>
            <li>and my lashes are soft to touch.</li>
            <li>I like a natural look that the mascara gives as the brush grabs all my lashes and separates &amp; extends them in one brush stroke.</li>
            <li>(20hrs so far) nor give you the &amp;#34;racoon eye&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this mascara a week so far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one that really makes my short nonexistent eyelashes long and full.</li>
            <li>I really struggled with shelling out twenty bucks for mascara, but I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 2.5 months without any signs of it drying out yet.</li>
            <li>I put my old $6 Mabelline Mega Plush Waterproof on one eye</li>
            <li>I have lashes that look Wow with ysl mascara .</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t go far as to say &amp;#34;Its</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My eyes and skin are sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>My search has ended, my journey is complete.</li>
            <li>and i have had eyelash extensions which ruined some of my natural lashes on both sides.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t bother my sensitive eyes, either.</li>
            <li>the only reason I am not giving it a 5 star rating is because while it really is sweat, oily skin, smudge, etc proof, it is not water proof.  </li>
            <li>I use an old wand to comb through my lashes after I use this.</li>
            <li>but so far I like the way this one works and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so it looks natural and it lengthens.  </li>
            <li>I have short lashes and it makes them look much longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot</li>
            <li>It really extends the length of my lashes and make my eyes look bigger.</li>
            <li>It is long wearing and very volumizing!</li>
            <li>This one marked off all of the boxes.  </li>
            <li>The result when applied is natural looking, fuller, longer lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a mascara that will really make my lashes stand out, and I&#x27;ve finally found it.</li>
            <li>but not when I am wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am cursed with ultra-blonde (nearly invisible) lower lashes, and have always had a problem showing them off.</li>
            <li>One pro about this mascara is it never irritated my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I have short eyelashes and really struggle with mascaras.  </li>
            <li>I also have sensitive eyes and have had to return mascaras because my eyes were running like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The company that makes this offers samples to try.</li>
            <li>If you want a natural look, 2 coats.</li>
            <li>NOT waste $20.00.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like your mascara, especially the brush that &#x27;grabs&#x27; the lashes and separates them,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>old woman, I have used lots of products in my lifetime.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Rather, when I rub it off in the shower, it comes off in soft pieces, sort of like Blinc&#x27;s \\&quot;lash tubes\\</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>It makes my blonde eyelashes really stand out,</li>
            <li>I curl my lashes and use this mascara, they slowly go back to being mostly straight again while the product is drying.  :</li>
            <li>But the second time I used it I realized how my eyelashes looked really really</li>
            <li>I have straight Asian lashes</li>
            <li>but so far it blows everything else out of the water.</li>
            <li>Lengthens without clumping, boosts appearance while still looking natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with my old brands.</li>
            <li>Lashes look naturally fuller.</li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to a drug store (or even a high end) brand after using this!  </li>
            <li>this mascara has helped while my real eyelashes grow back.</li>
            <li>I have very sparse short eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>This stuff gives you length, volume, makes your lashes seem soft and it doesn&#x27;t smidge.</li>
            <li>It just looks natural.</li>
            <li>I wear two coats of it almost every day and have had it for 5 months now, and it has yet to run out or get old or anything.</li>
            <li>Makes the lashes look natural, instead of looking like caked on mascara.  </li>
            <li>The product was not anywhere near my expectations.</li>
            <li>I must say I was surprised at how well</li>
            <li>maybe slightly old?</li>
            <li>This mascara does not irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>i was very pleasantly surprised with this product.</li>
            <li>Sixty two years old with thinning eyelashes.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not any flaking, and it&#x27;s waterproof as far as can tell.  </li>
            <li>i take it that they were old products.  </li>
            <li>If you have short lashes and are looking for something to lengthen them, absolutely go for this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I am only giving a 4 star rating because the liquid forms clumps and it gets very sticky at the end of the brush.</li>
            <li>It makes my teeny tiny lashes appear much fuller and longer.  </li>
            <li>natural lashes are noticeably shorter and thinner since using this mascara..</li>
            <li>this by far is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>and it still gives considerable volume and length.  </li>
            <li>I even went as far as to swap out the supplied brush for an old fav of mine.</li>
            <li>I wanted a mascara that would lengthen and accentuate my natural lashes.  </li>
            <li>it glides on, extends lashes in a natural way and does not clump.</li>
            <li>But all that is tertiary to the facts that (1) it doesn&#x27;t clump AT ALL and (2) IT STAYS SOFT.</li>
            <li>I am a professional gal on the go</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and cannot wear waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li>(by like 9A)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that - the seller - took a real interest in emailing me as to how I like the Product.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My eyes are sensitive to everything</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a born redhead with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It looks professional, but not overdone.</li>
            <li>More recently, I decided I was not happy with the look of tubing mascara, since it is not very buildable, and I wanted more drama.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>lashes are fairly straight and this lets me apply enough to make them turn up and plump</li>
            <li>Probably would try something else when I run out completely.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes at all.</li>
            <li>, it is straight and simple.</li>
            <li>Happily surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve begun using this mascara, exclusively,  because it makes my lashes come alive and there is no irritation.</li>
            <li>The second thing is that it really layers - this is almost a con for me though.</li>
            <li>I can actually bat my eyelashes like a cartoon character because there is so much to bat.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>Really builds big lashes that does not flake.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I have sensitive eyes, so this doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit.</li>
            <li>It gives natural length and volume.</li>
            <li>Look natural.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t damaged my natural lashes at all.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it didn&#x27;t seem to add as much volume to my lashes as I would have thought.</li>
            <li>maybe I got an old tube?</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the best way I can describe it so it may not seem heavy enough or thick enough for some people.  </li>
            <li>but I felt they weren&#x27;t really doing anything to make my eyelashes look different.</li>
            <li>It also lasts longer than some of it&#x27;s more expensive competitors, I would say daily use will last 3 weeks or more.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal really, but I wish it did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not left with raccoon eyes either, which is a real plus.  </li>
            <li>The mascara separates and lengthens my lashes and still soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because they really have something with the shape of the wand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over 50 and a healthcare professional</li>
            <li>and it really GOES give you a completely different look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I pitched my old crappy mascara when I got home</li>
            <li>It gives a lush look without heaviness or clumping.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>Does not flake or bother my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by that.  </li>
            <li>This mascara creates a natural look for daytime and two coats at night a bolder, but still natural look.</li>
            <li>I am 48 years old.</li>
            <li>and it makes my old lashes look young again.</li>
            <li>The hourglass shaped wand curls your lashes naturally and</li>
            <li>No smudging or running so far.</li>
            <li>It does not clump or flake and the color is not harsh.  </li>
            <li>Could not get the product off fast enough.</li>
            <li>During a busy period of my life, I decided to order online because I didn&#x27;t have time to trek downtown to buy make-up.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll do it the next day when I&#x27;m getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>As far as lengthening goes, it makes the tips looked ragged; as if someone came after my lashes with a chainsaw.</li>
            <li>Holy wow.</li>
            <li>There were no crying babies - no forest animals ran for the hills.</li>
            <li>My adult daughter also purchased</li>
            <li>So far... I like it.</li>
            <li>Gives me natural lashes and stays there all day.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the volume this mascara added to my lashes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get all &amp;#34;schmeery&amp;#34; when removed, it wipes off completely.</li>
            <li>First mascara i could actually see on my barely visible lashes.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff, there are better mascaras at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous mascaras and have wasted money on many.  </li>
            <li>As long as this tried and true formula remains the same, I&#x27;ll be an Elizabeth Mott mascara user forever!</li>
            <li>My lashes look more naturally dark and long.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s plenty to last a few more weeks</li>
            <li>On day one I was not happy with it, but each mascara has it&#x27;s own technique for obtaining the desired look.  </li>
            <li>the delivery went well, the product was good but too expensive for just a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; mascara.</li>
            <li>After all the good reviews I thought I would give it a try &amp; sorry to say</li>
            <li>Whether you have the same mascara issue as I, or you&#x27;re just looking for a great &#x27;false lash look&#x27;, this mascara WILL do the trick!</li>
            <li>I always get compliments on my eyelashes when I wear this, makes them look like fake in a good way.</li>
            <li>but I prefer the brush to men more in volume or thick.</li>
            <li>I did find the best way to apply it is to put on a base coat of any mascara and then apply this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little difficult to get off, but overall this is my favorite and most used mascara, and the midline price is just right.</li>
            <li>I have tried all big name brands and by far this one exceeds them!!!</li>
            <li>I ordered this mascara because I try to buy Cruelty Free makeup only , and that&#x27;s becoming increasingly difficult, as many previously lines that don&#x27;t test on animals or use animal products in the makeup have either changed their policies or have been bought out by bigger companies that do!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, it makes my eyelashes very long and is a long last formula.</li>
            <li>in pic #1: looking at the photo from where you are, the eye on the right side of the photo is voluminous and the left is its so big.</li>
            <li>I actually stopped wearing eye shadow because this mascara makes my lashes look full and very long.  </li>
            <li>I love this Mascara, I typically don&#x27;t leave reviews, and I have quite long lashes already</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump, lengthens, and is a nice dark black.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is a nice, dark black that adds length and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Finally a mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump or flake and still washes away with normal face soap!  </li>
            <li>After 10 million tubes purchased and too many decades to count, no more raccoon eyes!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mean I have sparse eyebrows like most girls who say they have none do....</li>
            <li>It goes on so light , but makes my lashes look so full and thick!!</li>
            <li>I have spent lots of money trying to find the right mascara.  </li>
            <li>i figured every mascara would just leave my lashes clumped together and looking less than full.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t plan on ever switching back to anything else and will be a loyal customer for a long time!</li>
            <li>This mascara is much nicer than many of the more expensive clinique and elizabeth arden products I&#x27;ve bought in the past.  </li>
            <li>I usually purchase Clinique high impact at the Clinique counter, but was lazy and thought I would try this because of comparable price and good ratings.  </li>
            <li>Brands are pretty limited.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is not paraben free so that is the only negative.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money, and unexpectedly so since I usually don&#x27;t spend much money on mascara.</li>
            <li>I have tried them all from high end brands, Japanese versions, fiber ones and even spa developed ones and Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s &amp;#34;Its</li>
            <li>I have very straight eyelashes that are on the short side and am always on the hunt for a mascara that adds volume and length without clumping, flaking or smudging - it HAS to last all day.  </li>
            <li>I will like a few things about a product but inevitably it will let me down in some other way sending me back on the hunt for the perfect item.</li>
            <li>If you have thicker lashes, just don&#x27;t apply as much or if you want really long, dramatic lashes, this is perfect with a few extra strokes of mascara!</li>
            <li>You have to apply a few coats to get the volume you want which is good because if you just want a natural look you only do a few, you want a more dramatic look apply a few more.</li>
            <li>I switched to this recently and its even BETTER than the big brands and less costly.</li>
            <li>Can I say seriously one more time?</li>
            <li>I have small, fine eyelashes and this mascara</li>
            <li>Big help for my short, straight lashes!  </li>
            <li>as I&#x27;ve gotten older the lines around my eyes (I&#x27;m 45) have gotten such that I don&#x27;t like to wear powder on face cause it cakes into the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It is the first traditional mascara I have used that doesn&#x27;t cause smudging and my lashes are big and noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different mascaras in the past, even ones with brand names and stuff, but nothing EVER came close to this.</li>
            <li>so the day has dwindled by... its so big looks exactly the same and still has it length while voluminous has flaked off and lost a lot of definition.</li>
            <li>I have decent lashes as it is, but rely on mascara and different application techniques to enhance them.</li>
            <li>I recently moved to Arizona, and first want to say this mascara does not melt in the heat or get in my eyes when I sweat, which is a big plus!</li>
            <li>Everything seemed to flake, run out quickly, and give me &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; after half a day.</li>
            <li>I usually end up getting it on my upper eyelids but this offered more control when applying.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, this product works for  many but not me:(</li>
            <li>It is on the expensive side though, don&#x27;t know if it is really worth 19 bucks, you can probably get a drugstore brand just as good for about 10 bucks less.</li>
            <li>It washes off easily with a facial cleanser (I use Cetaphil or Cerave) and comes off in little clumps.</li>
            <li>And if that weren&#x27;t enough, it&#x27;s also easy to take off with just a little cleanser.</li>
            <li>When I go to stores like Target and see mascara is $7, it always seems a little pricy, especially since it rubs off easily throughout the day.</li>
            <li>By the time I applied it to the other eye, the first eye was ready for a second coat.</li>
            <li>Not worth 20$ stick to their real by benifit !!</li>
            <li>A little clumpy, but not bad.</li>
            <li>All the other 5 star reviewers are right:  </li>
            <li>there, high and low end</li>
            <li>No specks or flacks on my face, even during high activity during the entire day and evening.</li>
            <li>Nothing is different between this and the others I got from drug stores except the high price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently used cheap mascara, as well as more expensive Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I had used the same high end product for years before trying Elizabeth Mott mascara.</li>
            <li>I bought this mascara because of the insanely high reviews and moderate price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love it for everyday use, it doesn&#x27;t smear or crumble under my long lower lashes and it goes on even and not clumply!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many of different brands of mascara and with long natural lashes, my mascara always flakes off or runs down.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to have to use a special makeup remover to take off my mascara, and I don&#x27;t want to use something with harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m spoiled with this and can&#x27;t use no other!</li>
            <li>I will say it doesn&#x27;t seem to clump, and it may give you a little more length, but definitely not big volume (even after several coats).</li>
            <li>not what i expected, L&#x27;ORÉAL Voluminous Volume Building Mascara does a better job for less money</li>
            <li>It was at least $10 less than what I paid for the Younique fiber stuff and just as good.  </li>
            <li>I really like that it does not flake off or melt after a long day</li>
            <li>In addition to living in a very humid climate, I have oily skin and long eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I have long lashes to begin with, so it doesn&#x27;t take much for me to boost them.</li>
            <li>It’s a long story – Very smitten with it.  </li>
            <li>and though I still love it, my only complaint is that I think the opening of the full size tube is too wide for the brush (which is the same size as the brush that came with the sample)</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t figured out why this is the ONLY mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge or leave a mess, yet looks fantastic...</li>
            <li>Not wet, but soft.</li>
            <li>I find wet mascaras tend to make more of a mess when applying</li>
            <li>no smudging, no dark circles, no residue.</li>
            <li>I have no dark smudge&#x27;s or anything.</li>
            <li>Ok so I&#x27;m somewhat obsessed with having full and long lashes.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes my lashes look normal</li>
            <li>but it is not even worth the $5 for an average mascara.  </li>
            <li>So, what I&#x27;m doing is using my normal waterproof volumizing mascara on my upper lashes and this on my lower.  </li>
            <li>And it comes off with my normal face cleaning routine, so no extra steps removing mascara.</li>
            <li>I do not have that issue with my normal mascara, with the same level of cleaning.</li>
            <li>I would say it is more of an everyday mascara to open up your eyes and will not leave residue above or below the eye-</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few days of wearing it, I decided to go ahead and buy the full sized product.</li>
            <li>Not only that, it truly does come off incredibly easily with plain soap and water.</li>
            <li>Before trying this mascara I felt like I sort of had to pick between a more subtle, daytime mascara and a more dramatic volumizing mascara, but with this mascara I can wear one or two coats for a softer look, or really layer it for extra volume without clumping or spidery lashes.</li>
            <li>It is a touch harder to wash off, but if you gently glide your lashes between your fingers once your lashes are wet, the stuff comes right off.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin, blond lashes and this product gives me the length and thickness that I&#x27;ve been searching for.</li>
            <li>Brush leaves mascara application a little thin but the consistency is great</li>
            <li>… Also it’s a little cheaper on Amazon, I think my friend spent about $12 more buying from someone</li>
            <li>I have tried every drug store brand of mascara and was hoping that if I spent a little bit more and trusted in the amazon reviews that I would find a product that was truly volumizing.</li>
            <li>I used to buy Loreal mascaras, but will definitely stay with this new one.</li>
            <li>Well, my last mascara was at the end of its life, so it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to see what new products come out in the future!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara, but I was sceptical that it could really live up to all of the glowing reviews.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have very long lashes (I am half-asian) and had to put a couple coats for it to look like much.</li>
            <li>The free sample wand worked better, so perhaps I got a bad one?</li>
            <li>very lumpy and dry.</li>
            <li>As a professional makeup artist, I have tried TONS of different types of mascara, this one is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For some strange reason the second didn&#x27;t seem like the first tube that I ordered.</li>
            <li>This mascara has worked so well for me, after losing all my eyelashes and having them grow back substantially thinner and shorter, I am finally back to complaining that my lashes are hitting my sunglasses again, thanks to this mascara.</li>
            <li>This mascara definitely adds length to lashes, however it doesnt really add volume for me personally.</li>
            <li>But of course, I think that the iconic pink tube mascara with the green tube is overrated too.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, only complaint is the price tag of $20/tube..</li>
            <li>I received a trial size in a beauty box and figured it would never beat my favorite pink and green tube.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying several mascaras lately, as I&#x27;ve found that many tend to flake or smudge off through the day.  </li>
            <li>You can definitely apply to your desired thickness and length, but I prefer natural looking as I work in a professional surroundings.</li>
            <li>I really like it, but I find that I can only use it when I go out because I do a lot of baking in my home and every time I open the oven door</li>
            <li>I tried again on the second day with multiple coats and curling my lashes and it clumped them up but didn&#x27;t really voluminize or lengthen my lashes.</li>
            <li>Your lashes really do get noticeably bigger with repeated applications, although for me, one application is plenty for daily use.</li>
            <li>I can easily put on one coat for a natural look or a few more for a bolder look without it looking fake.</li>
            <li>Overall a nice mascara, but the tube can be frustrating.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge in humidity of Hawaii, comes off easily with soap and water or facial cleansing wipes, doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes or contacts, can apply natural look or lush thick lashes.</li>
            <li>The brush is also designed for getting right down to the root of the lashes.</li>
            <li>This mascara isn&#x27;t necessarily &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; but stays on fantastically all day even when my eyes water (they do that a lot-- very sensitive eyes)</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair in general, and my eyelashes are no exception.</li>
            <li>I was curious about this since the reviews are so positive.  </li>
            <li>So, from next to invisible to wow!</li>
            <li>I only wish I had been able to use it for the past 45 years!</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get a major volume with it</li>
            <li>This mascara lengthens my lashes like no other</li>
            <li>I like the mascara as ordinary one, can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better than standard loreal or similar brand.</li>
            <li>I work long, long days (and nights sometimes) and most mascaras tend to smudge under my eyes and leave me with dark circles.  </li>
            <li>Even with just one coat I can tell a major difference.</li>
            <li>I only wear waterproof mascaras, but lately, most of mine have been running a bit under my eyes - possibly due to my sunscreen, but I won&#x27;t forgo sunscreen, so thought I&#x27;d experiment w/ other mascaras.  </li>
            <li>This met all my demands, no other mascara has.  </li>
            <li>It is more expensive than other mascaras, but it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>It is dark black, which I love.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara, lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t get clumpy!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taken me over 40 years of experimenting with all brands, old and new; finally I have found sheer perfection!!!!  </li>
            <li>I used to always have to wipe under my eyes during the day to clean up mascara even from ordinary perspiration.</li>
            <li>and I will not buy any other brand or waste time doing any more internet research.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly continue to use this mascara for a long time!!!</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth the splurge.  </li>
            <li>This means you can actually layer it and build volume without looking like your lashes are gunked up (seriously I have never been able to layer mascara before without it looking clumpy and feeling sticky).</li>
            <li>For me it doesnt flake off as much (only a bit) but it does mainly come off the same way that non waterproof mascara comes off.  </li>
            <li>Have compared it to a few other lash extending mascaras, and this one looks the most natural while still giving a big pop.</li>
            <li>And if you want to try a cool little trick... do a coat of mascara, then dust your eyelashes with baby powder and coat it a second time.</li>
            <li>By the end of the day I was extremely exhausted, realized my car was stuckin some snow, realized further that tow trucks were not willing to truck out to my location to help me, cried several tears in overwhelming exhaustion and frustration, and when I went to clean up my face in the restroom, was at least satisfied that my mascara did not run down my face or smear, but simply sat in small clumps under my eyes similar to how a tubing mascara comes off, and I very easily wiped it away with a tissue, still not smearing or smudging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different mascaras from drug store to high end</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a thick mascara (think long vs. fat lashes), but several coats gives a nice dramatic look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I have pretty straight, hardly there eyelashes</li>
            <li>Hard to get off (Since I am allergic to a lot of eye products I can&#x27;t use harsh chemicals; but the product I use from Payot was able to take off other mascaras easily, but not BiG unless I drown my eyes in it); I often wake up with mascara smudges even though I took it off the night before</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would confirm that all other positive reviews of this product are correct.</li>
            <li>But my absolute favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave black streak marks down my face when it gets wet!</li>
            <li>does not volumize like it says makes them long not thick</li>
            <li>so I have to use a formula that is really smudge proof and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>I have long, straight lashes that are of standard thickness</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also sensitive to several brands and end up with itchy eyes.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive eyes, and for years can only use one brand SYL.</li>
            <li>I can barely tell I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li>I think this will be my go-to mascara for the near future.</li>
            <li>I tried to go back to my old cheaper mascara when I ran out</li>
            <li>Just gave it to my 15 year old granddaughter as she took off for a Western tour for five weeks</li>
            <li>Not as much volume as I expected.</li>
            <li>Nearly the same price point.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and struggle to find mascara that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itchy and red.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gone back to my old mascara.  </li>
            <li>It really lengthened and darkened my lashes with absolutely no clumping.</li>
            <li>I was in complete shock when I saw the price was only $20!</li>
            <li>only did it beat it - it completely exceeded all my tests.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone, especially anyone with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>went back to store and bought my old revoln volumizing .</li>
            <li>I just comb out the clumps, but this makes my eyelashes look like a stick insect legs if I am not careful to comb my lashes after applying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to my old brand.</li>
            <li>I think in my opinion its a pretty average mascara.</li>
            <li>I would definitely say give this a try - I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>especially for a natural mascara</li>
            <li>I can see why people like this mascara, but I personally don&#x27;t want my natural lashes to be damaged.</li>
            <li>Sunglasses can only protect so far.  </li>
            <li>I can barely see them.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I barely ever have to use my makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched my entire adult life for a mascara that I can be faithful to...</li>
            <li>So far, not any different than Maybelline or Cover Girl.  </li>
            <li>This is the only one so far that hasn&#x27;t turned me into a raccoon at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>It barely works as well as non-volumizing &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This did the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>Although I do like Bare Minerals mascara</li>
            <li>This mascara barely coated my lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Revlon, Maybelline, Este Lauder, Bare Minerals, and Benefit.</li>
            <li>, I applied a regular amount one early morning as I was preparing to spend the day snowboarding.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a nice mascara.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the heavy expense.</li>
            <li>I am also pleased that it doesn&#x27;t appear clumpy or gross when you lay it on thick for extra drama.</li>
            <li>my eyelashes aren&#x27;t thick or long and I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras out there.  </li>
            <li>The expensive ones, although I like them- to be honest</li>
            <li>Really nice mascara, makes an impact without looking fake or caked on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash mascara for years, but lately it hasn&#x27;t been doing it&#x27;s job on my diminishing, short lashes (I&#x27;m 44 and have noticed that my lashes have been slowly getting shorter and shorter, which also happened to my mom and maternal grandmother).</li>
            <li>I have naturally long and thick eyelashes, but I want more.</li>
            <li>CRAZY how good</li>
            <li>It says you can do it with a regular face wash, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true -- seems to hang out on my eyelashes and face for a few days after.</li>
            <li>It looks like you put on false eye lashes but a thousand times better.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are normally not very thick nor long, but this mascara definitely gives them a kick!  </li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m not sure the product is good enough to justify its price point, and I&#x27;ll likely end up going back to my previous brand.</li>
            <li>A word of caution: the first time you remove the mascara you&#x27;ll look down horrified and think that all of your eyelashes just fell out.</li>
            <li>This mascara really gives me extra long lashes!</li>
            <li>Gives me jet black long full lashes and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I put about 1.5 coats on, and my lashes are about half an inch long, and full without any clumpiness.</li>
            <li>Not only can I use it with NO irritation, I LOVE the product as it doesn&#x27;t slide down your face or attach itself to your upper lids like a lot of other mascaras do throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It gives me the right amount of body and curl but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or get crunchy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Very clean, I could probably put on two coats to make it thicker, but i don&#x27;t want thick just long.</li>
            <li>It washes off better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>It cost more than the other mascara I have had in the past</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, and I anxiously waited for morning to try it.</li>
            <li>I love really thick big drag queen lights camera action stage eye lashes.</li>
            <li>For mascara users, the price is definitely worth it, and a little really goes a long way because the formula doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li>Mascara dries quickly though, so its not easy to go back in and separate lashes.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re real but in 5 minutes the mascara is all over my face and by the end of a busy night at work I have big dark circles from it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need to use anything other than that or baby wipes to remove it.  </li>
            <li>The brush shape is unique at least to any others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It stays on, I don&#x27;t get bits on my face or embarrassing raccoon circles, and it really makes my eyelashes look longer and fuller than other mascaras do.</li>
            <li>I can go dancing, or to the gym and never have to worry that my mascara is going to end up under my eyes making me look like a hot mess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a hot mess.</li>
            <li>It seemed like I did not get as much &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; as I did with my other mascaras.  </li>
            <li>I was a little worried at first because the product seemed thin and not very &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; but the product thickened up after a well of use and now I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li>It turned my eyelashes into little crispy strands instead of full feathery, long lashes like I wanted and as depicted on the box.  </li>
            <li>Not a single flake to be found.</li>
            <li>I have very thin, short lashes and have been looking for something that would make my eyes stand out a bit more!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m bringing the meaning of spider-eyes a whole new meaning with a only a few applications.</li>
            <li>I just with it was darker and a bit more dramatic.</li>
            <li>I used to waste so much time cleaning up my lashes after applying my old mascaras, because of how chunky/uneven it would look after application.</li>
            <li>Then about 2 week later, I accidentally packed only my old mascara when I went away for the weekend.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping the consistency will get better, but it does nothing for my thin, short lashes.  </li>
            <li>I have very short and thin lashes and was amazed at how lovely they looked as I applied this mascara on them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I have tiny eyelashes) and usually requires 2+ coats to see full, noticeable lashes.</li>
            <li>I tried so many different products all saying smudge proof with poor results.</li>
            <li>When I tightline my top inner rim with this mascara I swear it truly makes me look like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li>I am that person that buys every single new mascara looking for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li>Truly does what no other I&#x27;ve bought can - actually makes my lashes look thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li>With only 1 coat, this mascara lengthens and thickens my lashes like no other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The major thing for me is that it stays on the entire day with zero transfer, smudging or flaking.</li>
            <li>It washes off so easily and doesn&#x27;t leave your eyes in a black sticky mess.</li>
            <li>I was expecting much different results compared to other mascara&#x27;s I had used, but this really didn&#x27;t change much from any other one I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>With a long history of melting mascaras I am constantly trying new formulas.</li>
            <li>It does seem to clump a little and not go on as smoothly after a few weeks, but the benefits far outweigh the negatives.</li>
            <li>A little more expensive than I would prefer but worth the price.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I really love this mascara, and this is coming from a person who usually couldn&#x27;t care less about makeup.</li>
            <li>This mascara stays all day, removes easily, and creates long and thick lashes.  </li>
            <li>A little more costly than the $9 to $12 price point I usually purchase from, but we&#x27;ll worth the extra few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have tried lots of mascaras with great online ratings just to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I have worn this product while running, at a water park, and just generally being outside all day.</li>
            <li>Really overpriced, not worth it.</li>
            <li>This product when used in conjunction with the Lash Card makes me look like I have natural, long lashes.</li>
            <li>Although it is a  toss up between So Big and the one I have been using by Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>I like the long natural look.</li>
            <li>I just received the mascara not long ago.</li>
            <li>To completely remove I need to take the extra step of using makeup remover, which to me is simply that, an extra step.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on this one are short, which makes getting into the tiny corners a breeze, but to me it felt harder to get my lashes to really grow.</li>
            <li>I use this with Blinc&#x27;s lash primer and it looks like I have lush and long lashes.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a natural long  eyelash</li>
            <li>barely works as well as a regular mascara.</li>
            <li>but I returned this product because after a few hours the flakes bothered my eyes and didn&#x27;t look too pretty.</li>
            <li>The first few times I wore it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth $20</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn makeup for around the same amount of time, and I&#x27;m sure my fellow contact wearing sisters can commiserate with me about the frustration and pain they have gone through when mascara gets into their contacts, either from crying, in the shower (or crying in the shower), rain, sweat, whatever it may be that causes the mascara to run and get in your eye.</li>
            <li>First few times I either got mascara on myself, or the clump fell</li>
            <li>Makes my  lashes look full, thick and accentuates their length with out being clumpy.</li>
            <li>If you are wanting thick, full lashes this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>and it came off like little tubes, very much like the japanese mascaras out there.  </li>
            <li>It felt like there was little to no actual mascara inside the container after I first bought it, and it barely looked like anything was on my lashes after several attempts.  </li>
            <li>I added three more coats (for a total of four), and I still did not get any type of dramatic result.</li>
            <li>It immediately weighed my lashes down and made them straight.</li>
            <li>May as well put one of those furry hats on my eyelashes and call it a guard at the national gates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I cried my face off thanks to two aggressive onions I took down in battle.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this mascara, I believe I found my tube for life, it would be a hard competition to beat this one!!</li>
            <li>other brands that cost as much took several layers to achieve the same look and in the end they flaked off and irritated  my eyes.</li>
            <li>It gives a natural, long look to your lashes!</li>
            <li>In between each purchase I have tried other mascaras that have been highly recommended but it turns out they never compare.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference. :(</li>
            <li>I really like this one as it smudges a lot less.</li>
            <li>This mascara is so black in color that it really helps make my lashes pop.  </li>
            <li>It was old, dry and I will not buy again.</li>
            <li>Long lasting without any irritation, which is saying a lot since I have incredibly sensitive eyes and skin.</li>
            <li>I go from school directly to company dance rehearsals for 5 hours, and this mascara is the only one I have found that don&#x27;t run throughout my long day.</li>
            <li>It goes on effortlessly, stays on all day long, no smudging, no smearing, no flaking, not black dots under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Was not use to using a thin bush however the mascara goes on easy, makes my lashes longer I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li>This mascara goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t clump, but still makes my lashes look thick and long.</li>
            <li>If you put it on quick and thick it looks clumpy.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give me super thick lashes, but I don&#x27;t want that.</li>
            <li>When I ordered &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara&amp;#34; by Elizabeth Mott I was a little hesitant because it cost more than what I usually pay for mascara.</li>
            <li>they come straight back down.</li>
            <li>I am not thrilled about how much comes out and how it can quickly become a mess on lashes sticking together.</li>
            <li>I have such fine, short lashes that its hard to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t make them look like 2 spiders stuck to my eyelids!</li>
            <li>I have tried drugstore brands as well as higher end mascaras all with fairly good results and this is by far the worst mascara I have used since I can remember.</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin and with other mascaras I have smudges under my eyes by lunchtime - but never with this one.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s not clumping and hasn&#x27;t gotten dry, which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li>I cross train pretty hard and after 2 hrs there were no black circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I am a blonde, in my late 50&#x27;s, and with this mascara and a slick of Aveda lipstick, I look decades younger and effectively boost sales of a cruelty-free cosmetic.  </li>
            <li>Bought this because of all the positive reviews but it clumped after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews I was surprised at how bad this mascara turned out to be!</li>
            <li>If you need staying power AND volume, and happen to have thin, fine lashes, the search may continue.</li>
            <li>I have thin fine lashes.</li>
            <li>Absolutely NO flaking or smudging throughout the entire day - WOW!</li>
            <li>Plus I love the dark black pigment color!!!</li>
            <li>I am in the minority because I simply was not impressed at all by this mascara, and as another person pointed out, I&#x27;m a little baffled as to how this has so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t get what the hype is all about and wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive eyes which are irritated</li>
            <li>It also leaves your lashes BLACK, like DARK BLACK AND glossy looking, not gray like many others.</li>
            <li>It does add little volume to my lashes but irritates me eyes so much they burn and become red.</li>
            <li>: they didn&#x27;t appear longer or really that much bigger, just a little bolder.</li>
            <li>, I wear mascara to work out and other physical activities, and #3, I live in a sub-tropic climate where I tend to (ahem) perspire a lot.  </li>
            <li>Not only does this stuff cling to your lashes like a spider monkey to a back, it removes easily with makeup remover (I nearly tear my lashes out with other waterproofs I&#x27;ve worn), there is NO clumping when you apply it, and seriously ladies...</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes after reading the other reviews, but it falls flat on all fronts.</li>
            <li>I found this mascara to be very average, very chunky in the application.</li>
            <li>Very natural look without all the clumps  like the other mascaras do.</li>
            <li>My sensitive eyes that really seem allergic to all waterproof mascaras and maybe half of the other ones have never had a sensitivity to this mascara.</li>
            <li>It does have an interesting sort of formula which seems less heavy than other mascaras I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because the good outweigh the bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love how it makes my lashes look and best of all...</li>
            <li> I find the brush the perfect size for both top and bottom lashes</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, much better than the &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; department store brands.</li>
            <li> I tried for almost 13 years to find the best drugstore mascara that could lengthen, thicken, curl, and most of all, STAY ON.</li>
            <li> Sincerely the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this mascara :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this was the product that came in, I am very satisfied with this mascara, and will be buying again!!</li>

            <li> nice!</li>
            <li> This is the best waterproof mascara I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used many brands;  you name them, I have tried them.  </li>
            <li> Love Love this Mascara!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the perfect mascara for many years now, so when I stumbled upon</li>
            <li> The lash level was excellent and much better than anything else I have used.  </li>
            <li> Best part, it&#x27;s &#x27;beauty without bunnies&#x27; - cruelty free!</li>
            <li> I notice that I get a fair amount of volume and great lengthening.</li>
            <li> Most awesome mascara ever!</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with this awesome mascara!</li>
            <li> Love this, great price!</li>
            <li> Love it, worked great!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s spectacular!</li>
            <li> Every mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried has been at best OK..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most perfect mascara I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I had never heard of this mascara before but searched on amazon for best mascara and this was at the top.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do the world&#x27;s greatest job of thickening, but maybe I just need to put on more coats of it.</li>
            <li> I love the brush for this mascara, it&#x27;s perfect for adding volume while preventing the clumping together of eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It makes them look nice though!</li>
            <li> Plus no allergic reaction, which is nice!</li>
            <li> I have tried to find the perfect mascara since my go to  went out of production many years ago.</li>
            <li> Very impressed :-)</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect mascara for what seems like most of my makeup wearing life.</li>
            <li> The product is OK, it is not the best.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the most perfect mascara ever.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look great and it removes easily with soap and water, yet stays on and stays on looking good until it&#x27;s time to take it off!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice and comes off with water very easily but doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge!</li>
            <li> Never had a mascara that lasts and looks good - this does - Love it!!</li>
            <li> Granted, they are not luxurious, beautiful lashes I&#x27;ve always dreamed of having, but compared to having none, and not being able to wear mascara for two decades, it is welcomed!.</li>
            <li> This one was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> Awesome mascara, easy to wash off</li>
            <li> Easy to remove and best of all</li>
            <li> I was happy to find that Amazon carries this mascara that I have come to love!  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply and remove!  </li>
            <li> It looked as good at 8pm as it did at 5am when I applied it.</li>
            <li> That being said, I guess I need to find a good eye makeup remover that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to have it all and fit in the gym at your lunch break this is the best mascara.</li>
            <li> Looks good at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The color is good, but it seems to clump up on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> This mascara was so good that I went to the lower reviews just to see how or why they gave it one or two stars.</li>
            <li> I like the wand, the shape is a good idea.</li>
            <li> You do need a good waterproof mascara remover.</li>
            <li> It was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the good: this stuff LASTS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to layering up on mascara like putting on sweaters in a snow storm, but it wasn&#x27;t much good here.</li>
            <li> Someone else may find this product satisfactory and be delighted with the outcome.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People said it looked really good</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> This looked so good on my lashes...</li>

            <li> good quality product though.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mascara that was cruelty-free and this one got really good reviews so even though I wanted a waterproof mascara, I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> This product is good to me</li>
            <li> I wanted to give a fair review.  </li>
            <li> I loved this Mascara</li>
            <li> Really loved the way the brush was designed.</li>
            <li> The brush is not as good as the buxom mascara brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even as good as a $7 mascara you&#x27;d buy in a drugstore.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t even as good as those</li>
            <li> This mascara is good.  </li>
            <li> it does look good</li>
            <li> but i think you could find one just as good for cheaper</li>
            <li> I dont notice any smell, and the staying power is good.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all, which is good.  </li>
            <li> I loved this mascara, but I&#x27;m going to toss it because I try to avoid putting toxins in/on my body</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good mascara.  </li>
            <li> I always look for really good mascaras and have tried everything from Maybelline to Sephora and this one outshines them all.</li>
            <li> I have told everyone who is looking for a GOOD mascara to buy this.</li>
            <li> Stays on, doesn&#x27;t flake or crumble, for a good 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Two coats and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mascara because it received good reviews...</li>
            <li> Stays on nicely and looks great throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, good luck taking it off.</li>
            <li> At some point the formula must&#x27;ve change because the product is not as good as it was, I still like it</li>
            <li> My sister tried it out and loved it</li>
            <li> Very clean, smudge proof, great lashes and CRUELTY FREE!!!</li>
            <li> Washes off so easily!!</li>
            <li> Mascara stays on all day, no running, no smearing, and comes off easily when it&#x27;s time to wash your face!!</li>
            <li> Also comes off easily with my makeup wipes !!</li>
            <li> Plus it also comes off easy!!</li>
            <li> I was so impressed by this mascara after receiving a sample that I bought the full size.  </li>
            <li> I had a trial of this product and was very impressed and so purchased full size product.  </li>
            <li> It beautifully separates &amp; lengthens your lashes, and also thickens to your desire, depending on how many coats you apply.  </li>
            <li> It also washes off relatively easy with soap and water, although make-up remover is ideal.</li>
            <li> This mascara glides on, gives exceptional volume, and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE this awesome mascara -- not &amp;#34;goopie&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;flakie -  </li>
            <li> Very happy with the product as well as the quick processing of my order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real,&amp;#34; and find that to be exceptional in every way.</li>
            <li> , second, it builds, lenghens and curls my lashes, and doesnt flake, smudge or smear, and Lasts allllllllll day and the best part is, it washes off very easily with water!!!!!  </li>
            <li> Simply the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, hands-down, and that it&#x27;s cruelty-free makes it perfect.  </li>
            <li> I just love it, love it, love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This is really great mascara - I heard about it from a good friend who goes for a bit more made up look than I do</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t super impressed.</li>
            <li> It lasted through tears of happiness, dancing, and a warm day and looked as good at the end of the day as at the start of the day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many since Avon discontinued my favorite, and this one is without a doubt the best.  </li>
            <li> The wife loved it and says most of all it doesn&#x27;t clump!</li>
            <li> And perhaps the best part for me is that this is the very first mascara that doesn&#x27;t require makeup remover.</li>
            <li> This mascara does a really good job of making my skimpy lashes longer, thicker and more defined!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lengthen the way I had hoped but it&#x27;s very nice mascara - washes off beautifully - does not smudge and the brush is cool.  </li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE LOVE this!!!  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with this mascara.</li>

            <li> Works great for curl and length and thickness but has a better brush.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with quality of product and applicator.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is very lovely.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why so many have given this product a great review.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and like a lot of you out there have been searching for that mascara.</li>
            <li> Great formula, staying power, and NO flaking (which is a problem I have with most waterproof mascaras).</li>
            <li> Since this product had so many great reviews I thought I would try it out</li>
            <li> This one magically opens up your eyes and does a great job adding length and volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;;ve been using this mascara and am very pleased with the volume it has given to my lashes</li>
            <li> I could not be more happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> I am beyond baffled as to why this mascara has so many great reviews.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> That is its best quality, and worth buying for that reason</li>
            <li> you will be very pleased as it doesn&#x27;t run/smudge at all.</li>
            <li> but then when u apply more and more coats your eyelashes look really nice!!</li>
            <li> Went on vacation right after I started using it, and it was awesome.</li>
            <li> The best part is that soap and water will take the mascara right</li>
            <li> This product is better than some brands that cost more!!</li>
            <li> Very nice, lightweight mascara :)</li>
            <li> Definitely not the best ever....but certainly very good.</li>
            <li> I bought this based upon the great reviews and am not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s cruelty free and the brush is great!</li>

            <li> It goes on nice, no clumps.</li>
            <li> It takes me forever to apply and that would be OK if I loved the results</li>
            <li> Nice mascara, helps my skimpy lashes look fuller.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> Nice product that doesn&#x27;t clump and extends the lashes.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely one of the best mascaras I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Rivers my MAC mascara and doesn&#x27;t clump, but evens out lashes nicely.</li>
            <li> Also seems to stay on nicely too - at the end of the day</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any flaking to speak of, and it comes off nicely too.</li>
            <li> This is really the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Nice volume and no flake.</li>
            <li> and I liked it.</li>
            <li> It does make my lashes look nice.</li>
            <li> It works great, and such a wonderful bargain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every mascara out there over the years, but this is the absolute BEST in all categories.  </li>
            <li> If someone asks me what kind of mascara</li>
            <li> , she was thrilled to know she doesn&#x27;t have to apply</li>
            <li> and it provides a nice, lengthening coverage.</li>
            <li> Both give nice length.</li>
            <li> one of my 6th graders asked me what kind of mascara</li>
            <li> They are nicely separated.</li>
            <li> It has a nice brush too.</li>
            <li> I threw it in my makeup bag and never tried it because I had a mascara that I liked.  </li>
            <li> I treat it as a tubular and take a warm wash cloth and squeeze my lashes with it</li>
            <li> I really liked it but did not want to spend that kind of money on mascara</li>
            <li> but it does provide a nice definition and added length.</li>
            <li> They send a nice size sample.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that this company does not do testing on animals and they make a superior product.</li>
            <li> It kind of reminds me of Blinc--even though it&#x27;s not \\&quot;waterproof\\</li>
            <li> It really IS the best!</li>
            <li> I wish I could return the item honestly</li>
            <li> Or if you&#x27;ve ever used Milani infinite eye liquid eyeliner, the texture is kind of like that product, a bit thinner though.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It goes on really nicely, and STAYS on without smudging, clumping, or flaking.</li>
            <li> Nice added length to lashes</li>
            <li> Thanks again for a great product!!</li>
            <li> look nice and seperated.  </li>
            <li> It really is the best mascara</li>
            <li> Washes off with warm water and Neutrogena Foaming face cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I have spend much more money and not had as good of results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update----I am still loving this mascara.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best mascara that I have ever used!!!  </li>
            <li> Not the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used but far superior to store bought.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thinner mascara, so it coats the eyelashes nicely without clumping at all and gives them a really nice length.</li>
            <li> Nice coverage, no raccoon eyes in 80 degree heat.  </li>
            <li> she begged me to buy her one of her own.</li>
            <li> Effective and no clumps.  </li>
            <li> The brush does a nice job of separating the lashes while coating them thoroughly -- no lumps, no smears.</li>
            <li> This mascara really is the best.</li>
            <li> I have used every kind of mascara and this is up there as one of my favs.</li>
            <li> Warm water and face wash or a makeup remover works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a good product</li>
            <li> when you check yourself in the mirror, it&#x27;s not the broccoli in your teeth that&#x27;s catching your eye, it&#x27;s that damn mascara all smudged under there . .</li>
            <li> It goes on flawlessly and does NOT clump or flake the whole day.  </li>
            <li> It goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake or smear, and comes off nicely at end of day.  </li>
            <li> Many happiness.  </li>
            <li> I got kind of gooped together lashes</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the great product!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really the perfect mascara!</li>
            <li> I am continually looking for a nice mascara that does not clump, elongates your lashes and does not smudge.</li>
            <li> After a popular company discontinued my go-</li>
            <li> Really good mascara, probably the most effective</li>
            <li> This product is good, but I was hoping for something more.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still using this mascara exclusively and loving it.</li>
            <li> Kind of just a tint and lengthens.</li>
            <li> I am neither thrilled or disatisfied with the product.  </li>
            <li> Though I did not get the volume I would have liked, the product went on nicely and did not smear through the day.</li>
            <li> It really works great!</li>
            <li> Nice build-able consistency without getting clumpy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going on nicely,</li>
            <li> Nice mascara</li>
            <li> I kind of look like a doll hah.</li>
            <li> Good mascara, better than any drugstore mascara I have tried.</li>
            <li> Honestly did not get the hype of this mascara.</li>
            <li> My friend really liked it.</li>
            <li> This mascara does a nice job thoroughly coating lashes.</li>
            <li> I actually really liked this mascara.</li>
            <li> I liked that this mascara didn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> Wow....it is so nice to check the mirror at lunch time and not see raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li> A really good purchase :-)</li>
            <li> So for that reason I did not find it any better than a good drugstore brand.  </li>
            <li> It works great but there are more out there with a more affordable price.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and close together</li>
            <li> mascara is a nice inky consistency that ensures you wont end up with hideous chunks and clumps.  </li>
            <li> It does add volume, the brush is nice and it catches lashes nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest,</li>
            <li> I have been loving this mascara.</li>
            <li> It makes my own look fuller and longer...</li>
            <li> I love that they are clearly good people.</li>
            <li> However, I really liked it, while it lasted.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really add any volume or definition to my lashes...not impressed.</li>
            <li> This brand is the absolute best.</li>
            <li> It does not run onto my skin, lasts all day, and washes off with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this mascara.</li>
            <li> A nice feature - the hourglass brush gets into the corners without poking yourself with a pointed end.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice mascara.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely THE BEST mascara I have ever, ever worn in my life.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t clump which is nice.</li>
            <li> It has a nice liquidy formula so it lets go of the brush, but clings to your lashes.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t feel like the brush &amp;#34;combed through&amp;#34; my eyelashes as I would have liked them to.</li>
            <li> I have been on a quest to find a good lengthening mascara,that does not flake,or pull out even MORE of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s extremely happy with it, price was great and delivery was fast as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!  </li>
            <li> Love love love this mascara!!</li>
            <li> no clumping and super easy to apply... and the product itself is great!</li>
            <li> Every woman wants to have their eyes looking sexy after all this is what is noticed by everyone!!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY WORTH THE PRICE!!!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!!!</li>
            <li> This mascara is absolutely terrific, best I have ever used honestly!</li>
            <li> It stays on great giving full lashes and washes off nicely.</li>
            <li> It was at my door within 48 hours which is awesome, but after trying it on I didn&#x27;t exactly understand why there&#x27;s so many 5 star ratings.</li>
            <li> It removes very easily with warm water.  </li>
            <li> this is such a good mascara, doesn&#x27;t flake, stays on until you take it off, and the best part, its cruelty free!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have EVER used and believe me, I&#x27;ve used them all from drug store brands to high end department store brands.  </li>
            <li> Happy to pay $20 for the full size.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and looks great, and even better, it comes off easily (without leaving eye lashes on the cleaning cloth!</li>
            <li> requested a sample from Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s site and they ended up sending me all three samples, which is very sweet!</li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara!!!!!</li>
            <li> All that is great, but then add on top of it that it doesn&#x27;t flake, it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, it doesn&#x27;t clump, it goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it goes on smooth and adds great volume.</li>
            <li> Heard good great things about this mascara but found it to be less than impressive  for the price...  Going to stick to L&#x27;Oréal telescopic mascara,  way better and cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this mascara because it goes on easily and is a good volumizer.</li>
            <li> Absolute favorite mascara, great product!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara because it&#x27;s easy to apply, easy to remove, never ever flakes or smudges, lasts all day, and looks incredible.</li>
            <li> Easy to layer for gorgeous lashes.</li>
            <li> For a non-waterproof mascara, it has good staying power but washes of easily.</li>
            <li> For anyone writing reviews where they haven&#x27;t had a good experience it could be in the way they apply their mascara - I use a back-and-forth motion starting at the  bottom of my lashes working up and it works perfect every time.</li>
            <li> We used to use BENEFIT - they&#x27;re real &amp; as much as we loved that mascara , we tried this one and love it even more.  </li>
            <li> Great mascara and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> And I loved that it is easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> And best of all, for my very sensitive eyes.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> In fact, it is very easy to take off.</li>
            <li> it comes off very easily when I was my face a night.</li>
            <li> Very easy to remove as well.</li>
            <li> It comes off very easily with a make-up remover wipe or with soap and water, but I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about it running.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come off very easy.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very easy to wash off</li>
            <li> It also lasts all day but is very easy to take off when need to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought one and immediately bought two more to make sure I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have tried so far!</li>

            <li> I have been searching for a good mascara that is also cruelty free.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>

            <li> NOTHING has ever lasted more than two hours on me, and I&#x27;d given up hope that I could find a brand that would have any kind of staying power.  </li>
            <li> I wish you could build on the length more than you can, but it does give nice length.</li>
            <li> So far, this is the best I have found.  </li>
            <li> I continue to try mascaras and this is the best so far - it doesn&#x27;t end up under my lower lids, on my skin.  </li>
            <li> company contacted me almost immediately in response to this review, and gave a me a stunning, amazing, and generous response (which included a replacement bottle).</li>

            <li> Being an ex makeup artist, I will tell you this formula to me is up there with the top brands at sephora and did give my lashes volume and like promised didnt budge until i applied warm water</li>
            <li> But the most amazing thing to me is the staying power.</li>
            <li> I wash it off every night with Purity (from Philosophy); I doubt that most normal face washes would take it off well, so probably best to use eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> First and foremost - CRUELTY FREE - what a beautiful thing, thank you for this!!!   </li>
            <li> It really is awesome and my new favorite.</li>
            <li> The design of the wand it great too making for easy, clump free application.</li>
            <li> I have very fine lashes</li>
            <li> I was looking for and it easily washes off without any scrubbing!</li>
            <li> said that it was easy to remove and its NOT!</li>
            <li> But somehow also manages to be easy to take off!</li>
            <li> Comed off easily yet stays all day!</li>
            <li> And then at the end of the day, it comes off easily as well!</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and DOES NOT FLAKE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to wash off!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product as it is easy to apply and stays applied throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have very fine eyelashes and watery eyes</li>
            <li> Love love love this mascara!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this mascara!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this mascara!</li>
            <li> You will love, love, love this!  </li>
            <li> And the best part, there are no dark smudges under my eyes when I wake up in morning.</li>
            <li> I even slept in it and woke up excited how good they still looked with no smearing or raccoon eyes at all,</li>
            <li> The mascara is good: very high quality, looks good on my lashes etc.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> At my age, I use a good amount of undereye moisturizers, and that was causing smudge even with waterproof mascaras that were a nightmare to try to clean off at night.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a fat but natural look, or I can layer on more for some POW if I want it.</li>
            <li> I mention this as the majority of time there I was not only in the water a great deal of the time, but I there was also a great deal of heat and humidity at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far superior to Great Lash</li>
            <li> (if you get a good tube) is really that good that I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> but so far both times the mascara went on great and did a good job of separating my lashes.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, so far it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras and this is by far the best yet.</li>
            <li> If you want not only a great product but also a great after sales service</li>
            <li> I started out wiping the brush as clean as I could without good results.</li>
            <li> It feels great on my lashes, not clumpy, lasts all day and makes my lashes long and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love that i put it on, it stays and comes off very easy with out having to rub my eyes.</li>
            <li> Dior doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to this no clump miracle in a bottle :) Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and great product</li>
            <li> Builds nicely for either a clean (not clumpy!)</li>
            <li> I think, regardless what I do, I save that for special occasions and leave myself a good 10 minutes to apply the mascara.  </li>
            <li> Great product thanks!</li>
            <li> Great mascara and fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> The first two tubes I got were great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty great about defining your lashes and not clumping.</li>
            <li> when I applied this great mascara, it looked awesome, didn&#x27;t curl my top lashes down or bottom lashes up on the ends like some do, but really looked great</li>
            <li> Great lengthening without clumps and super easy to remove - no smearing or smudging either.</li>
            <li> Recommended to all my beauty loving friends and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great mascara.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly with no clumps.</li>
            <li> The mascara is very smooth and glides on.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are very light.</li>
            <li> The mascara goes on very smooth.  </li>
            <li> The contoured brush gives me a very smooth application.</li>
            <li> Very smooth application.</li>
            <li> the mascara is very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Amazing mascara ams easy to remove.</li>
            <li> not sure if its the best Volumizing mascara, but it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Doesnt smear in the water and can remove easily with warm water.</li>
            <li> Nice brush with a curved shape to it makes it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also does not flake, run, clump, or come off until you want it to, and then it rubs off easily with warm water.</li>
            <li> This one goes on easy and has a nice brush that separates lashes.</li>
            <li> applicator is easy to use and the mascara goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> It washes off easily, which is nice since I don&#x27;t have to tug at my lashes to get the mascara off.</li>
            <li> Still, a nice product that goes on well and stays put throughout the day yet removes easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove at night-just use warm water.</li>
            <li> It washes easily with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Australia, and finding a cheap, loved mascara isn&#x27;t always easy.</li>
            <li> Nice product and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Especially nice for someone older whose lashes don&#x27;t seem quite as full as they once were.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone who likes their lashes to look longer, thicker, and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> This mascara makes my lashes huge and does not clump!</li>
            <li> After going through several mascara&#x27;s that kept flaking on my skin throughout the day, I am so happy to have found this one!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE</li>
            <li> Lovely mascara.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> THE TOP LASHES.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> , more just interesting</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> but I like my L&#x27;oreal volumizing better.</li>
            <li> Move on to something better.</li>
            <li> Love this product it does what it says</li>
            <li> I love it, goes on without clumps</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not labeled as waterproof but I have cried so many time while wearing this</li>
            <li> but as for the ones that cost more than drugstore,prices  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve found the better mascara.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I get much better results using cheaper department store mascara.</li>
            <li> Have tried Better Than Sex and now this.  </li>
            <li> Have to put on too many coats.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the mascaras&lt;br /&gt;out</li>
            <li> This gives me awesome, lasting volume.</li>
            <li> The lengthening ability is amazing and it goes on smoothly with literally no clumping whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Many drugstore-cost mascaras are better for me.  </li>
            <li> I have made it a point to tell family and friends about this, because that&#x27;s how much a love it.</li>
            <li> Trying to take it off at night takes more than soap and water - you need product remover to get this mascara off.</li>
            <li> How are there so many rave reviews for this mascara?</li>
            <li> ; by Benefit until I find one that works better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t end up on them during application like most.  </li>
            <li> So many mascaras give the volume</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Put it on just this morning and thought again how much I love it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara and don&#x27;t have to use power at all</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Thank you Elizabeth Mott for coming up with such a great product!</li>
            <li> I have modeled for many years and have had many makeup artist tell me,  after I inform them off my mascara issue,  &amp;#34;ohh</li>
            <li> so many suggest</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> and this is my favorite in years.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the product for 2 weeks I started to notice that my eye lashes began to clump together and no matter how many times I washed my eyes</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m madly, deeply in love with this stuff that I will continue buying it.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Since switching, I am able to wear my mascara even during my sneeziest days.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Just okay.</li>
            <li> I found the Physicians formula is better...</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li> When you apply more than one coat, you don&#x27;t get the Gabore Look...</li>
            <li> So I would classify this as waterproof for sure.  </li>
            <li> I love it :)</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I will probably repurchase :)</li>
            <li> Forever or Benifit works better for me.</li>
            <li> Never used anything better.  </li>
            <li> I love the skinny wand:</li>
            <li> I thought I would LOVE it like everyone else seemed to...</li>
            <li> I received a travel sized version of this mascara in my Ipsy bag and fell completely in love with it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many mascaras.  </li>
            <li> Most mascaras are so so</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and I have tried many brands of mascara at twice the price</li>
            <li> I will never switch again! :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE MASCARA</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are using this mascara and love it.</li>
            <li> And the $8 Mascara is way better than this one.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how it works, but I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this mascara, but it just wasn&#x27;t as great as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> Especially great with lash lengthening, thickening is better after several uses.</li>
            <li> The mascara wand is well thought out and the opening of the container makes it so you don&#x27;t have to scrub a bunch of mascara off in order to use it, like many others.</li>
            <li> Lashes appear longer and fuller for sure.</li>
            <li> and it is our famliy favorite.</li>
            <li> I like it better than the L&#x27;Oreal Volumizing.  </li>
            <li> , i came upon this mascara buy accident and i&#x27;m so glad i did, all you need is one coat and the mascara</li>
            <li> This mascara is OK.  </li>
            <li> a must better job.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic mascara!</li>
            <li> Best máscarever, this is my second time buying it</li>
            <li> i love the thickness and length of my lashes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many types over the years, from drug store brands through pricey designer brands.</li>
            <li> Application and volume is just ok -</li>
            <li> but I love this product.</li>
            <li> I even fell asleep with it last night and when I woke up it still looked perfect!   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for about 2 weeks now and love it.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful mascara, I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay as surely as Dior Show waterproof, but I think that I prefer this better.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I finally found the perfect mascara.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wearing, I&#x27;m sure as heck not going to tell them &amp;#34;It&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I love the hourglass-shaped brush too.  </li>
            <li> My lashes have never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with Its so Big.  </li>
            <li> The brush could be better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting more based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Because it is truly fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Mabelline&#x27;s Falsies and Mega Plush are both much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love mascara and love to try them all this one was ok but would not get again</li>
            <li> I am enjoying wearing it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product since it doesn&#x27;t leave smearing under your eye.</li>
            <li> really defines them, and gives great length.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what magic is in this tube</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product but</li>
            <li> It claims to be a volumizing mascara, which is what I need, but I found it to be more of a lengthening mascara.  </li>
            <li> any $5 mascara from CVS or Walmart is million times better quality.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I also think this is a better lengthening mascara than a volumizing one</li>
            <li> Love this and if it lasted longer I&#x27;d give it a 5 star review</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara is just OK.  </li>
            <li> I started off with a sample of their mascara and fell in love.</li>
            <li> I have seen better results from the Maybeline Power Volume 24 H mascara.  </li>
            <li> I have almost no eyelashes and this perks up the ones I do have :)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so many drugstore brands and styles and formulas to choose from, why would I ever spend more than $10 on a mascara?</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mascara connoisseur; I&#x27;ve been using mascara for many years.</li>
            <li> I really love the brush and this does not clump at all</li>
            <li> so I love how it separates my lashes</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found a better brand in the drug store</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> it curled my lashes more, but I guess I could just use a curler...</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Benefits</li>
            <li> I also really love Fiberwig mascara by Imufiju</li>
            <li> I love with this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I can confidently wear just this when I don&#x27;t want to put on all my war paint.</li>
            <li> And my favorite thing about it?</li>
            <li> did an in depth review of my top 4 favorite mascaras on my blog: http://www.newlyag.com/the-final-four/&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE Benefit&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Then, I finally tried this, and let me tell ya, ITS AWESOME.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I really love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> This is ok I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> No smearing or flaking, and most of the time</li>
            <li> Oh, well, it&#x27;s still much better than alternatives I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many different types of mascara,  this one is the best!</li>
            <li> I just ordered some more.</li>
            <li> Drugstore brands work better.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara....</li>
            <li> I very much enjoyed the make up</li>
            <li> However this mascara is very persistent and tenacious, which is a great feature in some regards but not for removal.</li>
            <li> I will for sure be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I also love how it doesn&#x27;t clump together when applying.</li>
            <li> I love the way my lashes look and feel.</li>
            <li> I would have given it a five, but is like it to do more thickening in addition to the lengthening.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of macara&#x27;s and none have worked better then this one.</li>
            <li> I have used both Urban Decay and Clinique makeup removers to take this off and both worked perfectly to fully remove this</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li> I have read many posts about how it stays on in rain and humidity.</li>
            <li> and I feel more volumizing.  </li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> but I cannot force myself to put anything else on my lashes any more</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> SIMPLY THE BEST MASCARA</li>
            <li> MANY)- no problem here -</li>
            <li> So I gave it a try once more</li>
            <li> For my lashes, too many layers are needed and I end up with the spider look.  </li>
            <li> This is ok.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Found this and LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> Bought more than I needed to give as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have had better results with drug store mascaras.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s made of magic :)</li>
            <li> No raccoon eyes and love that it stays in place all day 😀</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara.</li>
            <li> but I think this is way better.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, I had friends using/selling the 3-D lashes</li>
            <li> So why do I LOVE it...</li>
            <li> 1) I have been searching for a masacara for about a year (tried many)</li>
            <li> I am about to order another one for my travel bag!! :-)</li>
            <li> I love the brush.</li>
            <li> Should have stuck with Two Faced&#x27;s Better Than Sex Mascara.</li>
            <li> you remove it with eye makeup remover, you need to take some time to remove it well, depending on how many coats you applied.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a mascara I REALLY love, but this comes close to what I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am particularly impressed with the size it makes my lashes look with only two applications.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure you take it off with eye make-up remover every day.</li>
            <li> This mascara makes them look like the lashes of my youth &amp; I love that.</li>
            <li> It peaked my interest, finding mascara with so many 5 star ratings.</li>
            <li> I like the price for ISB better</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Better than most drugstore brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> This mascara is ok, better than most grocery store mascaras I&#x27;ve tried since my favorite brand changed</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I will ever buy - excellent product!!!</li>
            <li> FINALLY I FIND THE PERFECT MASCARA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> TO MAKE SURE YOUR WAND IS LOADED.&lt;br</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> Product is awesome and I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> The mascara, unlike most formulas, is a bit more viscous and allows for better defining and building.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mascara that was cruelty free, volumizing, and wasn&#x27;t a bear to get off of my face when I was done with it!  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of this and fell in love.  </li>
            <li> Love this mascara</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love the wand on this brush.</li>
            <li> It is one of my favorite wands I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Does not run or smudge like so many others do.</li>
            <li> the product lasts longer than most.</li>
            <li> For me, a $20 investment in a mascara I love is cheaper than continuing my quest for the perfect mascara and wasting money on 2 or 3 different ones annually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this type of applicator, 2)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It became my favorite mascara</li>
            <li> better than most..</li>
            <li> However, compare &amp;#34;Clinc&amp;#34; which I used to use it, the &amp;#34;Elizabeth Mott&amp;#34; does lighter job, and i don&#x27;t feel it gives more volume</li>
            <li> My go-to mascara for sure</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great quality mascara!</li>
            <li> It does lengthen more than volumize but it does volumize.</li>
            <li> I like this one better.</li>
            <li> and I fell in love.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much better.</li>
            <li> The more I use it the more I like it.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is the way it comes off.</li>
            <li> but I can now wear one mascara on both top and bottom.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara because it checks off all the needs</li>
            <li> Like many others, I received this via Ipsy.  </li>
            <li> LOVE.  </li>
            <li> My I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> This one does it and more.  </li>
            <li> It does not work better for me than my Loreal Voluminous Million Lashes mascara from Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> This mascara is fabulous!</li>
            <li> husband noticed the difference also! :-)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you Elizabeth Mott for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> mascaras are better.</li>
            <li> you can get 2 or more for the price of this one</li>
            <li> A better name will be minimum mascara.  </li>
            <li> I love this part.  </li>
            <li> love love love this.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> The way that I was able to remove it was to be in the shower and literally rub my eyelashes with my face wash.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the everlasting look of this mascara.</li>
            <li> , I love this mascara</li>
            <li> (so many brands claim this</li>
            <li> Love that they use a fiber brush (can&#x27;t stand the rubber, silicone ones).</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love the product and buy it, just like I am.  </li>
            <li> I have used so many brushes and mascaras over the years.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I had read, I was hoping for much more from this mascara.</li>
            <li> All-in-all, love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Request a sample if you are unsure, but I can guarantee that you will love it.</li>
            <li> We now are able to talk about the weather.  </li>
            <li> thank you Elizabeth for making such an awesome product!!!!!</li>
            <li> but none was able to meet my demands.  </li>
            <li> I immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> It worked better than any mascara I had ever tried.</li>
            <li> On top of that I serve in the US Army Reserves.</li>
            <li> but I love it for my Army life.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the applicator brush, but seems to do well.</li>
            <li> I love the brush....</li>
            <li> Love,</li>
            <li> So glad I found this.  </li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a mascara I really love.  </li>
            <li> This one is okay.  </li>
            <li> gives me the most volume as well as length &amp; doesn&#x27;t flake of at all.</li>
            <li> BadGal lash mascara by Benefit :)  </li>
            <li> I have tried many brands, but always ended up with raccoon eyes by the end of the work-day.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> i will buy again for sure</li>
            <li> I was sent a free sample of this mascara, this is nice stuff.</li>
            <li> One of the better mascaras I have bought online.</li>
            <li> I think it may be a matter of fewer clumps or maybe just a more flexible</li>
            <li> Not glam, but good...natural looking but better.  </li>
            <li> I love this Elizabeth Mott</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product, but I can&#x27;t say that I do.  </li>
            <li> I. Love.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried more than 4 coats.</li>
            <li> I have purchased all the top line mascaras, but this one (in the price range) is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I love this product it does what it should be doing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic,  I will keep purchasing it!</li>
            <li> Back on the market looking for that perfect mascara again.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s more fancy than practical.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more time consuming to apply mascara than it would be if the brush were just...</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I have tried SO many mascaras, from drugstore cheapies to designer/Sephora goodies.</li>
            <li> I almost was talked into buying the latest direct-sales mascara trend until I did some research and stumbled across this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought mascara that was cheaper and much better than this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> So no raccoon eyes :-)</li>
            <li> This is one of the better ones I tried and would buy again.  </li>
            <li> It lasts all day and is not terrible to remove.</li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> I love this macara.  </li>
            <li> Like most of U I have used many mascaras over the years.</li>
            <li> I wan&#x27;t expecting much better from this item</li>
            <li> but, Thanks Gals, it had so many great reviews I decided to give it</li>
            <li> It stays on all day without any flaking, which is my favorite part.  </li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Although this is called volumizing, I feel it is more lengthening...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but seems to take a lot of going over and over.</li>
            <li> My 6 dollar tube is so much better....</li>
            <li> I now recommend this to all my friends who use mascara &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t clump</li>
            <li> Nothing else will do. : )</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> I love the way it comes off with no tugging or pulling with just water.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve everpaid for a mascara.</li>
            <li> but I think this is better than most I&#x27;ve used in that regard.</li>
            <li> I thought this mascara was going to give my lashes more volume.</li>
            <li> Glad I took the leap.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t change the formula, all I ask, please! :)</li>
            <li> Finally I have found the perfect mascara!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have used many different types of mascara and have to say that this is one works great!</li>
            <li> The brush really helps to reduce clumps and in addition to lots of volume, I also get great length.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> So glad I did.</li>
            <li> Better than any department store mascara I have used.</li>
            <li> I just love this mascara...</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> What I like most is</li>
            <li> Love love love this mascara...</li>
            <li> fantastic mascara!  </li>
            <li> Although the mascara is marketed as “volumizing”, I found that it lengthens better than it</li>
            <li> best part is its ease of removal with either a facial towlette or cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Simply the BEST mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> After years of searching I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many brands I&#x27;ve lost count.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I won&#x27;t buy anything else from now on.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> My favorite was benefit&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and she sent me a free trial size to see if I liked it</li>
            <li> Really love it.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>

            <li> Fantastic mascara!</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I was expecting this mascara to be much better.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> Will be trying more products from this boutique line.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> .. Love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and the seller -wish</li>
            <li> I love the mascara.</li>
            <li> It is truly fantastic!  </li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve never been the most skilled at applying mascara, this one creates the illusion that I know what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> was I pleased.  </li>
            <li> I plan on ordering more when I run out.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I wish the brush was better.</li>
            <li> I might like this mascara more than &amp;#34;Better Than Sex&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I know I still am, until I find something even better.</li>
            <li> I will be returning this mascara, since it didn&#x27;t give my lashes more volume.  </li>
            <li> MORE SMUDGES,</li>
            <li> but I love my Bobby Brown Waterproof that my daughter took from me.  </li>
            <li> Save your money go to CVS and buy a 6 dollar one you will like it better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had way better mascaras than this...</li>
            <li> I love how it lasts all day</li>
            <li> Top all of that off with it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s So BIG is great!  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with look</li>
            <li> And if anyone has suggestions for a volumizing mascara better than the two I already listed</li>
            <li> and I love the eye shadow and liner that was sent.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> My favorite for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li> An all-around win.</li>
            <li> I will say that I thought it would be a bit more volumizing than it is.</li>
            <li> , I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and most mascaras end up smearing.</li>
            <li> Plus, you can layer it for a more glam look.  </li>
            <li> I love when it&#x27;s time to wash off your eyes mascara</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> THIS stuff is sooo much better than any of them.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it not smudge or flake, it looks great all day and into the night!</li>
            <li> I have tried many mascaras over the years and many of them do what they claim to do</li>
            <li> I use cheaper mascaras and get much better volumizing from them.  </li>
            <li> Better than Dior.</li>
            <li> Love the brush.</li>
            <li> How refreshing.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will work better for my friend.  </li>
            <li> Could not ask for anything more from a mascara</li>
            <li> I would say this is a bit better than Great Lash, but really does nothing to thicken or lengthen my lashes.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many in all price ranges and</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I would say this mascara is more lengthening than volumizing.</li>
            <li> Great, except that doesn&#x27;t really work, because the product doesn&#x27;t layer well.</li>
            <li> Many of the mascaras I&#x27;ve tried are too clumpy or make me have caterpillar lashes, which is not the look</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give me the volume that I&#x27;d like, but it does okay.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> but maybe I just need to apply more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a person who takes time to write reviews on any product but this is an outstanding product which MERITS a review.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> love love love..</li>
            <li> I love how it does not smear nor does it shed.</li>
            <li> Is also way better and giving length than those &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; mascara&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have ever found and I have tried many mascaras.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> And when you fall in love with it,  tell all your friends so that this does not become another make up product</li>
            <li> you fall in love with that</li>
            <li> Both Cover Girl and L&#x27;Oreal have better products.</li>
            <li> When I apply most mascara, it tends to clump, even when the brand claims no clumps.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try and I absolutely LOVE this.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Once I realized the value of this mascara, I&#x27;ve never been able to go with another mascara.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews thought it would be better.</li>
            <li> Hi Ladies :-)</li>
            <li> I just bought 2 more &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Mascara :-)</li>
            <li> and I had to reapply more often than I would expect with a volumizing waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I had better</li>
            <li> While it does build some volume, it is not any better than Revlon or Loreal.</li>
            <li> Love dis mascara</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying different brands and still searching for the perfect one.</li>
            <li> But this stuff is smooth and creamy, doesn&#x27;t irritate and wears almost like waterproof!</li>
            <li> Most mascaras add volume OR definition.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried tons of different mascaras and this is the best.</li>
            <li> i love how you can change your look with more coats.</li>
            <li> will be returning for more :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s So Big Mascara really is awesome,</li>
            <li> Mostly claim to be &amp;#34;smudge</li>
            <li> Iconic Overcurl--DS on one eye</li>
            <li> Its just OK, it does not ass volume to my eyelashes</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> so I ordered more.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> It was just ok.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li> My favorite  mascara EVER.</li>
            <li> and I still love it.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is OK.</li>
            <li> this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> but then most mascaras smudge and end up darkening under my eye area - not this one.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I have bought much better mascara from Target.</li>
            <li> This is an ok mascara.</li>
            <li> Perhaps works better for people with longer, curlier lashes?</li>
            <li> if you want more drama, go over again.  </li>
            <li> This is now my go to mascara. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I will be using both :)</li>
            <li> Like so many others, I&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t clump my eyelashes together, it separates them and keeps them looking natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real and it looks great and better.</li>
            <li> It stays on, that&#x27;s for sure. :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> it going to give you magically longer lashes?</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; is much better, although it&#x27;s $5 more.</li>
            <li> However, any drugstore brand that lengthens will give you better results than &amp;#34;It&#x27;s so Big&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Any mascara would Volumize with that many coats.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s THAT much better.</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara -</li>
            <li> It does tend to clump lashes together if you layer, but I love it anyway and prefer it over anything I have used.  </li>
            <li> Used to use MAC and CHANEL, this is a much better bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not 100% sure I would pay $20 for it again though.</li>
            <li> Even better customer service.</li>
            <li> The 1st one I ordered was defective, but Alice worked with me and sent me a replacement free of charge!</li>
            <li> Its light weight, holds its shape and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s top quality is it does not smudge, even after a shower.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> The Elizabeth Mott mascara NEVER smudges but also fills in my lashes and lengthens them better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> so glad I bought it based on feedback.</li>
            <li> I bought this one to see if there was anything better out there, turns out there isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The length it gives is ok, the fullness it gives is also just ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I have never fallen in love with a mascara...</li>
            <li> This mascara is absolutely astonishing.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for.</li>
            <li> I love the hour glass shaped brush--it really does a great job at both thickening and lengthening my lashes.  </li>
            <li> For the price of this, I can go to Target and get a better mascara for $8-9.  </li>
            <li> during storage &amp; shipping), and it does seem to be better.</li>
            <li> a feature I LOVE.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara to date - and I&#x27;ve tried so many.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t run in the shower or when you wash your face.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I love that I can wear this mascara the whole day and it will not smudge.</li>
            <li> Better than over the counter brands.  </li>
            <li> I would like to see it elongate the lashes more</li>
            <li> I love the length and separation.</li>
            <li> I am able to accentuate my lower lashes without the clumps.</li>
            <li> It looks better and lasts longer than the store bought brands like revlon and maybelline.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s So BIG mascara is the BEST mascara ever....</li>
            <li> Definitely is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The best thing I can say for this mascara is that it definitely darkens the lashes.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;I was sent was a million times better than what I paid for.</li>
            <li> sure if I&#x27;ll order again though.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I tried many others which also ran.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many things</li>
            <li> This Mascara is OK...</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It provides more length than volume and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>

            <li> I absolutely LOVE &amp;#34;It&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I love the brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many over the years</li>
            <li> L&#x60;oreal works way much better...</li>
            <li> I am ordering more.</li>
            <li> love this.</li>
            <li> Just spend a bit more for this mascara and it won&#x27;t rub off and it doesn&#x27;t take as many layers.</li>
            <li> I like this one better.</li>
            <li> I have tried mascara from department stores, sephora, all the top brands and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> so I would know :)</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara ever.</li>

            <li> Save your money and buy something better.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> In LOVE with it and will always buy this for myself and recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Some great qualities are that it glides on well with no clumps, and it only requires 4 or 5 swipes for a good look.</li>
            <li> but this mascara is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I is just like imju fiber wig but with more product</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> OK mascara, nothing fancy.  </li>
            <li> I love....</li>
            <li> or else I&#x27;ll for sure have racoon eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I simply love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve bought 5 more to stock up.  </li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t clump and depending on how many coats you put on, seems to do the job of 8.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be better off going to Walmart and spend $2.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this a try and am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used $1 mascaras that work better.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Will  purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara</li>
            <li> Better than any of the Benefit or Dior top line products.</li>
            <li> Works better for me.</li>
            <li> I use a volumizing mascara and this one on top to make them longer....</li>
            <li> bought it for my gf, said she likes it alot but its not quite her favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend any money on it - for me</li>
            <li> and i love how it makes my lashes look.</li>
            <li> Would love to see you make one without the toxins</li>
            <li> what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras over the years and have found issue with just about all of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this item and will definitely be repurchasing !</li>
            <li> I use this as a top coat to the Younique 3D Fiber mascara to lengthen lashes and prevent smudges.</li>
            <li> I did not see the results I was hoping for...no better than my L&#x27;oreal Volumnious mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it has so many reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used drug store mascaras that work better.  </li>
            <li> Not my most favorite.  </li>
            <li> But, much better than OTC.  </li>
            <li> love this mascara ...</li>
            <li> however there could be improvement if the tube had a better more thorough way of removing the excess mascara from the wand when its withdrawn from the tube ..</li>
            <li> , I think its okay</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> and I love the style of the brush.  </li>
            <li> There have been many mascara brands on my lashes, both drugstore and designer brand.</li>
            <li> The brush I think is the key to the wonderful way it manages to catch and separate your lashes.</li>
            <li> I can safely say that it lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> It does not smudge throughout the day which I love as well.</li>
            <li> This was not my favorite, not as dramatizing as I would expect from a 20 dollar mascara.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of make-up counter mascaras, and my favorite is still voluminous by loreal.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Love love love it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I discovered this mascara.</li>
            <li> It is a lot like better then sex mascara which I love.</li>
            <li> My expectations were more than exceeded.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Love how well it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> This mascara is more waterproof and lifeproof than any &amp;#34; waterproof&amp;#34; mascara I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find many that I can say I LOVE .  </li>
            <li> Maybes line makes a better one for 5 dollars</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It cost about $10 more than the Maybelline mascara that I have been using and it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes stand out.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, no clumping</li>
            <li> so you can do as many layers as you want</li>
            <li> LOVE THAT.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> I also love the name</li>
            <li> making them look better then ever.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m glad I took this one.</li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This mascara for me was just okay</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> One coat does the trick for most days and the max I&#x27;ve ever needed to apply for a night out is two.  </li>
            <li> Cover Girl and Loreal make much better ones for 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li> I paid more for the Department Store brand I used to</li>
            <li> I have been buying various mascaras for years, hunting for the perfect all-in-one that would thicken, curl and lengthen all without clumps.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and like I have way more than I do.</li>
            <li> Fantastic mascara!  </li>
            <li> The only brand I buy now as it is the best!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, this was a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t clump up either :)</li>

            <li> love it ...</li>

            <li> over-all, satisfied.</li>
            <li> i am in love.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love it like I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cover girl mascara that was better</li>
            <li> Your better off with a $7 mascara from a drugstore</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> It adds a tasteful amount of volume, layer-able for more if you&#x27;re headed for a night out, stays put, and doesn&#x27;t make a mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For someone with ultra blonde eye lashes this is a great mascara!</li>

            <li> I will order again for sure.</li>
            <li> Applies easily without clumps, no flakes, stays on all day without smudging, washes off very easily.</li>
            <li> A very good mascara running usually use Lancôme and this mascara is just as good at a better price!</li>
            <li> The best part, it does not bleed under my eyes or rub off on my upper eye lid, not even during the hot Texas summers!!!</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and clean, very smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how it even survives an intense HIIT workout at the gym!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty easy to take off which is great.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the mascara in my Ipsy bag and loved it right away.</li>

            <li> It also has amazing staying power, yet washes off clean without residue.</li>
            <li> mascara/brush is excellent at separating out every lash so they look full &amp; lush.  </li>
            <li> It also goes on cleanly and nicely.</li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much every mascara, from drugstore brands to high-end, and this is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am a 1 coat of mascara girl myself and I love that this looks as good at 5pm as it does at 5 am when I first put it on.  </li>
            <li> Not unlike what you get with a $4 tube of classic Great Lash.  </li>
            <li> I put the mascara on, it is very easy to apply, is not clumpy and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product and would highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> have so happy that my new found love</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, the color is a perfect jet black</li>
            <li> and it was easy and fast with great customer service.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves to have perfect lashes all day long.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive feedbacks from this product, I honestly thought that it would have been amazing.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a HUGE HUGE HUGE bonus in my book!!</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re mine!&amp;#34;, all thanks to this amazing mascara!</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, and my lashes are amazing !</li>
            <li> I HAD to buy the full size product, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey compared to what I normally buy, but if it lasts for 3-4 months I will be happy.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is pretty good in some ways.</li>
            <li> makes my eyelash long and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect mascara for a long time.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happier with, but this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li> And it creates a beautiful, natural look, defining each and every lash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cool when you wash it off, it kind of flakes off.</li>
            <li> With one coat you get definition and a beautiful natural look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was wanting (fuller lashes).  </li>
            <li> I have no time to get them myself but want long beautiful lashes too!</li>
            <li> My lashes were as long, voluminous and flawless as when I walked in!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> All in all, a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Lengthens eyelashes pretty good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; as it could be, but still pretty good.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.  </li>
            <li> - I tried others since my first purchase - not as good as this one</li>
            <li> Pretty good mascara.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good mascara.</li>
            <li> and it is as good as on the first try.</li>
            <li> Unless you have naturally long lashes with a curl, you need a lash curler to achieve the best results.</li>
            <li> No clumping, stays put, gives me nice full eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have pretty good length already</li>
            <li> when I first got this mascara, it was in a box from people magazine, I absolutely loved the product and continue to buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very nice mascara, not a ton of volume, but it doesn&#x27;t clump and adds decent length.  </li>
            <li> Every product that Elizabeth Mott puts out I fall in love with, but this mascara is something special!</li>
            <li> It makes big beautiful lashes and is very easily removed with water.</li>
            <li> Really good mascara is hard to find, but this product is the perfect mascara!</li>
            <li> They also stand out significantly in photos too!</li>
            <li> I was not optimistic at trying a new brand, but am oh so happy that I did.  </li>
            <li> I wore it yesterday (after using my new Eyelash Curler - INSTA-CURLER by FUCHSIA Line, which is the bomb-diggity) and the mascara itself is great.</li>
            <li> The brush is great, but the mascara itself is very watery, and comes out onto the brush in huge globs.</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros, you can get a free sample, lengths, and separates, clump free, amazing product, can be found on sale</li>
            <li> This one was one that looked great no matter what, was safe on my sensitive eyes and also was cruelty-free.  </li>
            <li> But my favorite feature is that it is easy to remove at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> It washes off nicely with a mild soap in the shower and</li>
            <li> Also, love the way it wears like waterproof mascara but is so easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Love the brush and how easily it glides on my eyelashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the coverage AND the way it washes off easily (but doesn&#x27;t lose volume all day or night).</li>
            <li> Not waterproof but sure does seem like it and washes off easily</li>
            <li> But one thing i really love is how easy it is to remove.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not tested on animals and it washes of easily, but does not smudge at all.</li>
            <li> Its OK won&#x27;t wash off easily</li>
            <li> What I really love is it is SOOOOOOOO easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply more than one coat without clumping and lashes sticking together.</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on, stays on, and how easily it is removed.</li>
            <li> and this is by far my favorite formula with a great price.</li>
            <li> all this is a great mascara, far better than departments store brands.</li>
            <li> Honestly I love love this mascara, it stays on all day, makes my eyes look fabulous</li>
            <li> This mascara is great and seller is very professional</li>
            <li> This is the single greatest beauty find since botox.  </li>
            <li> Colorstay Overtime is also pretty good at that, but this mascara is more comfortable for me to wear.  </li>
            <li> Ok, love this seller - takes full responsibility for any issue, unlike most companies theses days.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST mascara I have used for long full lashes without clumping!  </li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara!!</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;ve already found your perfect mascara but (like so many of us) continue your hunt since you think the grass MUST be greener on the other side, you may want to re-evaluate this one.</li>
            <li> So Big pleasantly exceeds it&#x27;s value in pricing and expectations!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really fussy about it, I can get some of the best lashes I&#x27;ve ever had out of this brand, but it did take some practice to get used to this particular product.</li>
            <li> This is right up there with Lancome Definicils maybe even better!</li>
            <li> LOVE, love, love this mascara so much!!  </li>
            <li> On the bright side, it did not clump at all and felt very lightweight.</li>
            <li> I know most of you are already, but for those who find that curling contraption terrifying...muster your courage and please reconsider because it makes a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy :-)</li>
            <li> This mascara greatly enhances the length and volume of your natural lashes.</li>
            <li> I use a light coat of this mascara during the day and when I want more lash</li>
            <li> If you like the natural, glam look this is a great product</li>
            <li> Great product and I like that its all natural.</li>
            <li> Most importantly it stays put.</li>
            <li> I HAD to have this one, as the reviews made it sound better than sliced bread.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many mascaras...from cheap to pricey.</li>
            <li> I feel like the travel sized brush has better coverage than this full size, but I still love the product</li>
            <li> This is a nice balance for me as usually tubulars seem to work best for me.  </li>
            <li> It added incredible length and somehow adhered to tiny lashes</li>
            <li> This mascara is absolutely fabulous, and i&#x27;ve tried some well known and seemingly pricey brands that were supposed to be all that and more.  </li>
            <li> General on the lashes and just beautiful.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with how long, full and awesome</li>
            <li> This mascara is the most fabulous mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It lengthens and thickens my lashes and even more importantly it stays on throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and cruelty free :)</li>
            <li> Great if you have naturally curled lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried the free sample before buying this.  </li>
            <li> I see my mother regularly and on her own she even commented how nice my lashes looked!  </li>
            <li> Love how light this mascara feels on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty sure it also layers and builds nicely.  </li>
            <li> Surprised to find this to be a really great product.</li>
            <li> Its not that this mascara doesn&#x27;t work, its just that the cheap one does a better job.</li>
            <li> I also love that this mascara is cruelty free and does not test on animals.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s cruelty free.</li>
            <li> For the most part though it stays on nicely, and I&#x27;m pretty picky about mascara.</li>
            <li> I was using the djv beautenizer mascara before trying this one and loved it so much that I ordered another one.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara as a gift and loved it so much I bought another for myself once it ran out.</li>
            <li> The good reviews really are because it gives them really good lengthening for those of us with almost nonexistent lashes and yet is also really wearable long-lasting and doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge so you can wear it all day and night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not averse to spending money on a good product, but this one really disappoints.</li>
            <li> It was nice to try, but I don&#x27;t think it was worth it</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara, it makes my eyelashes look bigger, it stays all the day, but it is also easy to remove without damaging my eyelashes!</li>
            <li> It goes on very clean and doesn&#x27;t smudge or settle in my fine lines.</li>
            <li> The formula allows you to lengthen so easily, and multiple coats add a perfect amount of volume for natural-looking but full lashes.</li>
            <li> At $10 less than Younique, and $10 more than L&#x27;Oreal, this is the perfect mascara.</li>
            <li> So I stopped ordering that brand and decided to give Elizabeth Mott a try because of all the positive reviews!!!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re so FINE eyeliner because I am thus far very pleased with your products!</li>
            <li> they kind of just peel right off your lashes.</li>
            <li> The way it comes off reminds me of blinc mascara, you can use warm water and some pressure and it comes right off.  </li>
            <li> Hubs noticed it right away, and liked it.</li>
            <li> This stuff slides right off your lashes with warm water.  </li>
            <li> It dries fast so its quick and easy to make your eyes look great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best mascara available &amp; that includes even the high end ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also love that you can get a free sample (that arrives super quick!!)</li>
            <li> Truely!  </li>
            <li> other than that, its been great!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to pay more for mascara, but it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li> best masacar ever-will not buy any other mascara</li>
            <li> I only need 2 swipes and I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li> pretty much love it!</li>
            <li> I have oily eye lids and most mascara ends up under my eyes after a couple hours, so I&#x27;m always excited when I find one that doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using and really love it!</li>
            <li> I think my original order was a dud or maybe sitting around in inventory because I love this stuff</li>
            <li> This mascara is perfect and doesn&#x27;t need to be used with other mascara.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t smudge after you brush it on and every coat consistently adds more layers and volume to your lashes!</li>
            <li> I have purchased a full size already!</li>
            <li> i had gotten a sample, and used it up quickly, so i ordered the full size, and i like it even better!</li>

            <li> It stays on-- doesn&#x27;t flake or run-- yet easy to wash off.</li>

            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The very day I got this magic mascara and lovingly applied it to my lashes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a good buy and could very well be as good or even better than your current favorite, but I&#x27;d probably take the inordinate amount of glowing reviews with a grain of salt.</li>
            <li> Good look -- I only do one coat and get nice definition and volume (though I do employ an eyelash curler before applying).&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> I had high hopes since the reviews were mostly good.</li>
            <li> The wand does a good job of separating the lashes, and the mascara is high quality and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I am VERY pleased and this is most definitely my new brand.  </li>
            <li> it takes 3 quick coats -- but stays on ALL day long yet washes off in a flash -- I&#x27;ve ordered twice and will continue to order this awesome &amp;#34;eye opening&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It also comes off pretty easily, but doesn&#x27;t run while it is on, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> I have taken it to photoshoots with me and suggested it to the makeup artist,  they liked it so much they were asking me where they could order it!  </li>
            <li> And better yet, my lashes look so full and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to order a full size and one more for my sister.</li>
            <li> it leaves my lashes full and sexy.  </li>
            <li> My opinion is totally different: the mascara makes my, not existent, lashes beautiful.</li>
            <li> I quickly fell in love with it and had to buy the full size!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the BEST mascara ever for NO smearing or racoon eyes!!!!</li>
            <li> hands down BEST mascara</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best mascara i have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, THE BEST mascara I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> should:  goes on smoothly, non-clumping, easy to apply, stays on all day, easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> Best mascara, hands down.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Ok, I never write reviews, but I am soooooo in LOVE with this new mascara I bought!!!</li>
            <li> It is smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this at first, but I came to really love it and will be re-ordering.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, this mascara truly is superior to anything I&#x27;ve tried in the past -  everything from $7 Maybelline Great Lash to $40 Dior.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is fine</li>
            <li> I just use a lash brush and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, smooth and lengthens my lashes.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with results - I have sensitive eyes and most mascaras</li>
            <li> I loved it so much, I had to buy a full size.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s extremely important that the formula removes easily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> it does voluminize but on me it falkes in less than 3 hours, not so impressed for the cost it shouldnt flake</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, washes off easily.  </li>
            <li> such as it doesn&#x27;t clump, it doesn&#x27;t smudge even when sleeping in with it on, and best of all if i go for a swim without washing my face first</li>
            <li> After years of avoiding mascara because it seeped into fine lines, I decided to give it another try.</li>
            <li> I have fine lashes and this mascara thickens and lengthens them.</li>
            <li> I loved the sample so much, I bought the full size here.</li>
            <li> Does not flake off easily, which is important since I wear contacts, but also not like a waterproof mascara where you have to scrub and scrub to get it off.</li>
            <li> Just a smooth and easy application</li>
            <li> It makes my fine lashes pop.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light and easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t get clumpy.</li>
            <li> It is also slightly waterproof which is great for outdoor wear and pool season!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even ordered samples for my girlfriends and the customer service has been  excellent - they responded within 2 hours or less on both of my inquiries.</li>
            <li> Also, fabulous customer service - they responded very quickly when I submitted a question.  </li>
            <li> less money and am happy with that too!</li>
            <li> Maybe stick with three coats and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> It would be absolutely perfect if a darker black.</li>
            <li> Its fine</li>
            <li> I was expecting this mascara to make my fine lashes appear thicker and longer - it does neither.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t perfect - I started getting smears under my eyese by mid-afternoon, but that was after about 6 hours, not 1 or 2 like the previous products.</li>
            <li> I have super fine lashes and has tried many mascaras.</li>
            <li> I used to use the cheap Maybelline mascaras which kept me content for a while, but whenever I try to remove it with makeup wipes, it was NOT an easy job.</li>
            <li> Still worthy of five stars, but let this serve as a warning!</li>
            <li> Having it Prime is a plus and super convenient!</li>
            <li> Will be loyal to this brand from now on :)</li>
            <li> The style of the brush takes a biiit of getting used to, but it&#x27;s a quick adjustment!</li>
            <li> I bought this one and another brand that is more bold</li>
            <li> Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipped quick, too!</li>
            <li> What I like most is that this mascara dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t smudge around my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I am still super satisfied.</li>
            <li> One good coat will stay on pretty good until the next day.  </li>
            <li> Really couldn&#x27;t ask for a better mascara!</li>
            <li> It has a good strong color to it yet has a slightly natural look to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to layer to create a high volume look or you can use just a few strokes for an great length and beautiful definition.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a 1-step, non-smearing, easy to apply mascara that would make a significant difference to my fine eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> so when I found this mascara to be effective, it was pretty significant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been subscribed to ipsy for a while, and received many great products, but none of them were great enough to convince me to shell out big bucks for a full size product.</li>
            <li> Came very fast!!</li>
            <li> Very quick and friendly service.</li>
            <li> My eyes look brilliant again, dark lashes but not goth-black, easy application, wears well throughout the heat and humidity, easy to remove, no flaking, no itching, no fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily (the shape of the brush is unique and seems to keep the mascara from clumping on your lashes)</li>
            <li> Long full lashes that wipe of with water!!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump, wand is great for lower lashes, and nice rich black color c</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I ordered a full size right away!</li>
            <li> The mascara comes out in one huge glob around the brush.</li>
            <li> I have to scrape the brush along the opening to get the huge excess off every time before applying it.</li>
            <li> Makes my eyes look huge, but I can&#x27;t ever feel that I have it on.</li>
            <li> I do not need to curl my eyelashes with this mascara, which is a huge time saver for me.  </li>
            <li> Either way, I am thrilled with this product, and I really hope that it stays available for years to come.  </li>
            <li> It feels amazing and soft when you apply it, which I love.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m also a huge fan of their mascara tool:</li>
            <li> I have a huge issue with mascara smudging.</li>
            <li> But So Big wears so lightly, it feels great.  </li>
            <li> There is a huge difference immediately.  </li>
            <li> the difference was HUGE.  </li>
            <li> I can apply a nice coat to every lash, even the shrubbery in the outside corners of my eyes - and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Goes on clean and smooth, stays all day, washes off with water easily at night.</li>
            <li> It applies very well and makes the eyelashes look amazing.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li> I wish it were great, but it simply does not add volume or depth to lashes in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The only thing that kept this from being a one-star review: The ultra-black pigmentation was great...</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Better Than Sex wins.</li>
            <li> I received a free tube of this mascara in a gift box along with my People Plus magazine subscription.  </li>
            <li> It not only looks great when you&#x27;re wearing it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and liked it so much</li>
            <li> This stuff has a smooth application but that&#x27;s where the positives end.</li>
            <li> I called and got the free sample of this mascara because of all the Amazon reviews on it.</li>
            <li> This was worth every dollar, I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I was going to buy the 3D but read such great reviews</li>
            <li> I was not given this product for free in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li> It has to be both the brush and the formula that are fantastic.</li>
            <li> The name doesn&#x27;t fit the product.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is, in a word, FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> So BIG Volumizing&amp;#34; I still have to use my 3D Fibers lol</li>
            <li> Great mascara overall.</li>
            <li> I figured, what the heck, I&#x27;ll spend a bit more just to see if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and is not clumpy at all.  </li>
            <li> The lengthening is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It does not clump and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, DOES NOT FLAKE, SMEAR OR CLUMP, even after a 12 hour day.</li>
            <li> Awesome mascara, I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The page says they will send you a free sample</li>
            <li> I put it on at 6:00 a.m. and take it off at 10:00 p.m. with no smudging, no flaking, just amazing lashes the whole day</li>
            <li> I have become a walking billboard for the stuff, to the point of if I notice someone has some mascara smudge going I tell them about this mascara and give them detailed instructions on buying it.</li>
            <li> THAT IS AVAILABLE</li>
            <li> When you wash it off with warm water, you can literally gently pull off the mascara, as it seems to coat your lashes rather than just paint them.</li>
            <li> I was also thrilled with how fast I received the product.</li>
            <li> The mascara goes on smooth and I like that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li> This mascara is flake free and does not run.</li>
            <li> Not a crazy plastic brush like many others.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> I started using a cheap mascara for the thickening aspect</li>
            <li> My lashes looked great, although I do think you should use a eyelash curler prior to using this mascara.</li>
            <li> * Happy to report that I can already update my initial review.</li>
            <li> I asked for the free sample.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great mascara that she will buy again.</li>
            <li> Not sticky or clumpy, goes on smooth .</li>
            <li> The formula is light, but still lengthens my lashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an all around fabulous product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this mascara has such great reviews.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth...</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it and have just received my 3rd tube.</li>
            <li> wish it was available in the stores.</li>
            <li> This product makes my light lashes PIGGITY-POP without &amp;#34;leaking&amp;#34; color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m hooked and will likely never switch to something else.</li>
            <li> Works well, smooth, Does not come off.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate that it&#x27;s a cruelty free</li>
            <li> but my eyes are light and my skin gets really light during the winter, it adds the definition and contrast</li>
            <li> I wear contact lenses and that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for cruelty free mascara.</li>
            <li> Overall if your looking for a great mascara this might be the one for</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> This mascara goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> This mascara was great, but would still smudge some, especially if I used something like foundation or moisturizer on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the cheap ones from drug stores</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, no clumping or bleeding and my lashes just get longer and longer with each pass.  </li>
            <li> The second mascara worked great</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t bleed or flake.</li>
            <li> but they are light in color and therefore don&#x27;t stand out without mascara.  </li>
            <li> I also took advantage of the free sample offered on the website.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is fantastic--</li>
            <li> I received a faulty tube and they immediately contacted me and replaced it for free.</li>
            <li> Fabulous brush----best</li>
            <li> I thought only Sephora and Nordstrom&#x27;s had the Great Products.  </li>
            <li> AND the ethics of product testing is really important to me.</li>
            <li> I am 55, blue-eyed, with lashes so light</li>
            <li> For me one of the important factors in a mascara is that it stays put and doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s cruelty free</li>
            <li> My tip: volume is not as important.</li>
            <li> I registered on Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s website for a free mascara sample and forgot about it until a surprise package in the mail.</li>
            <li> (it was a free sample).  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see as much volume as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Fantastic mascara - lengthens lashes, doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it, and the maker is lovely as well.  </li>
            <li> When my package got lost, she insisted on sending me another tube for free.  </li>
            <li> is smooth.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money :)</li>
            <li> Or go to the website and get a free sample and try it.</li>
            <li> I much prefer 2000 Calorie mascara for its reasonable price, great application, and making my lashes look fabulous.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I do not get much in the way of volume, but I do get nice definition and length.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, the second i received my item, I tried it on, hoping for the great results everyone was talking about.</li>
            <li> This would be awesome for a few days of camping.</li>
            <li> The brush is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look fantastic.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you are missing out on a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased another one for a present because I want to share this great</li>
            <li> I have tried many different mascaras and this is by far the best out there!  </li>
            <li> also let me know that they give free samples.</li>
            <li> I used about 4 coats and I used an eyelash comb which I think is important to achieve that look.</li>
            <li> The last tube I ordered was great</li>
            <li> but overall this mascara is great.</li>
            <li> The product went on smooth and without clumping.  </li>
            <li> I work as a hiking guide in Alaska, and I like to maintain some girliness in my work and part of that includes having fabulous lashes while hiking the windy ridges.  </li>
            <li> Over time, the mascara does get thicker and tends a bit toward clumping but this is still a great product overall.</li>
            <li> This one is perfect for everyday and reminds me of the 2000 calorie mascara by Maxfactor (which isn&#x27;t sold in the US anymore).</li>
            <li> My lashes stay curled and fabulous all day</li>
            <li> It is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Overall: Great for a one-time buy</li>
            <li> However, they are too light, never lengthened my lashes</li>
            <li> I have always been a confirmed Lancome mascara user.  </li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this mascara about 2 weeks ago, and have used it 8 times.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s no different than Maybelline Great Lash, and I would have been furious if I&#x27;d dropped $20 on a tube of this.</li>
            <li> Fabulous stuff.  </li>
            <li> but really all you need is warm water and a washcloth.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth with no clumps</li>
            <li> Its really and truly amazing.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and does not clump or flake off.</li>
            <li> After research I found this &amp;#34;BIG&amp;#34; cruelty free.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes in the slightest and it makes my lashes look fabulous.</li>
            <li> and this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> , it looks great all day until I remove it with a facial cleaning cloth at 9pm.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly surprised by all of the good reviews on here.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this mascara in a gift box and liked it so much I ordered another tube from Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure to do more than one coat to really see a difference.  </li>
            <li> My Maybelline from the drugstore is a far superior product.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for making such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Imagine my delight when I used this mascara and found long beautiful lases again.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making such a great product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got one that was old, but i don&#x27;t understand the good reviews.</li>
            <li> Just got this and so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good though.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> It has a nice brush and it goes on smoothly but it doesn&#x27;t do much for volume, thus the 3 star review.</li>
            <li> Does not smear, nice brush, BIG Volumizing, beeswax gives it a nice texture.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands that are cheaper and just as good.</li>
            <li> Good for a natural Look</li>
            <li> My Covergirl mascara is far superior.</li>
            <li> I searched online for a good mascara and read many reviews on different mascara brands.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good for my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Great mascara, makes my lashes look very full and long!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t need a primer, it goes on beautifully and is super easy to build, it never, ever runs, it comes off easily with makeup remover (or even water and a washcloth if you&#x27;re in a pinch), and it never irritates my eyes or makes me feel like I have dry lashes.</li>
            <li> It comes off very easily with just warm water - I lightly rub my eyelashes at the sink in the evening between my index finger and thumb with some warm water, since the mascara contains fibers to build volume they come off like little tubes</li>
            <li> What I like best is that it looks great after application and all day long but removes easily with plain soap and water.</li>
            <li> again-originally received this in a People VIP gift and right away fell in love with it and ordered another one.</li>
            <li> L. F. Waterproof.)&lt;br /&gt;It is my favorite right now.</li>
            <li> I fell in love right away.</li>
            <li> It is so very beautiful and very black.  </li>
            <li> (This is my favorite part and haven&#x27;t experienced this with any other mascara.)</li>
            <li> Comes off really easily with water, but for me that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li> It actually makes a huge difference in highlighting my eyes!!!</li>
            <li> Really???!!!  </li>
            <li> I have sooo much looove for this mascara!!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!  </li>
            <li> and she loves it as much as I do!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more!!</li>
            <li> Being an older woman with skimpy eye lashes, I have finally found the perfect Mascara!  </li>
            <li> This is seriously the best, most foolproof mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It looks fabulous on and its super easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Only thing I do not like about it is that it sometimes clumps my eyelashes but other than that great mascara with no smudging and provides good volume!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara &amp; highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many mascaras and after reading the reviews I had high hopes for this one.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several high dollar mascaras waiting for the perfect one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands both high end and drug store brands and all</li>
            <li> Clinique and Mac have a few that are perfect but not waterproof, or they are waterproof but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but didn&#x27;t make my lashes much longer and the formula makes the lashes stick together</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flake off throughout the day, stays put (even when tears are involved), and builds nicely during application so you can get some decent lashes.  </li>
            <li> so applying in a rush is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> Stays on all day without smudging or flaking but comes off super easy with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Received a sample in an ipsy subscription, liked it so much that I ordered the full size version.</li>
            <li> and I have to say this particular item is so deserving of me taking the time to leave a review</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to take off with just water and a quick swipe with cloth (in case you forget your makeup remover).</li>
            <li> The mascara comes of super easily too.</li>
            <li> It wears well all day, and comes off easily with a mild face soap.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking (off and on) for a mascara that I would like as much as my beloved Full N&#x27; Soft by Mabelline since I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> For me, this mascara didn&#x27;t clump and it washed off super easy in the shower, no soap or ripping out eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The process of removing the make-up it quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> Comes off super easy in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mascara certainly worth trying if you&#x27;re at all interested.</li>
            <li> Overall,  it stays when and where it needs to stay, is easy to clean off when that time comes &amp; it does not irritate my eyes at all!!!</li>
            <li> However, it washes off very easy with gentle soap and water.  </li>
            <li> I really like how well it stays all day, without flaking, but washes off very easily.</li>
            <li> No other mascara I&#x27;ve used is as good as this one.</li>
            <li> Now this mascara is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> This is without a question my new favorite product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite mascara!</li>

            <li> In a nutshell... this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> My new favorite!</li>
            <li> I understand why it&#x27;s a high end price because it&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li> You know when you buy department store mascara for $30, you are getting luxe, amazing quality item that warrants the high price tag.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara, and I&#x27;ve tried too many to count.</li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara. :)</li>
            <li> Editing my initial review, as Elizabeth Mott has provided me a new bottle that worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve ever tried and continue to go back to it even though I like to try new mascaras.</li>
            <li> and I could see a huge difference in length right away!</li>
            <li> and I enjoy using it on special occasions.</li>
            <li> Excellent volumizing mascara that really works and lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> It went on super smooth and light</li>
            <li> Super happy with results after trying a couple different &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34</li>
            <li> What I also love is that it is so easy to remove and you don&#x27;t need to be rubbing your eyes much when removing your makeup.</li>
            <li> but what I really like is how easily it comes off.:)</li>
            <li> This mascara looks great giving me length, volume and absolutely no smudging but washes off easily.</li>
            <li> My third time buying his amazing mascara!</li>
            <li> I also sweat a lot and boy does it stay put - but total washes off easily - amazing!</li>
            <li> So Big mascara is so far the best I have used and not at a HUGE price.  </li>
            <li> I also love love love the contour of the brush which is so helpful especially when applying to lower lashes.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the cost!</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say that I am not disappointed in my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Super fine, defines lashes, not clumpy.  </li>
            <li> And the price is worth it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still love this mascara, it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed do</li>
            <li> I love this mascara so much!</li>
            <li> This mascara is definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I mix it with another mascara for a great long wearing,long lash look.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this mascara, I excitedly placed an order for a sample on the company&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> It is so worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve tried it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> I was NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li> That did NOT happen with the original mascara.</li>
            <li> Originally got this mascara in one of my subscription boxes (forget which one).  </li>
            <li> Friendly seller and prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> I was so excited</li>
            <li> I am pretty pleased with this mascara.</li>
            <li> GIven the reviews, I was so excited to get this.  </li>
            <li> Original</li>
            <li> At first it took me awhile to love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many, many mascaras and this is the only one that is volumizing and leaves no smudges.  </li>
            <li> This mascara makes my lashes look long and attractive, stays on all day</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Soon after leaving my review I was contacted by a friendly rep from Elizabeth Mott, she apologized and offered to send replacement mascara.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, they also refunded the $20 I originally paid.</li>
            <li> All mascaras run on me except original Blinc...</li>
            <li> but well worth it!  </li>
            <li> I first received this mascara in my monthly ipsy bag and I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just use normal face soap, too--the kind that doesn&#x27;t hurt the eyes--and wash all over.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Amazon review, and I buy stuff through Amazon all the time - that&#x27;s how much I love this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more interested in lengthening.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this mascara</li>
            <li> First tried it through my ipsy glambag subscription and had to buy more.</li>
            <li> It is well worth $20 a tube!</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t figured out the trick yet, but all and all its a WONDERFUL product and probably the only mascara I will be purchasing in the future :)</li>
            <li> Originally received a sample size of this product in an ipsy bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teacher so any product has to be able stand up to a pretty rigorous reality.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I originally got a sample of this mascara from Ipsy.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to see how well this mascara held up.</li>
            <li> Lasts quite a long time, great applicator, and DOESN&#x27;T FLAKE.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> This unique hour glass brush distributes the mascara evenly, without clumps and adds volume and length.</li>
            <li> but this one is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I usually use two coats and my lashes look great!</li>
            <li> The Mott company reached out to me about the refund and sent me a full size mascara free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s So Big and am thrilled that I did!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price ! </li>
            <li> I received this mascara originally by being a VIP with People magazine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the $20!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes need all the help they can get to even be visible, and this did a nice job of making them look normal.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara so much!</li>
            <li> The price is great and it wears ALL day long.</li>
            <li> I first tried it when I received a sample through an ipsy box and fell in love with it since then.</li>
            <li> I received a sample in a beauty bag subscription and it was love at first use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run or clump and is by far one of my very favorite.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> But the difference in the look of my eyelashes is worth the drawbacks!</li>
            <li> the first time I applied it, I thought it was okay.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li> I was more interested in volume than in added length, but this mascara does both.  </li>
            <li> I lost more than five hairs after taking it from first use.</li>
            <li> This one wins!</li>
            <li> It is also unique in that when you take it off, it doesn&#x27;t run,  </li>
            <li> : Been using this mascara ever since I originally ordered it.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about trying your mascara.</li>
            <li> and I was so excited to try it on.</li>
            <li> Cover Girl - Lash Exact would be better for me.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a great product like this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Worth to try!</li>
            <li> That might change after this success!</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money if you don&#x27;t need true waterproof mascara!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY other mascaras and this on is the best by far.</li>
            <li> Gives your lashes great length and definition, lasts all day long with NO SMUDGES!  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many other mascaras through the years and this one is by far the best for volume and  length with no clumping or flaking.  </li>
            <li> It just looked like my eyelashes got a nice new shiny paint job.</li>
            <li> What I love even more, no messy removal.  </li>
            <li> It washes completely clean with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I am sure you will enjoy it as much as me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had far better mascara for a way better price at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> I will go back to Lamcome which is the best so far</li>
            <li> I was not blessed with full, long eyelashes and have been searching for a great mascara to help volumize and elongate them.</li>
            <li> Overall alone it kind of created spider lashes after so many coats.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but doesn&#x27;t quite fit the description of BIG volume.</li>
            <li> Went on smoothly with no clumping and after a nine hour shift it looks as good now as when I left the house.</li>
            <li> Overall, a really nice mascara that coats evenly on both top and bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li> Prior to this happening I thought this mascara was OK, nothing amazing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump, lengthens, stays on and washes clean with soap and water..</li>
            <li> and it still looks clean.</li>
            <li> Honestly it did nothing more than any standard drug store mascara.  </li>
            <li> I like that the mascara is easy to remove, but it clumps, and I&#x27;m not crazy about the application brush.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t stand having to clean up around my eyes after applying;</li>
            <li> This mascara can be put on to be natural looking or nice and bold; easily layered to suit your needs.</li>
            <li> Well, let me say, as most other reviewers, this is pretty much the perfect mascara.  </li>
            <li> but when I saw how many positive reviews this one had, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> and this one is by far my favorite!  </li>
            <li> This mascara is far better than Dior Show!</li>
            <li> My 54-year old eyes never had better looking, flirtier eyelashes without using those falsies from the 80&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I get more product on my lashes thanks to the big, contoured brush, and the results are spectacular!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for volume, won&#x27;t add super long length though.</li>
            <li> I love love love it, it makes my lashes full and long.</li>
            <li> And easy to remove with water, mine peels right off in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about making sure</li>
            <li> This is really good mascara--not dry or clumpy even after a month of use; it goes on gently and makes even my lashes amazing.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why this mascara has such good ratings!</li>
            <li> I am always looking for better mascara; this stuff is really good, I have not had any issues with flaking or smearing; my mother tried it out the other day, and said &amp;#34;Where</li>
            <li> I still use this (1-2 coats) under my Max Factor mascara (that one still gives me more volume quickly), but the Max tends to clump a little more (so using them together leads to the best outcome for me personally).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product; I&#x27;ll certainly order it again.</li>
            <li> Nothing special at all...</li>
            <li> nothing outstanding and certainly inferior to Mally, Tarte and Lancôme mascaras.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to use a special eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Instead, I gave it as a gift to the special people in my life.</li>
            <li> But nothing special.</li>
            <li> so I went right in the bathroom and applied my shadow and liner and then - this mascara  NO CLUMPING!  </li>
            <li> Overall great product and will be back for more!</li>
            <li> Application is great, not much clumping, and clean up is a cinch.</li>
            <li> So I was super excited to get this mascara because I read all the reviews</li>
            <li> I hardly even have to think about it and best of all, no battle against the dreaded forces at the mall/nearest makeup counter.</li>
            <li> But when my attending shows up in the morning my lashes still look great, and no one can tell how rough my night was.  </li>
            <li> I first experienced it through my ipsy bag and knew I would be a regular customer.</li>
            <li> great product after I used it the first time I reorder a second tube that day</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and expected great mascara.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to pay more than I usually do for mascara if it held up to my expectation.</li>
            <li> Received the first one as a gift from People magazine and was happy to track the second one on Amazon because none of the department stores sell it</li>
            <li> and it is truely amaziing.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but it is well worth the money, trust me (and I&#x27;m cheap).  </li>
            <li> It provides full lashes without clumping.</li>
            <li> I never completely liked them but they were the best I could find until now.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara so much though.  </li>
            <li> Very volumizing, one of the better mascaras I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I bought the sample to try out -- then bought the full size.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve tried more than 20+ mascaras and came across this one, and after reading all the rave reviews really wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real Mascara&amp;#34; and I love it</li>
            <li> It really pumps up my skinny lashes better than fancy department store brands or drugstore favorites.  </li>
            <li> I love the way the brush separates my straight lashes</li>
            <li> More of a straight forward mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I went ahead and ordered it because....I really like it.</li>
            <li> Still looks good the next AM!</li>
            <li> and I still love it just as much.  </li>
            <li> I make all of my own skincare products and all of the makeup I wear from natural products to be frugal-</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect mascara since I was in my late teens</li>
            <li> It coats your lashes and will not smear or smudge, but comes off completely with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li> I know they&#x27;ll be buying the full size soon.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and shipped appropriately.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m cool with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for full lashes.</li>
            <li> The only good part about this mascara is there is a lot of product in the tube.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara, but I love the shape of the wand used.  </li>
            <li> Brush was good at reaching my shortest inner lashes too.</li>
            <li> My mother, who&#x27;s very critical of beauty products, even loved it.</li>
            <li> My lashes were full and it the mascara lengthened it beyond belief.</li>
            <li> I immediately bought the full size mascara</li>
            <li> It was way bigger than the sample size which was surprising.</li>
            <li> I love that I can wear this mascara the whole day and it will not smudge or give me raccoon eyes since I also wear it on my bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> I notice no flaking after a full day in the water world of dentistry.</li>
            <li> I ordered two full size from Elizabeth Motts website.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also so lightweight that your lashes stay soft and nice to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I threw away the packaging because I really thought Id love it</li>
            <li> and Amazon fast shipping what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t really had many issues resulting from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a sample size in my Ipsy Glam Bag, and had to order the full size.</li>
            <li> I received a sample in my Ipsy bag and I have since purchased two full size mascaras through Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to thick, perfect texture!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably return this if it wasn&#x27;t such a hassle - not that it isn&#x27;t a good mascara, because it is.</li>
            <li> or They&#x27;re Real by Benefit, which have been my favorite brand since forever.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and so much cheaper than Lancome.</li>
            <li> The full size is clumpy and flakes off my lashes.</li>
            <li> :-)&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky about mascara, but will never switch brands again.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, really thickens and lengthens lashes.  </li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about the customer service.</li>
            <li> Needs a mild eye makeup remover to clean off  </li>
            <li> They stopped making it a year ago and since then, I&#x27;ve accumulated a drawer full of mascaras that did not deliver as promised.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my Dior Show and realized how superior that brand is compared to this Elizabeth Mott stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the product and was shipped very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Received a sample in my ipsy bag and had to order the full size.</li>
            <li> Really made my lashes look fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I have found that as I age, mascara just isn&#x27;t a sure thing anymore, no matter how much I spend on it.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I have many requirements when I look for a mascara, as it is the most important cosmetic for me personally.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this product.  </li>
            <li> so it has to be true, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t totally blow me out of the park, but it has some really good points.</li>
            <li> But best of all, it doesn&#x27;t make them clumpy thick -- look caked on.</li>
            <li> but it just seems to be good, standard mascara.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different mascaras for years (my favorite was discontinued) from cheap mascaras to top brand name mascaras</li>
            <li> The wand has an interesting shape which allows you to really work the product into your lashes.</li>
            <li> Full coverage, plenty of volume and length.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good about this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I got a sample as part of my ipsy subscription, and replaced it with a full size tube as soon as it ran out.</li>
            <li> Applying makes most of my lashes stick together and look very clumpy.  </li>
            <li> True to review.</li>
            <li> You need to spend a good minute scraping the brush against the tube so all that extra mascara doesn&#x27;t get all over.  </li>
            <li> and she needed 15 coats just to get enough on the lashes to do any good.</li>
            <li> Every claim they make is true.  </li>
            <li> I like how full it makes my lashes look</li>
            <li> The way the brush is shaped really reaches more of my lashes as I&#x27;m applying the mascara.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not really bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> The mascara its self however is not bad.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used hands down!!!</li>
            <li> Love it, not clumpy and natural looking!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> It washes off easily with just warm water but comes off in small pieces; kind of reminds me of washing latex paint off of a brush, but easier.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of satisfied customers on here that have stated otherwise, and if you&#x27;re looking for a new volumizing mascara and are comfortable with the price tag</li>
            <li> I really liked this mascara and felt it was worth trying out something new.</li>
            <li> I loved how it separated my lashes, made them look nice and full, didn&#x27;t smudge or smear, and was super easy to wash off with regular facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It goes on so easy and smooth and really lengthens.</li>
            <li> I not only liked how this held up, the application was easy and even.</li>
            <li> Although this is a product my wife bought, When I asked her, she absolutely loved it, color was what she expected, easy to use</li>
            <li> Finally - A mascara that goes on, stays on, doesn&#x27;t smudge and comes off easily with a warm washcloth.</li>
            <li> This mascara is nice, gives some good volume and all, but it still clumps just as much as any other cheaper mascara I&#x27;ve tried from the Drugstore.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and stays on pretty well, however is tends to flake a tad towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Legitimately the first mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump, is easy to take off, and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> It doesnt make my eyes water, it comes off pretty easily</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump and it has a pretty easy application.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy to remove with just soap and water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to remove with make-up remover, and has a slim and pretty case.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge and it was pretty easy to wash off</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried them all- from high end to the famous - drug store- &#x27;pink one&#x27; great lash-</li>
            <li> I am THRILLED with this product, its well worth the couple extra bucks to not have to use two mascaras that aren&#x27;t near as good to begin with</li>
            <li> Just as other reviewers have said, this is great mascara.</li>
            <li> If you have trouble keeping your mascara on, then this one is a good one to try!</li>
            <li> somewhat of a gel, and goes on without the clumping and flaking I have experienced with other mascara&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this mascara as long as it&#x27;s available and look forward to trying many more Elizabeth Mott cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I feel like it strengthens my lashes rather than damage them as I have experienced with other mascaras.</li>
            <li> other than that it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li> It gives me full and long looking lashes, doesn&#x27;t clump, does not smear, and my favorite aspect about this mascara is that it is SO easy to remove!</li>
            <li> love my new mascara!</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best mascara I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> Seriously the best mascara I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> This is the best if you want some serious volume.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome love it much better than the lancome product I used previously and half the price</li>
            <li> I too, have searched far and wide for the best mascara.  </li>
            <li> Super, I just bought because of reviews</li>
            <li> It did not do anything extraordinary to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried an unreasonable number of mascaras trying to find one that doesn&#x27;t smudge on my super oily skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly with no clumps, not heavy if I want more I just put another layer on.</li>
            <li> Most have left me dis-satisfied, hence trying to find something better.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loyal to two types, this is one of them.</li>
            <li> its so light that its perfect for those with UBER THIN LASHES.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara because of the Prime access, however it was nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li> I went to the website to get the trial size offer and it shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the product itself, no Racoon eyes after hours of wear, only reason not 5 star, the brush could be designed better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal</li>
            <li> so Big is not a miracle worker, when you are blessed with short lashes, but it is the best my lashes have ever looked.  </li>
            <li> It can quickly.</li>
            <li> Luckily, this product doesn&#x27;t screw up my eyemakeup if I get it on my lids.</li>
            <li> This mascara works, but it&#x27;s not anything super extraordinary.</li>
            <li> I was quickly sent a replacement bottle and it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> And as she says it is a super mascara.</li>
            <li> quick delivery too.  </li>
            <li> The seller delivered the product quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s adequate.</li>
            <li> Quick Delivery</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many different mascaras over the years in search of the &amp;#34;perfect one&amp;#34; and I can truly say my search has ended!!</li>
            <li> The sample arrived quickly and gave me some assurance before making a purchase.  </li>
            <li> When I have FINALLY found the perfect mascara, it&#x27;s cause for celebration and a big thank you for creating this masterpiece.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many many mascaras and this one is totally IT!</li>
            <li> , there is just a few of us that can&#x27;t get good results with most mascaras.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly</li>
            <li> It goes on quickly and makes my lashes look longer.  </li>
            <li> I usually am a loyal user of Blinc Mascara, which is a tube mascara.  </li>
            <li> but I love it so much I am willing to pay the higher price.</li>
            <li> But a quick swipe of coconut oil takes care of that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super  clumpy.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> Since I fell pregnant in April I have become allergic to all the make up</li>
            <li> But I only do 2-3 coats, and according to the box, you could do many more coats to get that volume.</li>
            <li> It made my lashes stick together, look super sparse and clumpy.  </li>
            <li> I have tried to many different mascaras I would never be able to keep track.  </li>
            <li> but you must work quickly or it gets clumpy.  </li>
            <li> Im 8 months pregnant and</li>
            <li> I did find a good one that I like by Lancôme for a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> My advice, continue using what you currently have for Mascara, you will be more pleased.</li>
            <li> The brush has an interesting shape, so you never apply more product than necessary to eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It layers on as much or as little as you want it to make your lashes bold and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes that water very easily, so it can&#x27;t irritate my eyes or run</li>
            <li> I have many other pretty good mascaras in my collection</li>
            <li> One positive is that it does stay on you lashes and all day without flaking and easy to take off.</li>
            <li> I know from experience that products highly reviewed by others often aren&#x27;t satisfying for me at all, but thought I&#x27;d give this brand a try after googling Elizabeth Mott.  </li>
            <li> Better then high end leading brands.</li>
            <li> they stopped growing at all after so many pulling spells in high school.</li>
            <li> Makeup removers don&#x27;t work very well to take this off, but plain ol&#x27; water works just great!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it for super long and over coated lashes for length  and volume that some reviewers want, I just want a good product that stays on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly &amp; didn&#x27;t mind spending a bit more than I normally would.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run, comes off easily with makeup remover, doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my lashes look nice and long.</li>
            <li> This mascara has great coverage, doesn&#x27;t clump or leave dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty and feels light on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have tried other masacaras of this calibre but this one by far works best.</li>
            <li> I had been using blinc which I also liked over other products but find this even better.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was expecting something great and it was just average.  </li>
            <li> you can decide exactly how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; you want your lashes by adding additional layers of the smooth formula.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with It&#x27;s so BIG Volumizing mascara!</li>
            <li> My lashes are long and full, and even better it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or leave me with raccoon eyes :)</li>
            <li> Received it first as a free sample from a magazine</li>
            <li> Funny - received a free sample in a People Magazine VIP reward.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I have long and good lashes</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Mott was kind enough to send me a sample, which I absolutely loved, and so I went ahead and bought the BIG one</li>
            <li> However after I used this mascara I knew the full size product would be well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I will never use false lashes again, this works just as great and is more comfortable than falsies.</li>
            <li> I sometimes don&#x27;t even use my lash curler and lashes are long and gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Has no unpleasant odor, as some mascaras do.</li>
            <li> I like that it is healthier to use than many others and though it might not be unique in the way it looks, it is a great alternative and stands against other major mascara&#x27;s quite well.</li>
            <li> It shipped out right away too, so I could use it in time for a special occasion I was attending.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE ALL TIME mascara they no longer sell in stores &amp; I have to buy on Amazon as its only sold in Europe now; Max Factor 2000 Calorie GREAT, Amazing, Truly volumizing, thick coverage, no caking, non-smearing.</li>
            <li> I have very straight and short lashes so a good mascara is a must.</li>
            <li> It gives my eyelashes so much volume and you can apply it in many layers without it ever getting clumpy if you love big huge lashes like I do.</li>
            <li> The brush is just perfect and the formula goes on so silky smooth and really does last all day (&amp; into the next morning - NO RACCOON EYES!)</li>
            <li> Great black color with some shine to it, looks very pretty.</li>
            <li> And you do not need to use special lotion to remove it in the evening, just warm water is enough.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands...from drugstore to luxury brands, and Elizabeth&#x27;s Mott&#x27;s volumizing mascara has quickly become one of my new favorites (if not my favorite!).</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look fuller and longer with this mascara, and even though it isn&#x27;t waterproof, you can survive a good cry without looking like a hot mess. :)</li>
            <li> Read about it in the newspaper and thought I&#x27;d try it, the price is reasonable and it&#x27;s excellent, really does make your lashes look thicker and not as clumped as other brands.</li>
            <li> It is my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> Love my new mascara.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be adventurous and try a new mascara product and chose this based on the reviews I read</li>
            <li> My new favorite.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite</li>
            <li> You will love your new look!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daphne</li>
            <li> this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Have to say, it is my new favorite</li>
            <li> is definitely my new favorite.  </li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> Overall very very pleased...and no bunnies had to suffer!!!!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, does not clump &amp; stays looking nice all day long on.  </li>
            <li> Loved the mascara, so purchased another to have on-hand when first one was getting low.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to put on, and it makes my lashes look thicker, fuller and much longer.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of this mascara in an Ipsy bag and liked it enough to give the full size a try.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it at first, but after playing around with it I really began to like it.</li>
            <li> I was able to receive a sample first just because I was very hesitant.  </li>
            <li> Several beautiful layers can be applied with no &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; look, and my lashes feel soft all day.</li>
            <li> Stays on very well, while surprisingly easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and makes my lashes really stand out.  </li>
            <li> This mascara never rubs off during the time I need it, but it washes off easily and gently.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t apply more than 2 coats and my lashes look very natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very sensitive to eye make up and get allergic reactions to most products.</li>
            <li> This mascara give a very natural full-lash look without the clumpi-ness of most volumizing mascaras.  </li>
            <li> I expected a lot more for a high priced mascara but it&#x27;s not even as good as a $7 drug store one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is by far, hands down, the best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The good thing is this mascara comes off easily in the shower and does not run down your face!</li>
            <li> This mascara is my ultimate favorite!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Really works to lengthen!!</li>
            <li> I doubt I will ever buy any other kind now!</li>
            <li> Favorite Mascara by far!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mascara!!!</li>
            <li> I wore the first day I tried this!  </li>
            <li> No Racoon eyes, exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this mascara!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never even considering buying a different brand, love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is EXACTLY what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing more of this!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara by far!  </li>
            <li> I am really enjoying it so far!</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it can indeed cluster your eyelashes together, but I still love it!</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a phenomenal product!</li>
            <li> I was surprised, this mascara was pretty good, made my eye lashes look longer and didn&#x27;t clump as much as some others.  </li>
            <li> fantastic mascara gives you beautiful length, and looks like light false lashes.</li>
            <li> Great product, if you&#x27;re anything like me trying a new mascara seems like such a risk!</li>
            <li> , it comes off easy, it just comes off different than most mascaras.</li>
            <li> , it comes off easy, it just comes off different than most mascaras.</li>
            <li> It comes off easily with most soaps although I have had to struggle occasionally to get it off with just soap depending on the soap.</li>
            <li> I think I get a very natural look with this mascara, like I was blessed with long beautiful lashes, not a makeup look.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, so you don&#x27;t start getting smudges right away.</li>
            <li> I VERY rarely give one star, but I can&#x27;t find anything positive to say about this product.</li>
            <li> I also love that it washes away easily with warm water so that you&#x27;re not rubbing your eyes/damaging the delicate skin with a cleanser.</li>
            <li> my new favorite, and quick shipping, thanks!</li>
            <li> This is good mascara, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about is the mascara has a large clump on the end of the brush when you pull it out of the tube.</li>
            <li> Originally I had written a review complaining about how clumpy and unimpressed I was with the formula - but a representative reached out to me to apologize and offered to send me a new tube for free.</li>
            <li> The brush was perfect, the liquid had just the right viscosity, not too runny not to thick, and it went on SO smoothly,I could apply coat after coat without any clumps!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this mascara based on all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> The shape of the wand is amazing, I can finally get the corner lashes without getting mascara all over my face and under my eyes!</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on smoothly and really lengthens my lashes.  </li>
            <li> It takes a couple of coats to thicken the lashes, but gives you great length with just a few coats.  </li>
            <li> You really will receive a free sample and it will arrive within two days.  </li>
            <li> It makes your lashes look amazing and 1 tube will actually last you quite a while!</li>
            <li> The customer service is fabulous and very prompt.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s It&#x27;s So Big mascara and read all the amazing reviews I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Fabulous Product and very affordable.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this mascara a 2nd time because it is so AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Elizabeth Mott for making such an amazing product.</li>
            <li> But overall I didn&#x27;t feel like my lashes didn&#x27;t look that amazing</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look twice as big, it is quite amazing, this one is worth every $.</li>
            <li> The most amazing thing is, you would think you would need some heavy duty soap or eye makeup remover to get it off of your lashes</li>
            <li> It stays on all day looking as fresh as when it was applied.</li>
            <li> GOOD FOR BOTTOM LASHES, BUT NOT REALLY</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Really liked it, but after about six months, the inner ring came out and now I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I hoped for something far better.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth the $$.</li>
            <li> Worth the $</li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;ve had success with cheaper mascaras in getting volume--</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> This one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re asking yourself if $20 for mascara is worth it</li>
            <li> mascara is by far way better.</li>
            <li> I was going on a cruise and really wanted a good waterproof mascara as mascara would be my only daytime eye makeup</li>
            <li> This looks way more natural and lasts way longer.</li>
            <li> This brand seems to stay fresh longer without clumping or drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this at least a month before writing and the conclusion is that this really is the BEST mascara!</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s worth checking out.</li>
            <li> Worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> It is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> Amazon user (I almost never shop in stores anymore!) and never write reviews, but this one is truly worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early fifties and have tried many mascara products over the years.</li>
            <li> Bobbi Brown&#x27;s Smokey Eye is FAR better.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend $20 on mascara, especially if it didn&#x27;t fare any better than the cheap stuff I buy at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This mascara is so worth it.</li>
            <li> SO WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> It is not a heavy mascara so those who want more of an impact may need primer.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> so I am running around and rarely get to look in any mirror to check the makeup status.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> the price, it was not at all worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it really works very well.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara thus far.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny</li>
            <li> It does have fall out but the way it makes your lashes look its so worth it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just as the name of the product &amp;#34;BIG&amp;#34;  this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used...and I tried all off them no matter how expensive they were or cheap</li>
            <li> It wears well on 2 morning coats during the entire day, and it washes off nicely in the shower.</li>
            <li> No smudges, it lasts all day, my lashes look longer and are more clearly defined.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect mascara for a long, long time.  </li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and wanted a mascara that would make my eyes pop more.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Applies really nicely, doesn&#x27;t clump, even after several layers applied.</li>
            <li> But worth it..</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Buy it - it&#x27;s totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> May be it works better for people who have naturally curly eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It was worth the price that it cost..</li>
            <li> I am a Maybelline Colossal fan and have been for about 6 years.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth the premium price</li>
            <li> but this is certainly worth the $20.i</li>
            <li> Unsure yet whether the price is worth the product,</li>
            <li> This is a really nice mascara, especially the brush.</li>
            <li> I want my cake, and I want to eat it too because what fun is cake if you can&#x27;t eat it?</li>
            <li> , def worth the buy.</li>
            <li> So worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I just received a personalized email from elizabeth mott, which was pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great product coworkers thought I had false lashes :)</li>
            <li> The clumping is minimal, and it does a good job of volumizing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitly worth the moeny.</li>
            <li> I love this product--I rarely write reviews--especially beauty products, but this mascara never clumps and looks natural.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re worth</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Especially one with this kind of price tag...</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell which product was on which eye...not fresh in the morning or 12-14 hours</li>
            <li> I loved the sample so much that I purchased the regular product.  </li>
            <li> but this mascara is totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li> must admit that is pricey, but it is all worth it.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite mascara by far.  </li>
            <li> I like to look fresh.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have tried every mascara you could think of from cheap to expensive and this one is the best!  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Nope... The only thing I liked about this mascara is that it stays put.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I like the design of the wand, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the gooey mascara.  </li>
            <li> so I had to find a backup in order to keep my nice long, full lashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is my favorite by far....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the hour glass shape -</li>
            <li> I never would have thought I would spend $20 on a mascara, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve spent more on buying mascaras and throwing them away in my search for mascara nirvana.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> now THAT is worth every penny!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This mascara gives more of a natural look than a glamorous one.</li>
            <li> (makeup gets absorbed through the skin).  </li>
            <li> My lashes didn&#x27;t curl and even after using an eyelash curler they weren&#x27;t as nice as when I use a different mascara I have.</li>
            <li> the brush is not the usual shape that i prefer but it works beautifully ..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think parabens are absorbed through lashes, and as I said, it doesn&#x27;t smudge so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s now, so I have tried and searched many mascaras.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, this won&#x27;t be a popular review, but in case someone else out there is searching for the same reason I was, I hope this is helpful.does</li>
            <li> Like I said, this won&#x27;t be a popular review, but in case someone else out there is searching for the same reason I was, I hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and have tried many mascaras, at every price point.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give me as much volume as it says, but I still really like it and will be buying more once I run out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump on my lashes and actually separates them nicely.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a bit pricey for a mascara, I truly believe it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than Maybelline in the pink tube (costs more, too).</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll probably pay it for the full tube when my sample runs out ;)</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was cruelty free and had good reviews, I have very small and fine eyelashes</li>
            <li> Got the sample, and was more than pleased with the outcome; it lengthens my lashes pretty well and it doesn&#x27;t take me very long to put it on.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes very long and full, and the things it doesn&#x27;t do make it that much more fabulous...</li>
            <li> I love this mascara easy goes on and makes my eyelashes look really long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really dark, goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t flake or melt, and it comes off easily.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, makes my lashes look 3x longer and fuller, and at the end of the day, a little warm water gets it right off!</li>
            <li> It comes off easily with just normal washing with the face cleanser</li>
            <li> /&gt;You only need one coat, and it comes off super easy with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge fan!  </li>
            <li> I have used Tarte, Dior, NYX, and many, many other brands,</li>
            <li> as other reviewers mention, it does have some &#x27;fiber&#x27; that comes out on the end of the wand, but overall, it is the best I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for other similar products on the market, but best I can tell they don&#x27;t exist.  </li>
            <li> Got this only because it had such a good rating &amp; Boy!</li>
            <li> and it is not saturated as much with color as I would like, other than that great mascara.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love and stand by my previous comment only adding good to the last use.</li>
            <li> Waterproof formula is great for hot weather, and those who like to apply a little makeup when going to the gym.</li>
            <li> Instead, the mascara removes beautifully, like little tubes that just gently come off of each eyelash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not disappointed, I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Makes your lashes look long and lovely!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about ordering this mascara because the cost was more than double of what I normally pay.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be pretty cool if this were also available in a waterproof version one day, but it&#x27;s not going to deter me in the mean time. :P</li>
            <li> - thick gorgeous  Lashes to die for!  </li>
            <li> But never the less, I am always happy to leave positive reviews when warranted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with my ethically conscious and high quality mascara.</li>
            <li> It literally just slides right off your lashes.</li>
            <li> I find now that my lashes clump right away so matter what I do.</li>
            <li> and it slides right off.  </li>
            <li> Right off.</li>
            <li> I notice if I reapply right away my eyelashes uncurl.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this mascara and applied it right away.</li>
            <li> For one thing, it comes right off with water, without streaking or smudging or leaving any residue.</li>
            <li> BUT the mascara comes right off.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> am I not doing it right?  </li>
            <li> marketing was right.  </li>
            <li> reviews were right.  </li>
            <li> I read reviews before using and they were right.</li>
            <li> The mascara itself is clumpy and does not apply right.</li>
            <li> Miracle Mascara right here.</li>
            <li> I washed out off right after I put it on.</li>
            <li> And it just washes right off.</li>
            <li> I made the right choice</li>
            <li> I will go leave my positive review now!</li>
            <li> I live in a large city and haven&#x27;t been able to locate this product anywhere.  </li>
            <li> This mascara makes my eyelashes a mile long - but more important, it doesn&#x27;t flake off or smudge or spend the day wandering from my eyelashes to my under-eye area.  </li>
            <li> Long sexy and smooth (not clumpy).</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to how long it lasts, but so far I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I say this with confidence because you most likely will end up buying the full size.</li>
            <li> This mascara thickens, lengthens, doesn&#x27;t clump, and most importantly, stays put all day long with no flaking or bleeding onto the skin.  </li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product, full lash separation with massive volume!!!</li>
            <li> Has a nice dark pigment and a smooth texture.</li>
            <li> They do give GREAT Volume and Long Natural looking Lashes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this is the reviews were true that this is the BEST mascara; however I&#x27;m a believer!</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I do rotate mascaras with the cheap stuff, but this is by far my favoritemascara.</li>
            <li> comes off very easily when washing your face or in the shower but be warned: Don&#x27;t try to wipe it off with makeup wipes because you&#x27;ll inevitably take some eyelashes with it.   </li>
            <li> It separates my lashes and lengthens them like no other mascara has been able to before.</li>
            <li> I prefer a thinker more bristley large round brush, but that formula is so amazing it still works wonders.</li>
            <li> The formula is really something special.</li>
            <li> What I love about this mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t smears or leaves under eye black marks :)</li>
            <li> Many market mascaras clump or bunch my lashes together, causing less of a volume and more of a</li>
            <li> I get compliments frequently, many people asking if my eyelashes they are real or if I am even wearing mascara because they are not clumpy and look very natural.</li>
            <li> Happy to report that I look like linebacker no more.</li>
            <li> I was caught in a rainstorm, got soaked, it didn&#x27;t run, but did wash off very well with soap and water, (this is not the waterproof mascara), It is not clumpy, and did not flake, as some reviewers have stated, and made my lashes look full again.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes already, but this mascara increases the length of my lashes amazingly.  </li>
            <li> It stays on and does not run, even after an intense spin class after a full day at work.  </li>
            <li> I never expected to find a mascara that I can say I really love at this stage of my life....</li>
            <li> I usually sweat mascara off but this stuff is really great.</li>
            <li> think the $20 price I paid was worth it and not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> It goes on really nice and stays put a long time.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good dark color.  </li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes look thick and beautiful.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look nice and long and mascara stays through  the day without any problems.</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara but definitely not worth the $20.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in my monthly beauty subscription haul a couple of years back and absolutely FELL IN LOVE!</li>
            <li> No clumps, nice long lashes that make my skimpy ones look almost like falsies.</li>
            <li> Nothing had compared to the beautiful, thick lashes that I once had as a result of</li>
            <li> ; I love it!&amp;#34; It really makes your lashes look lush!</li>
            <li> on good but not worth the price</li>
            <li> IS ONE SUPER LARGE SIZE MASCARA TUBE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on easily without clumping, makes lashes look long and full, and it does not smudge!</li>
            <li> My lashes are very fine and short.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different mascaras and for a long time was loyal to Lancôme, then flipped 180 degrees on cost and went to Maybelline Great Lash.  </li>
            <li> This mascara gives a little more length than most.  </li>
            <li> I will gladly spend a little more for a product that works well.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m happy with it as a product, it really wasn&#x27;t worth the money I spent VS a normal Covergirl mascara.</li>
            <li> It also washes off more easily than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Amazing long curled lashes and no smudges!</li>
            <li> The brush is awesome and grabs every little lash (top AND bottom) for a perfect application and the formula is not too thick or too thin.  </li>
            <li> I respect spiders, but I certainly don&#x27;t want my eye lashes to resemble them!</li>
            <li> After just two coats my eyelashes are large and in charge!</li>
            <li> and it certainly makes my lashes look longer!</li>
            <li> This mascara works exactly as promised right from the beginning</li>
            <li> My lashes look amazing and VERY long.</li>
            <li> It is a great black color, easy to layer without caking or getting gross.</li>
            <li> I put several coats and have to really wiggle the brush to get any kind of volume.  </li>
            <li> Am learning to layer quickly, as it dries fast, but it gives the length I need without clumping.  </li>
            <li> This product not only gives me beautiful lashes, but also and most importantly, is the only product that doesn&#x27;t smudge and leave what appears to be dark circles under my eyes (without the use of any lash primer).  </li>
            <li> This mascara lengthens and is more natural looking, but doesn&#x27;t give as much volume.</li>
            <li> does not dry out, love it.</li>
            <li> Not to mention shipped and delivered super fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really different compared to others; doesn&#x27;t smudge, comes off easily and clean.</li>
            <li> I bought it based upon previous review that the product should have good volume.</li>
            <li> The texture of it is so different from all others I have used - it&#x27;s light and smooth.</li>
            <li> The wand makes for easy, seamless application, and the formula has zero clump.</li>
            <li> (one night I forgot to take it off &amp; it still looked good in the AM), &amp; is easy to take off, (flakes off instead of smearing black into my sensitive skin under my eyes).</li>
            <li> found a MUCH cheaper one that is far better on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;(E.</li>
            <li> I am actually using it without an eyeliner on my upper lids and it looks great.  </li>
            <li> once dry the mistakes just kind of fall</li>
            <li> AT A GREAT PRICE, COMPARED TO THAT OF THE BIG LOCAL BEAUTY STORES.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite mascara... Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I would take off half a star because once in a great while I do get fallout, if I try and add more once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I have searched far and wide for a great mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara is easy to apply and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I have slept in it accidentally only to find that it looks great the next day too!  </li>
            <li> *: It is still not the most volumizing mascara that I have ever used, but at the suggestion of the VERY HELPFUL Elizabeth Mott President &amp; customer service people, I received a tube directly from their company (as they noted that the Amazon product may have been affected by heat/cold/etc.</li>
            <li> I eventually had to use makeup remover (I&#x27;m used to my old brand coming off easily with cleanser) twice to get all the flakes off my lashes and face.</li>
            <li> I need a product that provides volume, length, stays put, and comes off completely and easily at night.</li>
            <li> biggest issue is that my eyes water all the time, especially when I smile (which I often do :)), and even with waterproof mascara I always have a smudging problem.  </li>
            <li> and it looks natural and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this amazing mascara,I have my femininity back!</li>
            <li> It is mostly lengthening, but if you put on a few coats it becomes much more voluminous, too.</li>
            <li> Amazing Long Lush clump free lashes.</li>
            <li> The only issue you need to know is that it takes quite a bit of time to apply if you want a super full clean look.  </li>
            <li> my first purchase was fantastic, it must have been a new mascara tube.  </li>
            <li> Then when I get home it comes off easy with a little warm water and some gentle rubbing.  </li>
            <li> Nice true black color.</li>
            <li> It comes of nice and easy with my usual make-up remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would also love it if Mott would create another formula with fibers for super long party eyes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very light and makes my eyelashes SO BIG!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> I have very straight lashes that refuse to keep a curl.</li>
            <li> Only thing I didn&#x27;t like, was that it goes on very light and takes awhile to build up the length</li>
            <li> I have very straight lashes.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> I very much like a mascara that can hold up to watery eyes and</li>
            <li> I am able to workout w/o it running down my face, but it easily washes off w/facial cleanser &amp; water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s So BIG is really lovely.....easy to apply, light as a feather, no clumping and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Works better for way less $$$ and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> What I like most about this product is that it is easy to remove and does not leave me with racoon eyes; a bunch of black gunk under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I hesitate to order another, but I did like the first one very much.</li>
            <li> Looks great, works well, hard to remove</li>
            <li> Others have great wear but are so hard to get off I lose lots of lashes.</li>
            <li> I am seriously not the type to leave a review, but this is by far the best mascara I have tried in the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li> so they coat your lashes well, and the &#x27;flail&#x27; is great for accessing those hard to reach areas around the corners of your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I searched for a new brand and discovered it&#x27;s so BIG and let me tell ya, this mascara is better!</li>
            <li> Super fun to have wow lashes again!</li>
            <li> My lashes didn&#x27;t look huge, but there clearly are thickening fibers in the product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but towards the later part of my work day it starts to irritate my eyes a bit.</li>
            <li> But I had to study those at first to make sure my actual eyelashes weren&#x27;t coming off.</li>
            <li> I love my current mascara and this was recommended to me.</li>
            <li> This was my first non-drug store mascara</li>
            <li> It is a bit more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; than I&#x27;m used to and the first application left me rather discouraged.  </li>
            <li> The first mascara I have ever worn that didn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes after a day of wearing it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time going away from drugstore mascara</li>
            <li> I have blonde lashes, so I need lots of color on the top and bottom lashes to see them.</li>
            <li> I first tried it at my daughter-in laws, and now I am hooked.</li>
            <li> I rarely ever review an item,  but this product really attention.  </li>
            <li> Comparable to Lancome at a much lower price!</li>
            <li> Even washing it off with a cleanser is pretty painless.  </li>
            <li> I initially thought it was not as advertised but having now used it for 2 weeks I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> My consistent go-to would be loreal voluminous.</li>
            <li> ; being that it really does NOT budge!</li>
            <li> The formula isn&#x27;t waterproof but it takes extensive patience for me to be able to remove ALL of it from my lashes.</li>
            <li> No matter how many extra coats I tried, my lashes remained stubbornly stick-ish.</li>
            <li> I will purchase two more as back up, now!</li>
            <li> No flaking, no smudging, no weird spider lashes.  </li>
            <li> now teach yoga, which gets me pretty hot...</li>
            <li> product ;)  </li>
            <li> Really does work!</li>
            <li> Performed exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> First off, I want to say...</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say Benefit gives more volume, but also clumps.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t smudge!  </li>
            <li> but this \\&quot;It&#x27;s so big\\&quot; is a hot item too.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I love big lash!!</li>
            <li> I really appreciated that!</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know that my eye allergy was being caused by this mascara.</li>
            <li> I am going to order more because this is the only mascara for me!</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t smudge.  </li>
            <li> This really is a holy grail mascara!</li>
            <li> but THIS... this is something I am willing to continually splurge on.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it does not go on cakey and gross looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an array of different brands over the years, and this is the first one to ever leave me 100% satisfied every time I&#x27;ve used it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never any clumping, looove the application wand shape (which I initially didn&#x27;t think I would), and, for once, actually love my lashes!&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will get home from whatever you were doing all day and it will look exactly as it did that morning when you put it on.</li>
            <li> After many years of searching for a mascara I can finally say that I have found a &amp;quot;keeper&amp;quot;.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal!</li>
            <li> I use it daily and am completely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> If I use it with a different applicator, I get better results.</li>
            <li> I first got a sample of this mascara and have been using while I travel for work.</li>
            <li> First purchased this product in December 2014.</li>
            <li> almost as the end-of-use of the first one.</li>
            <li> next best thing&amp;#34; in mascaras only to toss it to the back of a drawer and continue the search.</li>
            <li> And the delivery was FAST!</li>
            <li> but overall i still like loreal more.  </li>
            <li> Most mascarras end up actually straightening out my eyelashes even after I use the eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I did not like the odd-shaped brush, though I was willing to try it.  </li>
            <li> Really liking this product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already received compliments from two co-workers in the first week of using this product.</li>
            <li> You lashes definitely are more defined.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands and this stuff</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for in a mascara for years.</li>
            <li> Glad I finally found it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever bought a mascara online and not in a drug store off the shelf.</li>
            <li> I thought since it has wax in it it would be more likely to stay and be somewhat waterproof.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my eyes, and doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge after 10 hours of working in humid hot conditions.</li>
            <li> It has two types of bristles and that really helps &amp;#34;fan out&amp;#34; easier!</li>
            <li> They were just that pretty.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Not fake lashes look though.</li>
            <li> first, I  thought it might just be an overpriced eye lash curler, but no-</li>
            <li> and it had me at first use.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to purchase this mascara at first because of the price, but I read the reviews and was convinced to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It makes your eye lashes looks funny</li>
            <li> Everyone raves about this stuff, and I really didn&#x27;t like it!</li>
            <li> It does make those funny flakes when washing it off....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first mascara I can say that about.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real!).</li>
            <li> It was exactly as the seller described.</li>
            <li> and they really pop!</li>
            <li> It lengthens and thickens my lashes very well!</li>
            <li> I first tried a sample of this mascara that came in my monthly Ipsy box.</li>
            <li> Ok so the last few I have gotten have been good and this mascara</li>
            <li> I first got this in my monthly beauty subscription bag.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, it really doesn&#x27;t smudge!</li>
            <li> I used a curler first and then applied the mascara</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using this mascara</li>
            <li> Stays on all day, I will definitely be buying this again :)</li>
            <li> I first discovered it in a subscription make up box</li>
            <li> Really plumps up your lashes!</li>
            <li> Honestly for a mascara called BIG I expected more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the brush and the size of the tube of the So BIG Volumizing Mascara, but it does tend to flake...</li>
            <li> At the end of each hot, humid day in Hawaii, I can always count on</li>
            <li> thank you sooooo much its like heaven on my lashes!</li>
            <li> Going back to Buxom or even the drugstore brands as they are even better than this mascara.</li>
            <li> Though overall, I really love the mascara.</li>
            <li> This is the FIRST mascara that I have ever used that does not smudge.  </li>
            <li> It is more similar to waterproof mascara without being a pain to remove.</li>
            <li> I ended up swapping the brush to a different one and it works MUCH better.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real!</li>
            <li> From some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I think I&#x27;ll try taking it off first with Coconut Oil.</li>
            <li> This one comes very close!  </li>
            <li> This BIG MOTT mascara has been the first out of the last 8 attempts to replace my LANCOME Defincils mascara that has been successful.</li>
            <li> I was using Fairy Drops Scandal Queen Mascara which is my ultimate FAVORITE.</li>
            <li> It does not fail.</li>
            <li> But unlike Blinc, It&#x27;s So BIG has a way better formula.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the mascara the wand snapped off the lid and is stuck in side the tube.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I definitely need more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara now for several months -- probably six or more.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is very sticky &amp; never drys!</li>
            <li> Actually Loreal is better than this.</li>
            <li> it gives you the mod falsies look!  </li>
            <li> Love the BIG mascara!  </li>
            <li> So at this point I&#x27;m still experimenting, but I most definitely notice longer lashes!,</li>
            <li> I am really dissapointed in it!  </li>
            <li> I curl my lashes first</li>
            <li> only quibble is that the product removal (as you draw the brush out of the tube) could be a bit more complete/cleaner</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Ordering 2 more tubes, and extra for myself and one for my college age daughter!!  </li>
            <li> Let me say, this is the first formula I have tried that is not waterproof yet won&#x27;t leave me looking like a raccoon.</li>
            <li> Recieved my first</li>
            <li> Big is always better..</li>
            <li> I tried the sample first because I was apprehensive about spending $20 on a mascara without knowing how well it would work.</li>
            <li> I love trying lots and lots of different brands of mascaras.</li>
            <li> When I first saw it, I emailed the company to get a sample</li>
            <li> The first time my friends saw me with  this on they thought I had caved and gone to a lash  bar.</li>
            <li> When I first got it (was used 2 days)</li>
            <li> I add powder to my lashes first.  </li>
            <li> It really does make your lashes look thicker too!</li>
            <li> So glad I found a product that actually does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s worth the $20, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s up there with dior show, they&#x27;re real, and my holy grails eyko and RiRi!</li>
            <li> However, this product was more like Blinc Mascaras that use &amp;#34;tube-technology&amp;#34; to form tiny water-resistant tubes around lashes for amplification &amp; hold, rather than painting them.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re expecting something that will transform unnoticeable lashes to noticeable, you&#x27;re better off using the aforementioned Revlon Grow Luscious brand --</li>
            <li> Prior to using Elizabeth Mott, my favorite brand was Benefit&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and I hear nothing but compliments and &amp;#34;are those fake lashes?&amp;#34; Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep looking I guess, but first I&#x27;ll use up this one.</li>
            <li> I feel like they look bigger and better than ever.</li>
            <li> Most mascaras either left me with smudges or flakes on my face.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t need any other mascara, I have found my favorite!</li>
            <li> It does seem to last most of the day without clumping on your lashes or flaking.</li>
            <li> It also comes off much easier!</li>
            <li> I had ordered one and went back and ordered two more in addition to the gel eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> What more could you possibly ask for?  </li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the better mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It does help, of course, to curl your lashes first.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for letting me brag on this product!</li>
            <li> You can add extra coats for more volume and it doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li> But WOW....this stuff is exactly as the reviews are telling you....</li>
            <li> I went with a sample first and immediately ordered a full-size tube.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this mascara after receiving it in an ipsy bag.</li>
            <li> I first bought one to try it out.</li>
            <li> Yes, FINALLY :-)</li>
            <li> I have to wipe almost all the mascara off of the brush first.  </li>
            <li> So, at first, I was looking for a mascara to give length and volume.</li>
            <li> Overall I love it.</li>
            <li> It takes two coats over the primer, and my lashes are exactly everything I&#x27;ve ever searched for.</li>
            <li> Fabulous and lush mascara -</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara I have used that does NOT leave smudges under my eye.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I knew this was the mascara I had been looking for</li>
            <li> how favorite products are suddenly NLA!!!!)  </li>
            <li> *cough cough Smashbox cough cough*).  </li>
            <li> First time trying it.</li>
            <li> Tarte and Benefit have better mascaras for the same cost.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am always looking for something bigger and better in the makeup world</li>
            <li> However, this is the first time I&#x27;ve had this type of response from a company - and I will update my review upon trying the replacement bottle of mascara.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 4/22/14&lt;br /&gt;I received my replacement, and it appears my first bottle was a dud.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different types of mascara from Sephora, Ulta,</li>
            <li> Would absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> Not even sure this actually mascara.</li>
            <li> The first day I wore it</li>
            <li> The first is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to smudge or flake.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> My lashes are thicker and more voluminous, I never have any smudges at the end of the day, and washing it off is so simple--</li>
            <li> This is the first that does not.</li>
            <li> My lashes are also not sticking together like they were with the first tube.</li>
            <li> thanks Elizabeth Mott!    </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also priced well for the quality - definitely better than drug store brands which are similarly priced.</li>
            <li> I got my first taste of this mascara in a beauty box and haven&#x27;t used anything else since.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well-</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara!  </li>
            <li> This mascara did exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> Not so for Elizabeth Mott, and so this was my first puchase from this company.</li>
            <li> This mascara really is all its cracked up to be and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Much of the success of the product comes from how you hold the wand and manipulate it.</li>
            <li> and I love that this one stays on in the presence of tears and contact solution but can be washed off with regular face wash, without need for a separate eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> I use a blow dryer on my eyelash curler first.  </li>
            <li> Will most definitely purchase again &amp; tell my friends!</li>
            <li> I have a more oily skin, especially around the t-zone and eyes, and this does not smear for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake and only clumps with too many coats.</li>
            <li> Very lengthening, product doesn&#x27;t clump and I like the brush!</li>
            <li> Thanks Elizabeth!</li>
            <li> With all the rave reviews I expected something spectacular with this mascara</li>
            <li> Actually that works better than the non-oily mascara remover.  </li>
            <li> During the day, I&#x27;ll apply a couple coats and have a nice professional look but for a night out, a few more and my lashes stand out like they should.</li>
            <li> I first found this as a sample and immediately baca me a devotee.</li>
            <li> If I want more oomph I put on a second coat.</li>
            <li> FIRST MASCARA</li>
            <li> No clumping, makes my lashes longer and so pretty.  </li>
            <li> You will thank me later.  :)</li>
            <li> I first received this mascara in a trial size from monthly Ipsy Glam Bag.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad that will not be an issue for me as I&#x27;ve finally found the one.. or The BIG one :)</li>
            <li> is the first mascara that does not smudge-</li>
            <li> My first time using this product</li>
            <li> Stays in all day but is not difficult to remove at night.</li>
            <li> I havent tried 10 coats of it yet, like it suggests,  Im thinking I might not be able to keep eyes open</li>
            <li> this is the first mascara i&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t smudge on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t glump up like many others, always stays fluid.  </li>
            <li> Really lengthening!</li>
            <li> I lost my first mascara before I could use it, it fell out of my purse.</li>
            <li> but they have gotten more sparse in middle age.  </li>
            <li> I love how this goes on and especially how it stays on during the day and doesn&#x27;t leave any crease marks on my eyelids, like even the waterproof mascaras do, because I still have oily eyelids.</li>
            <li> This mascara really does what it says it does!</li>
            <li> I like the mascara, it definitely makes them more noticeable</li>
            <li> only eat at your pulling desire even more.</li>
            <li> It is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> I am fully aware of that....</li>
            <li> I am fully aware of that....</li>
            <li> This is the first Amazon review I&#x27;ve written but felt compelled.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Flash to 4 months later and STILL IN LOVE with this.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes pretty</li>
            <li> Woke up ready to go, no need to reapply!</li>
            <li> I ran out recently and had to buy more.</li>
            <li> and this is my current favorite.</li>
            <li> Ordered one of these awhile back and fell in love as it did what it promised.</li>
            <li> First use...seemed to lengthen.</li>
            <li> Would have returned, but threw out packaging and paperwork after first use.</li>
            <li> My first tube did not clump.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore the brush applicator!</li>
            <li> I will be restocking later. :)</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara!</li>
            <li> And to top it off, not only does it make my eyes pop, but it stays throughout an 8 hour session of hot and sweaty salsa.</li>
            <li> It makes my skinny non-existent lashes and really makes them pop!</li>
            <li> It  absolutely rocks my world!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and really like it!</li>
            <li> Eyelash curler is the only sure way I&#x27;ll get any curl.  </li>
            <li> I first recieved this product as a sample.</li>
            <li> I bought a MAC mascara and loved how it looked but would always flake off and smear after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Had to apply few times,but still good.</li>
            <li> This is a good everyday mascara.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful product, have been using for a few months now, will never go back to old mascara!!!</li>
            <li> It goes on clean and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> #34;I don&#x27;t know what you are talking about.&amp;#34; I quickly swiped my fingers under my eyes, and discovered no black!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased that this mascara doesn&#x27;t melt down my face, even in the 90 degree South Florida heat, running around all day with my children.</li>
            <li> I have eyelashes, and they&#x27;re clump free, flake free, long and dark and lovely!</li>
            <li> I am happy w/the product, it goes on smoothly and the black is not a harsh black color as many mascaras are.</li>
            <li> The color is a nice dark black that stays put &amp; can easily be applied layer on top of layer and so on</li>
            <li> The color is nice dark black and it stay put and can easily applied layer on top of a layer and so on.</li>
            <li> I read a ton of Amazon reviews before I made my purchase and this one seemed to have the highest number, and most positive reviews, overall - and I can see why.  </li>
            <li> and I saw so many positive review of So BIG that I figured I would try it.  </li>
            <li> The mascara can get very clumpy and it&#x27;s hard to remove, leaving my lashes feeling crispy; however, I do think that the mascara does a great job of lengthening your lashes and the wand is different from many others.</li>
            <li> But, after chemo and low thyroid took their toll, my nearly invisible lashes needed more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a great mascara and finally found it!  </li>
            <li> You barely need any to make you lashes look super long, love it!</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look super long, and washes off easily  </li>
            <li> It is also very easy to take off with just water, although I usually use an oil free makeup removers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really wear much other make up other than mascara, so the mascara that I choose to use needs to look awesome, well, this does it.</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t glue my lashes all together or need endless separating.</li>
            <li> Not as nice as other mascaras(in the volume department)</li>
            <li> The brush is nice and makes my lashes longer and fuller than any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smear or flake, no matter what I&#x27;m doing (it actually holds up better to swimming than most waterproof mascaras, even though it isn&#x27;t a waterproof formula), but comes off fine with my facial cleansing cloths or regular face wash.</li>
            <li> I would hands down compare it to my favorite so far NUTROGENA HEALTHY VOLUME mascara.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it does a better job than a few other products so while it&#x27;s a good product, I do not think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Although this is a very wet formula, they help my lashes stay curl, while providing nice length and volume.</li>
            <li> Still haven&#x27;t found anything near the excellent maybelline lash stylist mascara, which they stopped making years ago (should be criminal -</li>
            <li> For the last year or two, I started layering regular mascara with waterproof on top, to get it to come off easily and still stay on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this mascara, compared to Benefit, MAC, and store brands this is by far my favorite for a dramatic lasting look.</li>
            <li> It definitely works and doesn&#x27;t clump, but it does appear to smudge off easily with sweat which I don&#x27;t love, I switched back to my waterproof XXL one for the summertime</li>
            <li> My mascara was pretty dry at first, but now it seems to be covering much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never paid this much for a mascara before, but I am convinced I will never be able to go back to drug store brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but very time consuming to apply, 2 different things to apply, and can get chunky</li>
            <li> It appears that I&#x27;m much pickier than the most of the public when it comes to mascara...</li>
            <li> It can be a bit clumpy and doesn&#x27;t really separate, especially when I use more than one coat in hopes of increased volume.  </li>
            <li> This is coming from someone whose eyelashes are not thick or long looking on their own.</li>
            <li> so I am always on the move when I am working, constantly lifting things and working up a good sweat, especially in the summer time.</li>
            <li> Comes off with warm water, no left over residue like my old mascara</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great natural looking mascara for everyday.</li>
            <li> Especially now that price is more reasonable.</li>
            <li> It leaves my lashes long, full, clutter free and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> and I have finally --- FINALLY --- been able to absolutely just forget about being concerned whether I had darkened raccoon eyes as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> After searching for a long while I ran across this one and must say I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good buy, and I would compare it favorably with big department store mascaras.</li>
            <li> My lashes are too short to curl, but the mascara looks just as good 12-14 hours later as it did in the morning when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> It goes on even and smooth and makes my lashes long and full.  </li>
            <li> this is a really thin formula that delivers, at best, a lengthened natural look.  </li>
            <li> and this adds so much volume and makes my eyelashes appear incredible that they almost look false.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara, and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every affordable mascara and paying just a little bit more for this one is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> , it lasts all day, is nice and black, and just looks pretty.  </li>
            <li> The positive reviews seem to be exaggerations of its benefits.</li>
            <li> so that is a positive in my book.  </li>
            <li> The positive reviews I read about this mascara were spot on.  </li>
            <li> On the  positive side,  it comes off well with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could leave positive feedback</li>
            <li> I have to say I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to apply and how my lashes had much more volume than some of the other brands that I use.</li>
            <li> This is great going on, a little hard to remove, but overall I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li> easy to apply, lasts all day, comes off easily with a little makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments about how long my lashes look</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of different brands from the cheap to the expensive and this stuff is the best.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and every other kind I&#x27;ve tried always smudges and gets all over my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara that really works and NEVER FLAKES.  </li>
            <li> makes my lashes look so much longer and thicker than any other kind.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it makes my eyelashes long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every drugstore mascara on the market, and I&#x27;ve always had issue with both clumping and flaking.</li>
            <li> After removing them my lashes were pretty much non-existent.</li>
            <li> Just got my first real sized mascara.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty goopy, and the wand shape doesn&#x27;t help, but its very waterproof</li>
            <li> This product made my long sexy eyelashes</li>
            <li> I like my mascara to thicken and lengthen, and most of all, I do NOT want it to smudge after a long day.  </li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my lashes long but not clumpy :-)</li>
            <li> really works to help my dwindling eyelashes seem so much fuller and longer!</li>
            <li> It got here pretty fast</li>
            <li> First of all, it absolutely does not go on evenly.</li>
            <li> I have been using Maybelline  Full N&#x27; Soft.</li>
            <li> I usually use Lancome&#x27;s Definicils and this product was easily as good but at a lower price point.  </li>
            <li> It happens to me a lot &amp; usually with good reason.</li>
            <li> Nice, dark lengthen mascara.  </li>
            <li> but it is FAR superior to any other luxury or drugstore brand I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading the reviews I was excited to try it, but it didn&#x27;t give me much volume or length which really surprised me.</li>
            <li> Nice dark color, not too clumpy, and cheaper than some department store brands that don&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I had heard about it, ordered a sample directly from her site and then purchased the full size on amazon.</li>
            <li> It works nicely, staining my lashes and making them look dark and feathery with no clumps.</li>
            <li> Having been diagnosed this past summer with severe iron deficiency,I lost a good bit of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Also, so far I don&#x27;t believe any mascara has the true ability to curl lashes--</li>
            <li> I live in HOT, HUMID South Carolina, and, yay!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes luge huge  and super long!</li>
            <li> The mascara is SUPER BLACK, which I love.</li>
            <li> which if i got while wet was super easy.  </li>
            <li> No smear, no moving, just fabulous LONG pretty lashes!  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and cannot do many waterproof mascaras without major irritation.</li>
            <li> Have only been using a few days, but this seems to be an excellent mascara - it goes on smoothly without any flaking and with minimal glooping (is that a word?)  </li>
            <li> Since I have tried literally every mascara on the market....whether an expensive department store brand or cheaper drugstore brand, I can honestly say that It&#x27;s So BIG Mascara is definitely one of, if not the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend thismascara and hope you all have the same experience with it as I have!  :)</li>
            <li> I feel like there needs to be more quality control on this product, especially for the high price tag.</li>
            <li> And very easy to remove, unlike other non-smudging mascaras.</li>
            <li> Comes off very easily without causing eyelashes to fall out like some other mascaras can cause.</li>
            <li> I Love how long it makes my lashes!</li>
            <li> Big mascara - which comes off so easy with just face soap and a washcloth in threadlike pieces so</li>
            <li> Also, because it easily flakes off, I have to apply multiple times throughout the day...</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and my lashes are BIG as stated.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive eyes and have tried every mascara from drugstore to YSL and Chanel.</li>
            <li> The shape of the mascara wand makes it really easy to reach the tiny lashes in the corners, and the mascara lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried that both stays put without smudging and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> The It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara has never smudged and it easily wiped off at night -</li>
            <li> I am a makeup junkie who really just wants to find a product that works consistently.</li>
            <li> I also have short and somewhat skimpy lashes, and these can easily be layered on.</li>
            <li> it is very appropriate, very black (don&#x27;t let that scare you-we need it).  </li>
            <li> I almost wanted to be a tad bit more dense or perhaps even dry.</li>
            <li> THIS mascara gives me the same lengthening effects, but it is so lightweight, is easy to remove at the end of the day and NO flaking or running.  </li>
            <li> It does not give enough volume and smudges easily.</li>
            <li> I use my face wash followed by cleansing wipes and it comes off easy enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not nearly as good as my Urban Decay Canon Ball, which is the best waterproof mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, but that one is 25 bucks.  </li>
            <li> The only thing this product did as promised is that it is smudge proof and easy to come off.  </li>
            <li> But the only reason I gave it four stars is because it does not come off easily with make up remover.</li>
            <li> I eventually stopped buying mascara after becoming an ethical vegan and trying cruelty-free brands - the last one I bought was Aveda, and I might as well have worn nothing.  </li>
            <li> It comes off fairly easily with my facial cleanser and water.</li>
            <li> No smug, no flaking - ALL DAY and comes off easily with just your facial cleanser and water.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, lengthens my lashes like lash extensions and doesn&#x27;t leave me black under eyes.</li>
            <li> Washes off easily, with just my facial cleanser, and water.</li>
            <li> sure you go on there website for a free sample if you are not sure</li>
            <li> Easy and lasting.</li>
            <li> It also makes it easy to apply The only two drawbacks</li>
            <li> The only positives were it did not flake throughout the day and was easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I like it because it goes on easily without clumping and lasts throughout the entire day without flaking!</li>
            <li> This mascara went on smooth and never clumped, and instantly after the first swipe I saw a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Comes off easy enough with make up remover.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about my mascara and have pretty much tried everything from cover girl to Chanel.</li>
            <li> but because it ranks up there with pretty much any mascara you can get at the drug store much cheaper.</li>
            <li> but because it ranks up there with pretty much any mascara you can get at the drug store much cheaper.</li>
            <li> super soft lashes.</li>
            <li> Love how it doesn&#x27;t leave smudge marks and really makes my lashes long looking.</li>
            <li> This excellent mascara makes my eyelashes thick, long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for work; but if I am going out after work I generally need a little more.</li>
            <li> As always, I curl my lashes prior to mascara but with most brands, including high end, by midday my lashes are sagging and almost straight.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t flake off (ever), and comes off like magic with a single swipe of eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> for it, I feel certain you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers &amp; Shine On,  Zoe</li>
            <li> but it certainly did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> If you are using this for evening wear you may certainly apply over your day application and it will not clump.</li>
            <li> it’s good, but not as rich and dramatic as the others.  </li>
            <li> I feel very deceived by all the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li> I had been using Maybelline big lash and another one in a pink container thats newer, and it was pretty good -</li>
            <li> mascara from Ipsy a few months ago and fell in love with this mascara!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried the sample that the company offers before I spent $20 on the full size.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive and so far I had not found the perfect one.</li>
            <li> So Big Mascara is now my new favorite.  </li>
            <li> After about a month of using the product the &#x27;ring&#x27; at the top of the opening that serves to remove the excess mascara from the brush when it&#x27;s pulled out to apply came loose and is now stuck on the brush, not on the bottle where it should be.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump or apply too heavy, and the huge brush allows for easy and even application.  </li>
            <li> it is easy to remove with a simple gentle cleaner.</li>
            <li> It went on easy enough but it was almost like there wasn&#x27;t much mascara on the brush, and I tried two coats to no avail.</li>
            <li> have very little lashes and this mascara lengthens them significantly hense why I purchased two more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to remove with regular washing, so you do need an eye makeup remover, which is another thing I don&#x27;t love, but hey - you can&#x27;t have everything and with this product you get pretty much what you ask for.</li>
            <li> Second and third coats to outer lashes makes you look sexy!</li>
            <li> The price on It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara is at the higher end for what I want to pay for makeup, but I&#x27;m going to continue to purchase it for the unique qualities it has.</li>
            <li> For me it lengthened fine, and definitely made my lashes darker...</li>
            <li> The fine brush applicator reaches all the lashes creating a BIG voluminous lashes.</li>
            <li> At first brush, it definitely extends the length of your lashes significantly.  </li>
            <li> I never considered this issue when I was younger, so any mascara was fine.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it acts in the same manner as Blinc, only better!  </li>
            <li> Better to spend more on a quality product or less on one of the same quality.</li>
            <li> But, if I&#x27;m using 2 decent drugstore mascaras, that&#x27;s costing me close to $20 anyways!</li>
            <li> I use this particular mascara first.</li>
            <li> (seriously NO smudges - ever!)</li>
            <li> I did some research on mascaras, and since this one had very high ratings, I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, but alas... how many hours do YOU have to work to afford a single tube of mascara?</li>
            <li> It does not lengthen much and certainly does not give volume.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the kind of mascara that comes off in little tubes, with some water and rubbing.  </li>
            <li> I would have liked it to be a little thicker or bolder.  </li>
            <li> A little clumpy but effective.  </li>
            <li> I tried a sample first and loved it, but I purchased a different product because I didn&#x27;t want the parabens and other chemicals in my mascara.</li>
            <li> and the price is pretty high.  </li>
            <li> it is that great, especially for the price, a little pricy for me.</li>
            <li> really like this sample size, my full size is super dry though.</li>
            <li> And one of the coolest things about this mascara is that it looks tremendous on lower lashes if you have a light hand and are careful with your brush!</li>
            <li> The latter effect is huge because my lashes don&#x27;t curl.</li>
            <li> If you are happy with this price point, but not happy with the product, I would recommend Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real -</li>
            <li> Wears really well</li>
            <li> It stays on really really well -- through exercise, through sleep, through the whole day - no flaking or smudging.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t really do that.</li>
            <li> I run a lot and it doesn&#x27;t smudge one bit even with sweating so much.</li>
            <li> Works really well but doesn&#x27;t clump</li>
            <li> Not all that really.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really does make your lashes look longer and thicker without clumping.</li>
            <li> Too much comes out on the brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost wondering if I was duped and not giving the real thing when I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Too much work if you ask me.  </li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.  </li>
            <li> sometimes wash my whole face except my eyelashes, apply vitamin C, retin-A, oil of olay, palmers cocoa oil, what have you, leaving the mascara intact,</li>
            <li> Really does the trick.</li>
            <li> I do not wear much makeup anyway</li>
            <li> I still think the price is too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about mascara</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real by Benefit or in a pinch Lash Blast by Cover Girl.</li>
            <li> I think the price is absolutely out of control for what it is.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> It is not waterproof, but stays on very well (even in shower or pool if you don&#x27;t rub your eyes).</li>
            <li> Me, not so much.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It layers really well and doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake.</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> I get the same results from cheap drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real by Benifit.</li>
            <li> so I ordered it without much</li>
            <li> You have to be careful if you&#x27;re applying more than one coat as it starts to clump.</li>
            <li> But, It does flake if you touch your eyes too much.</li>
            <li> This mascara is so much more than I expected.</li>
            <li> It really does lengthen and fatten the lashes.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day, through every activity, and then washes off with a gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather buy $8 mascara at the store, than go through the hassle of using this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I am sure about this because I have spent probably thousands of dollars buying mascara in hopes it wouldn&#x27;t smudge off on me.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t lengthen much and my eye lashes clumped together.  </li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> My lashes look like they did in high school!</li>
            <li> This mascara is fantastic if you use it underneath a product that actually does what its job.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wash off very well</li>
            <li> so my eyes really pop.</li>
            <li> Fast and product was as described</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never clumpy but very lengthening.</li>
            <li> and they feel very brittle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about mascara</li>
            <li> Once, all I really needed was the mascara that didn&#x27;t smudge and flake, because that gets to be a literal pain, as I wear contacts.</li>
            <li> This really makes my eyelashes look fuller.</li>
            <li> This really does lengthen your eyelashes and separates them really well.</li>
            <li> REALLY well.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real, but I couldn&#x27;t justify $24 a tube for mascara.</li>
            <li> I really like this one.  </li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal mascara I&#x27;ve used for years gives me much longer and thicker lashes than this.</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> but this product didn&#x27;t really do much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way more volumizing than expected</li>
            <li> Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real mascara and had recommended it to friends, but now I am recommending this product.</li>
            <li> Extends my lashes so much, they brush against my eyeglasses.  </li>
            <li> Before 4 Months--------&amp;#62; waterproof...easily removed with soap and water and gently grasping  eyelashes in the shower...great for contact lens wearers no flaking...</li>
            <li> It did not plump up or lengthen my lashes very well.</li>
            <li> It was very clumpy...</li>
            <li> OMG where has this been my whole life.  </li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t want to hassel with the process</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought it would really blow me away.</li>
            <li> This mascara is really overpriced for what it does.</li>
            <li> buy it, for real.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it doesn&#x27;t really make my lashes look thicker, just longer</li>
            <li> I have been trying to decide if I really like this mascara</li>
            <li> Being very hopeful to find &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;, I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li> My lashes looked very individual and lightly coated with mascara.</li>
            <li> I found that two coats was all that I really needed.</li>
            <li> Really works like it said.  </li>
            <li> I expected the product would produce a greater volume of lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky with mascara.</li>
            <li> I was getting ready to try Latisse to grow my lashes because I wasn&#x27;t getting the results I wanted with mascara.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara a lot.  </li>
            <li> Really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It is smooth and does not clump, even after applying multiple coats.</li>
            <li> I feel responsible to warn people about this product.</li>
            <li> I sent for a free sample of So BIG Volumizing Mascara and couldn&#x27;t have been happier with the product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump or run--and, depending on layers, really makes lashes look thicker.  </li>
            <li> Something about my eye shape and skin texture, I have a real problem with 99% of mascaras smudging, except with this one.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it goes on very well</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a reasonably priced well made mascara.</li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> Really lengthens lashes...</li>
            <li> I will never buy another mascara again and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> (I buy generic Latisse, an eye lash growing serum for alldaychemist.com, an Indian Pharmacy for CHEAP).</li>
            <li> so I can really tell on the coverage of a mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a shame that this isn&#x27;t available in ALL Sephora and Ulta stores..</li>
            <li> mascara layers very well</li>
            <li> It acts much like the ever-popular &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; but without the raccoon effect.  </li>
            <li> and my eyelashes are very sparse...</li>
            <li> but it makes them straight.</li>
            <li> The one thing it didn&#x27;t really do for me was create volume.</li>
            <li> and she doesn&#x27;t need to re apply it very often.</li>
            <li> We were called to deploy and the job is intense.</li>
            <li> I really like the product.  </li>
            <li> Well, they really will send you a sample to try before purchasing.  </li>
            <li> really do like the appearance of my lashes when wearing this mascara but</li>
            <li> you know she really studies me – said “</li>
            <li> I really like</li>
            <li> and if I didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;d wake up in the morning with very irritated eyes.</li>
            <li> I really wish this wasn&#x27;t the case or my search for &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; mascara would be over...</li>
            <li> really think we have a winner here, folks...</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything really for my lashes.</li>
            <li> and I really have to scrape it otherwise my lashes get clumpy.</li>
            <li> Really adds volume and thickness</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t feel like I got as much of a volumizing effect as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mascara!</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> But for me, i really like this.</li>
            <li> The mascara goes on very evenly</li>
            <li> It never clumps and it really separates your lashes.</li>
            <li> I use 2 coats for work - I don&#x27;t think 1 is really noticeable.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara - the shape of the brush, and it really stays put.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real instead.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Very uniform application -- the brush shape really helps separate lashes, and helps application.  </li>
            <li> like that this product really holds up during the day with no smudging or flaking.  </li>
            <li> In addition, this company&#x27;s commitment to creating cruelty free products is a big plus in my book.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I found it very drying and did nothing to help the volume of the length of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> gentle foaming face wash.  </li>
            <li> much so that often I just dab on a bit of bronzer with this mascara and head out the door feeling Gorgeous!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like my Elizabeth Mott mascara</li>
            <li> I went back to my Mabelline Stiletto which is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Really like this Mascara.  </li>
            <li> mascaras as smearing/smudging is a real issue for me, and this doesn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s really important to me is that it doesn&#x27;t smudge later in the day.</li>
            <li> lashcard--it really does help to elongate my lashes with no clumps).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It lasts a reasonable amount of time too.</li>
            <li> I used to use Chanel but refuse to spend so much on makeup these days.</li>
            <li> and I really like the result.  </li>
            <li> It really lengthens and thickens her eyelashes.</li>
            <li> extend eyelash very well.</li>
            <li> very natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I see high standards!</li>
            <li> Much longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> I would purchase this one again and it is a reasonable price too.</li>
            <li> It really lengthens my lashes.</li>
            <li> but a couple of coats to see a real difference.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> However, it still works very well.</li>
            <li> I do really like the way the mascara wand applies the product.  </li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> It really makes my lashed pop and lengthens them.  </li>
            <li> I have bever had much luck with mascara.</li>
            <li> Thanks Elizabeth Mott.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff</li>
            <li> It REALLY makes my lashes stand out.  </li>
            <li> High Recommended!</li>
            <li> I thought the product was going to add volume &amp; lengthen my lashes, much like I get when I use Revlon&#x27;s Grow Luscious mascaras</li>
            <li> I work 13hr days then head straight to the gym</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use mascara much</li>
            <li> Plus it really lengthens and plumps up my lashes.</li>
            <li> I give the product two stars, because shipping was really fast</li>
            <li> and I watched my lashes become straight again</li>
            <li> It is very volumizing and buildable without clumpiness.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> THANKS Elizabeth Mott.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara</li>
            <li> It really takes me a couple coats to really get it to look how I want</li>
            <li> so my lashes really pop.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for about two months now, and I really want to like it,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very drying, making my lashes break</li>
            <li> I have never paid this much for a mascara before.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my mascara.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take much to give them a boost.</li>
            <li> Plus it is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is very comparable and 1/2 the price.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re ready to walk out the door.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know where to start really.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about mascaras flaking, stay on power.</li>
            <li> It seems to really hold up and it doesn&#x27;t glop on the lashes like lots of brands</li>
            <li> It really does volumize my lashes without making them clump together.</li>
            <li> I was so worried to spend this much money on a brand that I&#x27;d never tried-</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I&#x27;m a woman with fairly straight eye lashes and for me to get any curly length, I have to use an eye lash curler along with waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> For this price, Macy&#x27;s Landcomb is so much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really, who does That anymore?&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Much expectations exceeded.</li>
            <li> Very impress lengthening.  </li>
            <li> Very buy now.</li>
            <li> It lengthens AND thickens without clumping which I feel like most brands say they do but really do not.</li>
            <li> I was really intrigued by the reviews.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do much for them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how much mascara costs me, I will pay the price if does everything I want.</li>
            <li> And I find the price quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> But this one really deserves its 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Makes your eyelashes so much longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara is surprisingly light.</li>
            <li> really like the wand of Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I really did not like this mascara at all.</li>
            <li> Takes me that much longer to get ready for work in the morning.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any real volume or length, although I did see a bunch of fibers around my face.</li>
            <li> This product stays put very well.</li>
            <li> I have straight, medium length lashes.</li>
            <li> I like it ... will absolutely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I was hoping with all the great reviews that I may have broken my Lancome habit, but</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look much longer</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> decided to get a free trial of this stuff and now have an order on the way because I have finally found my solution.</li>
            <li> It works very well; no smudges, goes on evenly; no clumps.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this mascara.  </li>
            <li> For this price I expected more.</li>
            <li> However, it took 4 coats to get some real volume.</li>
            <li> Then I rubbed it with my finger, and very well, it came off.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It does lengthen my lashes and define them very well.</li>
            <li> You really need makeup remover to get it off.</li>
            <li> Washes off really well with just water.</li>
            <li> Very recommend.</li>
            <li> I paid way too much and it doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clot or flake and does;t smudge much.  </li>
            <li> (I think I must have very oily skin undr my eyes).</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Still highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different mascaras after running out of the bottle I purchased after using up my sample and haven&#x27;t found anything that I love more than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really made my lashes look longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> It really lengthens the lashes and it never smudges.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too much of a hassle to return.</li>
            <li> They also sent me their shadow crayon which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I much prefer the Benefit</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for a while, for some reason this one I just ordered is very flaky?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the difference between whole milk and skim milk -</li>
            <li> It dries really fast on your lashes and stiffens up.</li>
            <li> I have very puny lashes</li>
            <li> I really like the wand</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love&amp;#34; It&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I found that it clumped after 1 week of being opened and did not add much volume to my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t&#x27; clump so much the thicker</li>
            <li> I have even washed my face gently around the eyes (not washing my lashes) and it stayed on without flaking or smudging.  </li>
            <li> It defines, separates and lengthens very well.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would help the appearance of my thinning lashes (over 50).</li>
            <li> Thanks reviewers for getting me to try this (THUMBS UP).</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t do it much justice.  </li>
            <li> Have straight eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This product works very well</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend it for its price and purpose!</li>
            <li> It coats evenly without clumping, and it really makes my lashes longer.</li>
            <li> I found it to be very close to cover girls lash blast, which is what I have been using.</li>
            <li> Didnt care for this mascara,it was very clumpy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This mascara was a huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;For a $20 mascara I expected much more than your regular Loreal, Maybelline and the like.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It curls lashes, it raises them, which is absolutely awesome!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I am very picky about mascara.  </li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and speedy.  </li>
            <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t flake off into my eyes, it never runs, and it really fills out my sparse eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> It really does keep the lashes separated and that in itself, helps makes the lashes look even longer.  </li>
            <li> ~ I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Would not buy again, and feel that the advertising is very misleading.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t add length and not too much volume either; I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> For the price I expected more.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my lashes.  </li>
            <li> thanks Elizabeth</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.!</li>
            <li> would purchase this again if needed, but I want to find something to keep my eye lashes curled rather than having them point straight out when applying my mascara.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are just very resistant and stubborn.</li>
            <li> The company very generously supplies a sample upon request, so I tried it</li>
            <li> I like applying multiple light coats and the brush works well for this (although I do wipe off any excess mascara that tends to gather at the end of the brush before applying.)  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really been put to the &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to my cheap brand.</li>
            <li> This mascara really separates lashes and extends lashes waaaaaayyy.out.  </li>
            <li> My wife just absolutely loves this.  </li>
            <li> I know this is going to be a very unpopular review, but I have to be honest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have a really embarrassing hair pulling disorder called trichotillomania.</li>
            <li> And it really doesn&#x27;t flake off.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted a waterproof.</li>
            <li> I would like a straight wand instead of</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> really helps give them volume and some length.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like the way it seperates all lmy lashes and is never &#x27;cakey&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It really did nothing for my lashes.</li>
            <li> I tried it on and it didn&#x27;t seem to change my lashes much</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s really it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear much make-up, but I never go without using this mascara.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t really run or flake off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a gentle rub with an eye makeup remover to take it off.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t found anything that beats Lancome.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as volumizing as I hoped, but it really does define, and it&#x27;s smudge proof.</li>
            <li> And it seems to have real staying power.</li>
            <li> It makes my unimpressive lashes really stand out.</li>
            <li> I apply it when getting ready for work each morning at 6am</li>
            <li> Stays on all day and makes lashes look much longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my fav and the only one I have purchased more than once.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve received some pretty cool stuff with these gift boxes, this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever sought out and purchased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different mascaras over the years and this is by far my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I have thin, short lashes and this is the best mascara I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t seem to have any particular clumping advantage over Covergirl or Revlon mascaras I&#x27;ve tried, and doesn&#x27;t do a better job of creating more definition between each eyelash, especially some of the slightly longer ones.</li>
            <li> It is so difficult to find a good mascara, add to that finding one that is cruelty free</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and have tried many different brands.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is with every penny and is the last kind I well likely ever try.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not one of those &amp;#34;touch up your make-up in the middle of the day&amp;#34; kind of people - simply don&#x27;t have time.)  </li>
            <li> but I have found that works best for my thin short lashes.</li>
            <li> , I decided to just keep piling it on to see what kind of thickness it produced, what a joke and what a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that kind of time to waste every morning.  </li>
            <li> but I am always at least trying to find a good mascara that adds length and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes.</li>
            <li> What I love about &amp;#34;its so Big&amp;#34; not only does it not flake it gives me the volume but in a natural looking way.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, looks great with a single coat for the day and is smooth enough to use multiple coats for a more dramatic night look.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s worth having slightly thinner lashes to know that a make up company places a high priority on respect and love for animals.</li>
            <li> I want a mascara that dries quickly, requires very few coats, lengthens, voluminizes, does not smudge, does not irritate my eyes and is a bold rich color.  </li>
            <li> ; is the ONLY one that stays puts throughout the whole day and night!!!</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> I feel feel like I have young eyes again after applying!!!</li>
            <li> It gives me very full, very long looking lashes that are not caterpillary.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve use all the ones Sephora carries plus half the ones in the drug store.</li>
            <li> My wife said that even with the best mascaras she often ends up with some spots of black or runny spots from her mascara after working all day and not touching up her make up.  </li>
            <li> Took a long time to dry between coats....not good if you are in a hurry to get going.  </li>
            <li> I love trying different mascara products, (I do revisit the pink original Maybeline often)</li>
            <li> I have never found a product that makes my lashes look so long AND full!</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes so long and full!</li>
            <li> makes them look so long and full!</li>
            <li> I have only used the product a few times but, so far so good!</li>
            <li> I was looking at buying Latisse to enhance my eyelashes, but decided to try a new mascara first</li>
            <li> I live in a hot, humid climate.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and comes off easily with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> After reading all the other reviews I expected this to be a great lengthener - it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and leaves lashes looking long and sleek.</li>
            <li> My other mascara allows me to build layer on top of layer, as much as I want, but I think my lashes &amp;#34;got used&amp;#34; to my go-to mascara and started looking loppy.</li>
            <li> I did give it two stars due to the fast shipping and cute packaging.</li>
            <li> However, I went back to this mascara because it&#x27;s superior to the other that I tried.</li>
            <li> Thanks Elizabeth Mott and thanks Amazon for having product reviews on new products!</li>
            <li> I sometimes dust my lashes with some light powder from bare essential prior to using mascara for more fullness .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard many makeup artists say that mascaras are pretty much the same and you&#x27;re just buying a different brush that you like.</li>
            <li> I live in the SW and most mascara&#x27;s dry out in a month</li>
            <li> a little soap and water and light massage takes it all right off!  </li>
            <li> Is 19 bucks worth losing the quick dry and the volume?  </li>
            <li> But it is the dramatic awesome length that you get from department store brands such as Dior, Guerlain, Lancome?</li>
            <li> This product proves to be one of the most difficult mascaras to remove, which is great because you can go clubbing in it and not worry about looking like a hot mess!</li>
            <li> Works really well -- lengthens and volumizes lashes with just a few coats, and washes off very easily.</li>
            <li> I have had better luck with other mascaras than with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands that are way better.</li>
            <li> My other favorite &amp;#34;Mally&amp;#34; mascara does</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better with other brands; the no-smudging is what&#x27;s keeping me sold on this product.</li>
            <li> I think this one gives a cleaner look, while the other brand gives more volume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different than any I&#x27;ve used before, and worth the money!</li>
            <li> Unfortunatly due to too many morning of eye irritation I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> My bottom lashes stand out more from this mascara than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I put it on for work, got done, went out, and woke up the next day with lashes that looked freshly done!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, I do believe it does more for length than volume</li>
            <li> This product really is better than i expected!  </li>
            <li> Better than all other drugstore mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I read all the other reviews and decided to try it, but it is just OK.</li>
            <li> Currently, I use &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; by Benefit, and I love it, but I feel that a tube of that stuff usually lasts me 2 weeks before it starts having to take alot more coats.  </li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d like any other mascara more than Maybelline&#x27;s The Falsies.</li>
            <li> Ive had way better mascaras and this one does make my lashes longer but itx not consistent with the thickness of the application if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> I already have pretty long and full eyelashes, but wanted something that made them really stand out.</li>
            <li> This mascara definitely adds a significant amount of length.</li>
            <li> Compared my other eyelashes, which had $7 Stiletto mascara on them, this mascara did NOT make my lashes look any better.</li>
            <li> It does lengthen and volumize, however I do think other mascara&#x27;s do it better.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this after reading the rave reviews,  and then learning this this product is not tested on animals (that&#x27;s what the 2nd star is for).&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the unique brush is terrific!  </li>
            <li> You ladies who can rock just one coat of mascara and look normal, I envy you!</li>
            <li> and we both have said to each other about the many compliments we receive whenever we wear it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes your lashes comparably nice to other regular brands which cost under $10, plus it dries up easily and flakes after just a few hours, which is a huge NO-NO in my book.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do love the way it goes on, but with a brand new tube, it does clump up on the brush where you have to clear the brush off to apply it properly.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this mascara mainly because it was quite reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> My eyes tend to dry out fairly easily, I have not felt itchy eyes or irritated eyes with this product.</li>
            <li> This mascara has it all, it does not flake or clump, goes on really smooth and really does make your lashes look extremely long.</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed it for the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly but the tube was relatively dry after I opened it.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t need false lashes with this mascara because it looks like I have beautiful natural ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on easily with minimal clumping (never met any that didn&#x27;t clump to a certain degree).  </li>
            <li> I have mostly used lancome or other high end mascara due to irritation of eyes with most of drug store brands.  </li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look incredible and washes off so much easier than other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> it is decent, but I have used other cheaper mascaras that I like more.  </li>
            <li> With the high praises i was really dissapointed in this.</li>
            <li> This is a really highly-rated mascara, and the volume of high ratings influenced my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Too much clumping with the application of this mascara, although I really wanted to try a new product.  </li>
            <li> Paired with my Shu Uemura eyelash curler, ice been getting compliments left and right!</li>
            <li> Volumizing is definitely the right word for this mascara!</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product, and the reviews got me so excited</li>
            <li> I know it is a little expensive, but why buy the cheap when you can have the best!</li>
            <li> It looks natural enough and comes off relatively easily when I wash my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and like most Asians I have very straight, but long eye lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lengthening (little tubes on the ends of your lashes) and cleans off easily, but not clumpy when applying (which is...amazing!).</li>
            <li> I have naturally very long but fine eyelashes</li>
            <li> However, the subsequent tries have been much better!  </li>
            <li> Great mascara for my thin lashes and sensitive eyes!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy wearing it alone without any other eye makeup because it makes that much of a difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got long lashes already, so it&#x27;s not my primary goal here, but let&#x27;s face facts.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this, but when it arrived I first noticed the pink box opened.  </li>
            <li> I have long, light lashes</li>
            <li> I will continue ordering this mascara as long as it available.</li>
            <li> so normally I don&#x27;t notice much difference between makeup brands.  </li>
            <li> So Big Mascara make my lashes look and full of volume.</li>
            <li> I also love the dark color this provides.</li>
            <li> It was not horrible, just average.</li>
            <li> I tried this after getting a sample in my Ipsy bag and finally had to buy a full size tube.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the MAC and as much as the Urban Decay although the effects are different.  </li>
            <li> Unlike most mascaras, this one does not leave dark smudges under my eye at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I ordered the sample off of their website as suggested by others and came back to by the full version.  </li>
            <li> I have long lashes that are light and not particularly thick, so I really need a mascara that creates volume.  </li>
            <li> It was more waterproof then the average brand, but it did not add volume or length</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> So Big is like a dream come true for my lashes.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how it does on its own, but my friend says it doesn&#x27;t smear for her</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t quite understand the hype - it wasn&#x27;t until I was in a situation where I ended up pushed in a pool unexpectedly where this mascara truly shined.</li>
            <li> Better than your average grocery store mascara.</li>
            <li> the It&#x27;s So Big - is true to its name.</li>
            <li> I liked my past mascara, but saw all the reviews on Amazon and thought I would try it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok as mascara goes, but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara that stays put through my busy day.  </li>
            <li> Honestly after reading all the reviews i couldn&#x27;t wait to get the product… Usually i use LANCOME  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a major step in the right direction.</li>
            <li> But on the other hand, that&#x27;s kind of a good thing because I can layer it as much as I want, and either have a natural look or a really dramatic look.</li>
            <li> It layers very well, spreads out your lashes, doesn&#x27;t smudge (very important to me), lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Hands down, this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> But it goes on easy, the brush is not too big or small, the color is dark black, it is super buildable, and the best part, IT DOES NOT SMUDGE OR FLAKE!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in my naked lashes on the left eye versus the mascara&#x27;d lashes on the right eye.</li>
            <li> Very easy to remove and long lasting with no clumping</li>
            <li> Although I will continue to try new products, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; is the front runner for now!</li>
            <li> It one of my new favorites!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on a quest for a new mascara that will make my eyelashes look longer!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping an eye on this company for ANY new products that pop up!</li>
            <li> To be clear, this mascara isn&#x27;t really like my old Full n&#x27; Soft.</li>
            <li> But comes off easily with plain old face cleanser and water (no need for special eye makeup remover).</li>
            <li> hope this is available for a long time and never changes!</li>
            <li> It seems to work better when there is less product on the brush.</li>
            <li> usually put on one coat, then go back and put on another coat, which better thickens, defines and lengthens&lt;br /&gt;my fine lashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been comparing with others I typically used and this is much better.</li>
            <li> Better product can be bought for less at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> But my favorite part is that I  never get the black residue under my eyes</li>
            <li> I love it because it doesn&#x27;t wear off, smudge or make those black marks under your eyes</li>
            <li> I like my L&#x27;Oreal mascara much more, and it&#x27;s half the price.</li>
            <li> Much better than the lancome product I used previously &amp; half the price</li>
            <li> Did not smear or clump, but have had drugstore mascara do more for much less cost.</li>
            <li> I had found much better mascara at drugstores for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and has lasted about 1.5 months before it started to dry out in the tube a bit.  </li>
            <li> And my main thing to get use</li>
            <li> My main problem has always been specks of mascara ending up all around my eyes within an hour or two.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different types of mascara with hopes of finding one that would not bleed on my upper eye lid or under my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In sum, if you&#x27;ve got decent lash volume and just need something that will stick with you all day</li>
            <li> If you already have decent lashes, it will probably work for you.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely reorder in future.</li>
            <li> Like seriously, I&#x27;ve never had lashes like this before.</li>
            <li> The test was last Saturday as I was the wedding planner for my daughters wedding and running ragged puts it mildly.</li>
            <li> You can layer it easily without any problems so you can have a day look with one or two layers and a more dramatic look with 5 plus layers.  </li>
            <li> I can make a really decent job on them with this mascara.</li>
            <li> It comes off quickly, you don&#x27;t have to rub it, and it doesn&#x27;t smudge all over your eyes like regular mascara.....</li>
            <li> I use mostly MAC make-up overall, but since I started using SO BIG Volumizing Mascara by Elizabeth Mott, I haven&#x27;t used anything else.</li>
            <li> The results from using this mascara are decent; however, I don&#x27;t like the application brush.</li>
            <li> Really decent mascara.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different mascaras - Covergirl, Lancome, Sephora, Urban Decay, Clinique, you name it.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and does lengthen,but does not really thicken the lases much.</li>
            <li> I can find decent mascaras, but they will smudge under my eyes after a while.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to love it, but I guess I&#x27;m with the few it didn&#x27;t work for.  </li>
            <li> All in all a decent purchase.</li>
            <li> I went back recently and ordered 2 more because the price had dropped $5.00 each.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok..not a &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; but decent.  </li>
            <li> so I ordered the sample size which is a decent size.</li>
            <li> Basically, they&#x27;re not thick but they&#x27;re not thin... just normal).</li>
            <li> so I could have decent looking lashes.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and lush, doesn&#x27;t smear, doesn&#x27;t flake, and is a good price.</li>
            <li> But we wear it because we want beautiful, long, thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little gloopy at first, so I use an eyelash comb to easily catch any globs.</li>
            <li> but it still washes off very easily with water and a little eye-makeup remover!</li>
            <li> Short lashes become long and strong!</li>
            <li> It did provide some length but didn&#x27;t have the wow factor I was expecting from all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> but once a day and NO black eyes at the end of the day!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to apply because it makes my lashes look extra long and huge.  </li>
            <li> So then I try to layer a bit more on to create some depth, and it just sticks and clumps on my lashes, making a bit of a mess.</li>
            <li> This mascara was true to the reviews and it is now my new daily mascara.</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be the greatest mascara ever, but it was a little dry and not very lengthening or volumizing.  </li>
            <li> This mascara gives a natural long lash look and is easy to remove with soap &amp; water so I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>

            <li> I really wanted to like this mascara because of all the great reviews, but alas this did nothing for my straight asian lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried drugstore brands to high end department store brands.  </li>
            <li> It has replaced all my fancy high end mascaras.</li>

            <li> For everyone else, I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you are looking for a lengthening mascara.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> You can tell it is high quality</li>
            <li> I work in a high pace environment and</li>
            <li> Amazon users rated it highly and so did Makeup Alley.</li>
            <li> This one passes the test and I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I rarely buy makeup and/or skincare twice since I am constantly buying new things and trying so much</li>
            <li> While this is my new favorite mascara, this last tube seemed a bit different.</li>
            <li> No need to try others, this creates clean, long lashes.</li>
            <li> The second coat with the other brands go on nicely and make my lashes pop.</li>
            <li> The only other issue is when you wash it off it gets kind of clumpy under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> It has a wet kind of gel quality that builds and doesn&#x27;t dry too fast so that you can build up volume and length.</li>
            <li> If your lashes are naturally curled, you would probably like it (as the many other 5-star reviewers do).</li>
            <li> and I thought I&#x27;d splurge on a little bit more high end mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not waterproof but it does take a little more than water to get it off.</li>
            <li> When I came out of the water my mascara looked the same exact way it did as when I went in!</li>
            <li> The product is ok, but it&#x27;s a little too liquidy for my liking.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara, but wish it added a little more volume.</li>
            <li> It can be a little clumpy, but it&#x27;s not awful.</li>
            <li> I got my first sample of this mascara in my Ipsy bag, and there is just no other mascara like</li>
            <li> Once I tried it I fell a little bit in love.</li>
            <li> I was expecting big things from this mascara after all the rave reviews on Amazon, but after using it for the first time today, I wasn&#x27;t as wowed as I hoped!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The not so good:&lt;br /&gt;It went on a little clumpy; I had to manually separate out some of my top lashes after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The price is a little more then I would like to spend on mascara</li>
            <li> I like Nutrogena&#x27;s wand a little better</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews are a little gushy and over the top.</li>
            <li> You think they&#x27;re all basically the same, but this one does exactly what it&#x27;s name states!</li>
            <li> It stays looking nice the WHOLE DAY long, and I can&#x27;t say that about other mascaras I have used.</li>
            <li> It is fine - not sure it is worth $20.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wear or smudge, and I&#x27;ve tested it on several long and warm days so far; but it comes off easily with coconut oil and my regular facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply, I don&#x27;t need 5 coats like other brands,</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t run and washes off easier than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> trust me during summer, you want this because it stays on like water proof, but it comes off easy like any other mascara.</li>
            <li> It easily adds volume and length to your curls, although not to an extreme extent.</li>
            <li> Some of my other favorites went on well but had a strong chemical odor.</li>
            <li> I have normal to long eyelashes, but I like them to look full and vibrant and this product does the trick.</li>
            <li> Really like it very much and have bought several for gifts.  </li>
            <li> I really like how this product goes on overall; but found it hard to get a good amount of it on.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay attention to the bad reviews, this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> not thick or clumpy.</li>
            <li> My lashes are defined,  soft,  volumizing,  I really gave it a test yesterday and put it on before my workout.  </li>
            <li> I just (sadly) ran out of my discontinued Lash Length mascara by Mary Kay and decided to buy this because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Lancôme is too expensive for what you get, and with Great Lash, you get what you pay for (which includes lots of flaking/smudging).  </li>
            <li> About two years ago my usual brand of mascara was discontinued and had still not found a suitable replacement when a sample of this arrived in my ipsy bag.</li>
            <li> The wand is also great for lengthening and doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look weird and spidery or clumpy, like some mascaras will do.</li>
            <li> It really gives NATURAL looking volume to skimpy lashes.</li>
            <li> I do like the fact that it is not thick and clumpy.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be my dream mascara after all the great reviews, but it seems some of us have the wrong lashes or something.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every brand of mascara my whole adult life trying to find one that doesn&#x27;t result in racoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I expected fantastic eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> makes my lashes appear MUCH longer, but still natural and not clumpy.  </li>
            <li> I have spent more than 30 years and no telling how much money seeking my HG mascara and have finally found it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used (and liked) benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;bad gal lash&amp;#34; and lately a mascara from Elizabeth Arden, but I don&#x27;t care for this mascara at all.  </li>
            <li> this mascara makes them look full and long.  </li>
            <li> It is still worth the $20 price-tag simply because it doesn&#x27;t flake off!</li>
            <li> Also, makes lashes look full and long.  </li>
            <li> I was having difficulties finding a mascara that was  making my lashes look long and full.  </li>
            <li> I do need more than my usual gentle cleanser to remove</li>
            <li> Like others have said, the mascara is flaky and I&#x27;m not used to this, as my normal mascara doesn&#x27;t do this.</li>
            <li> It stays on and it doesn&#x27;t clump and it makes my lashes look long and full.</li>
            <li> I had full, long lashes until getting lash extensions.</li>
            <li> OK, as long as they are making It&#x27;s So BIG, I&#x27;ll be buying it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many mascaras and there always seems to be one missing piece--</li>
            <li> First off, you dont feel this mascara your lashes stay soft and natural feeling</li>
            <li> for me, I will go back to my long standing favorite:  </li>
            <li> Full, long lashes without clumps and does not irritate.  </li>
            <li> like the way the brush &amp;#34;finds&amp;#34; all of my lashes and gets them all looking long and full.</li>
            <li> I find Loreal&#x27;s Voluminous mascara to actually perform better in the thickening department, but it did manage to stay on a long time.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe how full and long my lashes are.  </li>
            <li> I believe I bought this for $20... and the Urban Decay mascara is $22 - WELL worth the price.</li>
            <li> After curling my lashes as I normally did, I applied one coat of this mascara</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look soooo long and full.</li>
            <li> It made them look long and full.</li>
            <li> I laugh at the picture on the box,which shows massive volume depending on the number of layers you use.</li>
            <li> My favorite everyday mascara...</li>
            <li> but it overall it was worth it.</li>
            <li> This definitely does not - the first one that I have found that really doesn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li> Washes off with my normal face cleanser or by the shampoo while taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can sleep in it and it&#x27;ll still look fresh the next morning.</li>
            <li> This is worth it big time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to my Clinique mascaras not leaving anything when I wash my face, but this is probably a normal occurrence.</li>
            <li> Gives me long, full lashes with no smudging or clumps.</li>
            <li> totally worth it, as it actually volumizes.  </li>
            <li> Great product, creates long thick lashes with no clumping.  </li>
            <li> I only wear mascara during the day - no liner or coverup, and I rarely take the time to wash my mascara off before I workout.</li>
            <li> And since my lashes are already long, when looking for a mascara I focus on volume and a nice consistency that is not too wet.</li>
            <li> Makes my eyelashes long and full.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the thick fiber-filled mascaras, this one would not be what you&#x27;re looking for; however, it stays on longer and thickens up nicely when you layer it on your lashes.</li>
            <li> It has a nice thick coat that separates and defines my lashes...</li>
            <li> It is a nice thick look, and resists clumping.</li>
            <li> For volume and lash separation with a good brush, I&#x27;m sticking with my Max Factor False Lash Effect mascara.</li>
            <li> I have always used drugstore mascaras and was a little hesitant to spend more than eight bucks to try something new out</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara hands down!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something more dramatic like the L&#x27;oreal Paris Voluminous Original Mascara.</li>
            <li> no clumping, flaking or difficult removal, just awesome long lashes, a winner!</li>
            <li> This mascara has not only has a great glossy black finish, but it does not smudge even during a long workout at  gym.</li>
            <li> I have always looked for a long lasting, gentle and  easy to take off waterproof mascara</li>
            <li> Took a little while to get used to the unique shape of the brush, but now I really like it!</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical to buy sit since I never heard of this brand before and its price is comparable to other more popular ones.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have to worry about raccoon eyes after multiple dips in the ocean or pool; this mascara stays where it&#x27;s supposed to, yet comes off super easy with a little eye makeup remover at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It is only &amp;#34;BIG volumizing&amp;#34; when you wear several coats, but is does not smear and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> And the big bonus is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and I can just wipe it off with my regular face cleansing wipes at night easily.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you let it dry before adding multiple coats, otherwise you may get some lashes sticking together.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I&#x27;m finding that it doesn&#x27;t get too thick and dry towards the end of the supply like some mascaras do.  </li>
            <li> I also like that when you wash it off, it doesnt make big black smudges under your eyes, rather it just kind of chips away.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency to apply, not too dry to too wet.</li>
            <li> The wand is tapered in the middle, making it easy to reach the inner, and outer corners of your lashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my lashes very full - I was hoping for slightly longer</li>
            <li> I do wish this mascara made my lashes look a little thicker and a little longer, but I already have pretty good lashes</li>
            <li> I like my lashes to look curled, separated, full, and long!</li>
            <li> It gives me full long lashes (not clumpy at all!)</li>
            <li> My thinning middle-aged lashes haven&#x27;t looked so full and long in years!</li>
            <li> My make up remover, and other, more traditional soaps/face washes remove it very well.  </li>
            <li> Everyone else says it slides right off, but I definitely do not have that experience.</li>
            <li> left &amp; right eyelashes had comparable volume and length.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I have long and full natural lashes, no curling or falsies!</li>
            <li> It was super clumpy and overpriced and I have long eyelashes</li>
            <li> You’re lashes look super long today”.</li>
            <li> Gives me long dark lashes :)!</li>
            <li> this technique gives me super long lashes.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are fine and grow in such a way that they tend to criss cross.</li>
            <li> Does a decent job of separating lashes, but I usually still use a lash comb to separate even more.</li>
            <li> It also washes off very cleanly and I appreciate not having to waste a lot of time with eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> The cheap ones don&#x27;t show much difference and the bottle doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> What I love: gives LONG, thick, clump free lashes and NO FLAKING AT ALL.</li>
            <li> the other reviews made it sound like it was some miracle mascara</li>
            <li> For the last 30 years I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal Lash Out and more recently L&#x27;Oreal Bare Naturale mascara, and nothing else.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and stays on throughout the day with absolutely no smudging!  </li>
            <li> I still try to use mascara, since it only makes my lashes appear even fuller and longer, but in general I can only apply a bit on the inside corners, mostly the bottom row.</li>
            <li> Other mascaras I&#x27;ve purchased from high- end make-up stores went on great but thought out the day I would get dark circles under my eyes (raccoon eyes) and was constantly having to wipe under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I think the Clinique High Impact Mascara works better, not sure if it is the brush.</li>
            <li> Comparable to high end mascaras that sell for the same price or higher.</li>
            <li> Although the goggles I wear are only the first defense against the high ninja winds, and my eyes do nothing</li>
            <li> Definitely my new go to mascara.</li>
            <li> and MAYBE it is just because this is a new tube.</li>
            <li> (Sometimes new mascaras need to be &amp;#34;broken-in&amp;#34; in my experience).  </li>
            <li> This is a new brand for me</li>
            <li> I assumed it was because of my new eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Even after I washed my face, I still had new flakes around my eye.  </li>
            <li> I ride horses all day, live in the pacific northwest where it rains ALOT, and no problem with&lt;br /&gt;it staying in place.  </li>
            <li> I have found my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new go to mascara.</li>
            <li> is my new mascara for life</li>
            <li> and I tried it and new</li>
            <li> My new mascara for life.</li>
            <li> My new mascara obsession.</li>
            <li> Brand new product.</li>
            <li> but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t even try any new mascaras I receive in my sample bags.</li>
            <li> I found my new mascara</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new mascara that would not clump, flake, or smear and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new mascara that would&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the new product for quite awhile now, and even with age the mascara is not clumping--</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> I found a new mascara.</li>
            <li> I had heard about all the new lash extending mascaras</li>
            <li> Each time a new mascara would hit the market, I&#x27;d have to run out and get it ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to mascara &amp; will be recommending it to friends &amp; clients.</li>
            <li> I buy a new one every 12 weeks or so.</li>
            <li> Its hard to get more than 2 coats on because it dries so fast.</li>
            <li> There is no flaking or clumping and it makes my eyelashes look super long!</li>
            <li> Makes your lashes look super long and never clumps!</li>
            <li> to remove just by washing my face, which was nice - with my usual mascara (Sephora full action extreme effect), if I try to just wash it off it ends up smudging under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> rarely do I buy the same makeup twice because I am always looking to try something new, but I have gone through two tubes of this mascara so far</li>
            <li> In the last year, I have been only using samples  to try out every higher end brand to find the right one.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended...works better than the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried also!  </li>
            <li> It was okay, but clumped a HUGE amount and was extremely difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> It removes easily in the shower and doesn&#x27;t leave any black under my eyes after the shower.</li>
            <li> Lashes are fuller longer thicker without smudging and easy to remove  without irritation or black eye look</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave black circles under my eyes but it comes off easily with just water (just like the description said).</li>
            <li> My previous Almay mascara was not as length-extending but it also didn&#x27;t smudge, came off easily and cost $10 max.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many brands of mascara, from cheap to expensive</li>
            <li> in all, I would say this mascara would be good for someone who does not want anything dramatic at all.</li>
            <li> It makes my tiny eyelashes be more noticeable with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> I can tell you I&#x27;ve spent way more money on high-end mascara that doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to So BIG.</li>
            <li> despite its staying power, it comes off completely with just regular eye-makeup remover - no racoon eyes in the morning, when we start fresh.</li>
            <li> The mascara is nice, but Seriously?  </li>
            <li> This mascara gives you full, long lashes that look natural.</li>
            <li> Also, it must dry quickly because I never have any stray marks after I am done applying it.</li>
            <li> which really helps define those tiny lashes you don&#x27;t get at with a straight wand.</li>
            <li> My lashes look long naturally not &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34; I also love the brush because of its shape it catches the end of my lashes and extends them evenly with the rest of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more on base all good reviews .</li>
            <li> I loved the lengthening effects of They&#x27;re Real, but it was prone to flaking and was difficult to remove at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Good to use as a base coat before your favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky on my mascara and am always in the search of something good but not too expensive and this hit the mark.  </li>
            <li> This is a good mascara if your lashes are thick and you need length only.</li>
            <li> My typical day consists of going to work, the gym, home and it stays on strong with no issues.</li>
            <li> I still use my 3D for date night or other special occasions, but I love this one for everyday use.</li>
            <li> No smudge, no flaking, makes lashes soooo long and really opens up your eyes!!  </li>
            <li> I wear contacts, have allergies and live in a hot climate and can really endorse this product as long wearing!  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes/skin and always need products that are hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> My eyes are also very sensitive but no irritation with this product occurred.</li>
            <li> This stays put all day and defines the lashes in a very natural way.  </li>
            <li> Looks very natural and not clumpy</li>
            <li> It does make your lashes look longer and very natural.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> The result is a very natural look, and it seems that my lashes are getting thicker since I&#x27;ve been using this.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive greasy eyes lids...</li>
            <li> Thank you very much, will definitely order again and also give as gifts.</li>
            <li> It has never irritated my eyes which is saying a lot as I have very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to those fibers that flake off and fall in my eye and blur my vision.</li>
            <li> Leaving a very natural but volume  lash.  </li>
            <li> Both look very natural.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive watery eyes</li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t have very many or very thick lashes</li>
            <li> The company was kind enough to replace my first order within a few days after I emailed them about my problems, however there was no change in the second mascara I was sent.</li>
            <li> However, the description claims it easily washes off with water -- that is not true at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, no clumps, no goopy mess.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something different and always willing to try something new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smart enough to be used for work and it is flirty enough to use for those fun nights.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super watery the consistency is loose and if you like the clumpy look</li>
            <li> Long lasting, does not smudge, easy to take off.</li>
            <li> Despite the long wear, it&#x27;s still easy to remove with a standard eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and makes the lashes long and big yet gives you a wispy look.</li>
            <li> If you wet a piece of toilet paper with warm water and gently pull your lashes with it, the mascara slides right off in a sort of goo that you can roll into a little ball and throw away</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara I&#x27;ve used that makes my lashes look several times longer and thicker WITHOUT the too-often typical unevenness and clumping that I&#x27;ve experienced with other (lesser) mascaras.</li>
            <li> I apply 2 coats to my lashes in the morning and done - huge lashes for the rest of the day without any dark circles or flaking under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Great mascara, you won&#x27;t look like a panda if it gets wet because it comes out the whole thing as if it is a thin cover to your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I also judge a mascara on how hard it is to get off, and it comes off easy with my makeup remover, home run!  </li>
            <li> and I was leery of paying extra for something that wouldn&#x27;t necessarily work any better than my current mascara.  </li>
            <li> So when I first tried this product I thought it worked well, but didn&#x27;t see how it was any different than cover girl lash blast.</li>
            <li> the product in general didn&#x27;t produce much thickness.</li>
            <li> I can soak it with a hot wash cloth for a minute and only a smidge comes off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty low maintenance</li>
            <li> No smudging or flaking so far!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t spend more than 10$ on mascara</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara that actually stays on me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s So Big and tried it yesterday for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Love the mascara, and will totally have to try out the other products from this company.</li>
            <li> --with most other brands I feel like I am constantly wiping underneath my eyes with my fingers.  </li>
            <li> This product adds WOW!  </li>
            <li> Most mascaras claim to do both, but usually lack in one way or another.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a busy woman always go, go, go!</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t clump or flake, so the lashes appear dark, smooth, well-defined.</li>
            <li> Was hesitant to buy, as it seems as though when I get samples, they far outshine the normal sized product.  </li>
            <li> I have finally found a mascara that I really like!  </li>
            <li> Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara first came to me by way of my Ipsy Bag.  </li>
            <li> Looks the same as when I first put it on this morning.</li>
            <li> Always searching for a mascara that lasts all day with the same volume as when first applied.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price, and one tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> They are average length and light.  </li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I thought I was going to be impressed with the lack of clumpy, gross-looking lashes, but I was actually fairly disappointed.</li>
            <li> so it does make you look like you have more eyelashes than usual.</li>
            <li> This worlds better than some of the designer exspensive ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> OH WOW!</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara I have used that actually did what it said!</li>
            <li> I have never spent this much money on mascara</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my contacts and when I forgot to take it off my eyes weren&#x27;t all goopy (happened with an all natural mascara!).</li>
            <li> use Physicians Formula organic mascara first for fullness and then immediately add the Its So BIG on the tips for length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Might need to order another tube as my 16 year old daughter keeps taking it!</li>
            <li> by far!</li>
            <li> Here is my mascara background: not sure why, but most eye products smear and smudge on me.</li>
            <li> Goes a long way and is well worth the $20.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, to me, no smudging!</li>
            <li> a miracle worker, the magic mascara for eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;Women look no more</li>
            <li> I guess my truthful answer is I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> I only need one coat to get the look I want, where other mascaras need about three or more.</li>
            <li> I first received It&#x27;s So BIG mascara as a bonus item with another mascara that I ordered.</li>
            <li> I know to get the most out of this product, but every time I&#x27;ve used it I look like I forgot to put on mascara, and end up putting my usual mascara over it.  </li>
            <li> I officially get to stay pretty while sweating it up with clients in the back country of Alaska.  </li>
            <li> This is the first mascara that I have ever used that causes no irritation and stays where it belongs (on my eyelashes only!)</li>
            <li> This mascara is so much better than the ones I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> definitely curl your lashes first.  </li>
            <li> They were lifted a bit higher, but if you use a curler before you put the Stiletto on, you will get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> I, like many others, have scan the endless types of mascaras in places like Target trying to decide which one will FINALLY be the one for my eyelashes...</li>
            <li> Have searched and searched for good mascara and still searching!! :(</li>
            <li> I have short lashes and this mascara is EXACTLY what I needed.</li>
            <li> I have tried more mascaras in the past six months than I care to admit.  </li>
            <li> I will prob not order again just due to the type of eyelashes I have and will stick to Better Than Sex, which is the brand I currently use.</li>
            <li> Okay so I bought this mascara after reading the reviews however I am not really in love with mascara.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive than drug store brands but totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have purchased my second tube (my first would have lasted longer</li>
            <li> It smelled like really old mascara!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already placed a second order for this mascara, so I&#x27;ll have it when it&#x27;s time to replace the first one I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive it based on all the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes, for the first time in 20 years, are back!</li>
            <li> This mascara is so soft!  </li>
            <li> And it looks so natural, not clumpy at all!</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I was excited to try this mascara.  </li>
            <li> Any definition they may have had from my curler was done seeing as how facial steam in my goggles straightened them but the volume on the lashes themselves was as they were when first applied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect 2 coats for casual look but easily builable for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily with little clumping.  </li>
            <li> The little clumping that sometimes occurs when applying it is easily remedied with a Qtip.</li>
            <li> it- goes on easily, gives volume and little bit of length without clumping.</li>
            <li> Easily removed with a little coconut oil before I wash my face at night.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing mascara on a dry day in a less than 50% humidity climate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m rather frugal (read: cheap) and am in no way let down by this mascara.  </li>
            <li> To keep it short and sweet, I am ALWAYS on the lookout for a new mascara, but now that I found this one I am never going back.</li>
            <li> However, in order to get volume you have apply many layers, which ends up getting very messy and clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are: no smudging/flaking, contact friendly, dark black color, able to create moderate to high drama, and preferably comes off with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I am always trying new mascara to make my natural lashes look longer and fuller.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the right mascara for a long time...</li>
            <li> I was hoping I could find something that I liked more and was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to my trusty Loreal, which makes my lashes look great for less than half the price of this stuff...</li>
            <li> If I lightly rub my eye it leaves a lot of black &amp;#34;crumbs&amp;#34; on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I am going back to my cheap one because it doesn&#x27;t clump and it makes my already long lashes even longer.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, no clumps, it doesn&#x27;t straighten my just curled lashes, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; leaving me with raccoon eyes, it washes off easily.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty natural overall.</li>
            <li> overall, voluminous make the lashes thicker, and its so big makes them longer but not as full.</li>
            <li> I have short straight lashes and by brushing them up, without a curler, my lashes look five times their normal size.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are exceptionally long, and I have spent many years looking for mascara that does not give me raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of the few women that have lots of nice, long lashes... except when I put this garbage on it</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to buying Smashbox Full Exposure, which is slightly more expensive, but</li>
            <li> I have fairly full eyelashes, I end up plucking a few in the corner because they tend to tangle no matter how much I curl or shape them.</li>
            <li> The product lengthens my lashes beautifully and doesn&#x27;t feel thick or too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I came across this mascara on Amazon and decided to give it a try, based on the numerous positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seriously have tried 20 different mascaras ranging from cheap to expensive and I have to say this is the BEST!</li>
            <li> In the case of this mascara I think that maybe you have a large pool of 5 star reviewers that are just hitting the market place &amp; really haven&#x27;t been test-driving mascara&#x27;s for long enough to REALLY know when they&#x27;ve found one of the &amp;#34;Greats&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Most mascaras irritate me like crazy after a full days wear, but not this beauty!</li>
            <li> So this is by far one of my favorites out there I&#x27;ve bought as far as mascara goes in a longggg time!</li>
            <li> product is probably great for people that already have thick, long lashes, &amp; need a mascara that will last all day.</li>
            <li> It also comes off easily for me with a few rounds of soap and water (In flakes, not black smears, yay!).  </li>
            <li> My lashes don&#x27;t necessarily feel more voluminous, but they do appear much longer than usual</li>
            <li> spin brush as you coat your lashes for a full wide eyed look!</li>
            <li> I used up the small sample which actually did last me for a  good amount of time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not bad - just not as life changing as some of the other reviews seem to claim.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mascara itself is more dry feeling, rather than wet which</li>
            <li> I have been on what seems to be an impossible search for the perfect daily wear mascara.</li>
            <li> It really makes your eye lashes look thick and it&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>
            <li> It dried quickly, which I appreciated.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very black, it lengthens your lashes and comes off easily with make-up remover.</li>
            <li> No flaking, drooping or smudging no matter how sweaty the workout, how long the work day or how many endless flights I&#x27;ve been on.</li>
            <li> You can put on less for a more natural look, or vamp it up with extra coats.</li>
            <li> The only drawback to me is that it doesn&#x27;t wash off as easily with regular facial cleanser or soap and water as some brands.  </li>
            <li> It does not clump, it is easy to apply and goes on very very very black.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not nearly as volumizing as other mascaras I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Many other brands go on smooth at first, but start to dry out and clump after only a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so incredibly easy to clean off with no black sludge left on my face like other more expensive mascaras.</li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara&amp;#34; again,</li>
            <li> This Elizabeth Mott mascara, however, goes on smooth and lasts all day, with little to no undereye smudge.</li>
            <li> Multiple coats makes them thicker, bolder, and more dramatic for night / special occasions.</li>
            <li> It separates my lashes so nicely and within a few coats (let the lashes dry in between each coat), my lashes are longer than ever almost like I&#x27;m wearing falsies!</li>
            <li> It is very goopy at first and is hard to clean the brush off enough to even apply it.  </li>
            <li> You have to use make up removeror work a little harder with the wash and warm water to get it off</li>
            <li> My problem is that I want more fullness and this product helps a little bit&lt;br /&gt;But enough.</li>
            <li> If you dare to try to put on more than one coat, your lashes look like gross little insect legs.  </li>
            <li> Find it a little clumpy, but overall satisfied.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m 42, so my eyelids are starting to droop a little and sometimes touch my top lashes.  </li>
            <li> Gave this a 4 star because it is a pretty decent mascara, though there are similar ones for a lesser cost, that is why I did not do a 5 star.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time being able to take the mascara off my lashes once it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> No black eyes or smudging!</li>
            <li> Still love the formula, but the brush IS hard to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super goopey, clumpy, and gets on my eyelid every time it apply it, no matter how careful I am!</li>
            <li> Quick easy application thick long eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My lashes look long and beautiful but at the same time are not overly stiff and dry.</li>
            <li> Yes, a few little flakes, but overall it still looked great.</li>
            <li> This product easily compares to the other midpriced prestige brands of makeup out there that are around the same price.  </li>
            <li> Just started using this product - easy to apply, no big clumps like other volumizing mascaras that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Very average product for a huge price.  </li>
            <li> I did find it seems to dry out a little rather quickly, but I just add a couple of drops of water (did that with my prior mascaras as well) and it rehydrates and applies easily.</li>
            <li> It has been over a week and is just beginning to clear up.</li>
            <li> (Clearly you are too, or you wouldn&#x27;t be reading the reviews.)</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed after using this mascara a few times, especially after reading so many great reviews.</li>
            <li> I am a resident doctor in a busy county hospital.  </li>
            <li> I tried, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; mascara with doupts and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara that really delivers.</li>
            <li> but it seems to have strengthened my natural eyelashes and made them a bit thicker.  </li>
            <li> This product is natural, but does not compromise quality.</li>
            <li> Definitely will buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like the soft bristle brush and the hourglass shape.</li>
            <li> Several coats did not lengthen my lashes as much as a couple swipes with my Revlon mascara.</li>
            <li> I got this in an Ipsy glam bag, I used it completely...</li>
            <li> I wish it was darker, but its all natural and does leave mine longer looking.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> With Benefit They&#x27;re Real, you definitely get volume, but also tons of clumping...</li>
            <li> and my lashes are soft to touch.</li>
            <li> I like a natural look that the mascara gives as the brush grabs all my lashes and separates &amp; extends them in one brush stroke.</li>
            <li> (20hrs so far) nor give you the &amp;#34;racoon eye&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this mascara a week so far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only one that really makes my short nonexistent eyelashes long and full.</li>
            <li> I really struggled with shelling out twenty bucks for mascara, but I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 2.5 months without any signs of it drying out yet.</li>
            <li> I put my old $6 Mabelline Mega Plush Waterproof on one eye</li>
            <li> I have lashes that look Wow with ysl mascara .</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t go far as to say &amp;#34;Its</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> My eyes and skin are sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> My search has ended, my journey is complete.</li>
            <li> and i have had eyelash extensions which ruined some of my natural lashes on both sides.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t bother my sensitive eyes, either.</li>
            <li> the only reason I am not giving it a 5 star rating is because while it really is sweat, oily skin, smudge, etc proof, it is not water proof.  </li>
            <li> I use an old wand to comb through my lashes after I use this.</li>
            <li> but so far I like the way this one works and stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so it looks natural and it lengthens.  </li>
            <li> I have short lashes and it makes them look much longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot</li>
            <li> It really extends the length of my lashes and make my eyes look bigger.</li>
            <li> It is long wearing and very volumizing!</li>
            <li> This one marked off all of the boxes.  </li>
            <li> The result when applied is natural looking, fuller, longer lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a mascara that will really make my lashes stand out, and I&#x27;ve finally found it.</li>
            <li> but not when I am wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am cursed with ultra-blonde (nearly invisible) lower lashes, and have always had a problem showing them off.</li>
            <li> One pro about this mascara is it never irritated my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I have short eyelashes and really struggle with mascaras.  </li>
            <li> I also have sensitive eyes and have had to return mascaras because my eyes were running like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The company that makes this offers samples to try.</li>
            <li> If you want a natural look, 2 coats.</li>
            <li> NOT waste $20.00.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like your mascara, especially the brush that &#x27;grabs&#x27; the lashes and separates them,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> old woman, I have used lots of products in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Rather, when I rub it off in the shower, it comes off in soft pieces, sort of like Blinc&#x27;s \\&quot;lash tubes\\</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> It makes my blonde eyelashes really stand out,</li>
            <li> I curl my lashes and use this mascara, they slowly go back to being mostly straight again while the product is drying.  :</li>
            <li> But the second time I used it I realized how my eyelashes looked really really</li>
            <li> I have straight Asian lashes</li>
            <li> but so far it blows everything else out of the water.</li>
            <li> Lengthens without clumping, boosts appearance while still looking natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with my old brands.</li>
            <li> Lashes look naturally fuller.</li>
            <li> old</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to a drug store (or even a high end) brand after using this!  </li>
            <li> this mascara has helped while my real eyelashes grow back.</li>
            <li> I have very sparse short eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> This stuff gives you length, volume, makes your lashes seem soft and it doesn&#x27;t smidge.</li>
            <li> It just looks natural.</li>
            <li> I wear two coats of it almost every day and have had it for 5 months now, and it has yet to run out or get old or anything.</li>
            <li> Makes the lashes look natural, instead of looking like caked on mascara.  </li>
            <li> The product was not anywhere near my expectations.</li>
            <li> I must say I was surprised at how well</li>
            <li> maybe slightly old?</li>
            <li> This mascara does not irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> i was very pleasantly surprised with this product.</li>
            <li> Sixty two years old with thinning eyelashes.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not any flaking, and it&#x27;s waterproof as far as can tell.  </li>
            <li> i take it that they were old products.  </li>
            <li> If you have short lashes and are looking for something to lengthen them, absolutely go for this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I am only giving a 4 star rating because the liquid forms clumps and it gets very sticky at the end of the brush.</li>
            <li> It makes my teeny tiny lashes appear much fuller and longer.  </li>
            <li> natural lashes are noticeably shorter and thinner since using this mascara..</li>
            <li> this by far is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> and it still gives considerable volume and length.  </li>
            <li> I even went as far as to swap out the supplied brush for an old fav of mine.</li>
            <li> I wanted a mascara that would lengthen and accentuate my natural lashes.  </li>
            <li> it glides on, extends lashes in a natural way and does not clump.</li>
            <li> But all that is tertiary to the facts that (1) it doesn&#x27;t clump AT ALL and (2) IT STAYS SOFT.</li>
            <li> I am a professional gal on the go</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and cannot wear waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> (by like 9A)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that - the seller - took a real interest in emailing me as to how I like the Product.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> My eyes are sensitive to everything</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a born redhead with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It looks professional, but not overdone.</li>
            <li> More recently, I decided I was not happy with the look of tubing mascara, since it is not very buildable, and I wanted more drama.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> lashes are fairly straight and this lets me apply enough to make them turn up and plump</li>
            <li> Probably would try something else when I run out completely.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes at all.</li>
            <li> , it is straight and simple.</li>
            <li> Happily surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve begun using this mascara, exclusively,  because it makes my lashes come alive and there is no irritation.</li>
            <li> The second thing is that it really layers - this is almost a con for me though.</li>
            <li> I can actually bat my eyelashes like a cartoon character because there is so much to bat.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> Really builds big lashes that does not flake.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I have sensitive eyes, so this doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit.</li>
            <li> It gives natural length and volume.</li>
            <li> Look natural.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t damaged my natural lashes at all.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it didn&#x27;t seem to add as much volume to my lashes as I would have thought.</li>
            <li> maybe I got an old tube?</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the best way I can describe it so it may not seem heavy enough or thick enough for some people.  </li>
            <li> but I felt they weren&#x27;t really doing anything to make my eyelashes look different.</li>
            <li> It also lasts longer than some of it&#x27;s more expensive competitors, I would say daily use will last 3 weeks or more.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal really, but I wish it did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not left with raccoon eyes either, which is a real plus.  </li>
            <li> The mascara separates and lengthens my lashes and still soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because they really have something with the shape of the wand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 50 and a healthcare professional</li>
            <li> and it really GOES give you a completely different look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I pitched my old crappy mascara when I got home</li>
            <li> It gives a lush look without heaviness or clumping.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Does not flake or bother my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by that.  </li>
            <li> This mascara creates a natural look for daytime and two coats at night a bolder, but still natural look.</li>
            <li> I am 48 years old.</li>
            <li> and it makes my old lashes look young again.</li>
            <li> The hourglass shaped wand curls your lashes naturally and</li>
            <li> No smudging or running so far.</li>
            <li> It does not clump or flake and the color is not harsh.  </li>
            <li> Could not get the product off fast enough.</li>
            <li> During a busy period of my life, I decided to order online because I didn&#x27;t have time to trek downtown to buy make-up.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll do it the next day when I&#x27;m getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> As far as lengthening goes, it makes the tips looked ragged; as if someone came after my lashes with a chainsaw.</li>
            <li> Holy wow.</li>
            <li> There were no crying babies - no forest animals ran for the hills.</li>
            <li> My adult daughter also purchased</li>
            <li> So far... I like it.</li>
            <li> Gives me natural lashes and stays there all day.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the volume this mascara added to my lashes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get all &amp;#34;schmeery&amp;#34; when removed, it wipes off completely.</li>
            <li> First mascara i could actually see on my barely visible lashes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff, there are better mascaras at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous mascaras and have wasted money on many.  </li>
            <li> As long as this tried and true formula remains the same, I&#x27;ll be an Elizabeth Mott mascara user forever!</li>
            <li> My lashes look more naturally dark and long.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s plenty to last a few more weeks</li>
            <li> On day one I was not happy with it, but each mascara has it&#x27;s own technique for obtaining the desired look.  </li>
            <li> the delivery went well, the product was good but too expensive for just a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; mascara.</li>
            <li> After all the good reviews I thought I would give it a try &amp; sorry to say</li>
            <li> Whether you have the same mascara issue as I, or you&#x27;re just looking for a great &#x27;false lash look&#x27;, this mascara WILL do the trick!</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on my eyelashes when I wear this, makes them look like fake in a good way.</li>
            <li> but I prefer the brush to men more in volume or thick.</li>
            <li> I did find the best way to apply it is to put on a base coat of any mascara and then apply this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to get off, but overall this is my favorite and most used mascara, and the midline price is just right.</li>
            <li> I have tried all big name brands and by far this one exceeds them!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this mascara because I try to buy Cruelty Free makeup only , and that&#x27;s becoming increasingly difficult, as many previously lines that don&#x27;t test on animals or use animal products in the makeup have either changed their policies or have been bought out by bigger companies that do!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it makes my eyelashes very long and is a long last formula.</li>
            <li> in pic #1: looking at the photo from where you are, the eye on the right side of the photo is voluminous and the left is its so big.</li>
            <li> I actually stopped wearing eye shadow because this mascara makes my lashes look full and very long.  </li>
            <li> I love this Mascara, I typically don&#x27;t leave reviews, and I have quite long lashes already</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump, lengthens, and is a nice dark black.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is a nice, dark black that adds length and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> Finally a mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump or flake and still washes away with normal face soap!  </li>
            <li> After 10 million tubes purchased and too many decades to count, no more raccoon eyes!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean I have sparse eyebrows like most girls who say they have none do....</li>
            <li> It goes on so light , but makes my lashes look so full and thick!!</li>
            <li> I have spent lots of money trying to find the right mascara.  </li>
            <li> i figured every mascara would just leave my lashes clumped together and looking less than full.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan on ever switching back to anything else and will be a loyal customer for a long time!</li>
            <li> This mascara is much nicer than many of the more expensive clinique and elizabeth arden products I&#x27;ve bought in the past.  </li>
            <li> I usually purchase Clinique high impact at the Clinique counter, but was lazy and thought I would try this because of comparable price and good ratings.  </li>
            <li> Brands are pretty limited.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is not paraben free so that is the only negative.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money, and unexpectedly so since I usually don&#x27;t spend much money on mascara.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all from high end brands, Japanese versions, fiber ones and even spa developed ones and Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s &amp;#34;Its</li>
            <li> I have very straight eyelashes that are on the short side and am always on the hunt for a mascara that adds volume and length without clumping, flaking or smudging - it HAS to last all day.  </li>
            <li> I will like a few things about a product but inevitably it will let me down in some other way sending me back on the hunt for the perfect item.</li>
            <li> If you have thicker lashes, just don&#x27;t apply as much or if you want really long, dramatic lashes, this is perfect with a few extra strokes of mascara!</li>
            <li> You have to apply a few coats to get the volume you want which is good because if you just want a natural look you only do a few, you want a more dramatic look apply a few more.</li>
            <li> I switched to this recently and its even BETTER than the big brands and less costly.</li>
            <li> Can I say seriously one more time?</li>
            <li> I have small, fine eyelashes and this mascara</li>
            <li> Big help for my short, straight lashes!  </li>
            <li> as I&#x27;ve gotten older the lines around my eyes (I&#x27;m 45) have gotten such that I don&#x27;t like to wear powder on face cause it cakes into the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It is the first traditional mascara I have used that doesn&#x27;t cause smudging and my lashes are big and noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different mascaras in the past, even ones with brand names and stuff, but nothing EVER came close to this.</li>
            <li> so the day has dwindled by... its so big looks exactly the same and still has it length while voluminous has flaked off and lost a lot of definition.</li>
            <li> I have decent lashes as it is, but rely on mascara and different application techniques to enhance them.</li>
            <li> I recently moved to Arizona, and first want to say this mascara does not melt in the heat or get in my eyes when I sweat, which is a big plus!</li>
            <li> Everything seemed to flake, run out quickly, and give me &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; after half a day.</li>
            <li> I usually end up getting it on my upper eyelids but this offered more control when applying.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, this product works for  many but not me:(</li>
            <li> It is on the expensive side though, don&#x27;t know if it is really worth 19 bucks, you can probably get a drugstore brand just as good for about 10 bucks less.</li>
            <li> It washes off easily with a facial cleanser (I use Cetaphil or Cerave) and comes off in little clumps.</li>
            <li> And if that weren&#x27;t enough, it&#x27;s also easy to take off with just a little cleanser.</li>
            <li> When I go to stores like Target and see mascara is $7, it always seems a little pricy, especially since it rubs off easily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> By the time I applied it to the other eye, the first eye was ready for a second coat.</li>
            <li> Not worth 20$ stick to their real by benifit !!</li>
            <li> A little clumpy, but not bad.</li>
            <li> All the other 5 star reviewers are right:  </li>
            <li> there, high and low end</li>
            <li> No specks or flacks on my face, even during high activity during the entire day and evening.</li>
            <li> Nothing is different between this and the others I got from drug stores except the high price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently used cheap mascara, as well as more expensive Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I had used the same high end product for years before trying Elizabeth Mott mascara.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara because of the insanely high reviews and moderate price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love it for everyday use, it doesn&#x27;t smear or crumble under my long lower lashes and it goes on even and not clumply!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of different brands of mascara and with long natural lashes, my mascara always flakes off or runs down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to have to use a special makeup remover to take off my mascara, and I don&#x27;t want to use something with harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m spoiled with this and can&#x27;t use no other!</li>
            <li> I will say it doesn&#x27;t seem to clump, and it may give you a little more length, but definitely not big volume (even after several coats).</li>
            <li> not what i expected, L&#x27;ORÉAL Voluminous Volume Building Mascara does a better job for less money</li>
            <li> It was at least $10 less than what I paid for the Younique fiber stuff and just as good.  </li>
            <li> I really like that it does not flake off or melt after a long day</li>
            <li> In addition to living in a very humid climate, I have oily skin and long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes to begin with, so it doesn&#x27;t take much for me to boost them.</li>
            <li> It’s a long story – Very smitten with it.  </li>
            <li> and though I still love it, my only complaint is that I think the opening of the full size tube is too wide for the brush (which is the same size as the brush that came with the sample)</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t figured out why this is the ONLY mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge or leave a mess, yet looks fantastic...</li>
            <li> Not wet, but soft.</li>
            <li> I find wet mascaras tend to make more of a mess when applying</li>
            <li> no smudging, no dark circles, no residue.</li>
            <li> I have no dark smudge&#x27;s or anything.</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;m somewhat obsessed with having full and long lashes.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my lashes look normal</li>
            <li> but it is not even worth the $5 for an average mascara.  </li>
            <li> So, what I&#x27;m doing is using my normal waterproof volumizing mascara on my upper lashes and this on my lower.  </li>
            <li> And it comes off with my normal face cleaning routine, so no extra steps removing mascara.</li>
            <li> I do not have that issue with my normal mascara, with the same level of cleaning.</li>
            <li> I would say it is more of an everyday mascara to open up your eyes and will not leave residue above or below the eye-</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few days of wearing it, I decided to go ahead and buy the full sized product.</li>
            <li> Not only that, it truly does come off incredibly easily with plain soap and water.</li>
            <li> Before trying this mascara I felt like I sort of had to pick between a more subtle, daytime mascara and a more dramatic volumizing mascara, but with this mascara I can wear one or two coats for a softer look, or really layer it for extra volume without clumping or spidery lashes.</li>
            <li> It is a touch harder to wash off, but if you gently glide your lashes between your fingers once your lashes are wet, the stuff comes right off.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin, blond lashes and this product gives me the length and thickness that I&#x27;ve been searching for.</li>
            <li> Brush leaves mascara application a little thin but the consistency is great</li>
            <li> … Also it’s a little cheaper on Amazon, I think my friend spent about $12 more buying from someone</li>
            <li> I have tried every drug store brand of mascara and was hoping that if I spent a little bit more and trusted in the amazon reviews that I would find a product that was truly volumizing.</li>
            <li> I used to buy Loreal mascaras, but will definitely stay with this new one.</li>
            <li> Well, my last mascara was at the end of its life, so it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to see what new products come out in the future!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara, but I was sceptical that it could really live up to all of the glowing reviews.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very long lashes (I am half-asian) and had to put a couple coats for it to look like much.</li>
            <li> The free sample wand worked better, so perhaps I got a bad one?</li>
            <li> very lumpy and dry.</li>
            <li> As a professional makeup artist, I have tried TONS of different types of mascara, this one is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For some strange reason the second didn&#x27;t seem like the first tube that I ordered.</li>
            <li> This mascara has worked so well for me, after losing all my eyelashes and having them grow back substantially thinner and shorter, I am finally back to complaining that my lashes are hitting my sunglasses again, thanks to this mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara definitely adds length to lashes, however it doesnt really add volume for me personally.</li>
            <li> But of course, I think that the iconic pink tube mascara with the green tube is overrated too.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, only complaint is the price tag of $20/tube..</li>
            <li> I received a trial size in a beauty box and figured it would never beat my favorite pink and green tube.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying several mascaras lately, as I&#x27;ve found that many tend to flake or smudge off through the day.  </li>
            <li> You can definitely apply to your desired thickness and length, but I prefer natural looking as I work in a professional surroundings.</li>
            <li> I really like it, but I find that I can only use it when I go out because I do a lot of baking in my home and every time I open the oven door</li>
            <li> I tried again on the second day with multiple coats and curling my lashes and it clumped them up but didn&#x27;t really voluminize or lengthen my lashes.</li>
            <li> Your lashes really do get noticeably bigger with repeated applications, although for me, one application is plenty for daily use.</li>
            <li> I can easily put on one coat for a natural look or a few more for a bolder look without it looking fake.</li>
            <li> Overall a nice mascara, but the tube can be frustrating.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge in humidity of Hawaii, comes off easily with soap and water or facial cleansing wipes, doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes or contacts, can apply natural look or lush thick lashes.</li>
            <li> The brush is also designed for getting right down to the root of the lashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara isn&#x27;t necessarily &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; but stays on fantastically all day even when my eyes water (they do that a lot-- very sensitive eyes)</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair in general, and my eyelashes are no exception.</li>
            <li> I was curious about this since the reviews are so positive.  </li>
            <li> So, from next to invisible to wow!</li>
            <li> I only wish I had been able to use it for the past 45 years!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get a major volume with it</li>
            <li> This mascara lengthens my lashes like no other</li>
            <li> I like the mascara as ordinary one, can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better than standard loreal or similar brand.</li>
            <li> I work long, long days (and nights sometimes) and most mascaras tend to smudge under my eyes and leave me with dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Even with just one coat I can tell a major difference.</li>
            <li> I only wear waterproof mascaras, but lately, most of mine have been running a bit under my eyes - possibly due to my sunscreen, but I won&#x27;t forgo sunscreen, so thought I&#x27;d experiment w/ other mascaras.  </li>
            <li> This met all my demands, no other mascara has.  </li>
            <li> It is more expensive than other mascaras, but it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> It is dark black, which I love.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara, lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t get clumpy!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken me over 40 years of experimenting with all brands, old and new; finally I have found sheer perfection!!!!  </li>
            <li> I used to always have to wipe under my eyes during the day to clean up mascara even from ordinary perspiration.</li>
            <li> and I will not buy any other brand or waste time doing any more internet research.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly continue to use this mascara for a long time!!!</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth the splurge.  </li>
            <li> This means you can actually layer it and build volume without looking like your lashes are gunked up (seriously I have never been able to layer mascara before without it looking clumpy and feeling sticky).</li>
            <li> For me it doesnt flake off as much (only a bit) but it does mainly come off the same way that non waterproof mascara comes off.  </li>
            <li> Have compared it to a few other lash extending mascaras, and this one looks the most natural while still giving a big pop.</li>
            <li> And if you want to try a cool little trick... do a coat of mascara, then dust your eyelashes with baby powder and coat it a second time.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day I was extremely exhausted, realized my car was stuckin some snow, realized further that tow trucks were not willing to truck out to my location to help me, cried several tears in overwhelming exhaustion and frustration, and when I went to clean up my face in the restroom, was at least satisfied that my mascara did not run down my face or smear, but simply sat in small clumps under my eyes similar to how a tubing mascara comes off, and I very easily wiped it away with a tissue, still not smearing or smudging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different mascaras from drug store to high end</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a thick mascara (think long vs. fat lashes), but several coats gives a nice dramatic look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I have pretty straight, hardly there eyelashes</li>
            <li> Hard to get off (Since I am allergic to a lot of eye products I can&#x27;t use harsh chemicals; but the product I use from Payot was able to take off other mascaras easily, but not BiG unless I drown my eyes in it); I often wake up with mascara smudges even though I took it off the night before</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would confirm that all other positive reviews of this product are correct.</li>
            <li> But my absolute favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave black streak marks down my face when it gets wet!</li>
            <li> does not volumize like it says makes them long not thick</li>
            <li> so I have to use a formula that is really smudge proof and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I have long, straight lashes that are of standard thickness</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also sensitive to several brands and end up with itchy eyes.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes, and for years can only use one brand SYL.</li>
            <li> I can barely tell I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> I think this will be my go-to mascara for the near future.</li>
            <li> I tried to go back to my old cheaper mascara when I ran out</li>
            <li> Just gave it to my 15 year old granddaughter as she took off for a Western tour for five weeks</li>
            <li> Not as much volume as I expected.</li>
            <li> Nearly the same price point.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and struggle to find mascara that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itchy and red.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gone back to my old mascara.  </li>
            <li> It really lengthened and darkened my lashes with absolutely no clumping.</li>
            <li> I was in complete shock when I saw the price was only $20!</li>
            <li> only did it beat it - it completely exceeded all my tests.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone, especially anyone with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> went back to store and bought my old revoln volumizing .</li>
            <li> I just comb out the clumps, but this makes my eyelashes look like a stick insect legs if I am not careful to comb my lashes after applying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to my old brand.</li>
            <li> I think in my opinion its a pretty average mascara.</li>
            <li> I would definitely say give this a try - I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> especially for a natural mascara</li>
            <li> I can see why people like this mascara, but I personally don&#x27;t want my natural lashes to be damaged.</li>
            <li> Sunglasses can only protect so far.  </li>
            <li> I can barely see them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I barely ever have to use my makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched my entire adult life for a mascara that I can be faithful to...</li>
            <li> So far, not any different than Maybelline or Cover Girl.  </li>
            <li> This is the only one so far that hasn&#x27;t turned me into a raccoon at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> It barely works as well as non-volumizing &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This did the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> Although I do like Bare Minerals mascara</li>
            <li> This mascara barely coated my lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Revlon, Maybelline, Este Lauder, Bare Minerals, and Benefit.</li>
            <li> , I applied a regular amount one early morning as I was preparing to spend the day snowboarding.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a nice mascara.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the heavy expense.</li>
            <li> I am also pleased that it doesn&#x27;t appear clumpy or gross when you lay it on thick for extra drama.</li>
            <li> my eyelashes aren&#x27;t thick or long and I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras out there.  </li>
            <li> The expensive ones, although I like them- to be honest</li>
            <li> Really nice mascara, makes an impact without looking fake or caked on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash mascara for years, but lately it hasn&#x27;t been doing it&#x27;s job on my diminishing, short lashes (I&#x27;m 44 and have noticed that my lashes have been slowly getting shorter and shorter, which also happened to my mom and maternal grandmother).</li>
            <li> I have naturally long and thick eyelashes, but I want more.</li>
            <li> CRAZY how good</li>
            <li> It says you can do it with a regular face wash, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true -- seems to hang out on my eyelashes and face for a few days after.</li>
            <li> It looks like you put on false eye lashes but a thousand times better.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are normally not very thick nor long, but this mascara definitely gives them a kick!  </li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m not sure the product is good enough to justify its price point, and I&#x27;ll likely end up going back to my previous brand.</li>
            <li> A word of caution: the first time you remove the mascara you&#x27;ll look down horrified and think that all of your eyelashes just fell out.</li>
            <li> This mascara really gives me extra long lashes!</li>
            <li> Gives me jet black long full lashes and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> I put about 1.5 coats on, and my lashes are about half an inch long, and full without any clumpiness.</li>
            <li> Not only can I use it with NO irritation, I LOVE the product as it doesn&#x27;t slide down your face or attach itself to your upper lids like a lot of other mascaras do throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It gives me the right amount of body and curl but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or get crunchy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Very clean, I could probably put on two coats to make it thicker, but i don&#x27;t want thick just long.</li>
            <li> It washes off better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> It cost more than the other mascara I have had in the past</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, and I anxiously waited for morning to try it.</li>
            <li> I love really thick big drag queen lights camera action stage eye lashes.</li>
            <li> For mascara users, the price is definitely worth it, and a little really goes a long way because the formula doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> Mascara dries quickly though, so its not easy to go back in and separate lashes.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re real but in 5 minutes the mascara is all over my face and by the end of a busy night at work I have big dark circles from it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need to use anything other than that or baby wipes to remove it.  </li>
            <li> The brush shape is unique at least to any others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It stays on, I don&#x27;t get bits on my face or embarrassing raccoon circles, and it really makes my eyelashes look longer and fuller than other mascaras do.</li>
            <li> I can go dancing, or to the gym and never have to worry that my mascara is going to end up under my eyes making me look like a hot mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a hot mess.</li>
            <li> It seemed like I did not get as much &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; as I did with my other mascaras.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried at first because the product seemed thin and not very &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; but the product thickened up after a well of use and now I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li> It turned my eyelashes into little crispy strands instead of full feathery, long lashes like I wanted and as depicted on the box.  </li>
            <li> Not a single flake to be found.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, short lashes and have been looking for something that would make my eyes stand out a bit more!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bringing the meaning of spider-eyes a whole new meaning with a only a few applications.</li>
            <li> I just with it was darker and a bit more dramatic.</li>
            <li> I used to waste so much time cleaning up my lashes after applying my old mascaras, because of how chunky/uneven it would look after application.</li>
            <li> Then about 2 week later, I accidentally packed only my old mascara when I went away for the weekend.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the consistency will get better, but it does nothing for my thin, short lashes.  </li>
            <li> I have very short and thin lashes and was amazed at how lovely they looked as I applied this mascara on them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I have tiny eyelashes) and usually requires 2+ coats to see full, noticeable lashes.</li>
            <li> I tried so many different products all saying smudge proof with poor results.</li>
            <li> When I tightline my top inner rim with this mascara I swear it truly makes me look like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> I am that person that buys every single new mascara looking for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li> Truly does what no other I&#x27;ve bought can - actually makes my lashes look thicker and longer.  </li>
            <li> With only 1 coat, this mascara lengthens and thickens my lashes like no other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The major thing for me is that it stays on the entire day with zero transfer, smudging or flaking.</li>
            <li> It washes off so easily and doesn&#x27;t leave your eyes in a black sticky mess.</li>
            <li> I was expecting much different results compared to other mascara&#x27;s I had used, but this really didn&#x27;t change much from any other one I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> With a long history of melting mascaras I am constantly trying new formulas.</li>
            <li> It does seem to clump a little and not go on as smoothly after a few weeks, but the benefits far outweigh the negatives.</li>
            <li> A little more expensive than I would prefer but worth the price.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I really love this mascara, and this is coming from a person who usually couldn&#x27;t care less about makeup.</li>
            <li> This mascara stays all day, removes easily, and creates long and thick lashes.  </li>
            <li> A little more costly than the $9 to $12 price point I usually purchase from, but we&#x27;ll worth the extra few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have tried lots of mascaras with great online ratings just to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have worn this product while running, at a water park, and just generally being outside all day.</li>
            <li> Really overpriced, not worth it.</li>
            <li> This product when used in conjunction with the Lash Card makes me look like I have natural, long lashes.</li>
            <li> Although it is a  toss up between So Big and the one I have been using by Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> I like the long natural look.</li>
            <li> I just received the mascara not long ago.</li>
            <li> To completely remove I need to take the extra step of using makeup remover, which to me is simply that, an extra step.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on this one are short, which makes getting into the tiny corners a breeze, but to me it felt harder to get my lashes to really grow.</li>
            <li> I use this with Blinc&#x27;s lash primer and it looks like I have lush and long lashes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a natural long  eyelash</li>
            <li> barely works as well as a regular mascara.</li>
            <li> but I returned this product because after a few hours the flakes bothered my eyes and didn&#x27;t look too pretty.</li>
            <li> The first few times I wore it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth $20</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn makeup for around the same amount of time, and I&#x27;m sure my fellow contact wearing sisters can commiserate with me about the frustration and pain they have gone through when mascara gets into their contacts, either from crying, in the shower (or crying in the shower), rain, sweat, whatever it may be that causes the mascara to run and get in your eye.</li>
            <li> First few times I either got mascara on myself, or the clump fell</li>
            <li> Makes my  lashes look full, thick and accentuates their length with out being clumpy.</li>
            <li> If you are wanting thick, full lashes this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> and it came off like little tubes, very much like the japanese mascaras out there.  </li>
            <li> It felt like there was little to no actual mascara inside the container after I first bought it, and it barely looked like anything was on my lashes after several attempts.  </li>
            <li> I added three more coats (for a total of four), and I still did not get any type of dramatic result.</li>
            <li> It immediately weighed my lashes down and made them straight.</li>
            <li> May as well put one of those furry hats on my eyelashes and call it a guard at the national gates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I cried my face off thanks to two aggressive onions I took down in battle.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this mascara, I believe I found my tube for life, it would be a hard competition to beat this one!!</li>
            <li> other brands that cost as much took several layers to achieve the same look and in the end they flaked off and irritated  my eyes.</li>
            <li> It gives a natural, long look to your lashes!</li>
            <li> In between each purchase I have tried other mascaras that have been highly recommended but it turns out they never compare.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference. :(</li>
            <li> I really like this one as it smudges a lot less.</li>
            <li> This mascara is so black in color that it really helps make my lashes pop.  </li>
            <li> It was old, dry and I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Long lasting without any irritation, which is saying a lot since I have incredibly sensitive eyes and skin.</li>
            <li> I go from school directly to company dance rehearsals for 5 hours, and this mascara is the only one I have found that don&#x27;t run throughout my long day.</li>
            <li> It goes on effortlessly, stays on all day long, no smudging, no smearing, no flaking, not black dots under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Was not use to using a thin bush however the mascara goes on easy, makes my lashes longer I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t clump, but still makes my lashes look thick and long.</li>
            <li> If you put it on quick and thick it looks clumpy.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give me super thick lashes, but I don&#x27;t want that.</li>
            <li> When I ordered &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara&amp;#34; by Elizabeth Mott I was a little hesitant because it cost more than what I usually pay for mascara.</li>
            <li> they come straight back down.</li>
            <li> I am not thrilled about how much comes out and how it can quickly become a mess on lashes sticking together.</li>
            <li> I have such fine, short lashes that its hard to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t make them look like 2 spiders stuck to my eyelids!</li>
            <li> I have tried drugstore brands as well as higher end mascaras all with fairly good results and this is by far the worst mascara I have used since I can remember.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin and with other mascaras I have smudges under my eyes by lunchtime - but never with this one.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s not clumping and hasn&#x27;t gotten dry, which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> I cross train pretty hard and after 2 hrs there were no black circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am a blonde, in my late 50&#x27;s, and with this mascara and a slick of Aveda lipstick, I look decades younger and effectively boost sales of a cruelty-free cosmetic.  </li>
            <li> Bought this because of all the positive reviews but it clumped after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews I was surprised at how bad this mascara turned out to be!</li>
            <li> If you need staying power AND volume, and happen to have thin, fine lashes, the search may continue.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine lashes.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO flaking or smudging throughout the entire day - WOW!</li>
            <li> Plus I love the dark black pigment color!!!</li>
            <li> I am in the minority because I simply was not impressed at all by this mascara, and as another person pointed out, I&#x27;m a little baffled as to how this has so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t get what the hype is all about and wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive eyes which are irritated</li>
            <li> It also leaves your lashes BLACK, like DARK BLACK AND glossy looking, not gray like many others.</li>
            <li> It does add little volume to my lashes but irritates me eyes so much they burn and become red.</li>
            <li> : they didn&#x27;t appear longer or really that much bigger, just a little bolder.</li>
            <li> , I wear mascara to work out and other physical activities, and #3, I live in a sub-tropic climate where I tend to (ahem) perspire a lot.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this stuff cling to your lashes like a spider monkey to a back, it removes easily with makeup remover (I nearly tear my lashes out with other waterproofs I&#x27;ve worn), there is NO clumping when you apply it, and seriously ladies...</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes after reading the other reviews, but it falls flat on all fronts.</li>
            <li> I found this mascara to be very average, very chunky in the application.</li>
            <li> Very natural look without all the clumps  like the other mascaras do.</li>
            <li> My sensitive eyes that really seem allergic to all waterproof mascaras and maybe half of the other ones have never had a sensitivity to this mascara.</li>
            <li> It does have an interesting sort of formula which seems less heavy than other mascaras I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because the good outweigh the bad.</li>
            <li> it went on way too thin and ended up clumping a lot more than expected.</li>
            <li> It makes lashes appear to have more volume, but doesn&#x27;t make them heavy or too thick.</li>
            <li> I will concede, this mascara is probably pretty good if you have short dark eyelashes as I have been using it on my lower eyelashes or as a base coat simply because I have to use it since I bought it.</li>
            <li> Lashes come out looking long, full, crossed &amp; therefore thick.</li>
            <li> This mascara wins hands down!!!</li>
            <li> Usually I have to buy something new because my product gets old not because it wears out.  </li>
            <li> There are probably other mascaras that give you bigger lashes faster, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s another that will give you lashes so big and natural at the same time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do as much as I&#x27;d hoped to plump up my lashes or make them appear thicker/longer (not like 3D lashes do), but I do like that it doesn&#x27;t smudge or leave black marks under my eyes after a long day at work.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of wearing false eyelashes for over a year, so I did some damage to my eyelashes and unfortunately many of them left me due to the abuse.</li>
            <li> I like to curl my eyelashes, so finding just the right mascara can be tricky; some are too watery and straighten the lashes, while others are too thick and end up looking clumpy.  </li>
            <li> The samples are half the size of the normal.  </li>
            <li> I love the thin brush and it doesn&#x27;t clump up like other mascaras.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a mascara, but not sure I would pay $20 again for it when there are a lot of other similiar mascaras on the market for a bit&lt;br /&gt;less.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons,  only sold online that I know of, price is a little high .</li>
            <li> I get panda eyes when I wear mascara, no matter what mascara from $3-$50 they all run down and make me look like I am trying out new anti-glare football</li>
            <li> It goes on better with three very thin layers.</li>
            <li> Three coats later you get dramatic, glamazon lashes still clump free.</li>
            <li> AMAZING product, you must try this...you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I wore it and my friend – who is more crazy than I am and has a strange fixation with the fact that I have young looking eyes, so</li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned, I&#x27;m surprised at all of the 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li> It did not seem as thick and rich as other products with the same price range.</li>
            <li> And me, I have short stubby lashes, dead straight, naturally angled slightly downward.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think $20 is a little high</li>
            <li> This product wont makes your eyelash dirty, it looks clear and clean!</li>
            <li> I was a Lancôme definicils users for years and just wanted to find some a tad bit less expensive and this product works even better than definicils!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s not cheap, but doesn&#x27;t get thick or dry out like most I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I get super LONG lashes and they are dark shiny black, not matte grey and flaky.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump and stays open long enough to layer.  </li>
            <li> Enough so that I am not completely discouraged about the hefty price, but the price is definitely what will keep me from buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Decent mascara, but a bit messy when putting on and setting.</li>
            <li> I work 9-7 everyday and sit at a desk, so I never really have an issue with flakiness, since my day is pretty sedentary, but surprise-surprise...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little less dramatic, and harder to layer than my previous mascara, which was a drug store brand, but that&#x27;s a small price (that I&#x27;m more than willing to) pay for a cruelty free product.  </li>
            <li> I could always fall back to using a different mascara under this one, but I feel a little resentful of that when I&#x27;ve spent twice as much on this mascara as I have on others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I can run in the rain with it and not have a mess under my eyes (I live in Washington state-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to remove and almost a bit too oily to create a full lash effect.</li>
            <li> look, or a more dramatic (still not clumpy!)</li>
            <li> I find I have to tug a bit and wipe pretty hard to get the stuff off.</li>
            <li> the last several I have purchased have been dry and clumping.</li>
            <li> and I have to get rid of the little black dots they leave right after applying.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every single mascara could find, from the most expensive to the cheapest.</li>
            <li> I like that I can go swimming, to the gym or jump in the shower and not have black running down my face with a huge mess on my face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference (except the price) from my usual drugstore brand mascara.  </li>
            <li> But alas no tubes have had that initial glide and wet clump free lengthening.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference compared to the mascara I usually use (Rimmel London Scandal Eyes Lycra Flex Mascara).</li>
            <li> Because it makes your eyelashes look naturally darker instead of looking like you put on dark mascara.</li>
            <li> I usually wear They re Real mascara</li>
            <li> I think it is just ordinary, and does not do much to volumize my lashes, in fact leaves them sort of spidery.  </li>
            <li> My daughter instantly commented on how long my lashes looked.  </li>
            <li> And it also is the only one I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake off after wearing it all day long.</li>
            <li> No clumps, long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Does not smudge and long lasting!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect it to last long.</li>
            <li> : It does give you long eyelashes that last all day</li>
            <li> Lengthens and volumizes without clumping and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> The wear is long lasting (even if you accidentally sleep in it it doesn&#x27;t end up on your cheeks!!)</li>
            <li> I have really long eyelashes already, so when I put mascara on, it should accentuate them even further.  </li>
            <li> My long search for a mascara that actually works is over.  </li>
            <li> If you like individual long lashes, this is the mascara for you.</li>
            <li> have long lashes to begin with but this product totally lengthens &amp; darkens them giving an ultra feminine look.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> Long lasting and</li>
            <li> makes my eyelashes look naturally long and curly, without it actually looking like mascara.</li>
            <li> My long, personal mascara nightmare is now over☺</li>
            <li> Lashes were flat within 6 hours of wear.</li>
            <li> Not only do I not see any visible advantage to using this mascara, it flakes off into my eyes all day long.</li>
            <li> I ski patrol and spend long days outside</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t wipe it off and reapply sinew the next day,  it still keeps lashes separated and and long.</li>
            <li> The only time I had some minor smudging was after walking in rain/snowy weather.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> you use an eyelash curler) to help your eyelashes hold their curl, it does for a short while, but they fall after so long.</li>
            <li> This mascara not only makes them twice as long</li>
            <li> No smudges, long, big lashes with no caking.</li>
            <li> My lashes are skimpy, but this actually makes them look long</li>
            <li> This will definitely be my go-to mascara for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> But with this mascara, I only had to wipe with minor pressure and BAM</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those who doesn&#x27;t take her mascara off at night, and there is a little morning smudging that I can live with.  </li>
            <li> have really sensitive eyes that water a lot, so I have always bought waterproof mascara so it doesn&#x27;t end up running down my face.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyelashes that fall out constantly with very little pull, and switching to this mascara has definitely reduced the number of eyelashes lost during makeup removal.</li>
            <li> I can also wear it to the gym without it running, when I&#x27;m sweating it during a very heavy fast paced cardio class.</li>
            <li> With the initial application, I can hardly see any mascara on, it doesn&#x27;t make much of an impact.</li>
            <li> but then when I took a shower, much to my dismay, it practically all come off in the shower with hardly any mascara left on my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> It really is sweat-proof and it comes off easily in the shower, but it clumps and rolls so that it isn&#x27;t staining my skin or running down my face all awkwardly.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because of the other reviews and have tried no other products from this company.</li>
            <li> I put only one coat for daily use or layer it up a little for major impact.  </li>
            <li> By the 3rd coat I couldn&#x27;t believe how long my lashes were!  </li>
            <li> This brand pulls off what other major store brands advertise but can&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> Not only does it create beautifully long lashes like never before, but doesn&#x27;t flake either!</li>
            <li> I used to use the big brand mascara, but that has long been tossed now that I found this!</li>
            <li> I have VERY long eyelashes, so it can be a struggle finding mascara that will actually run the length of my lashes without clumping or gluing the lashes together.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting!</li>
            <li> so I wonder if I got one that was old or in an odd part of the warehouse.</li>
            <li> I have dry eye syndrome and use drops multiple times throughout the day.</li>
            <li> FINALLY a mascara that doesn&#x27;t flake, clump, or dry out your lashes.</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old, and have slightly thinning lashes.</li>
            <li> In fact,the mascara left my lashes feeling flimsy, and the formula felt dry and crumbly.  </li>
            <li> On a whim, I decided to contact the company and to explain my disappointment of my most recent tubes of their mascara.  </li>
            <li> I pumped it several times but the brush and wand were dry.</li>
            <li> it dries out very quickly and it is difficult to reapply.</li>
            <li> tried every mascara out there stumble upon this and was amazed at how big and long it made my lashes look</li>
            <li> It does not last through the day even with careful and multiple applications.</li>
            <li> It started out really well, but then after a couple months it dried out a bit quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are semi thick, but short and they stick straight out.</li>
            <li> In the shower, I just rub the lashes a little bit after I&#x27;ve been in for a few minutes and it comes right off.</li>
            <li> I had BIG hopes for volume from this mascara, but in my opinion, it does not live up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> That being said, this is the ONLY mascara I have ever used that literally doesn&#x27;t move a single centimeter all throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and it lifts and separates every single eyelash individually.  </li>
            <li> trying every single one I could before my urges to pull possibly resurface.</li>
            <li> had to refresh it a bit, but it was on, no black rivers of tear stains running down my face.  </li>
            <li> No little black flakes dotting your face.  </li>
            <li> It dried quickly with very little product adhering to lash.</li>
            <li> Still a complete mess.</li>
            <li> mascara beats Lancome, Urban Decay Big Fatty, Dior, Blinc, Bare Minerals Buxom, Loreal, Maybelline, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very wet formula and in general I dislike those.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing to have this happen and then find out the seller will not make good on it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more dramatic results because of them, but it is subtler than that.</li>
            <li> If you have thin eyelashes that are weighed down easily by mascara - this is not for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very similar to my favorite mascara from Trish McEvoy but less expensive</li>
            <li> then I went back to my original brand and thought, &amp;quot;What is wrong with this crap?!&amp;quot;  </li>
            <li> I use the same eye makeup remover that I have used to remove other various types of mascara, with no issues or rubbing.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t run on your face (unlike other more expensive brands,</li>
            <li> My problem with other brands is the clump and also having to buy 8 different mascaras to get different effects.</li>
            <li> last 2 &amp;#34;favorites&amp;#34; were L&#x27;Oreal False Fiber Black Lacquer, which by lunchtime would leave a light gray rub under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> After years of using mascaras that feel heavy, clump, is impossible to wash away, and most importantly adds very little length...</li>
            <li> The wand is extremely small and it goes on VERY light and thin.</li>
            <li> Looks natural instead of little pieces sticking out every where.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from drugstore to high end mascaras since I always had a hard time finding one that wouldn&#x27;t smudge under my eyes and finally found this one.  </li>
            <li> I naturally have long lashes they just need a little &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; to make them look fuller and darker and this didn&#x27;t do it for me.  </li>
            <li> Little difficult to remove but overall I would say I am satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a mascara that goes on thick, stays put all day long</li>
            <li> , very little of it makes your lashes long and lush, so it goes a long way, and the ONLY mascara my super-sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara in terms of how it looks on is Revlon Grow Luscious, but it flakes off like crazy, just as a side note.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING from cheap to expensive, nothing works like this.</li>
            <li> I used to really like Lancome mascara, but lately it hasn&#x27;t been doing it for me, and it is a b#%*&amp; to get off.  </li>
            <li> If I go all sweaty day without reapplying it just seems to disappear (in talking after at least 12 hrs) which I much prefer to smearing out all over.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara and had one small reservation and when word got to the owner she was SO professional and went over and above the call of duty!</li>
            <li> I use, but it comes off in curly long wormy things.</li>
            <li> I will be a faithful patron of this mascara for a long time.</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my lashes look so long and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I work long hours</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look really long.  </li>
            <li> I have long been pestered with mascara that smudged under my eye during the day, but I never have that problem with this mascara.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump, makes my lashes look long and curls them up too.</li>
            <li> I expected big volumized lashes, but there is nothing volumizing or lengthening or thickening about this mascara.&lt;br</li>

            <li> No wow factor for me</li>
            <li> I have naturally long lashes but need the mascara for that feature to stand out.</li>
            <li> I have tried this mascara a couple of times, but haven&#x27;t had it for too long.  </li>
            <li> (it comes off in strange strands but does not leave raccoon eyes which need eye make up remover), and it does NOT clump.</li>
            <li> I have looked for a long time for a mascara that doesn&#x27;t give me racoon eyes and still gives me length.</li>
            <li> I can wear it all day long 16 hours and it never leaves a mark on my brow how some do after wearing it all day.</li>
            <li> It makes long lashes, and lasts all night, even after 13 hours of work.</li>
            <li> Although thus doesnt not gives alot of volume but it does makes your lashes long.</li>
            <li> And it doesn flake off by the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> mascara makes my lashes long, and they do not clump together.</li>

            <li> I have long lashes</li>
            <li> It make your lashes long and not clump together.  </li>
            <li> As another poster said, I have long lashes already, so this mascara should accentuate that.  </li>

            <li> Adds volume and definition to my eyelashes and stays put all day long.  </li>
            <li> I have long lashes</li>
            <li> Granted, I have long eyelashes and a lot of them</li>
            <li> Sadly, with the full product, it is not the same at all.</li>
            <li> The mascara usually ends up irritating my eyes even more.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical as I have tried so many different mascaras in a variety of price ranges that just didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> I have tried several mascaras and many of them very expensive.</li>
            <li> Not too thick, but coats really well.</li>
            <li> Really makes my eyelashes stand out and doesn&#x27;t clump or get little black specs in my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;can&#x27;t go wrong really!!!</li>
            <li> Almay One Coat Triple Effect is less expensive and works way better for me.</li>
            <li> my much, much less expensive drug store mascara is waaay better than this.</li>
            <li> I have used more expensive mascara, but this one does the trick for less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so Big can last all day on my eye lashes without causing any irritation, and almost half of the cost of what I have been using.</li>
            <li> I have been on a quest for one that doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t make raccoon eyes and yet can build up my short blond lashes and create big black lashes.</li>
            <li> My only slight caveat is that I&#x27;m not a big fan of the brush shape (the curled wand)</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s very liquidy and slow to dry.  </li>
            <li> i the past all mascara&#x27;s gave me raccoon eyes by midday but since using It&#x27;s So BIG not a black under eye to be seen ..</li>
            <li> Stays on all day, no clumping, no little black specks under my eyes at 10pm!  </li>
            <li> This product has a fabulous applicator wand/brush with lots of thick and thin portions to choose how much or how little you want to apply.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was when I accidentally pumped the brush a couple of times without thinking &amp; I ended up with a big mess on the brush - the brush was loaded with mascara (yuck)</li>
            <li> Long lasting and do not spread under my eyes if I use an oily moisturizer like other mascaras.</li>
            <li> The semi dry formula allows me to work at getting my lashes just so for as long as I want with no clumping.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I really like the brush compared to other mascara brushes I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> It makes my 50+ year old lashes look young and thick again!  </li>
            <li> I have long eyelashes, which can clump very easily with bad mascara.</li>
            <li> I have never received such awesome customer service because they promptly replaced my last two failed tubes of mascara at no charge, and apologized for my recent bad experiences!  </li>
            <li> My other recent purchase was the &amp;#34;Younique&amp;#34; which I bought from a friend that sells it, and I am not the hugest fan.  </li>
            <li> I look for long length and volume, don&#x27;t want smears or flakes!</li>
            <li> But with other mascaras (even waterproof) the moisturizer on my skin would make the mascara speckle under and above my eyes.</li>
            <li> never switch back to any other mascara.</li>
            <li> and It&#x27;s So Big on the other.  </li>
            <li> I have tried numerous mascaras &amp; decided to give this one a try based on other reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Gives me the same volume and length as other drug store brands.</li>
            <li> It volumizes, curls and stays on my lashes all night long no matter how oily my skin gets or how sweaty I am!</li>
            <li> I was actually looking to buy the &amp;#34;Better Than Sex&amp;#34; mascara and opted due to rave reviews and price to go for this one.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump, stays put, and lasts all day long - everything that I&#x27;m looking for in a mascara!</li>
            <li> This makes my lashes look so long!</li>
            <li> I have spent most of my adult life being disappointed in mascaras.</li>
            <li> I work long hours and it hangs in there with me!</li>
            <li> Makes lashes look long and does nor fall during the day!  </li>
            <li> Wears all day long!  </li>
            <li> and they look really long!</li>
            <li> several times,  and I end up having to try and diminish the clumps with my other mascaras.  </li>
            <li> It makes your lashes SO long and curly !</li>
            <li> I have been on a mascara odyssey for a long time!  </li>
            <li> but I am writing this just in case you recieve other reports and need to investagate further.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to any other brand.</li>
            <li> and it helps my other mascaras last longer...</li>
            <li> HOWEVER the Elizabeth Mott company contacted me, sent me another So BIG mascara plus two other products to try.</li>
            <li> if long, defined eyelashes is what you want!</li>
            <li> I have really short eye lashes and my other mascara</li>
            <li> and It&#x27;s So BIG on the other.  </li>
            <li> But still goes on the same way as all other mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara does not run even after a long day of work!  </li>
            <li> I get smudge when using any other mascara I tried, including Japanese products and department store brands.</li>
            <li> probably that I will ever keep for a long time!</li>
            <li> Despite definite flaws, I can&#x27;t see myself wearing any other mascara ever again.</li>
            <li> Hypoallergenic (for me; I am allergic to several other brands)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does everything you&#x27;d ever want in a mascara, and a bonus is that it stays put for a long time!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like buying the same products twice in a row, but I can&#x27;t imagine buying any other mascara after trying this.</li>
            <li> I have a tough time getting enough product on my lashes without it clumping - it dries really fast when it goes on.</li>
            <li> My eyes tear often due to dry eyes, but it only comes off when I wash my face or use my Clinique eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> The brush is not terribly fluffy and has a bit of an indent in the middle that makes it hard for me to evenly coat all my lashes.</li>
            <li> My recent two purchases, one tube was dry &amp; the other almost dry...</li>
            <li> No a smudge to be seen, even after a very long day, into night.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY long eye-lashes.</li>
            <li> It also has a moisturizing feel to it - rather than the dry, flaky mascaras I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li> With light blonde lashes, this is disappointing...</li>
            <li> Feels dry when applying, clumps when applying and after 1 hour starts to flake.</li>
            <li> Also, it seems &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; when it arrives (NOT clumpy or dry in the tube, like it&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf for months).</li>
            <li> It came in time but the product, when dry it comes on your skin</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe this, so I put some on my hand and waited for it to dry.</li>
            <li> Mascara is dry and doesnt add any length or volume to the lashes.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t let it dry between coats, keep applying until you get the result</li>
            <li> and i doesn&#x27;t have a dry cakey feeling.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the color is not an intense black.</li>
            <li> It was extremely dry upon arrival.</li>
            <li> This one does clump and takes awhile to dry and makes my eyes itch.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with this is it leaves black specks in my sink when I wash it off but really who cares.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 and have tiny thin straight lashes, always have.</li>
            <li> There are only a few items regularly in my budget that I would classify as a &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I suspect that this characteristic is what keeps it so smudge-proof.</li>
            <li> I have bought much more expensive brands that did not fit the bill</li>
            <li> This brush is thin from the middle which doesn&#x27;t make my lashes much</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed after reading such positive reviews...</li>
            <li> I found that this mascara did not live up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to report, this mascara is nothing special.</li>
            <li> It lengthens, curls and adds volume to my lashes without a single smudge.</li>
            <li> I have tried every single mascara on the market.</li>
            <li> Not even a single smear under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> and this usually happens with other brands  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this mascara, and I&#x27;m anxious to learn about other Elizabeth Mott&lt;br /&gt;cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I am a manicurist and since I am under hot lights and looking down all day, every mascara, and I mean every mascara smudges off on my.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t lengthen quite as much as some of my other mascaras that I have tried</li>
            <li> dark horse, It&#x27;s So Big Mascara, has now eclipsed them all!!</li>
            <li> Above average mascara.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of different brands of mascara and found this one to be average.  </li>
            <li> I have in the past year developed oily under eyes.</li>
            <li> you are a victim of panda eyes like me - this is the mascara for you.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say; once it ran out, i ordered the full size and use it every day.</li>
            <li> That is normally where I run into problems because volumizing products go on thick and the mascara just kinda piles on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using this product, people asked if I had false lashes on.</li>
            <li> We all have different needs from a mascara, which is evident from the very few negative reviews posted here.  </li>
            <li> When it was brand new, it hardly did anything for my lashes.  </li>
            <li> Layers on really well for a basic day look or dramatic night look.</li>
            <li> and I was only going to go in a ways and ended up getting knocked down by a wave.</li>
            <li> No one would know that my lashes are short and point down because this mascara pulls the lashes up into a sweeping butterfly look without any clumps of mascara at all.  </li>
            <li> Long lashes!!</li>
            <li> Makes my eyelashes look very long!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes aren&#x27;t very long but whatever it is in this stuff makes them look longer!</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and does not come off when I sweat like crazy in my Bikram class.</li>
            <li> and this is the only product that doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have black eyes.</li>
            <li> Finally a mascara that does not leave black marks under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It helps you not cry black tears and then go back to the office.</li>
            <li> so it takes some accommodation after smearing black mascara all over my eyelids several times</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll just go back to my previous brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every brand out there and disliked them all, until I found &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big!&amp;#34; I have long eyelashes already and had big problems with raccoon eyes and smudging!</li>
            <li> I typically use several combination mascaras</li>
            <li> I usually use a more expensive brand</li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;ll go back to my previous brand.</li>
            <li> This is a definite must buy for me because it doesn&#x27;t run (never have to worry about black under my eyes)</li>
            <li> Crazy thing is, I am in the professional beauty industry, and this was my first experience with this brand.</li>
            <li> I had been try different waterproofs and was very skeptical about this product since its not, but it was a free sample.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara (Black) by Elizabeth Mott</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my previous MAC and a Urban Decay mascaras.  </li>
            <li> Possibly, I had residue from a previous mascara????</li>
            <li> I do have trouble with some minor clumping when used on my left eye which must be from the way I am holding the wand.</li>
            <li> Because I swim and spin and get generally messed up when I exercise after work, I had been using the same, somewhat clumpy waterproof mascara for at least a decade.  </li>
            <li> (I typically use a facial wipe).</li>
            <li> The color is not deepest black, but that works for me because I&#x27;m a blonde.  </li>
            <li> $27 for mascara is pretty expensive, but I think I will purchase this mascara as my next go-to mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried so, so many mascaras only to be disappointed as the gradually ran off as the day went by.  </li>
            <li> , its like basic drugstore mascara, not super volumizing as it says.  </li>
            <li> so it actually looks like I have less lashes than I do.</li>
            <li> I hate waterproof mascara, so this one is easy to remove, BigOne is harder to remove, both don&#x27;t flake, I have very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I have very dry eyes which causes my eyes to water throughout the day</li>
            <li> but it made my eyelashes very dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t flake, doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my short, blonde eyelashes look thick and long.</li>
            <li> but if you want thick, natural looking lashes, this is for you!</li>
            <li> Also, my little bottle lasted a long long time because the formula doesn&#x27;t get dry (or, again, clumpy).  </li>
            <li> Cheap, expensive, in between, and slightly</li>
            <li> I either have to pull it off the wand and push it back into the opening of the tube, or try to screw the wand back in tightly in hopes that the little piece will stay put in the tube.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, far surpasses other mascaras I have tried in the past (Este Lauder, Too Faced, Tarte, etc).</li>
            <li> In the past when using volumizing mascaras I developed an allergic reaction due to the flaking of the mascara.</li>
            <li> so personally it is a tie for me, but this one is a little cheaper (about $4-$5)</li>
            <li> Even the next morning they felt a little irritated.</li>
            <li> While not a waterproof mascara, it takes a little extra effort to remove.  </li>
            <li> It is a little bit on the pricy side compared to regular drug store make up</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so big handle, and a little glob came out with it.</li>
            <li> I soon realized that this is not the case; rather, the mascara dries clung as an encasement around the lashes, so when it comes off it&#x27;s like a little mold of each individual eyelash.</li>
            <li> Big, dark separated lashes!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t separate my lashes and gets a little clumpy when applying a second coat.</li>
            <li> I stopped using mascara a couple of years ago due to dry eyes and allergies.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaints of other brandsis is that they don&#x27;t last, sting my eyes, or require rubbing my eyes to remove all the black smears.  </li>
            <li> Once applied, the mascara does stay where it&#x27;s put, but then so does several other brands at half the price.</li>
            <li> I also wear hard contact lenses and occasionally I get flaking in my eyes later in the day.  </li>
            <li> They look so long, dark, and it does not clump my lashes as i have tried high end brands from sephora and i dont like how they clump my lashes up together its not a good look.</li>
            <li> It goes on very wet and takes a while to dry</li>
            <li> I have tried Dior iconic, bad gal, clinique, etc etc etc..</li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of touching my eyes and face a lot, and still this didn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> Bad Girl Lash is better.</li>
            <li> Way better than Bad Gal by Benefit</li>
            <li> You can add coats for more volume and it does not clump up and look ugly.</li>
            <li> I have tried every mascara out there from least to most expensive...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this mascara is very clumpy, with extra goop coming out on the wand every time and not evenly distributing on the wand.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if it&#x27;ll work the same on everyone, but you definitely need to try it at least once.</li>
            <li> The only negative I could possibly find would be that the mascara tends to glob at the end of the wand.</li>
            <li> This is probably because it really does thicken and lengthen and it looks almost like fake eye lashes, so if you are going for a big look, this is IT.</li>
            <li> However I like it enough to use it till its dead.,</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> so my mascara, especially on the lower lashes, always disappeared or smudged after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have very blond, thin lashes.</li>
            <li> I disliked it enough to wash my eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times</li>
            <li> Does not really deliver on &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Dior is much harder to get off when you want to.  </li>
            <li> I do have to be careful if wearing liquid liner though because if the liner gets on my lashes, the mascara will clump in that spot.  </li>
            <li> I have spent YEARS looking in mirrors and cleaning up all the &amp;#34;heroin chic&amp;#34; smearing and running under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I get long dark lashes, no clumps at all.</li>
            <li> The Big Volumizing Mascara that I ordered is clumpy and dried out.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully by the time the tubes are empty</li>
            <li> I really was not happy with this...</li>
            <li> Keeps lashes separated, dark, volumized, and long even after a day at the beach.</li>
            <li> I like the length this produced, but the attention I have to pay to apply several coats, and then ensure my lashes don&#x27;t mark my eyelids because they haven&#x27;t dried yet --</li>
            <li> maybe they are rubbing their eyes  or about one of those clumpy dried out tubes that were a bigger problem in 2015 .</li>
            <li> It used to be wet</li>
            <li> Curled lashes but not much volume.</li>
            <li> It is a tad expensive for mascara, but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it does clump on the applicator after a few times use.  </li>
            <li> this is a much harder task than it seems...</li>
            <li> No thanks, Elizabeth Mott, I&#x27;ll be sticking to Benefits</li>
            <li> Bummer and waste of $20 for me personally.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn into wet ink when you get it wet.</li>
            <li> It does wash off at the end of the day though, not much issue.  </li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with mascara coming off on my upper lids...</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.</li>
            <li> The last few name brands I bought at the drug store went in the trash after a couple uses because of clumping....</li>
            <li> I took a risk on an unknown brand.</li>
            <li> It is SOOO BIG and also does not smudge or get messy as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> a lot, so I need mascara that doesn&#x27;t smear or drip when wet.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this mascara to anyone who has had trouble removing all of the mascara at night.</li>
            <li> Too wet.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback for me at that point was it did take quite a few coats to get the drama I was looking for.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve gotten my face wet with minimal damage.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in my ipsy bag a few months back</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not comfortable for non-contact wearers either, but its especially crappy when you have the stinging and burning and you are trying to see your way to the bathroom through a mascara-induced fog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wins over all the expensive mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li> , never really sticking with one.</li>
            <li> You can apply multiple coats and it does not look messy.</li>
            <li> The mascara is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> you have hanging lids, be careful.</li>
            <li> This mascara stays wet for a minute or two, and if your lashes hit your eyelids, it will leave marks.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s almost empty.</li>
            <li> My lashes look long and dark.  </li>
            <li> The shape of the brush works well to elongate the lashes but not much volume is being added.</li>
            <li> I work my bees in 95 degree weather and I am soaking wet, from head to toe when I am done</li>
            <li> It does not really do anything for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes so long and dark.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t run if you cry or get wet</li>
            <li> Still doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes even after keeping the eye lash curler on for over 15 sec.</li>
            <li> So I did...and no real change.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO raccoon eye with this mascara.</li>
            <li> Sometimes after a particularly long day I notice some wear or dark circles but that could also be from eyeliner, and I haven&#x27;t found makeup yet</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes, thin &amp; short eye lashes &amp;</li>
            <li> The brush is wide in the ends and narrow in the middle.  </li>
            <li> As others have said it does not build to a thick lush look.</li>
            <li> but I pinch the tips when it gets too clumpy and just reapply starting at the base to tip to give the tips a more whispy appearance.</li>
            <li> I have always had fiber mascaras, because I hate panda eyes, but this formula is better than any of the japanese brands I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it find every single little lash and coat it in fabulousness, but it doesn&#x27;t smear, smudge, or clump..not even in water!</li>
            <li> I have finally found a volumizing mascara that won&#x27;t leave that black residue under my eyes!  </li>
            <li> The only mascara I have used that doesn&#x27;t end up creating black circles underneath my eyes at the end of the day!  </li>
            <li> , it makes my sad little lashes super long!  </li>
            <li> After using this mascara for more than two weeks, it  was disappointing because in spite of other claims, for me it was messy to apply and it did leave clumps on my eyelashes.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This mascara is very difficult to remove (hence it does not smear); however, as a result, lashes are easily pulled out when you wash your face and make-up</li>
            <li> Makes my eyelashes so long and full that they look fake!</li>
            <li> We would continue to use ITS SO BIG VOLUMIZING DEEP BLACK MASCARA!!!</li>
            <li> Can layer several coats to make your look as natural or dramatic as you would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very deep set eyes with long lashes, so after a few hours, I usually look like a linebacker with big black circles under my eyes,....even with waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> Double Extend Beauty Tubes for less than half the price.</li>
            <li> It makes your lashes long but not full at all.</li>
            <li> After a long search for a mascara that could enhanced my thin, colorless lashes without clumping, flaking or smearing, I finally found &#x27;It&#x27;s So BIG&#x27; on AMAZON.</li>
            <li> It takes a few applications, but it does create really long, soft and thick lashes.</li>
            <li> This formula and brush were just not for me, I really wanted to like it due to all the rave reviews (seriously, I depend on those!)</li>
            <li> ***Must be replaced after at least 4 months bc after that it will start to break down and not look as voluminous and start to flake a tiny tiny bit</li>
            <li> Glad it works for others, but I&#x27;m disappointed and upset at having spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble with mascara leaving dark smudges under my lower lids and this mascara is one of the only ones I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> I actually have long and fairly thick eyelashes to begin with, and this mascara managed to make them look shorter and thinner.</li>
            <li> Long, thick lashes finally.</li>
            <li> Its So Big makes my lashes look thick and long like never before</li>
            <li> Leaves my lashes long AND thick.(61 years old with thin lashes) will be purchasing again and I am fussy.</li>
            <li> It also flaked and left little black pieces on my face.</li>
            <li> For the last few weeks, I&#x27;ve tested the resolve of this mascara by flying down the ski slopes at 35-45 miles per hour.</li>
            <li> Good product -- very thick mascara -- but impossible to wash out with just soap and water</li>
            <li> I only tried using this product twice, it did very little.</li>
            <li> Had previously used a tube technology mascara (blinc), because those types don&#x27;t flake/smudge, but disliked that you can&#x27;t add multiple coats.</li>
            <li> anyone who has fine eye lashs, it is almost impossible to find a mascara that thickens and lengthens their eye lashs.&lt;br /&gt;THIS</li>
            <li> As I read all the other reviews I realized I just needed to give it a try</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m going to keep trying to work with this and layer it with other mascaras to see if that helps, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> That means all night, in and out of medical masks, falling asleep at my desk, 5 cups of coffee and usually one tearful moment of exhaustion wondering why I didn&#x27;t pick a career that lets me sleep at night.  </li>
            <li> With other mascaras, I have had to use lots of make-up remover after cleansing.</li>
            <li> I ordered it once and now won&#x27;t use any other mascara.</li>
            <li> To keep this from happening I usually have to wipe some of the paste back in the container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not wearing any other makeup.  </li>
            <li> Every other mascara that I&#x27;ve tried, including Estee Lauder, Clinique, Lancôme, Dior, and some Target brands, leaves smudge marks under my eyes within an hour - even with the use of a lash primer.</li>
            <li> Works like any other mascara.</li>
            <li> I hope that the company will come up with other colors, so that I can switch all my mascara form SYL.</li>
            <li> However, I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t volumiZe more than it does.</li>
            <li> This mascara is like any other mascara I tried .</li>
            <li> That is something I have yet to find in ANY other mascara in my 30years.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge like every other mascara I have used.  </li>
            <li> I use it along with Lancome Hypnose Drama and the 2 seem to compliment each other.</li>
            <li> No more sticking the tip of the mascara brush on my inner lashes to deposit product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what they done to it, but it&#x27;s not the same!</li>
            <li> so I have yet to find a product that I don&#x27;t need to layer with other mascaras as well.  </li>
            <li> other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews on this product before buying it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it happened to other customers before</li>
            <li> I am throwing away all my other crappy mascara.</li>
            <li> After I tried this mascara, I threw out the other ones.</li>
            <li> i have the problem with other mascaras smudges on my bottom lashes and with this Mascara i didnt have that problem</li>
            <li> I like the product and the brush but based on other reviews</li>
            <li> I have tried so many mascaras and been disappointed every time.  </li>
            <li> A tube usually lasts me 2-3 months (which has only been beaten by Benefit&#x27;s</li>
            <li> an every other mascara does- can&#x27;t see how anyone could get this to flake-</li>
            <li> Perhaps my other mascaras were causing me to lose eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> &quot; per se, it&#x27;s not exactly water soluble either.</li>
            <li> I can keep building layers on each other.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t flake off during the day like every other brand I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I think I might try L&#x27;oreal on one eye and this one on the other to compare and see what they look like at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> and this stuff does not smudge, smear or relocate to any other place other than where you place it.  </li>
            <li> like I do with other mascaras.</li>
            <li> I bought based on the other reviews</li>
            <li> The product itself stays on all day, does not smear or bleed like other products and when i wash my face, it comes off in clumps, instead of giving me panda eyes.</li>
            <li> but i read other reviews on this one</li>
            <li> Due no fault of theirs</li>
            <li> I came online looking for my usual Benefits Big Lash, didn&#x27;t see it, but Amazon recc&#x27;d</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this problem with any other mascara.</li>
            <li> The reason I decided to try this mascara was because of the other 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> and I am not rubbing it off from under my eyes all day like other brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mascara and was always disappointed; this mascara does what it says!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike other mascaras, my eyes don&#x27;t itch at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using any other product from now on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I was not given this product to try for any blog or other reason.  </li>
            <li> It is NOT waterproof, and yet, it does not smear all over the place when wet!</li>
            <li> Does help make small eyes look bigger!</li>
            <li> Seriously not pretty.</li>
            <li> , this mascara has outlasted any other I have used.</li>
            <li> like it a lot but hearing from the other lady&#x27;s and reading there reviews</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely goopy and tar-like.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful for other reviews regarding this mascara</li>
            <li> I was disappointed for sure.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other mascara again.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect anything, I just wanted to inquire if the Elizabeth Mott company had somehow changed their formula or if any other customers had observed a difference with this product.  </li>
            <li> Oops for that other mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve managed to get it not to clump, but I&#x27;ve had to use techniques I use with other mascara.</li>
            <li> I will not buy any other brand.</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of other mascaras, but this one beats them all.</li>
            <li> The other drawback is that it does leave residue when you wash it off.</li>
            <li> I do not write reviews sadly, this is a first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend the other products too-</li>
            <li> I find the mascara to be extremely clumpy.  </li>
            <li> 1st picture is before and other two are after application    </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, the mascara coats the lash</li>
            <li> I tried it after years of using other brands.</li>
            <li> When you wash it off it doesn&#x27;t smear like other mascaras</li>
            <li> I also found that I had to re-curl my lashes after applying - which I never need to do with other mascaras - but this formula, as it dries, straightened my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> year-round due to allergies.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with this product is the small amount of work you have to do to take it off,</li>
            <li> Never happened to me before with other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> it being at an angle but other than that...</li>
            <li> Was NOT worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> A little flaky at the end of the day ( very minor) .</li>
            <li> But now, the liquid inside as well as the brush seem a little dry.  </li>
            <li> It was slightly dry when I got it but aded a little contact solution</li>
            <li> and I rank it higher than Lancôme for quality, particularly for the price.  </li>
            <li> Not very bold and glamourus.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long and dark eyelashes, but like using a mascara that plays them up and adds a little volume.</li>
            <li> its tough enough to last through what i put it through and still make me feel like a girl!</li>
            <li> but this is one of the very few products that I have bought multiple times and will never be without.</li>
            <li> After 4 hours, Its So BIG had black residue (little black flakes) under my eyes,&lt;br /&gt;Stiletto</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s really hard to take off and leaves a build up that makes application even harder the next day.</li>
            <li> - it stays put all day long, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and doesn&#x27;t make my lashes stiff and brittle.  </li>
            <li> Made my lashes feel very dry and they stuck together so tightly that when I tried to comb through with a metal comb it pulled out a couple lashes.</li>
            <li> I have Japanese background and have short and thin eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have thin tiny lashes and BIG immediately lengthens them.  </li>
            <li> No more raccoon eyes when I get home from work, hot and tired.</li>
            <li> I have spent three years battling black under-eye smudges once I begin</li>
            <li> WHAT a tremendous disappointment this Mascara was.  </li>
            <li> During the first couple times using this mascara, I thought the formula was very thin</li>
            <li> It has a unique formula, the texture kinda looks thick and gluey, like eyelash primers, except very black.  </li>
            <li> The resoundingly positive reviews did not steer me wrong.</li>
            <li> I have been searching endlessly for a mascara that will not leave smudges on my brow bone with no success...</li>
            <li> My girlfriend told me to write a review of this eyeliner, as she is currently busy putting on while being annoyed that I am lazily lounging around on the opposite couch.</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to wash off - it comes off in bits rather than wiping off cleanly, but doesn&#x27;t irritate, and it does come off with just soap and water (I HATE makeup remover, so this is a must for me), albeit not as easily as some others</li>
            <li> So, they are back but they are very, very, very thin and spaced far apart.</li>
            <li> My short thinned lashes look long and thick with this mascara!</li>
            <li> I wish the brush were a just a practical cone shape, wide at one end and tapers narrow at the other end.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely positively no complaints here!</li>
            <li> But a little practice of carefully pulling the wand out and twisting the brush has diminished that issue.</li>
            <li> but yet it stands out enough to where it could be on the dramatic side with an extra coat.</li>
            <li> You can add just one coat for a subtle look and up to 10 for something super dramatic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s So BIG Mascara bandwagon last year because I felt as if the formula somehow changed, and my lashes were not as voluminous or as dramatic as they once had been when I used this product.  </li>
            <li> that wouldn&#x27;t give me black eyes through out the day, (with other brand)</li>
            <li> so even if you want to, it makes it hard to apply another coat on later in the day (if going out after work, etc.).  </li>
            <li> At first I was little skeptical when I pulled out the trial size of the</li>
            <li> I was using They&#x27;re Real, which wore a little heavy on my thin eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it does get a little flaky after strenuous activity but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried scraping it back into the container, but it&#x27;s a big sloppy mess.</li>
            <li> So I ordered a free sample to see if I got a bad tube of mascara.</li>
            <li> This was definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I already have really dark eyelashes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just another average quality mascara that does nothing to volumize the lashes.</li>
            <li> The average reviews are waaaay off on this product.</li>
            <li> I followed up with 2 coats of Maybelline Illegal Lengths Mascara and they looked much thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> Not worth 20 dolllars</li>
            <li> Not worth the price</li>
            <li> Not worth your while.</li>
            <li> Certainly not worth $28.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no success with drug store mascaras</li>
            <li> even when I wear dark circle concealer.  </li>
            <li> My eyelids became like sandpaper for a week after using this mascara so a total waste of money :/</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave a star is you have to give at least one to say how crappy the product is.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price, maybelline or Mac  </li>
            <li> I wear it my whole shift at work , and no fly away clumps below my eyes !!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the brush is clumpy as is the formula when putting on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that it seems to flake off my lashes as the night progresses.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a dark circle under my eyes.   </li>
            <li> To my surprise, its so not worth it..</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> I really like &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; by Benefit, but it is SOOO expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have never left a negative review before.</li>
            <li> I have used at least 8 different fashion brands from Sephora.</li>
            <li> This mascara definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth what I paid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything including fake and fiber lashes and this is so much easier and never smudges or runs unless I want it off.</li>
            <li> Not useful since I already fight dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this mascara didn&#x27;t give me much volume or have staying power.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s average at best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to have dark circles under my eyes after my shower, but no longer.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I have average lashes.  </li>
            <li> but not worth 2-3 times what you pay for a drugstore brand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just average.</li>
            <li> While they were bald, I hid it by drowning my eyes in a sea of dark, dark liners and eye shadows.</li>
            <li> I have dark lashes</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT worth $20.  </li>
            <li> Problem is that the 2 I got on sale were clumpy and dried my lashes on contact so they were pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> I would return it, but it&#x27;s not worth the drama of dealing with a AMAZON return</li>
            <li> It feels like I am wearing false eyelashes, but looks natural.</li>
            <li> So thick I can actually say I have Eyelashes now.</li>
            <li> I got lots of compliments when I wore this mascara, but just after a few hours of working at the office in normal conditions, it started flaking and sticking underneath my eyes and irritating them</li>
            <li> I would say this would be more like a base coat type of mascara, which is how I will use it.</li>
            <li> It would be a lot easier for me to use the narrow end where I need it and wide end where I need it.  </li>
            <li> so the lashes are not as thick as they used to be and does not have the length I had in my younger years.  </li>
            <li> It has either been too clumpy or too thin or it has worn off by early morning.</li>
            <li> The wand is thin enough to get really defined and lengthened lashes, but not too thin.</li>
            <li> Especially disappointed after all the good reviews I read which is why I bought.</li>
            <li> The mascara comes out too thick on the brush (it is caked on and individual bristles are not separated).  </li>
            <li> Have tried many that I hate</li>
            <li> I had previously bought Yves Saint Laurent Volume Effet Faux Cils Luxurious Mascara for a False Lash Effect 1 High Density Black but it would leave smudges within hours--disappointing for $28!  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I am often tired and sweating, neither which makes it easy to keep mascara on.</li>
            <li> The only (slight) complaint I have about the mascara is that the end of the brush is a bit gooey - you must wipe the tip before applying.</li>
            <li> Every nite I&#x27;d take it offf, it would flake down my face.  </li>
            <li> This has all them beat lashes down.</li>
            <li> but i was not let down.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would survive in the Florida heat without melting down my face.</li>
            <li> I have downright sobbed in this mascara, but I&#x27;ve never had it run down my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it to the gym and run a 10k on the treadmill, sweat pouring down my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my lashes.</li>
            <li> I broke down and bought this &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So BIG&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve ever used... hands down</li>
            <li> This is it, hands down.  </li>
            <li> It clumps the brush doesn&#x27;t separate lashes, and weighs my lashes down not curl them up.</li>
            <li> this one beats it hands down.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes after a while like all other Mascara&#x27;s I recommend!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy any other brand from now on!</li>
            <li> Other than that it suck!</li>
            <li> then any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> After using the entire sample until it dried up, I purchased a full-sized tube and can&#x27;t imagine ever using anything else!!</li>
            <li> Just like any other mascara!</li>
            <li> I will never use any other mascara now!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it 10X times over any other out there!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know of any other companies that do that!</li>
            <li> I was a bit unsure of buying this due to the price (I have been disappointed in several higher price tag mascara&#x27;s before)</li>
            <li> it is EXTREMELY smudge-proof which means its not going to just wear off (unless you swim or cry!).  </li>
            <li> Other mascaras would flake immediately and/or leave gobs of goop on my lashes that I couldn&#x27;t even comb out with my eyelash comb!</li>
            <li> This is plain old mascara - nothing special - just on the expensive side - and a little difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> I have very long and think lashes and volumizing mascara usually makes my lashes clump together</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;It&#x27;s SO Big&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real!&amp;#34; The wand is very thin, the mascara comes out of the container with a long thread of mascara hanging off, the resulting lashes are skinny and require numerous coats for length--and my eyelashes are already long!</li>
            <li> Really dark black color</li>
            <li> I only ordered it because of the good reviews and it sucks so bad it makes me think the reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a really dark black, which is what I need since my hair is black</li>
            <li> Application was uneven, clumpy in some areas (I think due to the hourglass shaped brush), and made my eyelashes sparse looking.</li>
            <li> I get coupons for other mascaras, but don&#x27;t even waste time to use them.</li>
            <li> When applying, I felt like it was almost clumpy at times, and at other times I feel that I need to put on quite a few coats to get a noticeable look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s So BIG Mascara to survive, un-smudged, just as thick and dark as when I applied it in the morning!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does clump a little; however, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t do that at least a little if you&#x27;re outside in the elements all day.  </li>
            <li> (I mean very short) and these make my lashes look really long and thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really black</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t flake or leave black on your face.</li>
            <li> I almost stopped wearing mascara all together because I could not stand how black under my eyes would get by evening.  </li>
            <li> It separates and lengthens my lashes without clumping and I find it takes me less time to apply as a result.</li>
            <li> It made my lashes black, skinny and scrawny.</li>
            <li> I always find with wearing liquid liner that my lashes get lost in the black line, but this just makes my lashes stand out.</li>
            <li> It felt like I was putting black glue on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is like brushing black water onto my lashes.</li>
            <li> The black container is unmarked, unlike the sample.</li>
            <li> I wake up with pissed off eyes and black flakes everywhere.</li>
            <li> i always use loreal voluminous in carbon black</li>
            <li> I previously used</li>
            <li> I bought this based on previous reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> I would have the black smudges under my eyes and this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super black</li>
            <li> none the less and have been recommending it to my friends and coworkers.</li>
            <li> I washed it off in the shower with simple Cetaphil and it left behind no trace!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is black</li>
            <li> Typical mascara.</li>
            <li> I got the typical email reminder asking for feedback on items</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge but it flakes, and I have black flecks all over.</li>
            <li> The brush shape makes it simple to curl your lashes a bit, to apply subtly to areas, does NOT smudge or flake</li>
            <li> I used Lancome Virtuose Black Carat mascara for years.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this one despite it being a bit more expensive, but still affordable, but I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> But somehow in my Amazon black hole of &#x27;window shopping&#x27; I ended up here.</li>
            <li> Loreal Telescopic and Volumizing mascara works as well for less.</li>
            <li> You need several layers to have the same effect my maybelline mascara gives,  and it&#x27;s really difficult to take off at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> *Update to my previous review + adding 1 star</li>
            <li> (Previous review):  </li>
            <li> but I wake up with black flakey uckiness.</li>
            <li> I had been buying organic mascara and continually had black smudges under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It does slightly clump if you try to put on 10 coats as the box suggest.</li>
            <li> Mine took less than a week to arrive.</li>
            <li> I apply once in the morning and it stays on all day without flaking off or creating black bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t reapply during the day, which isn&#x27;t a problem with this mascara.</li>
            <li> works, but it doesn&#x27;t work half as well as Benefit or Lancôme.</li>
            <li> I can even sleep with it on and not wake up with black smeary eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about a week and a half</li>
            <li> Now granted I was wearing goggles, there were plenty of times I had the goggles lifted off my face and was subject to the wintery conditions of the slopes.</li>
            <li> I also recommend doing some serious lash-curling prior to putting the coats on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not your typical mascara either.  </li>
            <li> I am terribly picky and struggle to find a mascara that isn&#x27;t goopy or clumpy, or flakes off later in the day (or any of the typical problems with many mascaras).</li>
            <li> As an older person, it has been difficult to find a product that works for me.</li>
            <li> Again its not perfect but for now its benefits highly outweigh its downfalls for me.</li>
            <li> Is has yet to smudge or get that black mess below my eyes when I am perspiring.</li>
            <li> No matter how sweaty I get, as long as I don&#x27;t rub my eyes hard, this stuff won&#x27;t budge and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive, and difficult to remove, but creates prettier lashes.</li>
            <li> I hate the way it smudges or smears or how easy it leaves a dark residue under the eye...</li>
            <li> This mascara lasted all 14 hours of my workday and I am very active.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very active and even after a gym workout it held up</li>
            <li> What a huge disappointment!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a mascara that I don&#x27;t have a make-up degree to apply it, that doesn&#x27;t leave me with clumps, a mess, or spider eyelashes.</li>
            <li> mess</li>
            <li> The round tip makes it difficult to get the inner corner lashes, and I have poked myself in the eye several times by accident.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make a mess, but it&#x27;s not water proof</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make a mess, but it&#x27;s not water proof</li>
            <li> Eyelashes stuck together in one glumpy mess and racoon eyes by the afternoon.  </li>
            <li> It makes your lashes very sexy, it does not give you allergy and does not make your eyes dirty when you wash them!!!</li>
            <li> Every lash separate, long, and as thick as you want it.  </li>
            <li> My lashes look long and thick, but not clumpy.</li>
            <li> I do not have long or thick lashes.</li>
            <li> I will preface this with saying I have been blessed with thick relatively long eyelashes, but they have a tendency to go wherever they want...and compared to all of my friends and their semi permanent $200 plus eyelashes...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how long and thick it makes my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I use latisse and have long, thick lashes.</li>
            <li> and it makes my eyelashes long but thick.</li>
            <li> My lashes are long and thick.</li>
            <li> Even though I do not have an abundance of lashes,the ones I do have are thick looking and long when using this mascara.</li>
            <li> One coat makes my lashes look long, well-defined, and not too dark for casual daily wear.</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil to remove it and it leaves little black specks all over my face.</li>
            <li> a little less fancy.  </li>
            <li> Also when I go to take it off, it doesn&#x27;t leave black under my eye because it comes off in little clumps.</li>
            <li> Also you don&#x27;t get those little black dots under your eye.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes look clumpy and little black pieces fall onto my face during the day from the mascara.</li>
            <li> If you want less volume but little clumps, then this may be the mascara for you.</li>
            <li> I do sometimes find little black specks on my cheeks in the AM, which means it&#x27;s not fully coming off at night.</li>
            <li> Wish it cost a little less, but then again, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This product curls, lengthens, and volumizes without making your lashes feel heavy and weighed down.</li>
            <li> so I tend to be wary when using any new products, but this one has given me no issues so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but sadly it doesn&#x27;t live up to its name.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say this did not even live up to the hype..</li>
            <li> I was expecting a major change, but for the $20 price tag, it&#x27;s worse than a lot of drugstore brands that cost half the price!  </li>
            <li> It has always felt a little dry and hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes very long and thick.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make the lashes as thick but very long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry and has a wonky wand and not even useable.</li>
            <li> yes just a few,  black specks under my eye,  </li>
            <li> No clean up what-so-ever needed.</li>
            <li> With the small sample, I had no issues, my lashes were big and thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super heavy</li>
            <li> I tried several other mascaras over the next few months and felt disappointment every time.  </li>
            <li> Plumps up sad little lashes and gives a very natural and feminine look.</li>
            <li> I like for mascara to be a little thicker.</li>
            <li> and while it does lengthen my lashes there is no significant increase in volume.  </li>
            <li> but it does clump just a little.  </li>
            <li> Just a little wipe with makeup remover and its gone.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Chanel product, but saw the other reviews of this mascara.</li>
            <li> if I still have a little under the eye, it&#x27;s nothing</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about some of the ingredients, so that was probably the biggest thing that bothered me.  </li>
            <li> I wished that it made them look a little fatter.</li>
            <li> I find using a little bit of moisturing shampoo and lot of lather makes it easier to remove.</li>
            <li> So not worth the money!</li>
            <li> but I have little to no eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This is one step which is easier and gives a fuller look and does not leave me with dark circles from smudged and smeared mascara at the end of the day!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wear alot of makeup but now in my 40&#x27;s, realized I need to do a little bit to my face - just the sign of the times with age.  </li>
            <li> A little eye shadow, MAC brown eyeliner and this mascara</li>
            <li> I feel like usually you have to choose one or the other, and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey for me</li>
            <li> This Mascara doesn&#x27;t clump or flake off leaving dark circles under the eyes!</li>
            <li> although it does reach onto even the tiniest little in between lashes</li>
            <li> Some worked for a little bit...</li>
            <li> Usually it&#x27;s just one or the other.</li>
            <li> It can be a little stringy, but nothing that would keep me from buying it again.  </li>
            <li> dose not smear, it just comes off like little clumps.</li>
            <li> but I threw away the original brush. :(</li>
            <li> just in little pieces.</li>
            <li> I do notice that when removing my mascara it does not dissolve off, instead it comes off in little clumps, like it was truly coating my lashes, which explains why it doesn&#x27;t flake off while wearing it.  </li>
            <li> Although it was a little pricey (thus a star demerit), I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> not sure due to expense and not getting the volume I wanted,</li>
            <li> Has taken a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> comes off with a little effort</li>
            <li> The price is a little steep</li>
            <li> I have spring/fall allergies that make my eyes water all throughout the day and even with a little bit of rubbing and tissues, this stuff stays on.</li>
            <li> I need it not to smear and make dark circles under my eyes, or make my eyes itch!</li>
            <li> Usually a little soap and water work well to wash off the mascara</li>
            <li> After 2-3 uses it does flake and make little specks when you wash it off.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for two weeks and have already told at least 5 people about it!  </li>
            <li> IS A LITTLE CHANGE IN LENGTH.LEAVES LUMPS EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> so when it comes off it does so as a little tube, which means it doesn&#x27;t smear all over your face.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It is a little easier to take off with a mascara remover</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly with no chunks and stays on without leaving that annoying black shadow under my lower lashes when I&#x27;ve had it on all day.  </li>
            <li> The 2nd bottle performed well, but it&#x27;s still very hard to take off.</li>
            <li> The first one was weirdly wet and clumpy, which was clearly just a random bad bottle.</li>
            <li> I was expecting dramatic lashes from a 20 dollar mascara but the formula is watery and it barely looked like I was wearing mascara at all.</li>
            <li> I was not very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Removal is maybe a little messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even worn it in the steam room after a tough workout several times and didn&#x27;t have a speck out of place or any droop.</li>
            <li> : I had a massage, face down on the table, and then went into the steam room!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it running down my face by the end of the work day!</li>
            <li> Big mascara never flakes off or feels heavy on my lashes!!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be looking at your other products!!</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look fuller than with any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried...and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, just started using the second one and it was very dry...</li>
            <li> Thick and long with very little clumping</li>
            <li> And my boyfriend and I got in a huge, stupid fight, which ended with me CRYING and sleeping in the guest room, with my face buried in the pillow.  </li>
            <li> I really was unhappy with the performance of this mascara.</li>
            <li> After trying you will not need to waste anymore money trying others...</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe that I wasted my money like this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often go without mascara as my lashes are short and thin</li>
            <li> I have thin blonde lashes and oily eyelids.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> but again it doesn&#x27;t have that bleeding/running effect that makes you look like you&#x27;ve been crying for hours,  </li>
            <li> A friend may mention,  while swimming,  that i have a few.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of trouble finding mascara that does not wind up in a smear under my eyes after a few hrs.  </li>
            <li> Lengthens and separates without feeling heavy and looking gunky.</li>
            <li> The wand is not a shape I like and it takes a few coats to get my eyelashes where I want them to be.</li>
            <li> I have short, thin lashes.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes feel dried out.</li>
            <li> A lot of mascara goes on too heavy on the bottom</li>
            <li> I wear heavy eye cream</li>
            <li> It makes you end up looking like a caterpillar has dropped dead across your eyes.</li>
            <li> It basically looks like you applied natural fake lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my everyday use one.</li>
            <li> The determining factor will be if it starts clumping in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> However, there are a few things they could improve upon.</li>
            <li> I got a sample size of this product in an Ipsy bag a few years ago.</li>
            <li> one of the few mascaras i can use without it smudging.</li>
            <li> It meant lots of wasted money and mascara in the trash.  </li>
            <li> is the 1 item I do wear everyday (even on no make-up days)</li>
            <li> that I know what I&#x27;ve been missing.</li>
            <li> Takes at least 3 applications to get minimal length.  </li>
            <li> This mascara lengthens and separates lashes and doesn&#x27;t leave them heavy or chunky.</li>
            <li> it clumps it into a few sticks.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> The brush comes heavily loaded with mascara despite trying to lessen the amount, plus it is heavy.</li>
            <li> but the mascara never feels clumpy or heavy.</li>
            <li> Finding one that was cruelty-free and didn&#x27;t have that sickening petroleum chemical smell proved to be a greater challenge.</li>
            <li> Does not clump or feel heavy on eyes.</li>
            <li> After a few months of clumpy lashes and throwing away a few tubes of mascara, I found Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s mascara on an Amazon search.</li>
            <li> My trouble was removing it-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t feel heavy</li>
            <li> dont waste your money</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have the wimpiest lashes and I have tried every brand - Lancome, Chanel, Jane Iredale, M.A.C., just to name a few.  </li>
            <li> Felt like heavy hoods on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Works really nicely, not quite as juicy as I expected....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that the brush on the Perversion mascara has longer, fluffy bristles that just make my lashes sing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few samples in monthly subscription boxes and have since chucked them because they flaked within hours...  </li>
            <li> Now, after having it about 2 weeks, it&#x27;s almost all dried out.  </li>
            <li> I use a makeup remover to remove, but I&#x27;ve also used just soap and water, have not had any trouble.  </li>
            <li> and I need a few layers of volumizing mascara to make my eyes pop.</li>
            <li> Once it has dried, trying to put additional layers on is futile.</li>
            <li> Takes a few coats to get volume with the length.</li>
            <li> My everyday make-up kit has a mix of high-end and drug store items that I&#x27;m dedicated to.</li>
            <li> I found a few that give volume not length, and it didn&#x27;t look that great.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Am I missing something?</li>
            <li> I always have trouble with mascara smudging.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I have always had issues trying to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t end up in my under-eye area after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap</li>
            <li> For now it&#x27;s become my \\&quot;first-coat-only\\&quot; mascara (so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste), then I use Max.</li>
            <li> but did smudge under my eyes after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already told a few friends about it.</li>
            <li> It still clumps up after a few uses and needs to be wiped with a tissue before use, like any mascara.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara for everyday use, like going to work or running errands, but it&#x27;s not what I would use for a night out or a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i have a trouble washing it off</li>
            <li> I have been using Blinc for years and never knew what I was missing.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a few weeks after trying this mascara to write a review.</li>
            <li> Am I missing something or not using it correctly?  </li>
            <li> It also took the curl away from my lashes, because it was so heavy.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of this mascara in my Ipsy Glam Bag a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Holds up well to crying.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> I have short, thin lashes and this mascara</li>
            <li> and I wasted some of the pricey product.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money ..</li>
            <li> a few tears and</li>
            <li> And considering it came off in a tasteful manner when I was really crying and rubbing my eyes, this passed the test.  </li>
            <li> I used false lashes because every mascara I used gave me raccoon eyes and irritated my contacts, especially during allergy season.  </li>
            <li> a few hour later it started flaking again around my eyes and irritating them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mascara that came as close as realistically possible to imitating the look achieved by wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, I couldn&#x27;t get a thickness to my lashes and I ended up using my old MAC brush (from a dried out tube of mascara) for the mascara.  </li>
            <li> I had several people asking me if I was wearing false lashes or if I had my lash extensions,</li>
            <li> But if you actually want to appear as though you have false eye lashes , this is the product.</li>
            <li> Very black with little fibers.  </li>
            <li> I have slightly watery eyes, and also fairly prominent dark undereye circles, which makes for a terrible combination with flaky/runny mascara.  </li>
            <li> The formula left my lashes stiff and thin looking.</li>
            <li> I also teach bootcamp classes and after class, I&#x27;d have black all over my face!</li>
            <li> One less step!</li>
            <li> I need to change my previous review, but not sure how.</li>
            <li> ; Mascara after going through half a dozen mascaras from Target, and googling &amp;#34;best mascara.&amp;#34; What a Goddess-send!</li>
            <li> This has lasted on me for twelve hours, without touch-ups- even with my slightly oily skin!  </li>
            <li> Usually at the end of the work day i can see a trace if black under my eye.</li>
            <li> I have given this product three stars as opposed to 4 due to the fact that it is hard for me to remove.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no different than any other drugstore mascara that I&#x27;ve tried, and is difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> usually its all off and on my face by lunch, or a clumpy mess to put on.</li>
            <li> I never have the urge to pick it off late in the day like I have other mascaras.  </li>
            <li> Long thick lashes that DON&#x27;T smudge!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly thick like some other brands.  </li>
            <li> It is on the expensive side, but it does not clump and truly gives you long, thick, big lashes.</li>
            <li> Makes your eyelashes look long and thick!</li>
            <li> This makes your lashes long and thick, and does NOT smudge or flake!  </li>
            <li> This mascara does not flake, wear off, clump, or become stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> I use plain water, no soap, and it comes off in pieces/strands, not smudges.</li>
            <li> Your lashes don&#x27;t get stiff.</li>
            <li> This made my lashes stiff.</li>
            <li> Very odd.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very black</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t terrible, just...not much better than the average drugstore mascara.</li>
            <li> I am not easy on my makeup, I work in a warehouse on the night shift and walk up to 8 miles a day.</li>
            <li> Sadly after curling them the mascara would weigh them down and straighten them back out again.</li>
            <li> SO, basically what I look for in a mascara is its capacity to add volume to my lashes and not make a mess!</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with this recent purchase as I wasted $30.00 for what seemed to be old mascaras.</li>
            <li> I have had similar experiences with much less expensive mascara.</li>
            <li> After buying Dior and having to throw it out it was terrible, so luckily I tried this one around same time.</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time finding a mascara that doesn&#x27;t weigh my eyelashes down.</li>
            <li> I think it sucks and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> when I use this mascara, it just makes me look like I have maybe a dozen thin long lashes on each side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moreover, if you hate every mascara you&#x27;ve ever tried and are still on that lifelong quest for something that gets your makeup through the day, I would definitely recommend giving the It&#x27;s So Big Mascara</li>
            <li> I have long, thin eyelases.</li>
            <li> so it adds length while making the base of my lashes look SO full.</li>
            <li> It also gets and thick and dark as you want it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s takes at least a day for the product to begin to break down, and it will flake, not smear or run when it does.  </li>
            <li> No more black marks!  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t cause black smudges....</li>
            <li> Not only does it do a poor job separating lashes, but it also leaves a hard, flaky bit at the tips of your lashes.</li>
            <li> Usually in order to get volume the mascara ends up smudged, flaking, or making my eyelashes stiff and feeling like jabbing pine needles into my lower eye lid when I blink.  </li>
            <li> The last SEVERAL have been bad-</li>
            <li> The narrow part being in the middle is mostly useless to me, esp when I try to rock the brush at the root of my lashes, the narrow part won&#x27;t reach the roots well, and the thick ends end up getting mascara all over my eyelids while I&#x27;m trying to get that narrow part to rock at the root.  </li>
            <li> This not only isn&#x27;t worth the outrageous price of $20</li>
            <li> This mascara was very sticky, stringy, and almost impossible to apply neatly.</li>
            <li> Ill go back to my mac mascara, its a few dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li> I do have to do 3 coats at least, but that is typical for me.  </li>
            <li> I am a 52 year old woman who had given up using mascara because I was tired of raccoon eyes, tired of itchy eyes and so on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like little chunks fall off in my eyeball!</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a little cheaper, but you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Little did I know, this is a tubing formula!</li>
            <li> and then everything is a thick, sticky mess.  </li>
            <li> but this mascara was very dried out and was not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> A little hard to remove</li>
            <li> Seems a little hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Very little clumping.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smear, very little clumping.</li>
            <li> If I leave it on over night I wake up with very little flakes under my eyes.</li>
            <li> After that, did very little.</li>
            <li> I usually buy my mascara at the grocery store</li>
            <li> I received a small sample of this mascara in one of my monthly beauty subscription box</li>
            <li> I have used mascaras that look fuller and/or thicker, but usually at the cost of clumping or smearing.</li>
            <li> The two i have used in the past were $5 and $10</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one for small brushes, and this one is fairly small</li>
            <li> I usually use Lancôme Definicils or Maybelline Falsies.</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water like some mascaras have in the past.</li>
            <li> I work at a busy club and at 4am when ive been running around like crazy all night</li>
            <li> This mascara was no better than any drug store mascara.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to wear waterproof mascara because #1, my eyes water a lot, #2</li>
            <li> Anyone who&#x27;s ever done that knows what an issue fogging can be, and so mascara usually has to be waterproof or</li>
            <li> I also usually use waterproof versions to avoid flaking and smudging.</li>
            <li> I must say, not only is it mediocre, it is high-priced, considering the lackluster way it performs.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t go on and on about makeup products but this one deserves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where all of the five star reviews are coming from.</li>
            <li> I usually use mascaras with a price point of $30</li>
            <li> No more raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> I usually use crinique mascsra.</li>
            <li> I was unfortunately blessed with short stubby eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money and i&#x27;m bummed!</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll purchase again for the price.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m a woman past menopause</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake which has been a problem in the past.</li>
            <li> volumizes, applies with ease, stays put, and removes without excessive effort.</li>
            <li> It does define each lash and doesn&#x27;t clump like volumizing mascaras usually do.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is just a fluke or others have had this problem.</li>
            <li> when I unscrew the wand from the tube, the small piece that should be attached to the tube to pull of excess mascara from the brush, comes off with the wand.</li>
            <li> Now because it is past the return date I am told I cannot return it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> Have tried all kinds in the past from drugstore to Chanel and Dior.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no better than the grocery store mascara.</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is difficult to get off...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet</li>
            <li> I have small eyelashes and this mascara</li>
            <li> I usually wash my face every night but every once in a while I&#x27;ll forget and</li>
            <li> I usually put on 2-3 coats</li>
            <li> I am not able to evaluate this because there must be some ingredient that I am allergic to.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to perform the same.</li>
            <li> NO MORE.  </li>
            <li> NO MORE FLAKES.  </li>
            <li> No more raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> The brush is weirdly beveled in the middle.  </li>
            <li> While this one doesn&#x27;t advertise as &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;, it lasts through crying and sweating like a dream!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was more than disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use usually lengthens them and this one didn&#x27;t seem to do that.</li>
            <li> No more shopping around...</li>
            <li> It also stays put, in the past so often I find the mascara under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Definitely too expensive.</li>
            <li> I use it for work mostly when I don&#x27;t want or need outrageous lashes.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this mascara, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Read the small print regarding the # of coats needed to volumize.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure that for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what they hype was all about.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the Falsies one by Maybelline at the grocery store .</li>
            <li> The brush does not help to separate them, it usually contributes to the problem.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy  optic/ maybeline&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I do not love the flakes.</li>
            <li> and I usually have to wear waterproof.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it stays on in the pool or ocean...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write a review</li>
            <li> and I also have a difficult time getting it to stay on for the entire day.  </li>
            <li> No more smears and bits of mascara on my face by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product was goopy, clumpy and did not remove without several cotton pads.</li>
            <li> Not sure that I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t take my make up off at night, so it needs to come off in the shower</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> so it looks like I have 5 lashes, this one sadly did the same thing.</li>
            <li> Im not sure</li>
            <li> not sure about all the 5 star reviews?  </li>
            <li> I usually have to buy products that are hypoallergenic</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush head is fluffy, hourglass shaped....love it!  </li>
            <li> and I am not touching my skin with it</li>
            <li> No more racoon eyes.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the wand changed or what.</li>
            <li> I usually use L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous mascara.</li>
            <li> Goes in slick and fans out my lashes without clumps.</li>
            <li> and I usually stretch it out to 12.</li>
            <li> I usually go into Sephora and see what they have to offer.</li>
            <li> I felt like I had to scrub harshly against my eyes and the delicate skin around it.</li>
            <li> The shape of the wand made applying the mascara difficult and messy-application was very uneven and needed to apply several coats to look like I even had mascara on.</li>
            <li> I always give mascara several weeks because I feel like they dry out a bit and get easier to apply but after a couple of months, I&#x27;m still frustrated by this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on nicely, no clumps and very black.</li>
            <li> , however I have had some lashes fall (very few).  </li>
            <li> Big Vol well the prouduct was very wet and clumped up the lashes ,,big waste of a lot of money for this very disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the positive reviews on Amazon and was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> So, seeing that I&#x27;m sooooo addicted to Amazon, I researched for other mascaras and stumbled upon \\&quot;its so big\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> So I went a little crazy last week and ordered 3 mascaras.</li>
            <li> Like one of the other reviews talked about, I too thought that they could pass for false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This is a high maintenance mascara and not one that works for everyday wear. :(</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried, even worse than the cheapest department store brands.</li>
            <li> I am not very good at cleaning all of my mascara off...</li>
            <li> It comes off in clumps and doesn&#x27;t mess up your wash cloth!!</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but it lasts me for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have average lashes and was looking for something cheaper than false lashes and the likes.  </li>
            <li> It gives me long lashes without looking fake and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who is sick to deal of trying &amp;#34;the</li>
            <li> Yes, it stays put, but it makes your eyelashes very stiff -</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product but admit that I&#x27;m disappointed in it!</li>
            <li> Sloppy, gloppy and not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this product does that, but I will say that it is incredibly dry &amp; difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> my daughter hated this stuff - said it was super runny and went everywhere</li>
            <li> As a professional salsa dancer, it&#x27;s been impossible for me to find mascara that doesn&#x27;t sweat off, smear, or flake.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes look long and not too thick (which was a problem with even expensive brands).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this mascara did not live up to</li>
            <li> Yes, the formula looks a little weird when the wand comes out of the tube, like black lava or something.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are long and curled but very thin and blond.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product, particularly in light of the name, which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> I apply it, it doesn&#x27;t thicken much, and when I layer, it thickens the base, but the tips just stick together, and the effect just makes my lashes look weird, not lush.  </li>
            <li> The bad thing about my current mascara was the black that showed up under my eyes about an hour after applying.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because of the reviews but was still skeptical because like I said before I have never, EVER found a mascara that stayed on me as long as this one does!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a Tammy Faye type, so when I say I can hardly notice it, trust me, it&#x27;s hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> Hard.  </li>
            <li> It is even hard to get off with my makeup remover and flakes all over instead of smears off.  </li>
            <li> Mascara is a tricky product - it&#x27;s so hard to find one that has all the features you&#x27;d want.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to believe that I can now say I&#x27;ve found it.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s too hard to take off.</li>
            <li> I used to use Fairy Drops, but they became hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product also can make your eye lashes stick together and when they do its hard to take them apart..</li>
            <li> I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t give me racoon eyes but also came off without needing to rub too hard at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> My mascara had hardly anything in it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it hard to wash off at all like</li>
            <li> I always have a hard time finding mascara.</li>
            <li> I just think my eyelashes are too scrawny and hard to keep curled even though I use an eyelash primer before the mascara.  </li>
            <li> It clumps and is hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> Hard to remove.&lt;br</li>
            <li> are that it does tend to stick my lashes together and its hard to separate them after they&#x27;re stuck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard on my mascara-</li>
            <li> It comes off in pieces (hard to explain.)  </li>
            <li> It is really hard to get off though.  </li>
            <li> I do have fine lashes, so thickening without clumping is hard to find and this mascara is probably one of the worst I have tried.</li>
            <li> I think the brush was a little thin for me.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend you try this out, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> : Clumpy after 5 uses, the brush doesn&#x27;t allow the product to flow to the ends to get at the ends of your lashes, it&#x27;s gloppy and thick and hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> Rather awkward to apply upper and lower lashes separately.  </li>
            <li> still looked thin for such an expensive mascara</li>
            <li> Try the sample at least, before you buy.</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least 3 tubes of this mascara</li>
            <li> at least not for $20.</li>
            <li> I forgot and inspected my eyes in the late evening.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointing in the look I got out of this as well as the finish, its constantly smudging and flaking.</li>
            <li> This mascara adds enough volume without looking chunky and artificial.</li>
            <li> I have been for at least 15 years.</li>
            <li> It comes off in clumps, but at least it doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34; while you have it on.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You will have to put on at least 5 layers of this to notice anything.</li>
            <li> When you charge $20 for a mascara, I would at least expect it to arrive intact.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am bringing this in to play is: I wear a protective mask, I sweat like crazy its over 120 degrees some days, and the sand here is like getting microdermabration.</li>
            <li> but, oh well - at least it stays on.</li>
            <li> I order things on amazon as a Prime member at least a couple times per week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The thickening can be achieved by applying at least 2 coats of the mascara.</li>
            <li> If I have time for nothing else, I will at least have mascara on.</li>
            <li> I ordered it on a late Friday night (11P)  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s why I gave it at least 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> But, I have to put on t least 3 coats to get the volume I need.  </li>
            <li> I have to go over my lashes at least 4 or 5 times.  </li>
            <li> Just sucks.</li>
            <li> at least until I tried out this one.</li>
            <li> I almost feel as though possibly the cold weather was the culprit.</li>
            <li> I find that I am standing at my mirror for at least 15 minutes longer than I used to,  just applying this product.</li>
            <li> But i have been using it every day lately</li>
            <li> This product was  a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I would expect that for what is advertised, it would at least be buildable, but it was not.  </li>
            <li> Others have commented negatively on the wand</li>
            <li> at least mine, so that value is never a focus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s water resistant (at least it didn&#x27;t smear when I cried)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look like thick spider legs like some mascaras do.  </li>
            <li> The lashes do not get thick and clumpy like mascara&#x27;s that advertise volume do at least on me</li>
            <li> Dries slowly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick, so it doesn&#x27;t clump on your lashes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too heavy and my eyelashes too thin.</li>
            <li> Which forced me to find a replacement...</li>
            <li> It takes about 3 coats to get it thick.</li>
            <li> I wish it can make it thick also</li>
            <li> Mott&#x27;s mascara makes them thick and luscious ...</li>
            <li> and it goes on thickly without having to have to put on coat after coat to thicken my lashes.</li>
            <li> but I do have thick eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I wear contacts and have always had trouble with mascara irritating my eyes and smudging onto my face.  </li>
            <li> I have heavy lashes and it seemed to apply to thinly.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t go on thick</li>
            <li> so, I suppose I like a thick, sturdy formula-- non-runny.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are pale and rather thin.</li>
            <li> I had been disappointed with every mascara purchase I had made and was searching for something new.</li>
            <li> After using this a couple of days I went and threw out all the other mascaras I owned so that I would not accidentally use the wrong one.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that is makes my eyes sting a little. :(</li>
            <li> - I even tried waterproof to see if it would work and still everyday smudges!!</li>
            <li> I usually prefer a thicker brush, but this one worked well to achieve the lengthy lashes look!</li>
            <li> Was not sure if I should believe what others had said but decide to give this mascara a go!  </li>
            <li> but that does mean that it stays put all day.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable mascara!</li>
            <li> -- I mean, it is called</li>
            <li> I mean ALWAYS, had a problem with using mascara on them as it just seemed to smudge and flake off.  </li>
            <li> Look no more!</li>
            <li> I mean movie and wedding tears, not a torrential downpour</li>
            <li> No more smudging even after taking a nap with it on!</li>
            <li> So my original review of this product was that it was terrible.</li>
            <li> 20$ on this was a waste!!</li>
            <li> Never, and I mean never any flaking or smudging</li>
            <li> I mean I have NONE.</li>
            <li> I mean my eyelids were BALD up until now.</li>
            <li> I mean it.</li>
            <li> never knew my eyelashes could get so long and thick!!!</li>
            <li> My skin is very delicate and I am concerned about excessive pulling on the eye area that it takes to get this stuff off your lashes.</li>
            <li> I hate the new mascaras that make your lashes look way too thick.</li>
            <li> I mean seriously stays on.</li>
            <li> My eyes are very small</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the item was not worth the 20$ for me.</li>
            <li> Buy it, I would be totally surprised if you are disappointed by this mascara.</li>
            <li> and I have yet to have black eyes!!!</li>
            <li> —it&#x27;s unlikely to let you down.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously all day add though it had just been applied!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick with my Illegal Lengths mascara for half the price.</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally serious - NO</li>
            <li> Yes, it stays on ridiculously well (too well in my opinion.)</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t look ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It adds a subtle drama with fullness and length to my lashes that I haven&#x27;t had since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> This mascara is almost impossible to clump - even if reapplied at a later time over existing.  </li>
            <li> This works as well as Dior&#x27;s mascara and is much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> No exceptional volume as the name indicates.</li>
            <li> If I can find a less expensive alternative</li>
            <li> I have sad, short, thin lashes (to match my hair!)</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> I seriously have tried them all.</li>
            <li> I mean, I was jonesing hard for the stuff but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere!</li>
            <li> Normally I end up with some black specs below my eyes that end up smearing and looking like bags (awful!)</li>
            <li> I went through several other brands and hated each one.</li>
            <li> but it looked like a clumpy mess!!!</li>
            <li> A little difficult to remove</li>
            <li> The trade off to this is that it&#x27;s a little difficult to get off (sort of stringy) unless you use eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> A little bit difficult to get off</li>
            <li> The brush is a little weird shape but still workable.</li>
            <li> it do a poor job separating lashes, but it also leaves a hard, flaky bit at the tips of your lashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to post the specifics as I&#x27;m worried others might take advantage and lie and say they got a bad product just to get the same treatment.</li>
            <li> I hated it so much I cannot use it ,</li>
            <li> It did not volumize my lashes, it barely lengthened them whatsoever, and I am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not a good formula.</li>
            <li> This product is no good.</li>
            <li> found that when I tried to apply another coat, it then started to clump the lashes together and this was not a good look</li>
            <li> Anyway, because of this awkward design, I find myself using the wide end</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed; flakes after a few hours of wear and isn&#x27;t truly waterproof.</li>
            <li> But the mascara burns my eyes and not a good choice if u have contacts.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found this mascara clumpy and heavy.</li>
            <li> Not too thick and not too thin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gunky and no better than the least expensive mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like thin nor thick lashes just noticeable ones.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in a very thin coating on already fine lashes.  </li>
            <li> Like other unhappy customers, my lashes looked like insect legs.  </li>
            <li> I bought a new tube of my usual and was still very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so hard to get the look I want!  </li>
            <li> Its so hard!</li>
            <li> smudge-proof mascaras can be really hard to get off, but when I wash my face at night, the wash cloth takes off all of this mascara!</li>
            <li> My sad, pathetic lashes look fabulous and amazeballs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money over the years on expensive department store mascara and not really impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> My lashes didn&#x27;t appear thick or dramatic.</li>
            <li> It seriously looks like I am wearing false eye lashes.  </li>
            <li> Not only does that look rather ugly, it also makes urges even worse.</li>
            <li> Not only does that look rather ugly, it also makes urges even worse.</li>
            <li> Also not nearly as voluminous as Bad Gal mascara.</li>
            <li> When my dumb boyfriend came into the guest room in the morning to apologize, I could not even rub the guilt in with my raccoon-stained eyes....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the big name brands and was constantly disappointed by mid-day flakes and/or clumps.  </li>
            <li> I consider it expensive, and I&#x27;m not sure if I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was a tiny bit disappointed.  </li>
            <li> U pdate: they must have transferred manufacturing to China or wherever it was being manufactured just isnt doing the same QC. :(</li>
            <li> I have relatively weak eye lash follicles</li>
            <li> I will start off my saying I am a mascara fanatic!</li>
            <li> I just feel guilty spending $25+ on a small bottle of makeup.</li>
            <li> It even got the tiny hairs and POW crazy lashes!</li>
            <li> Leaves my lashes clumpy and short. :(</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an odor and the formula looks thick!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my lashes look thick!</li>
            <li> At the firts time I felt a little disappointed,  I thought that was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The product is very thin, almost like ink, and the applicator brush is too small.</li>
            <li> Not too thin or thick, genius applicator brush!</li>
            <li> I had to constantly check myself in the mirrow for those horrible black marks.  </li>
            <li> Mascara is a tough thing for me since I work in engineering and sometimes have to deal with all kinds of conditions.  </li>
            <li> Lashes look very thick but not clumpy.</li>
            <li> I was considering lash extensions before I found this product but now feel it&#x27;s unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I have thin eyelashes</li>
            <li> I bought this product after searching everywhere for something that would work for my thin lashes after reading some of the reviews I thought this is the one and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it however</li>
            <li> Not really happy about this mascara .</li>
            <li> I have thin lashes</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;This makes them look really thin and stringy and spaced out</li>
            <li> I have a lot of eye lashes but thin eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Goes on thin</li>
            <li> The coverage can be thin or thicker, depending on preference, and it doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hate it enough to return but won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> It goes on thinly which means that</li>
            <li> It goes on thin and does need a couple of coats to get the look I want.</li>
            <li> Lots of volume and definition without looking clumpy or smearing and the thin wand can get to every lash.</li>
            <li> I have thin and sparse lashes and  looking for volume.</li>
            <li> Exhausted from her complaining, I bought her this</li>
            <li> The worst part is that even after I curl my eye lashes once I apply the mascara they get all bent out of shape and straight and clumpy.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara is a game changer.  </li>
            <li> I confess, I was addicted to Lancome mascara, but was disheartened when they discontinued their Flextencils mascara...</li>
            <li> It spaces out your eyelashes leaving your eyelashes looking thin and scanty...</li>
            <li> On the days I misplace my tube of &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; and use something else (like &amp;#34;Loreal Voluminous&amp;#34; also highly-rated), I&#x27;m always annoyed when washing my face at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I am a mascara junkie because I have thin sparse lashes.</li>
            <li> I have really thin eyelashes</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the secret ingredient</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not GREAT.</li>
            <li> but they are thin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused as to what is &amp;#34;so big&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Got so tired of raccoon smudges from &amp;#34;smudge proof&amp;#34; mascaras.</li>
            <li> The formula seems thin, doesn&#x27;t thicken my lashes like it claims</li>
            <li> I also swept this over the ends of false lashes, giving it a fuller look without the heaviness.</li>
            <li> Thin thin thin and no length</li>
            <li> If you like the false eyelash look, then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> when I have two coats on, they almost look false.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like I have false lashes, just enhances what I already have.  </li>
            <li> I want to look like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes.</li>
            <li> Before using this proruct I was going to get false eyelashes but not anymore.</li>
            <li> After use, a friend asked me if I was wearing false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> This one reminded me of when your mascara is running out and your lashes start to clump - except this was a new bottle - very disappointed-  </li>
            <li> Not very waterproof  :(</li>
            <li> Now it doesn&#x27;t matter how careful I am it clumps and sticks and looks like Tammy Faye baker. :(</li>
            <li> It does what it promises to do: voluminizes my eyelashes beautifully, no crumps, doesn&#x27;t smear through the day, and even gives some length.</li>
            <li> I have tried maybelline (all), cover girl (all), Dior, Lancôme, benefit bad gal, rimmel, tarte, - these all ended up flaky or caused black under eye smudges by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Dramatic without the clumps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as dramatic as some others though.</li>
            <li> If you want a dramatic look, keep going!&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re going for truly dramatic lashes, you might need to keep layering it on.</li>
            <li> I use this one on days where I don&#x27;t feel the need to go so dramatic on my lashes</li>
            <li> I did not see any dramatic results though.</li>
            <li> , it will give you dramatic lashes.</li>
            <li> I can add a touch of additional mascara to my eyelashes for a dramatic effect without worrying about smudging areas</li>
            <li> Dramatic and no flaking.</li>
            <li> but (for me) not for the dramatic effect.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not nearly meet the rave reviews in my opinion, not lengthening, not for curl, not for volume, ; ( disappointed, I&#x27;ll stick to my Laura mercier, or perfekt..</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;d say it doesn&#x27;t show near as much, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I do not like writing negative reviews unless a product is stone cold horrible and a complete rip-off.  </li>
            <li> , I spent $20 and I am very unhappy.</li>
            <li> The mascara substance is very thin - goes on thin, and stays thin instead of building.  </li>
            <li> Horrible clumps right away my lashes weren&#x27;t long at all worst</li>
            <li> and I was afraid that this would make my lashes too thick</li>
            <li> then another issue I&#x27;ve always had with mascara has been that it always seems to leave a nasty black racoon stain under my eyes, and the effort it takes to get it off makes me wonder if I&#x27;m not causing some serious aging damage to my delicate under-eye area every time I remove my mascara stains.</li>
            <li> If I have been crying, rubbing my eyes, or in a steam room, it will just flake off and not leave a horrible mess.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, thinking it would be no better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried, but I was proven wrong.</li>
            <li> Expensive and not as dramatic as I would have</li>
            <li> This is the worst in my opinion it clumps up like no other I have ever used .</li>
            <li> HATE having black residue under my eyes...</li>
            <li> Though also terrible because it takes me an extra 5 minutes to get it all off, and half of the time I wake up still having some at the base of my lashes.</li>
            <li> The mascara was gloppy, hard to apply, flaked off by the end of the day, and my eye lids were burning badly.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m bad and will sleep in my makeup if I have a late night out.</li>
            <li> which I really hate to waste money.</li>
            <li> I cannot afford expensive mascara</li>
            <li> I have admittedly sparse lashes, and I don&#x27;t use fake lashes or anything, so</li>
            <li> Nor is it difficult to remove while I am washing my face.</li>
            <li> I applied 4 coats but they still looked faint and sparse.</li>
            <li> not that there is anything wrong with that.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I am doing something wrong , no volum</li>
            <li> definitely one of the worst mascaras I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all and would never spend the $20 again on this product.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> This mascara gives me the spider leg lashes without fail.</li>
            <li> This mascara was WAY too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have always been wary of splurging on mascara.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately mascara is not one of them.</li>
            <li> and I have tried every expensive brand sold in department stores.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> ill post an update at the end of the day as to which flaked or whatnot,</li>
            <li> It works like an expensive mascara without going into a department store to buy it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy how often I&#x27;m asked if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes, and I get to say &amp;</li>
            <li> I will not be reordering this item, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Found out about it through a subscription makeup service and have been obsessed ever since.</li>
            <li> Not really impressed with this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I have been asked whether or not I got extensions or if I am wearing fake lashes.</li>
            <li> Horrible and three to four times the regular price.</li>
            <li> I was rather obsessed with mascaras until I found this one, my holy grail.</li>
            <li> Don’t get me wrong</li>
            <li> it was difficult to get it all off</li>
            <li> But the cost for one tube is so expensive</li>
            <li> but it is no better than some I have purchased from the pharmacy :(</li>
            <li> and it runs all over, giving me dreaded raccoon eyes and random mascara spots.</li>
            <li> This mascara does not help with volumizing or extending lashes, it makes eyelashes clumpy and the brush is not great at all!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of mascaras, ranging from lower prices to extremely expensive, but none have done the job</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and have always had issues with mascara flaking into my eyes and irritating, not anymore!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible and is not making my lashes any bigger.</li>
            <li> Now I question amazon&#x27;s reviews as they are quite wrong in this case.</li>
            <li> It comes off in a weird chunk like layer but you will not look like a raccoon.</li>
            <li> and they all had issues - clumping, raccoon-eyes, difficult to remove, flaking, length but no volume, spider-eyes, on and on.  </li>
            <li> So, I wanted to wait a couple of weeks of using this product to find something wrong with it and give it a thorough review, but there is nothing about this product I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I tried fake lashes that were applied at a salon....hated &#x27;em.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally skeptical of mascaras.</li>
            <li> Not impressed</li>
            <li> The picture on the side of the box shows a women&#x27;s lashes with 2 coats versus 10 coats - I&#x27;m sorry, but I am not putting 10 coats of mascara on my eyelashes to get the fullness I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately based on the results I received from use</li>
            <li> thought I am seriously ill after searching and asking friends ..</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just feel I&#x27;m wasting expensive product each time.</li>
            <li> Also, the brush is just weird.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I am a 2 coat girl and think mascaras should work well within that parameter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive dept store brands as well as cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> The formula makes my eyelashes flutter with fullness without clumping, drying or looking fake.</li>
            <li> I have searched and searched for a mascara that would not smudge within an hour or so of applying it and thought that it didn&#x27;t exist, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look fake.</li>
            <li> Either I got a defective one, or my eyelashes are just weird.</li>
            <li> It was a weird consistency, the product just rubbed off my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I despise mascara that smudges and is difficult to remove, It&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this mascara.</li>
            <li> The mascara I received was on the clumpy side and difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to report, this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to say I didn&#x27;t like this mascara at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THERE IS NO IMPRESSIVE CHANGE IN VOLUME.THERE</li>
            <li> but the price makes it difficult to justify another purchase.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed at all.....</li>
            <li> Either the formula was wrong for me or the brush was difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Because of that, I almost always use shorter fake lashes to make it look like I have anything.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> it is not perfect as the rave reviews suggested to me.</li>
            <li> Have used mascara for years--cheap and expensive.  </li>
            <li> Not the worst mascara I&#x27;ve used but certainly not a great as I&#x27;d expected</li>
            <li> Not impressed for the price.</li>
            <li> My sister even has asked me if I am wearing false eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad bottle,  but I seriously can&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin and goes sticky,  so the lashes stick together</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a very thin mascara and does not thicken the lashes or add any volume as advertized, although some may prefer this&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its very thin stuff</li>
            <li> I have to start by saying that I have very thin and sparse eyelashes, but I don&#x27;t get what all the hype is about.</li>
            <li> My lashes are very thin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because it&#x27;s so hard to find a high-quality, cruelty-free mascara.</li>
            <li> Had stopped using mascara for a while because I hated the dark smudges.</li>
            <li> This mascara was very sloppy and did not add volume at all.</li>
            <li> It does the thing I hate for mascaras to do which is to group my eyelashes together, so that it looks like I have about 40 really really thick spiky eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to purchase this product for the price but at the time I felt desperate.</li>
            <li> It is awkward and difficult to use for application.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the mascara was still disappointing.  </li>
            <li> start at the base of you lashes, press wand into them, and slowly pull up.  </li>
            <li> It was clumpy and hard to get off!!!</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look so fat and thick!!!</li>
            <li> yes I figured maybe I was just getting the random bad tube.</li>
            <li> Not only is the product itself clumpy and annoying but the brush itself is the worst!  </li>
            <li> It flakes like crazy.</li>
            <li> just drives me crazy</li>
            <li> I use Pond&#x27;s cold cream to remove eye makeup, and it works well with the</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to layer it on.</li>
            <li> disappointing.</li>
            <li> Really awkward and given the struggle I have with this design</li>
            <li> I figured it would be disappointing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the mythical creature I have been searching so desperately for-</li>
            <li> This was so disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is a horrible, horrible disorder for a girl to have....especially in high school and college!</li>
            <li> Crazy.</li>
            <li> and like I said, the volume is tasteful and buildable, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it added some crazy amount of volume-----BUT, considering all I went through with it</li>
            <li> It gives me length and thickens my lashes without looking fake!  </li>
            <li> Sorry Elizabeth Mott!</li>
            <li> Terrible waste of money!</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ve all failed to deliver, except this one!).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to stick with Loreal Voluminous, you can&#x27;t go wrong with it!</li>
            <li> In the past 9 months, I have started wearing mascara again, and it has been mostly horrible.</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> but this is my unpleasant experience with &amp;#34;it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Very difficult to remove product from lashes.</li>
            <li> Waterproof stuff can flake, it can be impossible to take off.</li>
            <li> ALL the mascara comes out and is impossible to use.</li>
            <li> alas I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bad Gal lash 4E</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> bad:</li>
            <li> Too bad Sephora doesnt sell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been using Benefit Bad Gal forever and bought this on a whim.</li>
            <li> I received a bad bottle and didn&#x27;t know it...</li>
            <li> I wrote about and seller read the review and informed me that i must have a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think it is a bad mascara</li>
            <li> It clumps my eyelashes together so badly that I have had to wash it off immediately each time I&#x27;ve given it a try.</li>
            <li> Wand is terrible; mascara thin yet globby.  </li>
            <li> Not smudgy, but very dramatic!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed 💁</li>
            <li> , I am disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t hold as well as this one does.</li>
            <li> , will not buy again :-(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> It bled all over my cheeks and made my eyes burn like crazy the rest of the night!</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed I didn&#x27;t see any difference on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Does sometimes clump though :(  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara based on the reviews and I am maybe slightly disappointed.</li>

            <li> I was so disappointed when I used this mascara ..</li>
            <li> very disappointing and waisted money.</li>
            <li> But, $35.00 for mascara is just stupid.</li>
            <li> Hate to not give 5 stars but having to buy a primer to get my bombshell lashes put a damper on my experience with this product.</li>
            <li> I start at base and jiggle the wand until it  covers lashes.</li>
            <li> Hate it, Hate it</li>
            <li> This one requires even pressure from the  base of the lash all the way to the tip and needs about three coats</li>
            <li> it is crap..</li>
            <li> I took another reviewer&#x27;s recommendation and purchased the Shisheido eyelash base for additional oomf.</li>
            <li> I will rank them, in order, in case</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After going through several mascara&#x27;s that kept flaking on my skin throughout the day, I am so happy to have found this one! There is no flaking or clumping and it makes my eyelashes look super long!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this mascara in my beauty box 5 and I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;Not clumpy but lengthening and volumizing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but towards the later part of my work day it starts to irritate my eyes a bit. It&#x27;s like little chunks fall off in my eyeball!</li>
            <li> I have ordered Elizabeth. Mott mascara four times now and it is truely amaziing. Wears really well and my lashes look beautiful. Mary Margueritei.     As of June 2 2015 I continue to order Elizabeth Mott mascara.  Its the best. Truely!  Mary M.</li>
            <li> Heard good great things about this mascara but found it to be less than impressive  for the price...  Going to stick to L&#x27;Oréal telescopic mascara,  way better and cheaper.  This product is about the same as buying a $5 maybelline</li>
            <li> Big mascara - which comes off so easy with just face soap and a washcloth in threadlike pieces so no smudging, no dark circles, no residue. It wears well too. I went from taking mascara breaks to can&#x27;t-leave-home-without-it because of the no smudge/no residue benefits</li>
            <li> All the other 5 star reviewers are right:  this really is the perfect mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No smudging, no clumping, easy to apply, easy to remove (I use Almay water-based eye makeup remover), very little of it makes your lashes long and lush, so it goes a long way, and the ONLY mascara my super-sensitive eyes can wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the counter, store-bought mascaras all make my eyes watery and irritated, and they have chemical odors as soon as I pull the wand out.  That is not the case with this wonderful mascara.  It is pricey, but it is well worth the money, trust me (and I&#x27;m cheap).  I will buy only this mascara from now on.</li>
            <li> Lovely mascara. Definately lengthens and volumizes your lashes. Love this product.</li>
            <li> This mascara is aweful! Not only is the product itself clumpy and annoying but the brush itself is the worst!  I hated it so much I cannot use it , which I really hate to waste money.</li>
            <li> Amazing Long Lush clump free lashes. This is the best mascara I have ever used. It exceeded my expectations. My search is over for the best mascara.</li>
            <li> Washes off so easily!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many mascaras from expensive department store brands to 4.00 drug store brands. Maybelline great lash was my favorite for years until recently. It seems that the formula has changed because I started experiencing flaking and smudges which never happened before. This mascara lasted all 14 hours of my workday and I am very active. It looked as good at 8pm as it did at 5am when I applied it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine lashes this product didn&#x27;t over do it just made my lashes look perfect. The product wasn&#x27;t clumpy and lasted all day, yet easy to remove</li>
            <li> Best Mascara! Better than Chanel and Lancome!&lt;br /&gt;Get it !!!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on Amazon before purchasing the mascara and decided to give it a try. I used everything from Dior to Maybelline. It&#x27;s one of the best. It applies very well and makes the eyelashes look amazing. It doesn&#x27;t clump at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product and would highly recommend it. It&#x27;s a bit on the pricier side but a great investment.</li>
            <li> A little hard to remove but it&#x27;s very light and makes my eyelashes SO BIG!</li>
            <li> very nice. not thick or clumpy.</li>
            <li> Wonderful....does not flake/smudge...&lt;br /&gt;Washes off easily</li>
            <li> This was definitely not worth the money. I usually buy my mascara at the grocery store and I thought I&#x27;d splurge on a little bit more high end mascara. The price ($20) and the great reviews made me think the quality of this would be good but it was NOT. Probably the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!  As I read all the other reviews I realized I just needed to give it a try and I concur with all. This mascara does not flake, wear off, clump, or become stiff or sticky. It stays on all day looking as fresh as when it was applied. I also love love love the contour of the brush which is so helpful especially when applying to lower lashes. It is engeniously designed so that it doesn&#x27;t hit your face during application. Also, this product was delivered in one day, a bonus!  Thank you for such a great product. I will never change!</li>
            <li> Bought this because of all the positive reviews but it clumped after only a few weeks. Had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> The mascara is great. I just love it!!!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Applies evenly with no clumping.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of brands of mascara.  This is definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> GOOD FOR BOTTOM LASHES, BUT NOT REALLY THE TOP LASHES.  MAYBE A DIFFERENT BRUSH WOULD WORK.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It doesn&#x27;t flake, it doesn&#x27;t smudge and it comes off with just water. You can tell it comes off with just water because when you wake up the next morning there isn&#x27;t any smudging. I wear it almost every day because of its ease and its look. It makes my lashes longer and makes them a bit thicker. It makes me look so awake now! It doesn&#x27;t have an odor and the formula looks thick!</li>
            <li> This mascara is pretty good in some ways. It leaves your eyelashes curled. It seems to lengthen them. It stays on really really well -- through exercise, through sleep, through the whole day - no flaking or smudging. But it&#x27;s supposed to be volumizing mascara and it doesn&#x27;t really do that. It does the thing I hate for mascaras to do which is to group my eyelashes together, so that it looks like I have about 40 really really thick spiky eyelashes. It comes off easily with just normal washing with the face cleanser I use, but it comes off in curly long wormy things. That&#x27;s not really bad, more just interesting I guess. But I had to study those at first to make sure my actual eyelashes weren&#x27;t coming off. (They weren&#x27;t.) So, I&#x27;m going to keep trying to work with this and layer it with other mascaras to see if that helps, but I won&#x27;t buy it again. My favorite mascara in terms of how it looks on is Revlon Grow Luscious, but it flakes off like crazy, just as a side note. So my search for the perfect mascara continues...</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I bought a MAC mascara and loved how it looked but would always flake off and smear after a few hours.  This product looks and acts like the MAC mascara but doesn&#x27;t smear and flake and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference. :(</li>
            <li> This is the single greatest beauty find since botox.  I am a resident doctor in a busy county hospital.  This mascara lasted through a thirty hour call shift.  That means all night, in and out of medical masks, falling asleep at my desk, 5 cups of coffee and usually one tearful moment of exhaustion wondering why I didn&#x27;t pick a career that lets me sleep at night.  But when my attending shows up in the morning my lashes still look great, and no one can tell how rough my night was.  Then when I get home it comes off easy with a little warm water and some gentle rubbing.  My only complaint with this is it leaves black specks in my sink when I wash it off but really who cares.  I will be a faithful patron of this mascara for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  Never smears.</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my lashes look so long and lasts all day. It is also the easiest mascara ever to remove - a facial cleanser has been all that I need to take it off. With other mascaras, I have had to use lots of make-up remover after cleansing. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! It always makes me happy to find a new favorite brand. It actually makes me look like I have eyelashes AND not look like it&#x27;s just a bunch of caked on mascara. That&#x27;s a trick!!</li>
            <li> It goes on nice, no clumps. But I would not say its overly volumizing.  And my main thing to get use to is the way it washes off. Very odd. I will use it but I like my L&#x27;oreal volumizing better. And its says it curls.. yeah that&#x27;s not happening. Move on to something better.</li>
            <li> I run a lot and it doesn&#x27;t smudge one bit even with sweating so much.</li>
            <li> Not quite the advertised volume but amazing and doesn&#x27;t clump at all.</li>
            <li> Great mascara!  Short lashes become long and strong!</li>
            <li> Great mascara! Works really well but doesn&#x27;t clump</li>
            <li> Good product!  Great customer service.  I would recommend this mascara because it goes on easily and is a good volumizer.</li>
            <li> Love this product it does what it says it does I will buy again</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good mascara that is also cruelty free. Tried a number of products ranging in price. This is by far my fav and the only one I have purchased more than once. Wonder converge. Dramatic without the clumps.</li>
            <li> Sorry to report, this mascara is nothing special. The positive reviews seem to be exaggerations of its benefits. I wish it were great, but it simply does not add volume or depth to lashes in my opinion. Best of luck if you decide to try it for yourself!</li>
            <li> Not all that really. Just for every day not to impress!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best volumizing mascara I&#x27;ve ever used and the best part is that it&#x27;s cruelty-free.</li>
            <li> Great mascara!  It goes on easily and keeps the curl in my lashes all day.  I&#x27;ve tried millions of mascaras and have never had one that helps maintain a curl all day.  I will definitely be keeping this in my make up kit.   I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a mascara that I don&#x27;t have a make-up degree to apply it, that doesn&#x27;t leave me with clumps, a mess, or spider eyelashes. I have found it. I love it, goes on without clumps, I can run in the rain with it and not have a mess under my eyes (I live in Washington state-it rains), and it comes off easily with make up remover.  I have told friends,  they try it and they say they love it too.&lt;br /&gt;great product!</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara. It goes on easily and stays on pretty well, however is tends to flake a tad towards the end of the day. It&#x27;s also pretty easy to take off which is great. The one con for me is the clumping of my lashes. They tend to clump into three or four clumps of eyelashes and I&#x27;m not a fan. other than that, its been great!</li>
            <li> As a self-proclaimed mascara junkie who has tried countless products... this was one of the lower quality mascaras I&#x27;ve used. I actually have long and fairly thick eyelashes to begin with, and this mascara managed to make them look shorter and thinner. (How does that even happen?) I trashed it immediately. The only thing that kept this from being a one-star review: The ultra-black pigmentation was great...</li>
            <li> This Mascara is Amazing!!! I have tried all big name brands and by far this one exceeds them!!! I will purchase this mascara again!!! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> First mascara i could actually see on my barely visible lashes. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing long curled lashes and no smudges! I love this product! Definitely worth the cost!</li>
            <li> So clumpy... I&#x27;m honestly surprised by all of the good reviews on here. If I lightly rub my eye it leaves a lot of black &amp;#34;crumbs&amp;#34; on my cheeks.  Also, because it easily flakes off, I have to apply multiple times throughout the day...</li>
            <li> This is hands down the BEST mascara ever for NO smearing or racoon eyes!!!! I have tried them all from high end brands, Japanese versions, fiber ones and even spa developed ones and Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s &amp;#34;Its So Big&amp;#34; is the ONLY one that stays puts throughout the whole day and night!!! After trying you will not need to waste anymore money trying others...this one is IT!!! Enjoy :-)</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have very dry eyes which causes my eyes to water throughout the day and this is the only product that doesn&#x27;t make me look like I have black eyes. I love it. It&#x27;s really black and I already have really dark eyelashes but I feel like it makes my eyelashes look longer.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used! It goes on smooth. Separates lashes and adds length. I love this product. Received in two days with my prime membership.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. It provides full lashes without clumping. I have used more expensive mascara, but this one does the trick for less. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with eye lashes and have tried many different mascaras. This is by far my favorite. A little more expensive than I would prefer but worth the price. I get compliments frequently, many people asking if my eyelashes they are real or if I am even wearing mascara because they are not clumpy and look very natural. Does not smear when I swim or get caught in the rain and does not make my eyes gunky. I recommend to everyone and will continue to buy for myself.</li>
            <li> This mascara is my ultimate favorite! I understand why it&#x27;s a high end price because it&#x27;s an amazing product. I received a small sample of this mascara in one of my monthly beauty subscription box and I am so glad I did. It&#x27;s not labeled as waterproof but I have cried so many time while wearing this and it does not budge. I work long hours and it my lashes look great from beginning to end. I highly recommend this. You will not be disappointed 💁🏽</li>
            <li> Gave this a 4 star because it is a pretty decent mascara, though there are similar ones for a lesser cost, that is why I did not do a 5 star.  I love trying different mascara products, (I do revisit the pink original Maybeline often) but as for the ones that cost more than drugstore,prices  I think the Clinique High Impact Mascara works better, not sure if it is the brush.</li>
            <li> Really liked it, but after about six months, the inner ring came out and now I can&#x27;t use it. Bummer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Lancoln waterproof mascara. But, $35.00 for mascara is just stupid. I tried, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; mascara with doupts and was pleasantly surprised. It lasts all day and passed the gym test. I cross train pretty hard and after 2 hrs there were no black circles under my eyes. I think I&#x27;ve found the better mascara. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This mascara did none of what it claims to do. Application was uneven, clumpy in some areas (I think due to the hourglass shaped brush), and made my eyelashes sparse looking. I love my current mascara and this was recommended to me. I&#x27;ll stick with my current mascara. This product is a rip off.</li>
            <li> It does add little volume to my lashes but irritates me eyes so much they burn and become red.</li>
            <li> Best mascara. I will be ordering more. Doesn&#x27;t come off until you wash it off. No raccoon eyes and never flakes off.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The mascara exceeded my expectation. My daughter and I were looking for a mascara that can be used during sport activities. This mascara does not smudge and makes your eye lashes look BIG. Now we both use it and very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a 1-step, non-smearing, easy to apply mascara that would make a significant difference to my fine eyelashes.  I read a ton of Amazon reviews before I made my purchase and this one seemed to have the highest number, and most positive reviews, overall - and I can see why.  This product is great.  I apply 2 coats to my lashes in the morning and done - huge lashes for the rest of the day without any dark circles or flaking under my eyes.  I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> does not volumize like it says makes them long not thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked. Super sexy volume and length! Long lasting without any irritation, which is saying a lot since I have incredibly sensitive eyes and skin. Most mascaras irritate me like crazy after a full days wear, but not this beauty! I&#x27;ve never paid this much for a mascara before, but I am convinced I will never be able to go back to drug store brands. This is the one.</li>
            <li> Finally a mascara that does not leave black marks under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Its not that great of a mascara. I get much better results using cheaper department store mascara. for $20 I was expecting something of great quality and this one clumps a bunch.</li>
            <li> The best part about this mascara is that it does not smudge or flake.  I have had some mascaras that leave me looking like a raccoon by the end of the day.  I swam in the ocean and it stayed on.  That being said, I guess I need to find a good eye makeup remover that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> This was my first non-drug store mascara and I was leery of paying extra for something that wouldn&#x27;t necessarily work any better than my current mascara.  Suffice it to say that I am not disappointed in my purchase.  It is a bit more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; than I&#x27;m used to and the first application left me rather discouraged.  However, the subsequent tries have been much better!  My lashes don&#x27;t necessarily feel more voluminous, but they do appear much longer than usual and they actually curl.  The latter effect is huge because my lashes don&#x27;t curl. Ever.  Additionally, I do not end up with mascara under my eyes throughout the day.  No Rocky Balboa effect here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rather frugal (read: cheap) and am in no way let down by this mascara.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Have tried Better Than Sex and now this.  Tried this because it is cheaper.  Have to put on too many coats.  Very frustrating.  Better Than Sex wins.</li>
            <li> Perfect mascara! If you&#x27;re trying to have it all and fit in the gym at your lunch break this is the best mascara. It helps you not cry black tears and then go back to the office.</li>
            <li> The brush is great, but the mascara itself is very watery, and comes out onto the brush in huge globs. I&#x27;ve tried scraping it back into the container, but it&#x27;s a big sloppy mess. I hoped for something far better. Cannot use this. I think they need to thicken up their formula or create a container that pulls excess mascara back into the bottle so the wand is not globbed up.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed after reading such positive reviews...I don&#x27;t have very long lashes (I am half-asian) and had to put a couple coats for it to look like much. It separates nicely but for the price, I will stick to Chanel or Diorshow for more omph on my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reminded me of everyone raving about Maybelline Great Lash - which didn&#x27;t do anything for my lashes. The plus side is they do offer samples so you can try it before buying it (next time I will do that!).</li>
            <li> Worst &amp;#34;mascara&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever tried to try. Wasn&#x27;t volumizing at all.  Total fallacy.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used! I ordered it once and now won&#x27;t use any other mascara. It goes on so easy and smooth and really lengthens. It comes off in tubes. I absolutely love this mascara it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> The first mascara I have ever worn that didn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes after a day of wearing it. Love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. It goes on very clean and doesn&#x27;t smudge or settle in my fine lines.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this mascara in a gift box and liked it so much I ordered another tube from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It really does make your lashes look longer and thicker without clumping. I&#x27;ve tried most of the mascaras&lt;br /&gt;out there, high and low end and this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product, particularly in light of the name, which is why I bought it. It&#x27;s just another average quality mascara that does nothing to volumize the lashes.</li>
            <li> I adore this mascara. I used to buy a different type of mascara each time, searching for one that had everything I wanted. This gives me awesome, lasting volume. But my absolute favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t leave black streak marks down my face when it gets wet! Not even in the shower.</li>
            <li> This truly is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve used mascara religiously for twenty years and have tried numerous brands. This is the only mascara that really delivers. The lengthening ability is amazing and it goes on smoothly with literally no clumping whatsoever. I was considering lash extensions before I found this product but now feel it&#x27;s unnecessary. This mascara greatly enhances the length and volume of your natural lashes.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  It&#x27;s never clumpy.  Gives me jet black long full lashes and it lasts all day.  It stays where it should and isn&#x27;t easy to smudge, but at the end of the day it washes off easily.  It&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I do not like this mascara at all.  It&#x27;s a very wet formula and in general I dislike those.  I always give mascara several weeks because I feel like they dry out a bit and get easier to apply but after a couple of months, I&#x27;m still frustrated by this.  My lashes clump together so I have to keep combing them and they end up looking spikey and spidery.  It takes me forever to apply and that would be OK if I loved the results but I don&#x27;t.  Many drugstore-cost mascaras are better for me.  Bummer - I&#x27;m still searching for my favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> I am so very disappointed in this mascara. I had really high hopes after reading the other reviews, but it falls flat on all fronts. It leaves my lashes clumpy and not lengthened at all. This is my first time going away from drugstore mascara and I can&#x27;t believe that I wasted my money like this.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. It makes my lashes longer &amp; fuller. It&#x27;s not waterproof but it does take a little more than water to get it off. Doesn&#x27;t flake or leave black on your face. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> I received a free tube of this mascara in a gift box along with my People Plus magazine subscription.  While I&#x27;ve received some pretty cool stuff with these gift boxes, this is the only product I&#x27;ve ever sought out and purchased.  It not only looks great when you&#x27;re wearing it but it seems to have strengthened my natural eyelashes and made them a bit thicker.  I don&#x27;t often go without mascara as my lashes are short and thin but now you can actually see my lashes even when I don&#x27;t have on mascara.  I bought 4 tubes - 2 for home and 2 for travel (I travel weekly).</li>
            <li> A very nice mascara. Goes on well, no clumps. I have used mascaras that look fuller and/or thicker, but usually at the cost of clumping or smearing. This does neither. Looks good at the end of the day. And very easy to remove, unlike other non-smudging mascaras.</li>
            <li> The color is good, but it seems to clump up on my lashes.  To keep this from happening I usually have to wipe some of the paste back in the container. Too much comes out on the brush.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used! Doesn&#x27;t flake, doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my short, blonde eyelashes look thick and long.</li>
            <li> Reall great mascara! It goes on really nice and stays put a long time. I like the way it comes off when you wash your eyes. It comes off in clumps and doesn&#x27;t mess up your wash cloth!! Just wish it was a little cheaper, but you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome love it much better than the lancome product I used previously and half the price</li>
            <li> It is only &amp;#34;BIG volumizing&amp;#34; when you wear several coats, but is does not smear and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes. At last I have found a mascara that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Great mascara!  Super fine, defines lashes, not clumpy.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, does not clump &amp; stays looking nice all day long on.  Big help for my short, straight lashes!  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This mascara is great and seller is very professional</li>
            <li> After a long search for a mascara that could enhanced my thin, colorless lashes without clumping, flaking or smearing, I finally found &#x27;It&#x27;s So BIG&#x27; on AMAZON. This product is the best I&#x27;ve ever used! I can understand why it&#x27;s an AMAZON &amp;#34;BEST SELLER&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> This mascara was so good that I went to the lower reviews just to see how or why they gave it one or two stars. I have never in my life paid $20 for mascara. I cannot afford expensive mascara so i cannot tell you if any worked, I just know they are out there. The two i have used in the past were $5 and $10 and they were name brands. I never completely liked them but they were the best I could find until now. I&#x27;m 53 and have tiny thin straight lashes, always have. My main problem has always been specks of mascara ending up all around my eyes within an hour or two. I tried a sample of this stuff and I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Very clean, I could probably put on two coats to make it thicker, but i don&#x27;t want thick just long. The stuff has never come off, all day until i take a shower at night and then it slips off my lashes. No specks or flacks on my face, even during high activity during the entire day and evening. I think I get a very natural look with this mascara, like I was blessed with long beautiful lashes, not a makeup look. I have made it a point to tell family and friends about this, because that&#x27;s how much a love it.</li>
            <li> This mascara is anything but volumizing. My lashes don&#x27;t look any fuller than a standard drugstore mascara and it also doesn&#x27;t hold any curl AT ALL. That being said, this mascara does lengthen a lot and I like that it stays on all day but washes off easily with a make up remover or wash cloth. It&#x27;s alright, but I will not be purchasing it again since I also think it&#x27;s a bit pricey for the results it gives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not overwhelmed by this mascara. I have a tough time getting enough product on my lashes without it clumping - it dries really fast when it goes on. With the initial application, I can hardly see any mascara on, it doesn&#x27;t make much of an impact. I&#x27;m not a Tammy Faye type, so when I say I can hardly notice it, trust me, it&#x27;s hardly noticeable. So then I try to layer a bit more on to create some depth, and it just sticks and clumps on my lashes, making a bit of a mess. I like the wand, the shape is a good idea. But for this price, I figured the product would be easier to apply. It does stay on, it doesn&#x27;t smudge. Trying to take it off at night takes more than soap and water - you need product remover to get this mascara off. It turns into this rubbery type substance that flakes off if you try to take it off with face soap/water.</li>
            <li> Not very waterproof  :(</li>
            <li> I like this mascara. No raccoon eyes at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> How are there so many rave reviews for this mascara? I&#x27;m almost wondering if I was duped and not giving the real thing when I purchased this. Yes, there is definitely lengthening with this mascara, but &amp;#34;volumizing?&amp;#34; No. I have admittedly sparse lashes, and I don&#x27;t use fake lashes or anything, so when I use this mascara, it just makes me look like I have maybe a dozen thin long lashes on each side. That just doesn&#x27;t do enough for me! I have had better luck with other mascaras than with this one. I guess I&#x27;m going back to &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; by Benefit until I find one that works better.</li>
            <li> Great, great product!  After using this a couple of days I went and threw out all the other mascaras I owned so that I would not accidentally use the wrong one.  Does not smudge.  I almost stopped wearing mascara all together because I could not stand how black under my eyes would get by evening.  Now with this mascara.  I wear it everyday!</li>
            <li> Really???!!!  I was so excited to get this mascara based on all the positive reviews.  I&#x27;ve used (and liked) benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;bad gal lash&amp;#34; and lately a mascara from Elizabeth Arden, but I don&#x27;t care for this mascara at all.  Yes, it stays put, but it makes your eyelashes very stiff - so even if you want to, it makes it hard to apply another coat on later in the day (if going out after work, etc.).  I also don&#x27;t feel it lengthens or volumizes at all.  I put several coats and have to really wiggle the brush to get any kind of volume.  Too much work if you ask me.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands that are way better. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, doesn&#x27;t clump ever, looks great everytime!</li>
            <li> I have blonde lashes, so I need lots of color on the top and bottom lashes to see them. But I always end up with mascara smudged under my eyes. This mascara has great coverage, doesn&#x27;t clump or leave dark circles under my eyes. You do need a good waterproof mascara remover. I tried it based on a review and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara! It works great every application, and lasts ,and lasts and lasts...... No smearing, smudging, or running! I was not optimistic at trying a new brand, but am oh so happy that I did.  Now this mascara is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried. Worth every penny. Will continue to use. I&#x27;m spoiled with this and can&#x27;t use no other! I first tried it at my daughter-in laws, and now I am hooked. I get coupons for other mascaras, but don&#x27;t even waste time to use them. I love this mascara. It feels like I am wearing false eyelashes, but looks natural. Its a quality product, and I love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.  It goes on easily and my lashes are BIG as stated.  Easy to remove with soap &amp;amp; water.  It is my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> Well, let me say, as most other reviewers, this is pretty much the perfect mascara.  I too, have searched far and wide for the best mascara.  Cheap, expensive, in between, and slightly unimpressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UNTIL NOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Alaska Fashionista Outdoorsy review states...it is ON your lashes like White on Rice!  It&#x27;s got staying power.  I have also worn it to the gym, the beach, running,  etc.  I&#x27;ve tested it in sweaty situations (including sex)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST TEST EVER!!!  The very day I got this magic mascara and lovingly applied it to my lashes, we went to dinner, and drinks, etc.  And my boyfriend and I got in a huge, stupid fight, which ended with me CRYING and sleeping in the guest room, with my face buried in the pillow.  When my dumb boyfriend came into the guest room in the morning to apologize, I could not even rub the guilt in with my raccoon-stained eyes....BECAUSE THE MASCARA WAS STILL IN PLACE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to refresh it a bit, but it was on, no black rivers of tear stains running down my face.  It was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes wash my whole face except my eyelashes, apply vitamin C, retin-A, oil of olay, palmers cocoa oil, what have you, leaving the mascara intact, since I know it will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last 2 &amp;#34;favorites&amp;#34; were L&#x27;Oreal False Fiber Black Lacquer, which by lunchtime would leave a light gray rub under my eyes.  My other recent purchase was the &amp;#34;Younique&amp;#34; which I bought from a friend that sells it, and I am not the hugest fan.  It&#x27;s ok, but very time consuming to apply, 2 different things to apply, and can get chunky I think, regardless what I do, I save that for special occasions and leave myself a good 10 minutes to apply the mascara.  And pray that there are no fallen fibers on my face as the night wears on.  It&#x27;s not foolproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara KILLS those.  At $10 less than Younique, and $10 more than L&#x27;Oreal, this is the perfect mascara.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever! I look for long length and volume, don&#x27;t want smears or flakes! I got everything with this wonderful mascara! Found this by accident while on Amazon, so glad that I did!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Elizabeth!</li>
            <li> Loved the mascara! Exactly as described! Your services are a plus too!</li>
            <li> Hate to not give 5 stars but having to buy a primer to get my bombshell lashes put a damper on my experience with this product. However I like it enough to use it till its dead.,</li>
            <li> I rarely ever review an item,  but this product really attention.  I have thin blonde lashes and oily eyelids.  Usually in order to get volume the mascara ends up smudged, flaking, or making my eyelashes stiff and feeling like jabbing pine needles into my lower eye lid when I blink.  Or the dreaded tarantula leg eyelashes.  This stuff...GAME CHANGER.  My lashes are defined,  soft,  volumizing,  I really gave it a test yesterday and put it on before my workout.  No smudging,  smearing,  flaking.  Comes off with my facial cleanser.  Oh,  I have hooded eyelids and it didn&#x27;t end up on them during application like most.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Comparable to Lancome at a much lower price!</li>
            <li> Really does the trick. It&#x27;s a little gloopy at first, so I use an eyelash comb to easily catch any globs. 3 or so coats are perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I have very sensitive eyes/skin and always need products that are hypoallergenic. This product is natural, but does not compromise quality. It actually makes a huge difference in highlighting my eyes!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome! Stays put, no flaking!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve used in years.  It is the perfect balance lengthening and thickening.  It doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look like thick spider legs like some mascaras do.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and liked it so much, I ordered 2 additional back-up tubes.</li>
            <li> Am still finding my grove with this mascara, but it does all it says it will.  Especially love the &#x27;no smudge&#x27; aspect.  So many mascaras give the volume but then I look like a racoon at the end of the day.  Not so with this mascara.  No a smudge to be seen, even after a very long day, into night.  Am learning to layer quickly, as it dries fast, but it gives the length I need without clumping.  And the price is worth it!  Will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Nice mascara, helps my skimpy lashes look fuller.</li>
            <li> Really works to lengthen!!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Truly does what no other I&#x27;ve bought can - actually makes my lashes look thicker and longer.  I have what I&#x27;d say are thin-ish lashes to begin with at 45 coupled with thyroid disease.  They&#x27;re not sparse, but not dreamy looking either.  And they&#x27;re short.  Needless to say, love this mascara.  Put it on just this morning and thought again how much I love it.  What I love even more, no messy removal.  It almost peels off with water.  I don&#x27;t really need to use anything other than that or baby wipes to remove it.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge, etc.  Worth the $$.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a ton of mascara.  Usually I have to buy something new because my product gets old not because it wears out.  I love this mascara so much though.  I&#x27;ve found myself putting it on even on days I&#x27;m not wearing any other makeup.  Maybe I&#x27;ll actually run out this time.  Thanks for a great product.  It looks pretty and feels light on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Just as other reviewers have said, this is great mascara. It separates and lengthens my lashes without clumping and I find it takes me less time to apply as a result. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It really is great mascara....this is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered it. Can&#x27;t find anything that compares. Doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake off and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Best waterproof mascara Ive ever used…. as I&#x27;ve gotten older the lines around my eyes (I&#x27;m 45) have gotten such that I don&#x27;t like to wear powder on face cause it cakes into the wrinkles. But with other mascaras (even waterproof) the moisturizer on my skin would make the mascara speckle under and above my eyes. BUT with It&#x27;s So BIG mascara I have not had that problem once!!!  I love this mascara and don&#x27;t have to use power at all so I feel I look my best when wearing it :) Thank you Elizabeth Mott for coming up with such a great product! I am a fan for life!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this mascara. It doesn&#x27;t clump, and goes on nicely!  Even washing it off with a cleanser is pretty painless.  Would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Doesn&#x27;t smudge. I&#x27;ll definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! I have been using it for a few years now.  I have tried so many different types of mascara with hopes of finding one that would not bleed on my upper eye lid or under my eyes. I have modeled for many years and have had many makeup artist tell me,  after I inform them off my mascara issue,  &amp;#34;ohh this mascara I have will definitely work&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;you haven&#x27;t tried this mascara i have here! &amp;#34; only to have the bleeding issue continue!  Then I came across the It&#x27;s So Big Mascara by Elizabeth Mott and I requested a sample from their website as I read so many suggest and I&#x27;m so happy I did!  I was very skeptical, thinking it would be no better than all the others I&#x27;ve tried, but I was proven wrong. The mascara wand is a perfect size, in my opinion, to evenly cover all my lashes.  I can easily put on one coat for a natural look or a few more for a bolder look without it looking fake. I do not wear much makeup anyway but I can quickly hit my lashes with this mascara and that&#x27;s it &amp; be good to go! The best part, it does not bleed under my eyes or rub off on my upper eye lid, not even during the hot Texas summers!!! It can come off some while swimming but again it doesn&#x27;t have that bleeding/running effect that makes you look like you&#x27;ve been crying for hours,  it comes off &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; if you will.  A friend may mention,  while swimming,  that i have a few. ..yes just a few,  black specks under my eye,  I use my finger and swipe under my eyes &amp; that&#x27;s it (for the part that comes off that is). It doesn&#x27;t smear all over my pillow case if I forget to remove it before bed, yay! Nor is it difficult to remove while I am washing my face. I have taken it to photoshoots with me and suggested it to the makeup artist,  they liked it so much they were asking me where they could order it!  Overall,  it stays when and where it needs to stay, is easy to clean off when that time comes &amp; it does not irritate my eyes at all!!! I HIGHLY recommend thismascara and hope you all have the same experience with it as I have!  :)</li>
            <li> I initially thought it was not as advertised but having now used it for 2 weeks I am satisfied with the product. It does extend my lashes.  I would not describe the lashes as being BIG but they are longer.  The lashes do not get thick and clumpy like mascara&#x27;s that advertise volume do at least on me so that is a positive in my book.  I still think the price is too much.</li>
            <li> Definitely my new go to mascara. I was using the yonique 3D fiber lashes which require 1 coat of regular mascara, 1 coat of their transplanting gel and 1 -2 coats of their fibers, which took FOREVER to apply and left me looking like i had spider legs for lashes&lt;br /&gt;Once I purchased this product I was blown away. I get so many compliments about how long my lashes look and I don&#x27;t apply more than 2 coats and my lashes look very natural. They also stand out significantly in photos too!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I have thin eyelashes and it helps I may consider using a primer with it</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive eyes and have tried every mascara from drugstore to YSL and Chanel. This is the only one that doesn&#x27;t flake, doesn&#x27;t itch, and doesn&#x27;t give me smudgey raccoon eyes. I&#x27;ve repurchased it multiple times because everytime I try another brand, I am disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t hold as well as this one does. It&#x27;s great for volume, won&#x27;t add super long length though.</li>
            <li> I love this. I&#x27;m very picky about mascara and this is my favorite in years. I&#x27;ve tried everything from drugstore brands to Clinique, Dior, etc. I&#x27;m also sensitive to several brands and end up with itchy eyes. Not with this! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Long thick lashes that DON&#x27;T smudge! Really great product. Bought one and immediately bought two more to make sure I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> It is the first traditional mascara I have used that doesn&#x27;t cause smudging and my lashes are big and noticeable.  I have purchased this numerous times and prefer it to Blinc.</li>
            <li> AWESOME MASCARE, A MUST HAVE!!</li>
            <li> One of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve purchased in awhile. My consistent go-to would be loreal voluminous. I&#x27;m not one for small brushes, and this one is fairly small so it takes some accommodation after smearing black mascara all over my eyelids several times I think I&#x27;m getting there. Incredible length, separation and curl. All in all a very, very good mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update : 03/12/14&lt;br /&gt;Still love this mascara, it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed do and then some. The &amp;#34;then some&amp;#34; being that it really does NOT budge! The formula isn&#x27;t waterproof but it takes extensive patience for me to be able to remove ALL of it from my lashes. I&#x27;m very particular about making sure any and all make up is removed from my face before bed. This product proves to be one of the most difficult mascaras to remove, which is great because you can go clubbing in it and not worry about looking like a hot mess! Though also terrible because it takes me an extra 5 minutes to get it all off, and half of the time I wake up still having some at the base of my lashes. Still worthy of five stars, but let this serve as a warning!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very short and blonde; basically, they are invisible.  This product not only gives me beautiful lashes, but also and most importantly, is the only product that doesn&#x27;t smudge and leave what appears to be dark circles under my eyes (without the use of any lash primer).  Every other mascara that I&#x27;ve tried, including Estee Lauder, Clinique, Lancôme, Dior, and some Target brands, leaves smudge marks under my eyes within an hour - even with the use of a lash primer.</li>
            <li> Awful!! It appears that I&#x27;m much pickier than the most of the public when it comes to mascara... The average reviews are waaaay off on this product. I bought this because of the great reviews. This stuff has a smooth application but that&#x27;s where the positives end. It made my lashes black, skinny and scrawny. No weight or fullness to them at all and the length wasn&#x27;t anything to write home about either. I&#x27;ll stick with They&#x27;re Real by Benefit or in a pinch Lash Blast by Cover Girl. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff, there are better mascaras at your local drugstore. So disappointing!!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara so much! I go from school directly to company dance rehearsals for 5 hours, and this mascara is the only one I have found that don&#x27;t run throughout my long day. Thank you!</li>
            <li> So when I first tried this product I thought it worked well, but didn&#x27;t see how it was any different than cover girl lash blast. I actually think the cover girl brand works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for 2 weeks I started to notice that my eye lashes began to clump together and no matter how many times I washed my eyes I could not get the mascara off! I tried everything to get off the accumulation of gunk. I ended up not wearing any mascara for two weeks in order to get this stuff off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick to cover girl lash blast or lash bloom. Works better for way less $$$ and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> Very nice lengthening mascara</li>
            <li> Sloppy, gloppy and not worth the money.  Dries slowly s well.</li>
            <li> Dude... this mascara ROCKS.  Hard.  I&#x27;m a cheapskate when it comes to makeup (hello $4 makeup!) and I got this as a gift...and I&#x27;m madly, deeply in love with this stuff that I will continue buying it.  My sad, pathetic lashes look fabulous and amazeballs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need one coat, and it comes off super easy with soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge fan!  *bats lashes*</li>
            <li> In my early 60&#x27;s, lashes are somewhat scarce, found this product to be an excellent choice.  Latisse works too, just can&#x27;t use the product all the time~ it  irritates my lids after a while. I use a light coat of this mascara during the day and when I want more lash I coat heavier. I start at base and jiggle the wand until it  covers lashes. I sometimes dust my lashes with some light powder from bare essential prior to using mascara for more fullness .</li>
            <li> Nice product that doesn&#x27;t clump and extends the lashes. I&#x27;ve been using this product 1St too achieve the desired look I want.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Bought a bunch for Christmas gifts because I had to share.</li>
            <li> one coat works!  my new favorite, and quick shipping, thanks!</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Nothing amazing but perfectly good mascara.</li>
            <li> A very nice mascara!  Worth the $</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally unimpressed. I didn&#x27;t care for the brush and the product in general didn&#x27;t produce much thickness. I think the price is absolutely out of control for what it is.</li>
            <li> My lashes are very fine and short. This mascara did not create volume whatsoever. I applied 4 coats but they still looked faint and sparse. I followed up with 2 coats of Maybelline Illegal Lengths Mascara and they looked much thicker and longer. Unfortunately, this mascara did not live up to it&#x27;s 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> So thick I can actually say I have Eyelashes now. It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes after a while like all other Mascara&#x27;s I recommend!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this mascara.  Before I found this mascara I used false lashes because every mascara I used gave me raccoon eyes and irritated my contacts, especially during allergy season.  Since switching, I am able to wear my mascara even during my sneeziest days.  I have even slept in the mascara and gone to the gym and it does not come off!  However, it washes off very easy with gentle soap and water.  This mascara is definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I wanted a one coat mascara and this is it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara!!  It gives me length and thickens my lashes without looking fake!  Be sure to do more than one coat to really see a difference.  The best mascara EVER!!!</li>
            <li> This mascara was nothing like how I envisioned it to be. It did not volumize my lashes, it barely lengthened them whatsoever, and I am extremely disappointed. I have a hard time being able to take the mascara off my lashes once it&#x27;s on (which doesn&#x27;t happen often because it doesn&#x27;t do what it is supposed to do).</li>
            <li> Let me preface this review with two notes: 1. I have very fine, thin hair in general, and my eyelashes are no exception. There isn&#x27;t a lot for ANY mascara to work with. 2. That said, I&#x27;ve had success with cheaper mascaras in getting volume-- but they smudged throughout the day. That lead me to this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the good: this stuff LASTS. I&#x27;m used to looking like a post-break-up poster child by about 10am every day because nothing sticks to me. Not so with this stuff-- once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s ON. Doesn&#x27;t budge until I wash it off at the end of the day. To boot, washing it off is NOT an eyelid pulling marathon of pain, either. It comes of nice and easy with my usual make-up remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the not-so-good: it did not give me volume. I&#x27;m used to layering up on mascara like putting on sweaters in a snow storm, but it wasn&#x27;t much good here. No matter how many extra coats I tried, my lashes remained stubbornly stick-ish. I could always fall back to using a different mascara under this one, but I feel a little resentful of that when I&#x27;ve spent twice as much on this mascara as I have on others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, if you&#x27;ve got decent lash volume and just need something that will stick with you all day THIS IS FOR YOU. If you need staying power AND volume, and happen to have thin, fine lashes, the search may continue.</li>
            <li> Looks great and comes off easily.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;The lady who does my facials even asked if I was medication to make my eyelashes grow.&lt;br /&gt;Will never switch back to any other mascara.</li>
            <li> Nothing impressive!!!</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews about this mascara I thought I&#x27;d buy it. I tried it and I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my lashes. They looked almost the same as they did without mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only mascara I will use!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time.  I like the mascara but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Just okay. I found the Physicians formula is better...</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! Makes my eyelashes look very long! Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> OMG!!!! This is the best mascara I have used and by far true to its description. BUY BUY BUY. I will purchase two more as back up, now! This mascara glides on, gives exceptional volume, and stays on all day. My lashes look amazing and VERY long. The product does not get into the eyes, it does not irritate the eyes in any way, and is not sticky and clumpy. The BEST MASCARA on the market today. Thank you so much. I will recommend this to every woman I know.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time and to the standards described when purchasing.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this! This is the one to buy as a gift.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT mascara!  One of the best I&#x27;ve ever tried, coupled with a perfect brush (and I&#x27;m picky with my mascara brushes).  Definitely will buy again and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It makes eyelashes look superlong. Another awesome feature - it doesn&#x27;t smudge at all. I have oily skin and watery eyes so my mascara, especially on the lower lashes, always disappeared or smudged after a few hours. This mascara stays intact! Love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this mascara. Adds both thickness and length. It is not waterproof, but stays on very well (even in shower or pool if you don&#x27;t rub your eyes). Also, comes off easily without smudging. Can&#x27;t say enough About this product!!</li>
            <li> Super, I just bought because of reviews and I&#x27;m glad!</li>
            <li> Very good mascara. Provides volume and length. No clumping or flaking. Stays on lashes , does not run off on my face. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Rather awkward to apply upper and lower lashes separately.  Also not nearly as voluminous as Bad Gal mascara.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Mott, the company who  manufactures this product, has e-mailed me with a request to review her product. I would not have written a review of this product if I had not be asked. I do not like writing negative reviews unless a product is stone cold horrible and a complete rip-off.  This is not the case here. However, I would not purchase this product again. It did not do anything extraordinary to my eyelashes. It did not make them &amp;#34;BIG&amp;#34; as the manufacturer claims. I have had similar experiences with much less expensive mascara. I do like to try different products and I thought this may be &amp;#34;the&amp;#34; mascara. But it wasn&#x27;t even close. Someone else may find this product satisfactory and be delighted with the outcome. I was not!  Sorry Elizabeth Mott!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after searching everywhere for something that would work for my thin lashes after reading some of the reviews I thought this is the one and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it however when I got it it did nothing like the reviews said yes it did not clump but did not volumize as described my lashes still looked thin for such an expensive mascara I expect more quality I then purchase Better Than Sex mascara and finally have fuller lashes without clumps still expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> I initially tried this product as a sample in an Ipsy bag.  I thought, &amp;quot;Hmm, this is okay...&amp;quot;  then I went back to my original brand and thought, &amp;quot;What is wrong with this crap?!&amp;quot;  I bought a new tube of my usual and was still very disappointed.  So you have all been warned.  Once you try this, there is no going back.  Perfect Mascara!  Not too thick and not too thin.  When you apply more than one coat, you don&#x27;t get the Gabore Look...not that there is anything wrong with that.  If that&#x27;s what you want!  Me, not so much.  Thicker, longer looking lashes and easy to apply.  Worth every penny</li>
            <li> I just (sadly) ran out of my discontinued Lash Length mascara by Mary Kay and decided to buy this because of the great reviews. I am not as happy with it as I thought I would be.  It is very goopy at first and is hard to clean the brush off enough to even apply it.  When you do get it on evenly, it looks great and lasts all day.  However, the description claims it easily washes off with water -- that is not true at all. I can soak it with a hot wash cloth for a minute and only a smidge comes off. So I would classify this as waterproof for sure.  It is even hard to get off with my makeup remover and flakes all over instead of smears off.  I end up with flakes in my hair and stuck to my scalp in the morning if I don&#x27;t wash it off 100%.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but didn&#x27;t make my lashes much longer and the formula makes the lashes stick together</li>
            <li> Great mascara. I love it :)</li>
            <li> I scored with this one!  The wife loved it and says most of all it doesn&#x27;t clump! Great product thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It really makes your eye lashes look thick and it&#x27;s easy to remove.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used!  It makes my lashes look really long.  It lasts all day and even though it is not waterproof, it acts as if it is.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The shape of the mascara wand makes it really easy to reach the tiny lashes in the corners, and the mascara lasts all day. No clumps, no smudges, buildable volume and length. I will probably repurchase :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried an unreasonable number of mascaras trying to find one that doesn&#x27;t smudge on my super oily skin. This one is by far my favorite. It layers really well and doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake. It gives great volume and length. I like the soft bristle brush and the hourglass shape. It&#x27;s a little difficult to get off, but overall this is my favorite and most used mascara, and the midline price is just right.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t curl or add volume. Makeup Forever or Benifit works better for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like at all. Not worth 20 dolllars</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of trouble finding mascara that does not wind up in a smear under my eyes after a few hrs.  This is by far the best I have found.  It goes on well, never smudges, and lasts well.  I have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I never leave product reviews. .. but if you&#x27;re asking yourself if $20 for mascara is worth it the answer is yes! I have tried tons of different brands from the cheap to the expensive and this stuff is the best. Goes on smoothly with no clumps, not heavy if I want more I just put another layer on. The shape of the wand is amazing, I can finally get the corner lashes without getting mascara all over my face and under my eyes! Best of all it stays on all day without flaking or running but when I wash my face at night it all gets off without having to scrub for fourteen minutes. So glad I found this stuff!</li>
            <li> Never used anything better.  I always sweat mascara off and end up with raccoon eyes.  This stuff is a life hack!</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara. It didn&#x27;t clump and it did make my lashes look longer and fuller. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this based upon the great reviews and am not disappointed! No flaking ever!</li>
            <li> I thought it would make a great difference but it doesn&#x27;t, plus it is not water proof, will not buy again :-(</li>
            <li> I got lots of compliments when I wore this mascara, but just after a few hours of working at the office in normal conditions, it started flaking and sticking underneath my eyes and irritating them a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it another try to see if I could wear it all day by using 1 coat of Blinc primer and 1 coat of &amp;#34;Its so Big&amp;#34; and a few hour later it started flaking again around my eyes and irritating them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People said it looked really good but I returned this product because after a few hours the flakes bothered my eyes and didn&#x27;t look too pretty. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I heart this product. I mix it with another mascara for a great long wearing,long lash look. Will be buying again when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> Love this! I was hesitant to pay more for mascara, but it&#x27;s worth it!  I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Not at all impressed. Several coats did not lengthen my lashes as much as a couple swipes with my Revlon mascara. Would not buy again even if it were a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li> Not overly impressed.  Works like any other mascara.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money over the years on expensive department store mascara and not really impressed with the results. I tried this and I&#x27;m really impressed! I will definitely purchase again!! Thanks Elizabeth Mott and thanks Amazon for having product reviews on new products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky with mascara.  This mascara is AMAZING.  It goes on easily and evenly, and stays on.  No flaking, no smudging, no weird spider lashes.  It is perfect and stays perfect all day, and then washes off easily at night with regular face soap.  It does not require separate makeup remover like a waterproof formula would, but it stays on that well.  I am now converted and this will be my go to mascara moving forward.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This is my second review. I rated it 3 stars before because it wasn&#x27;t making my lashes thicker so that i needed to do lots of layers which made it clumpy. I got a prompt response letting me know that that shouldn&#x27;t be happening and that they sent me a replacement (without me even asking)&lt;br /&gt;2 days later I received my second one. It works great, goes on smooth and lengthens and thickens my lashes. It also stays on and doesn&#x27;t smudge like my Lancome mascara does. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because i still put on several layers (without clumping this time)&lt;br /&gt;Excellent customer service!!!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm!  It&#x27;s not overly thick like some other brands.  I love the skinny wand: it&#x27;s perfect for creating volume without the spider look.</li>
            <li> I thought I would LOVE it like everyone else seemed to... it is decent, but I have used other cheaper mascaras that I like more.  Give this a try, maybe it will blow you away..  but I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara ever! Makes your lashes look super long and never clumps! Lasts me for 4 months!</li>
            <li> I received a travel sized version of this mascara in my Ipsy bag and fell completely in love with it. There are no flakes or smears throughout the day. And better yet, my lashes look so full and pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of wearing it, I decided to go ahead and buy the full sized product. I am still very happy with my mascara and will probably continue to buy it over and over again.</li>
            <li> I only ever buy big brand mascara because the stuff from pharmacies just doesn&#x27;t cut it. I switched to this recently and its even BETTER than the big brands and less costly. Will never stop buying.</li>
            <li> Thickening and lengthening, does not clump like others I have used. Also doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge. Best mascara I have tried so far!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the mascara. I have extremely sensitive eyes, and for years can only use one brand SYL. All the others gave me itchy and watery eyes with falling eye lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have so happy that my new found love It&#x27;s so Big can last all day on my eye lashes without causing any irritation, and almost half of the cost of what I have been using. I hope that the company will come up with other colors, so that I can switch all my mascara form SYL.</li>
            <li> I have tried many mascaras.  This one is the best by far!  I Love how long it makes my lashes! Stays put until removed. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have very blond, thin lashes. After reading the reviews for this mascara, I excitedly placed an order for a sample on the company&#x27;s website. It arrived quickly, and I anxiously waited for morning to try it. I swiped it across my lashes and couldn&#x27;t even tell there was anything on them. I added three more coats (for a total of four), and I still did not get any type of dramatic result. I can barely tell I&#x27;m wearing it. I get the same results from cheap drugstore brands. On the bright side, it did not clump at all and felt very lightweight. If you already have decent lashes, it will probably work for you. If you&#x27;re like me, though, and are looking for the next miracle in mascara, keep looking. I console myself by remembering that I only paid $2.79 for the sample rather than the $20 for a full-size bottle.</li>
            <li> The mascara has great hold, and doesn&#x27;t clump.  However, I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t volumiZe more than it does.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely one of the best mascaras I have ever used.  It&#x27;s fun to apply because it makes my lashes look extra long and huge.  It&#x27;s smart enough to be used for work and it is flirty enough to use for those fun nights.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this mascara is easy to use and does the job.  I like that it is healthier to use than many others and though it might not be unique in the way it looks, it is a great alternative and stands against other major mascara&#x27;s quite well.</li>
            <li> Very volumizing, one of the better mascaras I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s not as dramatic as some others though.</li>
            <li> Most mascaras are so so but this is now going to be my go to mascara! Love it!</li>
            <li> I just with it was darker and a bit more dramatic.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST MASCARA EVER!!!&lt;br /&gt;It provides amazing volume and definition without getting clumpy. As a professional makeup artist, I have tried TONS of different types of mascara, this one is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;I now teach yoga, which gets me pretty hot...I perspire easily. This mascara NEVER ends up underneath my eyes and its still feels &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; on the lashes. I can&#x27;t stand it when my lashes feel &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; and that often happens when using transfer resistant mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got this in an Ipsy glam bag, I used it completely...I loved it. I have long and full natural lashes, no curling or falsies! This looked so good on my lashes... If you like the natural, glam look this is a great product</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I have very oily skin and every other kind I&#x27;ve tried always smudges and gets all over my eyes. This one stays in place and lasts all day. It&#x27;s also very easy to remove. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! No clumps, smudges and lasts all day yet washes out with soap and water! I wear contacts and I have tried many brands of mascara at twice the price and there is no comparison to It&#x27;s So Big! I will definitely purchase again,</li>
            <li> Very nice, lightweight mascara :)</li>
            <li> WOW--incredible mascara!! Rivers my MAC mascara and doesn&#x27;t clump, but evens out lashes nicely. I will never use anything else again!</li>
            <li> This is great mascara. I usually use Lancôme Definicils or Maybelline Falsies. I am never going back. This mascara goes on great, it&#x27;s very black, it lengthens your lashes and comes off easily with make-up remover.</li>
            <li> I had never seen this brand anywhere, so when this showed up in the &amp;#34;you might like this&amp;#34; section while I was shopping on Amazon, I read the reviews and decided to take the chance. I have tried literally over 50 mascaras in my 63 years. Most have left me dis-satisfied, hence trying to find something better. I really like this mascara. It doesn&#x27;t clump, and it does not smear or leave racoon eyes. Washes off easily with soap and water. As I apply several coats my lashes are fuller and longer. I have already ordered a second tube.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best mascara I have ever tried! I love the hour glass wand! I will never switch again! :) xoxo</li>
            <li> I bought the sample to try out -- then bought the full size. I LOVE MASCARA and I&#x27;m loyal to two types, this is one of them. My other mascara allows me to build layer on top of layer, as much as I want, but I think my lashes &amp;#34;got used&amp;#34; to my go-to mascara and started looking loppy. So, I&#x27;ve tried more than 20+ mascaras and came across this one, and after reading all the rave reviews really wanted to try it out. Got the sample, and was more than pleased with the outcome; it lengthens my lashes pretty well and it doesn&#x27;t take me very long to put it on. I don&#x27;t really wear much other make up other than mascara, so the mascara that I choose to use needs to look awesome, well, this does it. Try the sample at least, before you buy. I say this with confidence because you most likely will end up buying the full size. Happy Mascara&#x27;ing.</li>
            <li> This is now my favorite mascara! I have long been pestered with mascara that smudged under my eye during the day, but I never have that problem with this mascara.</li>
            <li> I love it. Its the best mascara i ever had</li>
            <li> Maybe I am doing something wrong , no volum and I have to apply 5-6 times . Loreal  butterfly  mascara is by far way better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Australia, and finding a cheap, loved mascara isn&#x27;t always easy. This mascara is officially my be all end all mascara. It doesn&#x27;t clump, makes my lashes look long and curls them up too. I always find with wearing liquid liner that my lashes get lost in the black line, but this just makes my lashes stand out. Recommended to all my beauty loving friends and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great mascara.</li>
            <li> Not really happy about this mascara . I was expecting more on base all good reviews . This mascara is like any other mascara I tried .</li>
            <li> This is the absolute most amazing mascara ever!  It lengthens and volumizes in a big way and stays put!!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it does a better job than a few other products so while it&#x27;s a good product, I do not think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I would highly recommend to anyone who likes their lashes to look longer, thicker, and beautiful.  I will most definitely reorder in future.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!!! I thought I was already happy w the one a had been using- They&#x27;re Real by Benifit. - this one by Elizabeth Mott totally out does every mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried- and I&#x27;ve tried them all- from high end to the famous - drug store- &#x27;pink one&#x27; great lash- I tried this on a whim- after I tried the Fiber 3- D ones and didn&#x27;t like the flaking they caused- this one doesn&#x27;t smear- stays on - no clumps- easy off- great cost- PERFECT!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE this awesome mascara -- not &amp;#34;goopie&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;flakie -  BUT it extends AND thickens your lashes - it takes 3 quick coats -- but stays on ALL day long yet washes off in a flash -- I&#x27;ve ordered twice and will continue to order this awesome &amp;#34;eye opening&amp;#34; product ;)  -- Get your lashes on with BIG !!</li>
            <li> UPDATE!  I have purchased at least 3 tubes of this mascara and I love it more than ever!  It applies smoothly with no chunks and stays on without leaving that annoying black shadow under my lower lashes when I&#x27;ve had it on all day.  Very happy to have found this mascara : )</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I&#x27;ve tried dozens of brands and always wondered if there was a perfect product just for me. I found it!!!!!! It&#x27;s So Big mascara never flakes off or feels heavy on my lashes!!! Perfect!</li>
            <li> This is terrific mascara.</li>
            <li> Really does work! Lengthens and separates without feeling heavy and looking gunky. Looks pretty natural overall. Also doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water like some mascaras have in the past. Comes off really easily with water, but for me that&#x27;s not a bad thing. I don&#x27;t like waterproof mascaras but I do want one that stays put, and this one does just that!</li>
            <li> I called and got the free sample of this mascara because of all the Amazon reviews on it. For the life of me I can&#x27;t figure out what all the hype is about. I couldn&#x27;t stand it. It felt like I was putting black glue on my eyelashes. I disliked it enough to wash my eyes so I didn&#x27;t have to wear it all day...</li>
            <li> Great product.  Performed exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara easy goes on and makes my eyelashes look really long</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t meet my expectations.The mascara doesn&#x27;t volumes my eyelashes,it makes them look longer.The price is too high for this product.I would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara!! I am terribly picky and struggle to find a mascara that isn&#x27;t goopy or clumpy, or flakes off later in the day (or any of the typical problems with many mascaras). This mascara goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t glue my lashes all together or need endless separating. There are no clumps to deal with either. Also seems to stay on nicely too - at the end of the day I didn&#x27;t see any flaking to speak of, and it comes off nicely too. I&#x27;m very active and even after a gym workout it held up ok. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so I can&#x27;t speak to how it holds up over time, but this first week has been great!</li>
            <li> This was worth every dollar, I love this mascara.  My eyelashes are almost invisible with out mascara this mascara makes them look full and long.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great mascara! Long, thick lashes finally.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are using this mascara and love it. I was going to buy the 3D but read such great reviews so I thought I would give it a try. I wish it was darker, but its all natural and does leave mine longer looking. Still might try a 3D just to compare but I would buy this again. Great product and I like that its all natural.</li>
            <li> I will never ever buy another mascara again! I work at a busy club and at 4am when ive been running around like crazy all night its still PERFECT! Never will i buy another mascara!</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used!  I doubt I will ever buy any other kind now!</li>
            <li> I dont like this mascara. I have been using Maybelline  Full N&#x27; Soft. And the $8 Mascara is way better than this one.  I Don&#x27;t feel like using this at all, as the mascara clumps my eyelashes. Hate it, Hate it</li>
            <li> This is so different from any mascara you can get at the pharmacy.  I&#x27;m pretty low maintenance so normally I don&#x27;t notice much difference between makeup brands.  This had five stars so I ordered it without much thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on the morning after it arrived.  Wow. It went on super smooth and light but I still got a big effect.  I went to work and then spin class without removing my eye makeup.  MAGIC!!!  No smudging or running at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mascara after work and the gym was literally perfect.  When I got home, I rubbed it off easily.  I don&#x27;t understand how it works, but I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> My search for the best mascara in the world is over :) (Australia)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for it....it did nothing for my lashes.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!! Came very fast!! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this product and loved it! I bought one for myself and one for my mom who also loved it. It stays on all day, holds the curl, and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> this mascara is amazing. no smudging or melting. and removal is simple soap and water. NO raccoon eyes. they kind of just peel right off your lashes. amazinggg</li>
            <li> This is THE best mascara. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Covergirl to MAC and nothing worked so well. It is on the expensive side, but it does not clump and truly gives you long, thick, big lashes. It is so worth it!</li>
            <li> I especially like the fact that the mascara does not clump and does not ever end up under my eyes - I have sensitive eyes and this usually happens with other brands  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this mascara, but it just wasn&#x27;t as great as I&#x27;d hoped. It did provide some length but didn&#x27;t have the wow factor I was expecting from all the positive reviews. You have to be careful if you&#x27;re applying more than one coat as it starts to clump.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. I love how it makes my lashes look and best of all...no raccoon eyes or flaking. We went to the beach this weekend and I was only going to go in a ways and ended up getting knocked down by a wave. When I came out of the water my mascara looked the same exact way it did as when I went in! Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes based on the reviews. The product is ok, but it&#x27;s a little too liquidy for my liking. I like for mascara to be a little thicker.</li>
            <li> Some of the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used in 35 years! Especially great with lash lengthening, thickening is better after several uses.</li>
            <li> This mascara works as advertised. It makes lashes appear to have more volume, but doesn&#x27;t make them heavy or too thick. The mascara wand is well thought out and the opening of the container makes it so you don&#x27;t have to scrub a bunch of mascara off in order to use it, like many others. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and would buy it again. No smudging or flaking so far!</li>
            <li> I was going on a cruise and really wanted a good waterproof mascara as mascara would be my only daytime eye makeup and this fit the bill perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!! Super happy with results after trying a couple different &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; mascaras.  This is the by far the best!</li>
            <li> Favorite Mascara by far!</li>
            <li> First off, I want to say... I was not given this product for free in exchange for a review. I feel like you almost can&#x27;t trust amazon reviews anymore! My go to mascara has been &amp;#34;Benefit They&#x27;re Real Mascara&amp;#34; and I love it but I had an amazon gift card and I was in dire need of mascara so I thought I would try this because it had great reviews. Here is my verdict: The formula is just superb! its so light that its perfect for those with UBER THIN LASHES. It allows you to layer on the mascara to form longer lashes. With Benefit They&#x27;re Real, you definitely get volume, but also tons of clumping... you have to clump it on, comb out clumps and repeat x333 and it took me forever. This stuff is 3-4 layers for lengthening and 5-8 for volume. This looks way more natural and lasts way longer. I also swept this over the ends of false lashes, giving it a fuller look without the heaviness. Its also a soldier against smudging, tears and humidity. But, It does flake if you touch your eyes too much. The mascara is easily removeable without stubborn residue on lashes or mascara deposits into the skin. Overall, I would say Benefit gives more volume, but also clumps. This mascara lengthens and is more natural looking, but doesn&#x27;t give as much volume. I like a lot of volume so personally it is a tie for me, but this one is a little cheaper (about $4-$5) so I might have to go with it from now on!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara, and I&#x27;ve tried too many to count. Many other brands go on smooth at first, but start to dry out and clump after only a few weeks of use. This brand seems to stay fresh longer without clumping or drying. It also stays on until you wash it off. It does fade a bit throughout the day, but I have yet to find a brand that doesn&#x27;t. I also like that there is no odor. Some of my other favorites went on well but had a strong chemical odor. Although I will continue to try new products, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; is the front runner for now!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve tried it and I wish I had gotten it earlier. I don&#x27;t need to wear anything else with it (eyeliner, etc) because it makes my lashes look so good.</li>
            <li> Excellent volumizing mascara that really works and lasts a very long time.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading all the good reviews. I must say the favorable reviews are correct. It is by far the best mascara I have ever used. Lashes appear longer and fuller for sure. Wears well.</li>
            <li> Does what it says! Second and third coats to outer lashes makes you look sexy!</li>
            <li> My daughter used it once and stole it from my makeup bag. This is my second purchase of this mascara and it is our famliy favorite. No need to try others, this creates clean, long lashes. No clumping or flaking.</li>
            <li> The hour glass shape didn&#x27;t provide anything different than another mascara.  Mascara was clumpy and flaked off.  It felt drying on my lashes.  Every nite I&#x27;d take it offf, it would flake down my face.  definitely one of the worst mascaras I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t smudge!  Great alternative to waterproof!</li>
            <li> There are only a few items regularly in my budget that I would classify as a &amp;#34;favorite&amp;#34;. This mascara is so much more than I expected. After years of using mascaras that feel heavy, clump, is impossible to wash away, and most importantly adds very little length...I have finally found a mascara that is the opposite of all of this. I hope it works for you the same as it did for me.</li>
            <li> Amazing mascara ams easy to remove. I will not use anything else now!</li>
            <li> I like the volume I get and my lashes are soft to touch. This mascara gives a natural long lash look and is easy to remove with soap &amp; water so I recommend it. The only problem I had was when I accidentally pumped the brush a couple of times without thinking &amp; I ended up with a big mess on the brush - the brush was loaded with mascara (yuck) and I had to use another brush to remove some from my lashes. I like a natural look that the mascara gives as the brush grabs all my lashes and separates &amp; extends them in one brush stroke. I am a big fan of \\&quot;Bobbie Brown smokey eye mascara\\&quot; but this \\&quot;It&#x27;s so big\\&quot; is a hot item too.</li>
            <li> Good mascara for the price.  I like it better than the L&#x27;Oreal Volumizing.  It does not flake and does volumize lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given this at least a month before writing and the conclusion is that this really is the BEST mascara! Even after sleeping, the mascara looks 99+% the same as I put on 24 hours earlier. It removes easily in the shower and doesn&#x27;t leave any black under my eyes after the shower. It has to be both the brush and the formula that are fantastic. It really does lengthen and fatten the lashes. I&#x27;ve tried all of the drug store brands, as well as CK from Ulta and Make Up For Ever from Sephora in this same price range. This has all them beat lashes down.</li>
            <li> I truly love this mascara! For years i&#x27;ve been buying my mascara from sephora and though i like there mascara i decided to search for a different brand, i came upon this mascara buy accident and i&#x27;m so glad i did, all you need is one coat and the mascara does not dry out, love it.</li>
            <li> Absolute favorite mascara, great product!</li>
            <li> This mascara is OK.  I really like that it does not flake off or melt after a long day (20hrs so far) nor give you the &amp;#34;racoon eye&amp;#34; look  That is something I have yet to find in ANY other mascara in my 30years. I am a contact lens wearer and this mascara causes no problems!  The only reason for the 4 stars is that it is labeled as BIG Volumizing mascara....and while it does lengthen my lashes there is no significant increase in volume.  My other favorite &amp;#34;Mally&amp;#34; mascara does a must better job.  I wish i could combine the 2!  I have been wearing this mascara a week so far and MAYBE it is just because this is a new tube. (Sometimes new mascaras need to be &amp;#34;broken-in&amp;#34; in my experience).  It is still worth the $20 price-tag simply because it doesn&#x27;t flake off! It also washes off relatively easy with soap and water, although make-up remover is ideal.</li>
            <li> best masacar ever-will not buy any other mascara again-originally received this in a People VIP gift and right away fell in love with it and ordered another one.</li>
            <li> Smudges off after an hour. Doesn&#x27;t volumize my lashes like it said it would!</li>
            <li> GREAT MASCARA!  Does not flake or smear!  This is by far the best mascara I have ever tried; it also extends eyelashes as you apply it.  This will be my forever mascara for sure!  Should be named, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So GREAT!&amp;#34;  FOLLOW-UP:  I have been using this mascara for about 2 months, along with my daughter.  Both of us found that it was great at the beginning but we both started to have eyelashes falling out.  This mascara is very difficult to remove (hence it does not smear); however, as a result, lashes are easily pulled out when you wash your face and make-up etc.  BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> Stays on all day, through every activity, and then washes off with a gentle cleanser.  I am really impressed.</li>
            <li> Best Mascara I have ever used!  Would definitely recommend.  Doesn&#x27;t smudge like every other mascara I have used.  Also, makes lashes look full and long.  I have mostly used lancome or other high end mascara due to irritation of eyes with most of drug store brands.  This is really the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara, but wish it added a little more volume.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> By far the best mascara I have ever bought!!! Not to mention shipped and delivered super fast. This is without a question my new favorite product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for good mascara.  It&#x27;s got my heart.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. Nice volume and no flake. It lasts all day and comes off easily with soap and water. I will absolutely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed. The name doesn&#x27;t fit the product. I love really thick big drag queen lights camera action stage eye lashes. This mascara is like brushing black water onto my lashes. Thin thin thin and no length</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smudge. good products.</li>
            <li> This is a new brand for me and I liked it. For the price, it&#x27;s worth checking out.</li>
            <li> Fantastic mascara! With a long history of melting mascaras I am constantly trying new formulas. This one holds on ALL day and night. I remove it with coconut oil and it&#x27;s relatively easy. Lashes look very thick but not clumpy. Will be the one mascara I&#x27;ll buy again. ( have used &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; by Benefit but that didn&#x27;t thicken my lashes at all.)</li>
            <li> not volumizing as promised</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and great product</li>
            <li> Best máscarever, this is my second time buying it and I will keep doing, it&#x27;s just great!! ! ! !</li>
            <li> Wow, this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried...and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!  It really pumps up my skinny lashes better than fancy department store brands or drugstore favorites.  A little pricey but worth the splurge.  I would have given the 5th star but it does clump just a little.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This mascara stays put and washes off easily. ( I use neutraGena towelettes). It does make my lashes look nice. I like it and would buy it again. Worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> im not a mascara lover but for me this product is great coz its satisfy on what i am looking..i only use it once a day and it stays until in the afternoon..i love the thickness and length of my lashes everytime i use this..</li>
            <li> This mascara gives a little more length than most.  I use it along with Lancome Hypnose Drama and the 2 seem to compliment each other.</li>
            <li> Mascara is a tricky product - it&#x27;s so hard to find one that has all the features you&#x27;d want. I&#x27;ve tried many, many types over the years, from drug store brands through pricey designer brands. The price on It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara is at the higher end for what I want to pay for makeup, but I&#x27;m going to continue to purchase it for the unique qualities it has. This is the only mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried that both stays put without smudging and is easy to remove. At my age, I use a good amount of undereye moisturizers, and that was causing smudge even with waterproof mascaras that were a nightmare to try to clean off at night. The It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara has never smudged and it easily wiped off at night - I don&#x27;t know how they came up with this formula,but it works perfectly. Application and volume is just ok - I&#x27;ve had better with other brands; the no-smudging is what&#x27;s keeping me sold on this product. I&#x27;d highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara for that feature alone.</li>
            <li> I was using the djv beautenizer mascara before trying this one and loved it so much that I ordered another one. For some strange reason the second didn&#x27;t seem like the first tube that I ordered. It didn&#x27;t work the same nor have the same effect and probably it was because the vendor changed. So I stopped ordering that brand and decided to give Elizabeth Mott a try because of all the positive reviews!!! I love the way the brush separates my straight lashes and I didn&#x27;t even curl them either and yet they still curled up with just the mascara on!!! Plus I love the dark black pigment color!!!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t spend more than 10$ on mascara but I love this product. I even fell asleep with it last night and when I woke up it still looked perfect!   ETA 9/4/15: My third time buying his amazing mascara! I&#x27;m hooked. Tried to do drug store brand to be more cost effective, but the results could not compare! I love big lash!!</li>
            <li> After seeing how highly rated this mascara was, I had to try it. Went on vacation right after I started using it, and it was awesome. Didn&#x27;t have to worry about raccoon eyes after multiple dips in the ocean or pool; this mascara stays where it&#x27;s supposed to, yet comes off super easy with a little eye makeup remover at the end of the day. I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for about 2 weeks now and love it.  It doesn&#x27;t flake off throughout the day, stays put (even when tears are involved), and builds nicely during application so you can get some decent lashes.  But my favorite feature is that it is easy to remove at the end of the day.  Just a little wipe with makeup remover and its gone.  I think this will be my go-to mascara for the near future.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this mascara. I usually use Chanel product, but saw the other reviews of this mascara. It works great, and such a wonderful bargain. It shipped out right away too, so I could use it in time for a special occasion I was attending.</li>
            <li> Does not really deliver on &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34;.  More of a straight forward mascara.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened. I ordered a sample and I loved it! But I must&#x27;ve gotten a defected product because this is nothing like the sample. The black container is unmarked, unlike the sample. The mascara comes out in one huge glob around the brush. I have to scrape the brush along the opening to get the huge excess off every time before applying it. I&#x27;d much rather buy $8 mascara at the store, than go through the hassle of using this stuff. If I want to spend $25 on mascara, I&#x27;d rather go to Sephora. I will be contacting the merchant in hopes of getting a refund.  ***update: I contacted the seller and they sent me a replacement, no questions asked. I really appreciated that! I feel like there needs to be more quality control on this product, especially for the high price tag.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara!  It&#x27;s comes off easy when you want it to, yet it stays on all day without smudging and I am sure about this because I have spent probably thousands of dollars buying mascara in hopes it wouldn&#x27;t smudge off on me.  I am a manicurist and since I am under hot lights and looking down all day, every mascara, and I mean every mascara smudges off on my.  This is the first mascara that actually stays on me and it&#x27;s a good dark color.  I do wish this mascara made my lashes look a little thicker and a little longer, but I already have pretty good lashes so I can&#x27;t complain.  If you have trouble keeping your mascara on, then this one is a good one to try!</li>
            <li> The mascara adds length and volume without lumps. It is smooth and easy to apply. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful mascara, I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Looks great, works well, hard to remove</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this at first, but I came to really love it and will be re-ordering.  It&#x27;s the kind of mascara that comes off in little tubes, with some water and rubbing.  It doesn&#x27;t stay as surely as Dior Show waterproof, but I think that I prefer this better.  Dior is much harder to get off when you want to.  This seems to stay well enough for my 12+ hour work days.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a nice mascara.  But....it&#x27;s nothing to write home to mom about.  For $13 cheaper I get the SAME effect with my store bought mascara.  Won&#x27;t buy again...at least not for $20.</li>
            <li> When I ordered &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara&amp;#34; by Elizabeth Mott I was a little hesitant because it cost more than what I usually pay for mascara. I&#x27;m glad I went ahead and ordered it because....I really like it. It makes my lashes thicker and longer. Once it dries, it doesn&#x27;t smear and it&#x27;s easy to remove when I wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone looking to have thicker and longer eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara was no better than any drug store mascara.  Didn&#x27;t lengthen much and my eye lashes clumped together.  And it took way too many coats to even be noticeable!  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I finally found the perfect mascara.  I&#x27;ve tried every mascara out there over the years, but this is the absolute BEST in all categories.  Well, all except for one:  the name.  &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big?&amp;#34;  Really?  If someone asks me what kind of mascara I&#x27;m wearing, I&#x27;m sure as heck not going to tell them &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, this mascara truly is superior to anything I&#x27;ve tried in the past -  everything from $7 Maybelline Great Lash to $40 Dior.  It lengthens my short, blonde lashes like I&#x27;ve never seen before - with no clumps.  I love the hourglass-shaped brush too.  No more sticking the tip of the mascara brush on my inner lashes to deposit product.  Best of all, it performs almost like a waterproof mascara.  I usually have to wear waterproof mascara because #1, my eyes water a lot, #2, I wear mascara to work out and other physical activities, and #3, I live in a sub-tropic climate where I tend to (ahem) perspire a lot.  I can wear this mascara all day and in to the night with nary a smudge or flake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I happened upon this mascara and took a chance on a non-waterproof kind.  My lashes have never looked better.  Now if they could only change the name...</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know that my eye allergy was being caused by this mascara. I assumed it was because of my new eye shadow. But when I stopped using the eye shadow and continued to use the mascara the itching didn&#x27;t go away. The minute I remove it and use eye drop, the itching is gone is gone until I use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of reviews said that their mascara would flake off a lot. For me it doesnt flake off as much (only a bit) but it does mainly come off the same way that non waterproof mascara comes off.  Then it just gets into my eyes and instantly I&#x27;m running to the bathroom just to wash my face cause it stings. That has never happened to me with mascara. Sometimes i&#x27;ll even forget I have mascara on til the end of the night. With this brand I can&#x27;t even make it til lunch time before im reaching for make up remover wipes. I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to mascara til now. I guess I&#x27;ll just go back to my previous brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan. It does not apply evenly, and the overall appearance is blah. I expected big volumized lashes, but there is nothing volumizing or lengthening or thickening about this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it credit for not flaking throughout the day though!</li>
            <li> This mascara has worked so well for me, after losing all my eyelashes and having them grow back substantially thinner and shorter, I am finally back to complaining that my lashes are hitting my sunglasses again, thanks to this mascara.</li>
            <li> A very good mascara running usually use Lancôme and this mascara is just as good at a better price! Have reordered!</li>
            <li> I have tried every mascara out there from least to most expensive...I am very happy with Its so Big.  No flaking and don&#x27;t need anything but water to remove.  Still looks good the next AM! Have recommended to all my mascara junkies.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST mascara I have ever used. It does not clump, it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes feel brittle and is easy to remove.  It never runs or smears. It is absolutely fantastic.  I am going to order more because this is the only mascara for me!</li>
            <li> This mascara is wonderful. Long lasting and do not spread under my eyes if I use an oily moisturizer like other mascaras. Keep the eyelashes separated niceley. Really like it.</li>
            <li> Bought this mascara for my 16-year-old daughter, and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara! It goes on smoothly, looks great with a single coat for the day and is smooth enough to use multiple coats for a more dramatic night look. Also, it comes off easily with water and never leaves me with raccoon eyes. I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Excellent mascara! Lengthening and volumizing without clumps. I have tried every mascara and this one truly delivers!</li>
            <li> Great mascara - will continue to purchase this great product!</li>
            <li> honest ok, nothing special</li>
            <li> I use to be a Great Lash user for years. I&#x27;m not sure what they done to it, but it&#x27;s not the same! I&#x27;ve tried every brand out there and disliked them all, until I found &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big!&amp;#34; I have long eyelashes already and had big problems with raccoon eyes and smudging! I also teach bootcamp classes and after class, I&#x27;d have black all over my face! This mascara is the best! No smudging, no flaking, or clumping! My lashes look like they did in high school! I can even put mascara on my bottom lashes with no fear of getting to a mirror and seeing a raccoon in the mirror! I will only buy this mascara from now on! It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Amazing mascara  Makes lashes look like a doll.  Smooth , thin and doesn&#x27;t flake.  One night I fell asleep in my mascara looked the same in the morning. Not that I recommend that.  The brush could be better.</li>
            <li> This mascara is much nicer than many of the more expensive clinique and elizabeth arden products I&#x27;ve bought in the past.  My daughter instantly commented on how long my lashes looked.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used. Period. It stays on until you wash it off. It never runs or flakes. It is expensive, but it lasts me for a long time. I tried to go back to my old cheaper mascara when I ran out and I couldn&#x27;t stand it compared to this. It is worth the cost. I tend to have a nervous habit of picking my mascara off and this stuff put an end to that as well.</li>
            <li> I will not be buying again, though I will finish using this tube. It&#x27;s just OK. I&#x27;ve been used to &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; formula mascara that truly lasts until you take it off, and comes off in one solid piece with water (such as Blinc). I&#x27;ve decided I have to stick with that cause the flakes of mascara that come off after a while and irritates my eyes. Yes, I&#x27;m bad and will sleep in my makeup if I have a late night out. I can&#x27;t get away with sleeping in this and showering in the morning...I wake up with pissed off eyes and black flakes everywhere. It&#x27;s also not especially volumizing or lengthening. It&#x27;s just ... meh.</li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have tried other masacaras of this calibre but this one by far works best. My lashes are longer and thicker with no clumping or flaking. It is a bit pricey but other brands that cost as much took several layers to achieve the same look and in the end they flaked off and irritated  my eyes. I didn&#x27;t  get that with Elizabeth Mott.</li>
            <li> Really like it very much and have bought several for gifts.  I had been using blinc which I also liked over other products but find this even better.  Just gave it to my 15 year old granddaughter as she took off for a Western tour for five weeks, she was thrilled to know she doesn&#x27;t have to apply but once a day and NO black eyes at the end of the day!!!  Hooray!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!  I have bought my 3rd tube and my lashes are longer, also no runs throughout the day. ☺</li>
            <li> LOVE!!! Will keep buying!!!</li>
            <li> This mascara is fantastic if you use it underneath a product that actually does what its job. The only thing I did for me was darken my lashes, it wasn&#x27;t volumizing or lengthening. Bad Gal lash 4E</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this mascara and used it until it was gone and just had to buy a full sized mascara to keep the love going! I&#x27;ve tried lots of different mascaras over the years and this is by far my favorite mascara. It&#x27;s easy to layer to create a high volume look or you can use just a few strokes for an great length and beautiful definition. It also stays on GREAT. NO FLAKING. That&#x27;s a HUGE HUGE HUGE bonus in my book!! I never have to worry that by the end of the day (or night!) I&#x27;m going to have raccoon eyes from my mascara! And I don&#x27;t even have to use primer! Yay! One less step! Woot! I think I&#x27;ve found my forever mascara and that&#x27;s a great feeling.</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting more based on the reviews. This didn&#x27;t do anything for me that the local drug store brand doesn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t smudge.  Fantastic!</li>
            <li> This mascara is mazing. It&#x27;s the only one that really makes my short nonexistent eyelashes long and full. And it also is the only one I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake off after wearing it all day long. I recommend this mascara to all!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this mascara for the third time.  Why?  Because it is truly fantastic!  In between each purchase I have tried other mascaras that have been highly recommended but it turns out they never compare.  And I&#x27;m not comparing this to just drugstore mascaras.  Im comparing it to tarte, Lancôme, clinique, and the list goes on. This mascara thickens, lengthens, doesn&#x27;t clump, and most importantly, stays put all day long with no flaking or bleeding onto the skin.  I find the brush the perfect size for both top and bottom lashes so applying in a rush is quick and easy.  This really is a holy grail mascara!</li>
            <li> I wear glasses and a scrub mask all day. Anyone who&#x27;s ever done that knows what an issue fogging can be, and so mascara usually has to be waterproof or its a no-no because it melts under your eyes. Not this stuff. For me it stays on all day. No raccoon eyes, no melting, no flaking, even when I&#x27;m sweaty or all fogged up. Make my lashes look fattttt. Like seriously, I&#x27;ve never had lashes like this before. Perfect for a fat but natural look, or I can layer on more for some POW if I want it. Virtually weightless. Makes my eyes look huge, but I can&#x27;t ever feel that I have it on. I really struggled with shelling out twenty bucks for mascara, but I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about 2.5 months without any signs of it drying out yet. Will purchase again and again and again. Update: this is my third purchase of this product and I still love it just as much.  I spend virtually NO MONEY on makeup- I make all of my own skincare products and all of the makeup I wear from natural products to be frugal- but THIS... this is something I am willing to continually splurge on.</li>
            <li> I just got my It&#x27;s So Big and tried it yesterday for the first time.  I put my old $6 Mabelline Mega Plush Waterproof on one eye and It&#x27;s So Big on the other.  I have a 20x magnification mirror so meant to check throughout the day.  I forgot and inspected my eyes in the late evening.  To my surprise, my eye with the Maybelline was still covered and had no flakes.  My It&#x27;s So Big eye was COVERED with flakes all around my eye... and nothing left on my lash.  Even after I washed my face, I still had new flakes around my eye.  Not impressed at all and would never spend the $20 again on this product.  Mabelline&#x27;s Falsies and Mega Plush are both much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I did not like this mascara at all.  I bought it because of the positive reviews on Amazon and was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love how this mascara layers!  It doesn&#x27;t get crusty or lump together.  I do have to be careful if wearing liquid liner though because if the liner gets on my lashes, the mascara will clump in that spot.  Great product!!!!</li>
            <li> I love mascara and love to try them all this one was ok but would not get again</li>
            <li> Excellent product and I am enjoying wearing it.  I ride horses all day, live in the pacific northwest where it rains ALOT, and no problem with&lt;br /&gt;it staying in place.  Will continue to use this product, it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous mascaras &amp; decided to give this one a try based on other reviews on Amazon. I&#x27;m so glad I did! It truly lengthens my lashes &amp; does not flake. I am able to workout w/o it running down my face, but it easily washes off w/facial cleanser &amp; water. I have received several compliments on my eyelashes since using this mascara. Definitely worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> I love this product since it doesn&#x27;t leave smearing under your eye. It is just as the reviews promised. I won&#x27;t buy any other brand from now on!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this mascara in a subscription box a while ago and had to have it.  I have thin lashes and It&#x27;s So BIG really defines them, and gives great length.  I also love the fact that it does not go on cakey and gross looking.</li>
            <li> Very nice! It doesn&#x27;t wash off very well but it does make my lashes look amazing. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Works well but a tad overpriced.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am so glad that I found this product on Amazon. I was having difficulties finding a mascara that was  making my lashes look long and full.  So Big Mascara make my lashes look and full of volume. This product is wonderful, much better than the &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; department store brands. Definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> This mascara is just well above the rest.</li>
            <li> Buy Maybelline  This is a joke</li>
            <li> I really liked this mascara and felt it was worth trying out something new. I used to buy Loreal mascaras, but will definitely stay with this new one.</li>
            <li> I have lashes that look Wow with ysl mascara . I Thot I would give this a try&lt;br /&gt;This makes them look really thin and stringy and spaced out like I have no lashes&lt;br /&gt;Terrible for volume !!</li>
            <li> Love.  Well worth the $$$. I get nervous spending over $6 for a tube of mascara but i was not let down. Did not clump or streak.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, will buy again!</li>
            <li> This mascara is, in a word, FANTASTIC. I&#x27;ve used an array of different brands over the years, and this is the first one to ever leave me 100% satisfied every time I&#x27;ve used it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased &#x27;It&#x27;s So BIG&#x27;, I was looking for a mascara that came as close as realistically possible to imitating the look achieved by wearing false lashes. I was NOT disappointed. This is the first mascara I&#x27;ve used that makes my lashes look several times longer and thicker WITHOUT the too-often typical unevenness and clumping that I&#x27;ve experienced with other (lesser) mascaras. I used to waste so much time cleaning up my lashes after applying my old mascaras, because of how chunky/uneven it would look after application. With this stuff? Takes me SECONDS to apply, and I only ever need the one coat. No clean up what-so-ever needed. Never any clumping, looove the application wand shape (which I initially didn&#x27;t think I would), and, for once, actually love my lashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Miss Mott!</li>
            <li> I am a makeup junkie who really just wants to find a product that works consistently. I will like a few things about a product but inevitably it will let me down in some other way sending me back on the hunt for the perfect item. Some mascaras make my lashes look great but then flake all over the place. Others have great wear but are so hard to get off I lose lots of lashes. I have been looking for the perfect mascara since I was in my late teens and I&#x27;m now 34. It&#x27;s hard for me to believe that I can now say I&#x27;ve found it. This mascara DOES IT ALL PERFECTLY. No flaking, drooping or smudging no matter how sweaty the workout, how long the work day or how many endless flights I&#x27;ve been on. The semi dry formula allows me to work at getting my lashes just so for as long as I want with no clumping. It&#x27;s very black so my eyes really pop. When I tightline my top inner rim with this mascara I swear it truly makes me look like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes. I&#x27;ve even worn it in the steam room after a tough workout several times and didn&#x27;t have a speck out of place or any droop. And perhaps the best part for me is that this is the very first mascara that doesn&#x27;t require makeup remover. It washes completely clean with soap and water. WOW!!!  I don&#x27;t know what magic is in this tube but I am so happy that I found it. Kudos on this genius product!!!</li>
            <li> Gives me the same volume and length as other drug store brands. Not worth the price</li>
            <li> makes my eyelash long and beautiful! This product wont makes your eyelash dirty, it looks clear and clean! so good</li>
            <li> I always have the raccoon look with mascara and eyeliner.  This mascara doesn&#x27;t do this.  I am a long time Amazon user (I almost never shop in stores anymore!) and never write reviews, but this one is truly worth the effort.  I won&#x27;t buy another brand!</li>
            <li> I am in my early fifties and have tried many mascara products over the years. It&#x27;s So BIG is really lovely.....easy to apply, light as a feather, no clumping and easy to remove. What more could you ask for? Well done Elizabeth Mott....</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. it does not smudge, it is easy to wash off, it makes the eyelashes appear thicker and longer. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am not impresses by this mascara.  I do find my lashes are longer but only after I brush my lashes out with a different mascara brush.  It&#x27;s an okay product but not one I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This mascara is fine but it&#x27;s not what I was looking for.  It claims to be a volumizing mascara, which is what I need, but I found it to be more of a lengthening mascara.  It can be a bit clumpy and doesn&#x27;t really separate, especially when I use more than one coat in hopes of increased volume.  I appreciate the fact that this is a cruelty-free brand but the product doesn&#x27;t do what I&#x27;m looking for in a mascara.</li>
            <li> Fast and product was as described</li>
            <li> I have wasted so much money on mascaras over the years. This did not coat well and di not help with volume either. I have a lot of eye lashes but thin eye lashes. I always end up back at Lancôme. Bummer.</li>
            <li> Great mascara.  I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like it at all. very lumpy and dry. will not recommend and will never buy again. any $5 mascara from CVS or Walmart is million times better quality.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It&#x27;s never clumpy but very lengthening. Most importantly it stays put. It doesn&#x27;t give you the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Looking 20 years for a mascara this good! Seriously.</li>
            <li> Its good mascara but I wouldn&#x27;t go far as to say &amp;#34;Its So BIG Volumizing&amp;#34; I still have to use my 3D Fibers lol</li>
            <li> Wow. I&#x27;ve tried so many different mascaras in the past, even ones with brand names and stuff, but nothing EVER came close to this. This is the best and most beautiful mascara ever. Plus it lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smear (I don&#x27;t touch my face/especially eyes anyway unless I&#x27;m applying or cleaning it). This is coming from someone whose eyelashes are not thick or long looking on their own.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great lengthening and volumizing mascara.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars because i think its in no way a perfect mascara for me. The wand is not a shape I like and it takes a few coats to get my eyelashes where I want them to be. That being said, this is the ONLY mascara I have ever used that literally doesn&#x27;t move a single centimeter all throughout the day. You will get home from whatever you were doing all day and it will look exactly as it did that morning when you put it on. And yet it is extremely easy to wash off. Again its not perfect but for now its benefits highly outweigh its downfalls for me.</li>
            <li> It works well for me. As an older person, it has been difficult to find a product that works for me.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever!! My eyelashes never looked so long</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look amazing with this product! It gives tons of fullness and length without getting clumpy or flaking. It&#x27;s my new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be the greatest mascara ever, but it was a little dry and not very lengthening or volumizing.  I was not impressed.  Bobbi Brown&#x27;s Smokey Eye is FAR better.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of coats to make this mascara work, but it looks good when you are done.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the great reviews here but I would definitely not purchase again. This mascara gives me the spider leg lashes without fail. It&#x27;s very thin and goes sticky,  so the lashes stick together and they feel very brittle. Overall I felt like my lashes would start breaking if I continued use. I also think this is a better lengthening mascara than a volumizing one should you choose to buy it.</li>
            <li> Brush leaves mascara application a little thin but the consistency is great</li>
            <li> Not as much volume as I expected.</li>
            <li> Love this and if it lasted longer I&#x27;d give it a 5 star review</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara. Doesn&#x27;t clump. Good lash separation and lengthening. Stayed put for a long time. I&#x27;m very picky about mascara so I was really happy that I found this one. The only thing is that is makes my eyes sting a little. :(</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would survive in the Florida heat without melting down my face. I have not had any issues with it running and it provides a nice, lengthening coverage.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product based off the reviews.  I have tried numerous mascaras and have wasted money on many.  My eyes and skin are sensitive.  I do not have problems with this mascara.  It is easy to apply.  This is my second time purchasing this product.  Just order it now!!</li>
            <li> The best mascara I have ever had!  Finally a product that stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t smear under my eues.  Easy to take off too.  I have sensitive eyes and this mascara is the best!  I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Lefts the say the only thing I like about this mascara is the ease of washing it. Other than that it suck!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it .its mess my eyelashes .not good at all</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend $20 on mascara, especially if it didn&#x27;t fare any better than the cheap stuff I buy at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.  The brush feels different from the moment you take it out of the tube.  It&#x27;s not too thick, so it doesn&#x27;t clump on your lashes.  It doesn&#x27;t stick them together like spider legs, either.</li>
            <li> This mascara was WAY too expensive. I was extremely disappointing in the look I got out of this as well as the finish, its constantly smudging and flaking. Makes my lashes look like insect legs after 1 coat and gets all over my eye lid when applying.</li>
            <li> Great mascara overall.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully! Very happy with the product as well as the quick processing of my order.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best mascara I&#x27;ve had.  I have short, thin lashes.  This is a miracle product.</li>
            <li> This mascara is just OK.  I didn&#x27;t notice my lashes to look thicker or longer than with any&lt;br /&gt;drug store mascara.  Not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This mascara does not volumize, as some reviews claim it does.  Good for lengthening lashes.</li>
            <li> Not a good formula. Goes on thin</li>
            <li> I started off with a sample of their mascara and fell in love. I also have short and somewhat skimpy lashes, and these can easily be layered on. Doesn&#x27;t flake off or give you panda eyes at the end of the day. I also love that it washes away easily with warm water so that you&#x27;re not rubbing your eyes/damaging the delicate skin with a cleanser.</li>
            <li> Long plump movie star lashes. It&#x27;s so incredibly easy to clean off with no black sludge left on my face like other more expensive mascaras. Beautiful price and it lasts forever! Absolutely love this mascara, stop looking around and buy it already!</li>
            <li> So I was super excited to get this mascara because I read all the reviews and they made it seem like this was the best mascara in the world.  I was so dissapointed because this mascara did not volumize nor did it make my eyelashes look fuller.  I naturally have long lashes they just need a little &amp;#34;umph&amp;#34; to make them look fuller and darker and this didn&#x27;t do it for me.  I have seen better results from the Maybeline Power Volume 24 H mascara.  All in all, this product fell SHORT.</li>
            <li> Definitely works.  I tend to prefer mascara that is lengthening and I was afraid that this would make my lashes too thick but it does not.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long and dark eyelashes, but like using a mascara that plays them up and adds a little volume. I also usually use waterproof versions to avoid flaking and smudging. This mascara gives great definition with no clumping, and I&#x27;ve worn it all day without flakes, smudges, or irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the perfect mascara for a long time. Once, all I really needed was the mascara that didn&#x27;t smudge and flake, because that gets to be a literal pain, as I wear contacts. But, after chemo and low thyroid took their toll, my nearly invisible lashes needed more! I love this mascara because it&#x27;s easy to apply, easy to remove, never ever flakes or smudges, lasts all day, and looks incredible. My sister even has asked me if I am wearing false eyelashes! So, from next to invisible to wow! That&#x27;s this mascara for me.</li>
            <li> Great mascara and fast shipping!  This really makes my eyelashes look fuller. Thank you</li>
            <li> Best Mascara! I have almost no eyelashes and this perks up the ones I do have :)</li>
            <li> The positive reviews I read about this mascara were spot on.  It goes on easily with little clumping.  There is no fallout throughout the day.  My lashes didn&#x27;t look huge, but there clearly are thickening fibers in the product.  I am happy with the results after using this.</li>
            <li> After many years of searching for a mascara I can finally say that I have found a &amp;quot;keeper&amp;quot;.  This mascara provides the length and fullness I was looking for and it easily washes off without any scrubbing! I would recommend this to anyone!  Thank you</li>
            <li> WOW. This mascara is so worth it. I have always been wary of splurging on mascara. There&#x27;s so many drugstore brands and styles and formulas to choose from, why would I ever spend more than $10 on a mascara? Well, my last mascara was at the end of its life, so it was time for a new one. I found this one through amazon&#x27;s lovely review system, and it&#x27;s got a ton of amazing reviews. I figured, what the heck, I&#x27;ll spend a bit more just to see if it&#x27;s worth it. SO WORTH IT. I have eyelashes, and they&#x27;re clump free, flake free, long and dark and lovely! Love the mascara, and will totally have to try out the other products from this company.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. My eyelashes aren&#x27;t very long but whatever it is in this stuff makes them look longer!</li>
            <li> Great mascara! Doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes feel dried out. My new favorite!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal! Legitimately the first mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump, is easy to take off, and doesn&#x27;t smudge. Some mascaras tend to bother my contacts throughout the day because of flaking, but this stuff only needs one application, and it stays until you take it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mascara connoisseur; I&#x27;ve been using mascara for many years. I HAD to have this one, as the reviews made it sound better than sliced bread. I must say, not only is it mediocre, it is high-priced, considering the lackluster way it performs. I&#x27;ve been using Benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real,&amp;#34; and find that to be exceptional in every way. &amp;#34;It&#x27;s SO Big&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real!&amp;#34; The wand is very thin, the mascara comes out of the container with a long thread of mascara hanging off, the resulting lashes are skinny and require numerous coats for length--and my eyelashes are already long! Not worth your while. &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; has no competition from this mascara!</li>
            <li> This really does lengthen your eyelashes and separates them really well. Never have to worry about &amp;#34;spider eyes&amp;#34;. Doesn&#x27;t clump. Would buy again!!! Works great on bottom lashes. A lot of mascara goes on too heavy on the bottom but this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  No clumps, long lasting.  A little difficult to remove but that won&#x27;t stop me from buying again.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth order of Elizabeth Mott mascara. No other mascara I&#x27;ve used is as good as this one.I use it daily and am completely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I really love the brush and this does not clump at all but I do need to put multiple layers on.  In fact I use another mascara underneath it in order to get the type of darkness I am looking for.  Now, I don&#x27;t have very many or very thick lashes so I have yet to find a product that I don&#x27;t need to layer with other mascaras as well.  ONe thing I do like is that I know this will not clump when putting it on so I love how it separates my lashes which is why I use it over another one.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara. Every product that Elizabeth Mott puts out I fall in love with, but this mascara is something special! It gives you the best lashes for an all day effect. I would put this macara on in the morning, and when I came home at night, my lashes still looked great. I also love the dark color this provides.</li>
            <li> Pretty good. I&#x27;ve found a better brand in the drug store I&#x27;m happier with, but this one is pretty good. If I use it with a different applicator, I get better results.</li>
            <li> I first got a sample of this mascara and have been using while I travel for work. I love it. My lashes stand out and the biggest bonus it does not flake and washes of REALLY well. I have no dark smudge&#x27;s or anything. I highly recommend this mascara!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara!! And it&#x27;s not tested on animals!</li>
            <li> First purchased this product in December 2014. Loved the mascara, so purchased another to have on-hand when first one was getting low. Unfortunately, just started using the second one and it was very dry...almost as the end-of-use of the first one. It also flaked and left little black pieces on my face. That did NOT happen with the original mascara. I hesitate to order another, but I did like the first one very much.</li>
            <li> Originally got this mascara in one of my subscription boxes (forget which one).  This is a great mascara! Doesn&#x27;t clump, lengthens, and is a nice dark black.  It seems to work better when there is less product on the brush. Makeup removers don&#x27;t work very well to take this off, but plain ol&#x27; water works just great!  I do with it curled my lashes more, but I guess I could just use a curler...</li>
            <li> This is great. Doesnt smear in the water and can remove easily with warm water.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and is not clumpy at all.  And the best part, there are no dark smudges under my eyes when I wake up in morning.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a mascara like this one for probably 10 years. I have very oily skin and I also sweat a lot. I am someone who does not work at a desk, I am a veterinary technician and also a waitress so I am always on the move when I am working, constantly lifting things and working up a good sweat, especially in the summer time. I am a makeup junkie. There are a lot of things I can buy at the drug store and not spend lots of money on and still get great results but unfortunately mascara is not one of them. I have tried every single mascara could find, from the most expensive to the cheapest. I absolutely LOVE Benefits they&#x27;re real but in 5 minutes the mascara is all over my face and by the end of a busy night at work I have big dark circles from it. Certainly not worth $28. I also really love Fiberwig mascara by Imufiju or however you spell it, but it still would sometimes flake off my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is a GOD SEND! It volumizes, curls and stays on my lashes all night long no matter how oily my skin gets or how sweaty I am! I bought this because of the reviews but was still skeptical because like I said before I have never, EVER found a mascara that stayed on me as long as this one does!! I will never buy another mascara again. This is the only one I will ever wear. I promise you if you have oily skin or are someone who sweats a lot this is the mascara for you!! I have hunted all my life for a mascara like this and so happy I have found it. THANK YOU ELIZABETH MOTT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love with this mascara.  When they say it does not glop or rub off, believe it.  It is not a heavy mascara so those who want more of an impact may need primer.  For us over 50&#x27;s it is very appropriate, very black (don&#x27;t let that scare you-we need it).  I do need more than my usual gentle cleanser to remove but it is easy with any makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge, doesn&#x27;t flake,  awesome definition and added length!!! I have found my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; mascara!!!!! Really impressed by the no smudges! I wear heavy eye cream and it still doesn&#x27;t smudge! Comes off easily with the cleaning oil I use also!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my eyes pop. Doesn&#x27;t flake either and comes off with makeup remover,</li>
            <li> I bought this to compare to the Younique 3D fiber lash mascara. I really like this one as it smudges a lot less. No raccoon eyes! I still use my 3D for date night or other special occasions, but I love this one for everyday use. It lasts a long time and comes off easily with coconut oil. It&#x27;s my new go to mascara. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many mascaras...from cheap to pricey. I was actually looking to buy the &amp;#34;Better Than Sex&amp;#34; mascara and opted due to rave reviews and price to go for this one. I am a school teacher so I am running around and rarely get to look in any mirror to check the makeup status. I adore this stuff. I will be buying more. I hate the new mascaras that make your lashes look way too thick. It makes you end up looking like a caterpillar has dropped dead across your eyes. This mascara adds enough volume without looking chunky and artificial. The lengthening is fantastic. I can confidently wear just this when I don&#x27;t want to put on all my war paint. Washing it off is a dream....Soap and water and that is it. Is has yet to smudge or get that black mess below my eyes when I am perspiring. The test was last Saturday as I was the wedding planner for my daughters wedding and running ragged puts it mildly. It passed that test no problem. I highly recommend this to anyone who is sick to deal of trying &amp;#34;the next best thing&amp;#34; in mascaras only to toss it to the back of a drawer and continue the search. I usually don&#x27;t go on and on about makeup products but this one deserves it.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing mascara I&#x27;ve ever used...and trust me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them! Not only does it find every single little lash and coat it in fabulousness, but it doesn&#x27;t smear, smudge, or clump..not even in water! And my favorite thing about it? How easily it&#x27;s removed. It&#x27;s like magic! How does this mascara know to only come off when you WANT it to come off?! No makeup remover required. It literally just slides right off your lashes. I will never have to try another brand of mascara again. My search has ended, my journey is complete. Thank you, Elizabeth Mott!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have used and I have tried every expensive brand sold in department stores. I received this in my Ipsy subscription and just loved it. Great look. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes and best of all no raccoon smudges. I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> This is the best if you want some serious volume. It is a fiber mascara so it adds length while making the base of my lashes look SO full. If you like the false eyelash look, then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did an in depth review of my top 4 favorite mascaras on my blog: http://www.newlyag.com/the-final-four/&lt;br /&gt; hope this helps!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I live in HOT, HUMID South Carolina, and, yay! I have oily skin. I tried for almost 13 years to find the best drugstore mascara that could lengthen, thicken, curl, and most of all, STAY ON. I have spent YEARS looking in mirrors and cleaning up all the &amp;#34;heroin chic&amp;#34; smearing and running under my eyes. I LOVE Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real, but I couldn&#x27;t justify $24 a tube for mascara. For the last year or two, I started layering regular mascara with waterproof on top, to get it to come off easily and still stay on. But, if I&#x27;m using 2 decent drugstore mascaras, that&#x27;s costing me close to $20 anyways! Then, I finally tried this, and let me tell ya, ITS AWESOME. My eyelashes are semi thick, but short and they stick straight out. This mascara lengthens, curls, thickens, and when I have two coats on, they almost look false. And BEST OF ALL- IT STAYS ON!! through an entire humid low country humid day, AND a workout, and even at the beach. I am THRILLED with this product, its well worth the couple extra bucks to not have to use two mascaras that aren&#x27;t near as good to begin with</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great mascara!</li>
            <li> Sincerely the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I have such fine, short lashes that its hard to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t make them look like 2 spiders stuck to my eyelids! :) This product when used in conjunction with the Lash Card makes me look like I have natural, long lashes. I won&#x27;t use anything else. I&#x27;ve found my mascara &amp;#34;home&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy. I have tried Lancome&#x27;, Bobby Brown, Clinique, Estee Lauder and Dior and this by far is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  I wore it all day and didn&#x27;t have raccoon eyes by the end of the day.  The brush is a really great design.  Keep up the good work and I&#x27;ll be looking at your other products!!</li>
            <li> I have tried every product to make my eyelashes thicker and longer looking.  This is the first mascara that really works and NEVER FLAKES.  I really love it.  The only issue you need to know is that it takes quite a bit of time to apply if you want a super full clean look.  If you put it on quick and thick it looks clumpy.  It goes on better with three very thin layers.</li>
            <li> The good: It makes your lashes seriously long. It basically looks like you applied natural fake lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: It irritates my eyes and when removing my makeup there are fibers all over my face.</li>
            <li> This was a real disappointment. The mascara was gloppy, hard to apply, flaked off by the end of the day, and my eye lids were burning badly. Ugh!  My Maybelline from the drugstore is a far superior product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Lancome, Tarte, Ulta, Elizabeth Arden...etc.  mascara&#x27;s and I think they all have they cons and pros, but I really like this one.  It&#x27;s my everyday use one.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, unfortunately. The L&#x27;Oreal mascara I&#x27;ve used for years gives me much longer and thicker lashes than this. I will stick to my drugstore brand!</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara. It does what is says, no surprise!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this mascara!!! Does not smudge and long lasting! I&#x27;m 37 and my lashes have thinned out over the years. This is the only mascara I have found that hides the imperfections. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and cannot do many waterproof mascaras without major irritation. This mascara isn&#x27;t necessarily &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; but stays on fantastically all day even when my eyes water (they do that a lot-- very sensitive eyes) and it has even held up just as good as any waterproof mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried even when swimming at the water-park. And the big bonus is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and I can just wipe it off with my regular face cleansing wipes at night easily. It does seem to clump a little and not go on as smoothly after a few weeks, but the benefits far outweigh the negatives.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  I love this mascara.  And the delivery was FAST!</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara because of the Prime access, however it was nothing extraordinary. I likely will not use it again.  It did not seem as thick and rich as other products with the same price range. It was not horrible, just average.</li>
            <li> This is ok I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara!  I&#x27;ve tried all the big name brands and was constantly disappointed by mid-day flakes and/or clumps.  This mascara goes on smoothly and really lengthens my lashes.  Lasts all day and comes off with regular facial wash.  I&#x27;d recommend this mascara to anyone!</li>
            <li> ehhh... i always use loreal voluminous in carbon black but i decided to give this a try... overall, voluminous make the lashes thicker, and its so big makes them longer but not as full. ill post an update at the end of the day as to which flaked or whatnot, but overall i still like loreal more.  in pic #1: looking at the photo from where you are, the eye on the right side of the photo is voluminous and the left is its so big. i put about 3 generous coats on each lash.  pic #2: voluminous from the side  pic #3: its so big from the side  keep in mind: i also have really short shi**y eyelashes so... and i have had eyelash extensions which ruined some of my natural lashes on both sides.  *****UPDATE: so the day has dwindled by... its so big looks exactly the same and still has it length while voluminous has flaked off and lost a lot of definition. id say i like them both equally in diff ways at this point.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;m somewhat obsessed with having full and long lashes. I have a really hard time finding a mascara that doesn&#x27;t weigh my eyelashes down. I like my lashes to look curled, separated, full, and long! I know that&#x27;s a lot to ask for. Most mascarras end up actually straightening out my eyelashes even after I use the eyelash curler. But not this one! I get everything out of it that I want!</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t my favorite mascara. It&#x27;s tough to remove and almost a bit too oily to create a full lash effect. I almost wanted to be a tad bit more dense or perhaps even dry. It gets an A for effort.</li>
            <li> So happy with this mascara!  It works like an expensive mascara without going into a department store to buy it. I have absolutely no success with drug store mascaras and I&#x27;m happy to have discovered this product.  I&#x27;m 54 and my lashes are fading and thinning, so I just put 2 coats on for the day and 3 for an evening out.  Its just perfect!  It washes off nicely with a mild soap in the shower and if I still have a little under the eye, it&#x27;s nothing a good eye make-up remover can,t get!</li>
            <li> Incredible...this mascara is the best I&#x27;ve ever used! I get long dark lashes, no clumps at all. No smearing or flaking, and most of the time I don&#x27;t curl my eyelashes before I use this mascara. I will never buy anything else... It&#x27;s perfection!</li>
            <li> I stopped using mascara a couple of years ago due to dry eyes and allergies. After reading the reviews, I decided to give this a try. It&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. The coverage can be thin or thicker, depending on preference, and it doesn&#x27;t smear. It&#x27;s also easy to remove. All around, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful mascara, it stays on well and will not smudge, which has always been an issue for me! The only bummer is this order, the mascara was a bit clumpy so I wonder if I got one that was old or in an odd part of the warehouse. Oh, well, it&#x27;s still much better than alternatives I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve tried em all!!). Won&#x27;t bother my sensitive eyes, either. Great product and wonderful customer service.</li>
            <li> The Big Volumizing Mascara that I ordered is clumpy and dried out.  I don&#x27;t expect it to last long.</li>
            <li> Oh Elizabeth Mott, where have you been all my life? Love this mascara. Doesn&#x27;t clump, stays put, and lasts all day long - everything that I&#x27;m looking for in a mascara! I only need 2 swipes and I&#x27;m good to go! Very happy with this mascara :)</li>
            <li> I received this mascara as a gift and loved it so much I bought another for myself once it ran out. Nothing compares!  It is so easy to put on, and it makes my lashes look thicker, fuller and much longer.  One of my friends even asked me if I recently got eyelash extensions.  It doesn&#x27;t run below my eyes throughout the day --with most other brands I feel like I am constantly wiping underneath my eyes with my fingers.  When I want to take it off at the end of the day, it glides off of my eyelashes easily without damaging them.</li>
            <li> I love love this product!</li>
            <li> I tried this mascara based on the reviews that I read online here at Amazon and I&#x27;m not disappointed, I really like it.  It may just be the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My lashes have never looked better! Paired with my Shu Uemura eyelash curler, ice been getting compliments left and right! Great mascara!</li>
            <li> Not impressed, I couldn&#x27;t get a thickness to my lashes and I ended up using my old MAC brush (from a dried out tube of mascara) for the mascara.  I did not like the odd-shaped brush, though I was willing to try it.  I have long and good lashes but this product didn&#x27;t really do much.  Won&#x27;t buy again.  I prefer my MAC mascara.</li>
            <li> I tried this after getting a sample in my Ipsy bag and finally had to buy a full size tube. It&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. Builds nicely for either a clean (not clumpy!) look, or a more dramatic (still not clumpy!) look. It coats your lashes and will not smear or smudge, but comes off completely with soap and warm water. Nice brush with a curved shape to it makes it easy to apply. Friendly seller and prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this mascara mainly because it was quite reasonably priced. I&#x27;m very happy I did. I typically use several combination mascaras&lt;br /&gt;after watching an Oprah episode. I use this particular mascara first. It is a great base for others. I&#x27;ve tried so many and this one is the best. The second coat with the other brands go on nicely and make my lashes pop. Definitely will buy again. Doesn&#x27;t clump, wand is great for lower lashes, and nice rich black color c</li>
            <li> Have only been using a few days, but this seems to be an excellent mascara - it goes on smoothly without any flaking and with minimal glooping (is that a word?)  I hope the tube lasts me a while and maintains its initial integrity.  Will report back later!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many different types of mascara,  this one is the best! It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t  smear. I just ordered some more. Excellent!</li>
            <li> not what i expected, L&#x27;ORÉAL Voluminous Volume Building Mascara does a better job for less money</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on without clumping and stays on. I was looking for a cruelty free product and this one it meets all of my requirements for a good mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was expecting something great and it was just average.  I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference (except the price) from my usual drugstore brand mascara.  It was also a pain to remove and pulled my eyelashes out with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where all of the five star reviews are coming from. I used this mascara twice and both times, it flaked horribly and gave me smudges both under my eyes and on my brow bone.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s listed as being a volumizing and lengthening, making your eyes look bigger and your lashes darker, fuller and thicker. It did none of those for me, it just made a flaky, smeary mess.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it was not at all worth it. Drugstore brands work better. Returned it and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara....the only reason I am not giving it a 5 star rating is because while it really is sweat, oily skin, smudge, etc proof, it is not water proof.  I take my mascara off once a week and just do touch ups during the week, even sleeping &amp; showering in my current mascara.  I was so excited when I applied this great mascara, it looked awesome, didn&#x27;t curl my top lashes down or bottom lashes up on the ends like some do, but really looked great..... I even slept in it and woke up excited how good they still looked with no smearing or raccoon eyes at all, but then when I took a shower, much to my dismay, it practically all come off in the shower with hardly any mascara left on my eyelashes.  Oh how I wish this mascara came in waterproof also.  I would buy it in a heart-beat!  I gave my tube to my sister that doesn&#x27;t use waterproof, knowing with confidence she will love it!  Totally worth the money if you don&#x27;t need true waterproof mascara!</li>
            <li> I very much enjoyed the make up and it came to my house very quickly. Absolutely positively no complaints here!</li>
            <li> This mascara definitely adds length to lashes, however it doesnt really add volume for me personally. I have given this product three stars as opposed to 4 due to the fact that it is hard for me to remove. I use the same eye makeup remover that I have used to remove other various types of mascara, with no issues or rubbing. However this mascara is very persistent and tenacious, which is a great feature in some regards but not for removal.</li>
            <li> Really liking this product!  I do feel like I need two coats of this on though......pretty much love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on ratings and was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I have sooo much looove for this mascara!!! It makes my lashes look so fat and thick!!!</li>
            <li> Mascara stays on all day, no running, no smearing, and comes off easily when it&#x27;s time to wash your face!! It adds some volume with zero clumping. Not as nice as other mascaras(in the volume department) I&#x27;ve tried BUT everything else about this product is so great I can&#x27;t complain!!! I will for sure be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s way more volumizing than expected and I have been through a lot of different mascara brands! It can be a little clumpy, but it&#x27;s not awful. I just use a lash brush and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara. It gives your lashes length and volume AND it lasts all day without giving you raccoon eyes. I also love how it doesn&#x27;t clump together when applying. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it really works very well. Doesn&#x27;t come off or flake at all. Great product. I will definately buy this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this mascara, compared to Benefit, MAC, and store brands this is by far my favorite for a dramatic lasting look.</li>
            <li> For the price I was expecting easy application and a great look. Unfortunately this mascara is very clumpy, with extra goop coming out on the wand every time and not evenly distributing on the wand. I use an old wand to comb through my lashes after I use this. Also, it&#x27;s really hard to take off and leaves a build up that makes application even harder the next day.</li>
            <li> I am pretty pleased with this mascara. Although it is a  toss up between So Big and the one I have been using by Bare Minerals. They each have their pros. Nearly the same price point. Both give nice length. I think this one gives a cleaner look, while the other brand gives more volume. Hopefully by the time the tubes are empty I will have made a decision.</li>
            <li> I am seriously not the type to leave a review, but this is by far the best mascara I have tried in the past 20 years.  I have tried Dior iconic, bad gal, clinique, etc etc etc.. I have tried over the years all the top rated one&#x27;s, this is amazing.  Every lash separate, long, and as thick as you want it.  It does not run and stays that way ALL DAY LONG.... Seriously all day add though it had just been applied!&lt;br /&gt;This is my new mascara for life</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara.  I previously used Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real mascara and had recommended it to friends, but now I am recommending this product. I loved the lengthening effects of They&#x27;re Real, but it was prone to flaking and was difficult to remove at the end of the day.  And it would start to get a bit clumpy about 4 weeks in to the tube. THIS mascara gives me the same lengthening effects, but it is so lightweight, is easy to remove at the end of the day and NO flaking or running.  And it creates a beautiful, natural look, defining each and every lash. I&#x27;ve already received compliments from two co-workers in the first week of using this product. So, I told them to go to the Elizabeth Mott site to get It&#x27;s So BIG samples for themselves...I know they&#x27;ll be buying the full size soon.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST mascara I have ever used!! It washes off easily but will NEVER smudge it stays on my lashes even if I sleep with it on. I love the way my lashes look and feel. I don&#x27;t think I will ever use another mascara.</li>
            <li> I am on the hunt for the perfect mascara. I have been for at least 15 years. I bought this one because of the other reviews and have tried no other products from this company. On day one I was not happy with it, but each mascara has it&#x27;s own technique for obtaining the desired look.  This one requires even pressure from the  base of the lash all the way to the tip and needs about three coats and then it&#x27;s perfect.  I would have given it a five, but is like it to do more thickening in addition to the lengthening. The determining factor will be if it starts clumping in a few weeks. If not, then I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara now. I&#x27;ve tried a number of macara&#x27;s and none have worked better then this one.</li>
            <li> Love my new mascara. It&#x27;s really different compared to others; doesn&#x27;t smudge, comes off easily and clean.</li>
            <li> I am obviously in the minority but I don&#x27;t like this mascara. It does not give enough volume and smudges easily. Don&#x27;t hate it enough to return but won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Good mascara.  It does not clump and goes on smooth.  You lashes definitely are more defined. Does not rub off during the day.  I would have liked it to be a little thicker or bolder.  The only other issue is when you wash it off it gets kind of clumpy under your eyes.  It is fine - not sure it is worth $20.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on previous reviews of this product. I went on vacation to the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands. I mention this as the majority of time there I was not only in the water a great deal of the time, but I there was also a great deal of heat and humidity at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was EXTREMELY happy with how this held up in both situations! I alway use a cotton square to take some of the product off of the brush when using mascara. I not only liked how this held up, the application was easy and even. I have used both Urban Decay and Clinique makeup removers to take this off and both worked perfectly to fully remove this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would confirm that all other positive reviews of this product are correct.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a mascara that does not give me raccoon eyes! It&#x27;s a wonderful product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Goes on smooth. Lashes look great.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara thus far.  I often use it with a 3D fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! The only mascara I&#x27;ve found that stays on all day without giving me Raccoon eyes! I was a little worried at first because the product seemed thin and not very &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; but the product thickened up after a well of use and now I&#x27;m satisfied! Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li> I really loved this mascara. However, there are a few things they could improve upon. I have read many posts about how it stays on in rain and humidity. It does not at all for me! The fibers flake off in our Virginia summer weather. I was also recently caught in a rainstorm. It bled all over my cheeks and made my eyes burn like crazy the rest of the night! Even the next morning they felt a little irritated. It is an amazing mascara on a dry day in a less than 50% humidity climate.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara !! The color is a nice dark black that stays put &amp; can easily be applied layer on top of layer and so on</li>
            <li> I keep putting it on but it&#x27;s not doing anything for me.</li>
            <li> I have Japanese background and have short and thin eyelashes. This this is great to add length but, does not thicken as well as other brands I have tried. My eyes tend to dry out fairly easily, I have not felt itchy eyes or irritated eyes with this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara!  It&#x27;s easy to use, smooth and lengthens my lashes.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara ever. Applies easily without clumps, no flakes, stays on all day without smudging, washes off very easily. Best mascara ever.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever...love it</li>
            <li> I got a sample size of this product in an Ipsy bag a few years ago. I usually use mascaras with a price point of $30+ (Lancome, Dior, etc.) and this is by far my favorite formula with a great price. Nice true black color. Smudge proof but removes with water. It&#x27;s very similar to my favorite mascara from Trish McEvoy but less expensive and I feel more volumizing.  I like that I can go swimming, to the gym or jump in the shower and not have black running down my face with a huge mess on my face. Having it Prime is a plus and super convenient!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. I have thin fine lashes. This product adds WOW!  Lashes are fuller longer thicker without smudging and easy to remove  without irritation or black eye look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this mascara! I&#x27;ve ordered a sample from Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s website and I&#x27;ve used the product now for about 2 weeks. I have many other pretty good mascaras in my collection but I cannot force myself to put anything else on my lashes any more, it&#x27;s that good! My eyelashes are long and curled but very thin and blond. The coverage is perfect, no clumps!!! and when my eyelashes touch my upper eye they do not leave any traces of mascara. I&#x27;m an RN and even when I help my patients take a shower the mascara stays put, but when I wash it off it comes off easily. My eyes are also very sensitive but no irritation with this product occurred. I&#x27;m about to order a full size and one more for my sister.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing! Don&#x27;t pay attention to the bad reviews, this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this mascara a couple of times now. This is the best mascara by far. I work 14 hour days, this does not run, flake and I don&#x27;t need to apply during the day. Even works great with lash extensions !! No damage to them at all. Stays on so well but comes off easy. And the staff treat you so well. Only mascara for me!!</li>
            <li> I usually use a more expensive brand but I&#x27;m happy with this one as well.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look fuller than with any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried...and I&#x27;ve tried a lot!! Lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t flake. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews on this product before buying it. The reviews were correct. No clumping and my lashes are longer and stayed curled all day. I would buy this mascara again. I have used Tarte, Dior, NYX, and many, many other brands, but so far I like the way this one works and stays on all day.  I saw some people&#x27;s reviews about removal and I can give one tip for any mascara-baby oil works wonders on removing eyeliner and mascara. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I got a sample size of this mascara with my Ipsy subscription...the rest is history. It goes on smooth, DOES NOT FLAKE, SMEAR OR CLUMP, even after a 12 hour day. No more raccoon eyes. Comes off with warm water, no left over residue like my old mascara (Maybelline used to be my go-to mascara, never again). Makes my eyelashes look longer and thicker. Works great with my contacts. Well worth the price. Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> This is my 3nd order of this mascara.  Best I have ever used.  Will keep ordering.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best mascara I have ever used!  I have tried all price ranges and nothing can compare to this product.  It applies easily with no clumping.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I got my first sample of this mascara in my Ipsy bag, and there is just no other mascara like it.&lt;br /&gt;I love how it feels, washes off, and looks all day!</li>
            <li> SIMPLY THE BEST MASCARA I HAVE EVER USED. AND BELIEVE ME I&#x27;VE USED PLENTY. I FEEL LIKE A MOVIE STAR WHEN I WEAR IT lol</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my eyelashes fuller and longer, and, when paired with my trusty eyelash curler, my lashes have never looked better!  My students even noticed... one of my 6th graders asked me what kind of mascara I wore the first day I tried this!  And I always wear mascara every day, it was only noticed after I started wearing this!  Thank you so much for making such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried! I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands and this stuff makes my lashes look so much longer and thicker than any other kind. Will be loyal to this brand from now on :)</li>
            <li> Does not perform as advertised, clumps and flakes when trying to remove.  I can&#x27;y recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it! I usually use crinique mascsra. So big  has almost same function, but it makes my eyelash longer. I&#x27;m gonna use this brand&#x27;s mascara all my life.</li>
            <li> No problems with clumping or flaking. Exactly what I was looking for in a mascara for years. Glad I finally found it.</li>
            <li> Since I was 15 and was allowed to wear make up, putting on mascara was a staple in my makeup routine. I was unfortunately blessed with short stubby eye lashes. I don&#x27;t need just length, but volume also. Most mascaras claim to do both, but usually lack in one way or another. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever bought a mascara online and not in a drug store off the shelf. I&#x27;m SO glad I decided to take the chance! With only 1 coat, this mascara lengthens and thickens my lashes like no other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. The consistency is perfect! Not too thin or thick, genius applicator brush! **trick: spin brush as you coat your lashes for a full wide eyed look! And one of the coolest things about this mascara is that it looks tremendous on lower lashes if you have a light hand and are careful with your brush! I highly recommend this It&#x27;s SO BIG! to any girl! Plus, it washes out without having to scratch your skin or eye off! Yay!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with results - I have sensitive eyes and most mascaras irritate my eyes (have tried SO MANY)- no problem here - not sure how long it will last but so far, Great!</li>
            <li> I have oily eye lids and most mascara ends up under my eyes after a couple hours, so I&#x27;m always excited when I find one that doesn&#x27;t.  This stays put all day and defines the lashes in a very natural way.  You look like a person, not a doll, but it doesn&#x27;t flake or smear.  It&#x27;s a great natural looking mascara for everyday.</li>
            <li> What I love about this mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t smears or leaves under eye black marks :)</li>
            <li> one of the few mascaras i can use without it smudging. i had gotten a sample, and used it up quickly, so i ordered the full size, and i like it even better!</li>
            <li> The lashes looks longer than using my cover girl mascara but not a BIG difference that I would die for. The biggest downfall is that it makes my eyes irritated and red, I thought it was because of allergy season so I stopped using it and use my cover girl instead and it stopped?! So I gave it a try once more and once again I felt like my eyes were so itchy that it will fall off from me rubbing it. I don&#x27;t know if it happened to other customers before, might vary depending on the sensitivity of their eyes but this is my unpleasant experience with &amp;#34;it&#x27;s so BIG&amp;#34;!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every mascara out there and this one is by far my favorite!  Extends my lashes so much, they brush against my eyeglasses.  I&#x27;m not making this up, skimpy lashes go BIG!  I put only one coat for daily use or layer it up a little for major impact.  Also, I have to say how convenient it is to just order from Amazon with one click, and as an Amazon Prime member, get it in 2 days.  I hardly even have to think about it and best of all, no battle against the dreaded forces at the mall/nearest makeup counter.</li>
            <li> Great mascara! Plumps up sad little lashes and gives a very natural and feminine look. Love the brand and love the quality!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy how often I&#x27;m asked if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes, and I get to say &amp;#34;Nope, they&#x27;re mine!&amp;#34;, all thanks to this amazing mascara! I got it as a sample in an Ipsy box and had to buy another tube of it b/c it is so amazing. It stays on great for 14+ hours. I&#x27;ve worn it during sweaty workouts and it stays put on my lashes, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s waterproof to an extent. It&#x27;s really cool when you wash it off, it kind of flakes off. And it doesn&#x27;t pull your lashes out when washing off. I love it!</li>
            <li> The mascara did not work for me.  For my lashes, too many layers are needed and I end up with the spider look.  Plus it&#x27;s too hard to take off.</li>
            <li> I do like this mascara, it doesn&#x27;t smudge or sting and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> This is ok. Took a long time to dry between coats....not good if you are in a hurry to get going.  Then I had difficulty removing it. Required several applications of oil to get it off and then face wash.  My skin is very delicate and I am concerned about excessive pulling on the eye area that it takes to get this stuff off your lashes.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara.  Long full lashes that wipe of with water!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this mascara. Not too thick, but coats really well. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I used to use Fairy Drops, but they became hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found this and LOVE LOVE LOVE. Bought more than I needed to give as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few key points: Before 4 Months--------&amp;#62; waterproof...easily removed with soap and water and gently grasping  eyelashes in the shower...great for contact lens wearers no flaking...***Must be replaced after at least 4 months bc after that it will start to break down and not look as voluminous and start to flake a tiny tiny bit</li>
            <li> I found that this mascara did not live up to my expectations.  It did not plump up or lengthen my lashes very well. No wow factor for me and I have had better results with drug store mascaras.  One positive is that it does stay on you lashes and all day without flaking and easy to take off.</li>
            <li> I have been on a quest to find the perfect mascara for YEARS.  It meant lots of wasted money and mascara in the trash.  Now my quest is over!  I love this product.  It doesn&#x27;t clump and doesn&#x27;t flake.  You can layer it easily without any problems so you can have a day look with one or two layers and a more dramatic look with 5 plus layers.  It comes off easily with eye makeup remover with no smudging.  It&#x27;s different then any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried! I think it&#x27;s made of magic :)</li>
            <li> I will not be reordering this item, unfortunately. Too much clumping with the application of this mascara, although I really wanted to try a new product.  Looks like I&#x27;ll go back to my previous brand.</li>
            <li> Awesome mascara, I use it everyday. I love the length and volume! It doesn&#x27;t smudge. No raccoon eyes and love that it stays in place all day 😀</li>
            <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t work. I put it on and it doesn&#x27;t make ANY difference. It is deceptive to say it is BIG Volumizing when it has no visible effect at all.  For this price I would rather buy Lancome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to reorder!  I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, doesn&#x27;t flake or run, yet still comes off easily at the end of the day.  I like the length and volume it adds, but I will admit I&#x27;m not going for the &amp;#34;just left the Lash Bar&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara. I have been looking for a mascara that would not flake and not make my lashes lose their curl, after I used my heated eye curler. I had been using Maybelline big lash and another one in a pink container thats newer, and it was pretty good - but I think this is way better. I got a sample and am now buying two bottles.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong—I was very satisfied with this mascara. It goes on thinly which means that it A) doesn&#x27;t clump, and B) you can decide exactly how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; you want your lashes by adding additional layers of the smooth formula. It also—while not waterproof—does come through on it&#x27;s claim to be smudge-resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, if you hate every mascara you&#x27;ve ever tried and are still on that lifelong quest for something that gets your makeup through the day, I would definitely recommend giving the It&#x27;s So Big Mascara a try—it&#x27;s unlikely to let you down. However, if you&#x27;ve already found your perfect mascara but (like so many of us) continue your hunt since you think the grass MUST be greener on the other side, you may want to re-evaluate this one. It&#x27;s still a good buy and could very well be as good or even better than your current favorite, but I&#x27;d probably take the inordinate amount of glowing reviews with a grain of salt. Unless you&#x27;re currently living a raccoon-eye nightmare, don&#x27;t expect this to change your life.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a mascara that stays put when I sweat at work or chill on my days off. This is not it! It flakes like crazy. I thought since it has wax in it it would be more likely to stay and be somewhat waterproof. I was wrong. The page says they will send you a free sample but I could not figure out how to get the sample. I wasted my money and i&#x27;m bummed! I had high hopes since the reviews were mostly good.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see the BIG in this. was just there! Terrible waste of money!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Not sticky or gooey and does not  smudge during tha day. Makes my lashes look thicker and longer too!</li>
            <li> Good volume and no smudges! I am throwing away all my other crappy mascara.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have EVER used and believe me, I&#x27;ve used them all from drug store brands to high end department store brands.  No clumps, no lumps, no spider looking eyes.  I&#x27;m a fan forever.</li>
            <li> In addition to living in a very humid climate, I have oily skin and long eyelashes. I have been searching endlessly for a mascara that will not leave smudges on my brow bone with no success... Until I found Elizabeth Mott mascara!! I have zero smudges, even after workouts and runs! It&#x27;s amazing!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> this is the best mascara I have used.  stays all day and looks perfect with curled lashes.  Looks very natural and not clumpy</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this product. It doesn&#x27;t flake off, it doesn&#x27;t come off when I go swimming, but it comes off easily when I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I really was not happy with this... It was very clumpy...</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT! I will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I tend to accumulate mascara and lipstick.  After I tried this mascara, I threw out the other ones. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many expensive mascaras over the years- this one is just as good if not better but a whole lot cheaper!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. I had ordered 2 others with this one, and didn&#x27;t receive any of them. This was the only product I received after sending an email (no fault to the seller). I&#x27;m glad this was the product that came in, I am very satisfied with this mascara, and will be buying again!!</li>
            <li> I have been &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with oily eyes, which I have been assured I will appreciate later in life, I am just currently waiting for the benefits to kick in.  To that end I get panda eyes when I wear mascara, no matter what mascara from $3-$50 they all run down and make me look like I am trying out new anti-glare football smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews for this mascara and figured why not... OMG where has this been my whole life.  I put it on at 6:00 a.m. and take it off at 10:00 p.m. with no smudging, no flaking, just amazing lashes the whole day through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a victim of panda eyes like me - this is the mascara for you.  I have become a walking billboard for the stuff, to the point of if I notice someone has some mascara smudge going I tell them about this mascara and give them detailed instructions on buying it.</li>
            <li> Item came on time but I was disappointed I didn&#x27;t see any difference on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Finally found MY Mascara!! I love this mascara, I had friends using/selling the 3-D lashes and I really didn&#x27;t want to hassel with the process, I&#x27;m a busy woman always go, go, go! So why do I LOVE it... 1) I have been searching for a masacara for about a year (tried many) that wouldn&#x27;t give me black eyes through out the day, (with other brand) I would apply in morning and by that afternoon around 2pm I would have the black smudges under my eyes and this just drives me crazy - I even tried waterproof to see if it would work and still everyday smudges!! This mascara is awesome - It gives me full long lashes (not clumpy at all!) and I have had NO smudging at all (using about a year now) AND No smudging when I swim either!! It is not listed as waterproof, but I swim almost daily as I have a pool and mascara is the 1 item I do wear everyday (even on no make-up days) and I have yet to have black eyes!!! LOVE!! I use my face wash followed by cleansing wipes and it comes off easy enough. BEST MASCARA EVER</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!! I am about to order another one for my travel bag!! :-)</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried countless mascaras. I have naturally long lashes but need the mascara for that feature to stand out. My issue has been the inability to find one that didn&#x27;t leave me with racoon eyes. South GA humidity is a beast. At the end of the day I&#x27;d have none left on my lashes because it all wound up being wiped away from under my eyes several times during the day. All those &amp;#34;no smudging, stays on all day&amp;#34; promises were BS. Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is AWESOME!! With one coat you get definition and a beautiful natural look. It&#x27;s easy to apply, no clumps, no goopy mess. Three coats later you get dramatic, glamazon lashes still clump free. I love the brush. Last night I fell asleep reading and didn&#x27;t get to wash off my make-up. I was shocked when I looked in the mirror and saw that my mascara was still looking good. No racoon eyes, no flakes. It washed away without an issue. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara!  It one of my new favorites! It makes my eyelashes look AMAZING and NO clumping! So that is a bonus!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different mascaras and for a long time was loyal to Lancôme, then flipped 180 degrees on cost and went to Maybelline Great Lash.  Lancôme is too expensive for what you get, and with Great Lash, you get what you pay for (which includes lots of flaking/smudging).  The It&#x27;s So Big Mascara is now my new favorite.  It provides lots of volume without being clumpy.  It&#x27;s definitely not flaky and it doesn&#x27;t smudge.  It&#x27;s far superior to Great Lash and I rank it higher than Lancôme for quality, particularly for the price.  While not a waterproof mascara, it takes a little extra effort to remove.  I use Pond&#x27;s cold cream to remove eye makeup, and it works well with the It&#x27;s So Big Mascara.</li>
            <li> I really was unhappy with the performance of this mascara. I read the reviews and thought it would really blow me away. It did nothing for volume or fullness. It just looked like my eyelashes got a nice new shiny paint job. Should have stuck with Two Faced&#x27;s Better Than Sex Mascara. This mascara is really overpriced for what it does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just SOOOOO BIG!</li>
            <li> Seriously amazing. This makes my lashes look so long! It doesn&#x27;t smear or flake or smudge, it doesn&#x27;t even get on my face when I flinch mid application and slam my eyes shut.. Now THAT is impressive! I am now a customer for life. Best mascara EVER. buy it, for real.</li>
            <li> I have tried this mascara a couple of times, but haven&#x27;t had it for too long.  It layers very well, spreads out your lashes, doesn&#x27;t smudge (very important to me), lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;When you remove it with eye makeup remover, you need to take some time to remove it well, depending on how many coats you applied.  It does not remove easily.  It comes off in clumps, but at least it doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34; while you have it on.  I was a little concerned about some of the ingredients, so that was probably the biggest thing that bothered me.  I consider it expensive, and I&#x27;m not sure if I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have very deep set eyes with long lashes, so after a few hours, I usually look like a linebacker with big black circles under my eyes,....even with waterproof mascara.  Happy to report that I look like linebacker no more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. I haven&#x27;t found a mascara I REALLY love, but this comes close to what I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have EVERY used and I am 62 so I have tried them all. It comes off when I take it off but I have never had problems with smearing or flecking. I am particularly impressed with the size it makes my lashes look with only two applications. I have short straight lashes and by brushing them up, without a curler, my lashes look five times their normal size. I also notice that there has never been irritation with this mascara. I only wish I had been able to use it for the past 45 years!</li>
            <li> I really like it. It doesn&#x27;t run, comes off easily with makeup remover, doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my lashes look nice and long.</li>
            <li> This is really good mascara--not dry or clumpy even after a month of use; it goes on gently and makes even my lashes amazing. It&#x27;s different than any I&#x27;ve used before, and worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is a definite must buy for me because it doesn&#x27;t run (never have to worry about black under my eyes) even when I wear dark circle concealer.  It&#x27;s not super black so it looks natural and it lengthens.  I&#x27;d say it doesn&#x27;t really make my lashes look thicker, just longer but because there is zero smudging, I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> Great mascara:  easy to apply, lasts all day, comes off easily with a little makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Best mascara out there!!! Does not irritate my eyes, and doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge after 10 hours of working in humid hot conditions. Will definitely be buying this again!!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! It has two types of bristles and that really helps &amp;#34;fan out&amp;#34; easier! Great mascara for my thin lashes and sensitive eyes!</li>
            <li> Great mascara! Loved this product. Provides great definition, length, &amp; volume.</li>
            <li> A little clumpy but effective.  Not sure I&#x27;ll purchase again for the price.</li>
            <li> With the high praises i was really dissapointed in this. It goes on great, but by the end of the day it starts to flake. Especially if i rub my eyes. You have to make sure you take it off with eye make-up remover every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 50 &amp; my lashes are getting thinner &amp; shorter every year. This mascara makes them look like the lashes of my youth &amp; I love that. Also, love the way it wears like waterproof mascara but is so easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Best mascara that I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to decide if I really like this mascara or if it is so-so. It goes on very smoothly with no clumps. It does make your lashes look longer and very natural. They are nicely separated. I wished that it made them look a little fatter. BUT - would I order this again? Yes. I like the long natural look. Just wish I had fatter eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smudge, smear, or flake.  It also has a moisturizing feel to it - rather than the dry, flaky mascaras I&#x27;ve used before.  If you&#x27;re looking for the thick fiber-filled mascaras, this one would not be what you&#x27;re looking for; however, it stays on longer and thickens up nicely when you layer it on your lashes.</li>
            <li> GIven the reviews, I was so excited to get this.  I must admit I was a tiny bit disappointed.  It doesn&#x27;t lengthen the way I had hoped but it&#x27;s very nice mascara - washes off beautifully - does not smudge and the brush is cool.  I will buy again</li>
            <li> You can read my review on my beauty blog [...]&lt;br /&gt;I loved this mascara. I think what makes it so amazing is the wand</li>
            <li> This mascara had very nice ratings, which got my attention. It peaked my interest, finding mascara with so many 5 star ratings. Being very hopeful to find &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;, I had to give it a try. It went on well, covering every lash. My lashes looked very individual and lightly coated with mascara. It dried quickly, which I appreciated. By the time I applied it to the other eye, the first eye was ready for a second coat. I found that two coats was all that I really needed. Like one of the other reviews talked about, I too thought that they could pass for false eyelashes. They were just that pretty. It has a nice brush too. Crazy thing is, I am in the professional beauty industry, and this was my first experience with this brand.</li>
            <li> i have the problem with other mascaras smudges on my bottom lashes and with this Mascara i didnt have that problem</li>
            <li> I switched from They&#x27;re Real to Its So Big for a few reasons. I like the price for ISB better, it washes off easily (it comes off in strange strands but does not leave raccoon eyes which need eye make up remover), and it does NOT clump. I went to the website to get the trial size offer and it shipped quickly. After trying, I was very pleased with product and the customer service.</li>
            <li> Really good mascara!! Don&#x27;t seem like it will do anything but then when u apply more and more coats your eyelashes look really nice!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a non-smearing, non-flaking mascara like this for 10 years! So happy to have found it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara. I first experienced it through my ipsy bag and knew I would be a regular customer. It washes off better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. It&#x27;s worth the heavy expense. I have short lashes and it makes them look much longer.</li>
            <li> Really works like it said.  I have looked for a long time for a mascara that doesn&#x27;t give me racoon eyes and still gives me length. Love this stuff. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!! I can wear it all day long 16 hours and it never leaves a mark on my brow how some do after wearing it all day. I can also wear it to the gym without it running, when I&#x27;m sweating it during a very heavy fast paced cardio class. I&#x27;m sensitive to a lot if mascara but not this one. I wear contacts and I do not experience any problems.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now. Love it!</li>
            <li> I like the product and the brush but based on other reviews I expected the product would produce a greater volume of lashes.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m a woman past menopause my  lashes aren&#x27;t what they used to be. Imagine my delight when I used this mascara and found long beautiful lases again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It really extends the length of my lashes and make my eyes look bigger. Easy to wash off, but does not smear throughout the day. I&#x27;m very picky with mascara. You wont be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> This really is great mascara! I was getting ready to try Latisse to grow my lashes because I wasn&#x27;t getting the results I wanted with mascara. That was before I tried this brand. Because of the way it separates and defines lashes without clumping, lashes appear longer and thicker. I am so happy with the results and that I don&#x27;t need to spend hundreds of dollars on a lash-growing product. I will never use another mascara!</li>
            <li> It goes on great and it&#x27;s not clumpy, it makes my lashes look longer and it seems to curl them a bit. I really like this mascara a lot.  It is not water proof but it doesn&#x27;t smudge at all even if I cry.  It&#x27;s great!!!</li>
            <li> Save your money and do not buy this mascara. I was expecting dramatic lashes from a 20 dollar mascara but the formula is watery and it barely looked like I was wearing mascara at all.</li>
            <li> Love the shape of the wand!</li>
            <li> I order this for myself and daughters and I absolutely love it!! It goes on so light , but makes my lashes look so full and thick!! Also comes off easily with my makeup wipes !! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Great Mascara. Better than most drugstore brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was skeptical. But I have got to say that this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve used in ages. I have oily skin and have always struggled with raccoon eyes as the day goes on. Not so with this product. It goes on thin and does need a couple of coats to get the look I want.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara!!! I have tried so many mascaras and been disappointed every time.  Elizabeth Mott mascara is awesome!!! Gives me length and volume!! The price is great and  It&#x27;s a great product &#x3D; win-win for me</li>
            <li> This mascara is ok, better than most grocery store mascaras I&#x27;ve tried since my favorite brand changed it&#x27;s waterproof formula.  This mascara is lengthening but not at all volumizing.  It goes on very wet and takes a while to dry so you have longer to wait for a second coat.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not nearly as good as my Urban Decay Canon Ball, which is the best waterproof mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, but that one is 25 bucks.  Is 19 bucks worth losing the quick dry and the volume?  I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> This mascara is absolutely terrific, best I have ever used honestly! It doesn&#x27;t clump! It goes on light and smoothly, and gives time to comb through for a fabulous finish! Makes your lashes look long and lovely! Plus it doesn&#x27;t smudge, and stays put even overnight. I don&#x27;t always remove my mascara at night, and noticed when awakening that my lashes looked as lovely as the morning before when I had applied it! I would highly recommend this mascara ladies, you must try it, and I know you will be very pleased!</li>
            <li> It makes long lashes, and lasts all night, even after 13 hours of work. I find using a little bit of moisturing shampoo and lot of lather makes it easier to remove.</li>
            <li> Did not notice a difference from regular drug store brands.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> This mascara is far better than Dior Show! It is long wearing and very volumizing! I absolutely love it! No smudges either!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence on this one...I gave it four stars because the good outweigh the bad. I wanted to be adventurous and try a new mascara product and chose this based on the reviews I read and it was comparable in price range with my regular mascara brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: It does give you long eyelashes that last all day, that&#x27;s a big plus in my book. Love the brush and how easily it glides on my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: Like others have said, the mascara is flaky and I&#x27;m not used to this, as my normal mascara doesn&#x27;t do this. The product also can make your eye lashes stick together and when they do its hard to take them apart..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer stated, if you have oily skin and issues with smudging, then this is the mascara for you!!! Even waterproof mascaras smudge on me, but this one stays in place all day and is easy to remove with soap and water. This is the only mascara I will ever buy - excellent product!!! Also, I have skimpy lashes but with 2 coats of this non-clumping mascara, I have volume and length. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever bought! It&#x27;s super watery the consistency is loose and if you like the clumpy look this is definitely not for you 😖</li>
            <li> Really like this mascara. Doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake which has been a problem in the past. Very good for enhancing eyes. Not fake lashes look though.</li>
            <li> FINALLY I FIND THE PERFECT MASCARA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS ONE SUPER LARGE SIZE MASCARA TUBE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; LOTS OF MASCARA INSIDE, NO SCRAPING TO MAKE SURE YOUR WAND IS LOADED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I TOOK A CHANCE ON THIS AND I AM SO GLAD I DID.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOTALLY HOOKED ON HOW WELL MY LASHES LOOK AND FEEL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; NO CLUMPING- NO IRRITATION OR BURNING........ AND IT LASTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE NIGHT I FELL ASLEEP WITHOUT REMOVING MY MAKE UP( I KNOW DOING THAT IS  A NO- NO), AND THE NEXT DAY MY LASHES LOOKED LIKE I HAD JUST DONE THEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***NOTE****I BOUGHT THIS MASCARA AND ALSO USED IT WITH A EYE LASH CURLER I AM NOW ALSO HOOKED ON THAT IS AVAILABLE ON AMAZON CALLED: *WHIPLASH EYELASH CURLER*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I  thought it might just be an overpriced eye lash curler, but no- it is worth every penny and worked great with this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I will be writing a review on *WHIPLASH EYELASH CURLER* so check that out if you want to read more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I learned from working with the curler and mascara, how to make these two items work great together.</li>
            <li> I received a sample size in my Ipsy makeup bag one month and it had me at first use. I HAD to buy the full size product, it&#x27;s amazing. My eyelashes look fabulous, best they&#x27;ve ever looked. And easy to remove with water, mine peels right off in the shower. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I had been disappointed with every mascara purchase I had made and was searching for something new. I found this mascara and I LOVE it!  It stays on all day without flaking but comes off easily in the shower with face wash.  It makes my 50+ year old lashes look young and thick again!  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my lashes in terms of adding volume.  I would not recommend to a friend, nor purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great shipping time. Product is awesome and I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I have customarily sparse and short asian eyelashes - so when I found this mascara to be effective, it was pretty significant. The mascara, unlike most formulas, is a bit more viscous and allows for better defining and building. Also, it doesn&#x27;t clump or flake, so the lashes appear dark, smooth, well-defined. Application lasts very nicely for 8-12 hours. For mascara users, the price is definitely worth it, and a little really goes a long way because the formula doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> I have been through my share of mascara and this by far is the best - gives me tons of volume and length - I literally do NOT leave home without it.  Found out about it through a subscription makeup service and have been obsessed ever since.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mascara that was cruelty free, volumizing, and wasn&#x27;t a bear to get off of my face when I was done with it!  This one marked off all of the boxes.  It is so very beautiful and very black.  I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I hesitated to purchase this mascara at first because of the price, but I read the reviews and was convinced to give it a try. It is worth every penny and then some. The quality is top notch! No smearing, flaking, clumping, or fading. When you wash it off with warm water, you can literally gently pull off the mascara, as it seems to coat your lashes rather than just paint them. The result when applied is natural looking, fuller, longer lashes. I will not buy another mascara now that I know what I&#x27;ve been missing.</li>
            <li> I am one of those women who has tried all of the mascara brands... it&#x27;s so hard to get the look I want!  Recently, I received a sample of It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara.  I loved how it separated my lashes, made them look nice and full, didn&#x27;t smudge or smear, and was super easy to wash off with regular facial cleanser.  After using the entire sample until it dried up, I purchased a full-sized tube and can&#x27;t imagine ever using anything else!! BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this and fell in love.  Was hesitant to buy, as it seems as though when I get samples, they far outshine the normal sized product.  Happy to say, it is not the case here.  My lashes are normally not very thick nor long, but this mascara definitely gives them a kick!  Will purchase again.  Arrived fast and shipped appropriately.</li>
            <li> Love the product itself, no Racoon eyes after hours of wear, only reason not 5 star, the brush could be designed better.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever had. Although thus doesnt not gives alot of volume but it does makes your lashes long.</li>
            <li> It stays put when I Crossfit, which is a first!!! Love this mascara and it&#x27;s well worth the money!!! Satisfied!</li>
            <li> I am always trying new mascara to make my natural lashes look longer and fuller. This product does it. It is smooth and does not clump, even after applying multiple coats.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever tried. Yes, it&#x27;s not cheap, but doesn&#x27;t get thick or dry out like most I&#x27;ve tried. I feel feel like I have young eyes again after applying!!!</li>
            <li> So not worth the money! This does nothing for my eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have to put on at least 5 layers of this to notice anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried alot of volumizing mascaras and I have to say this one is the best so far.  Lengthens and volumizes without clumping and long lasting.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It does have fall out but the way it makes your lashes look its so worth it.</li>
            <li> Not really impressed with this mascara.  Takes at least 3 applications to get minimal length.  Ever since I started using this product my eyes are irritated and watery.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Love love love this mascara!! It&#x27;s very nice and comes off with water very easily but doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge! Finally no raccoon eyes at the end of the day!!</li>
            <li> Received product promptly. This mascara lengthens and separates lashes and doesn&#x27;t leave them heavy or chunky. Love it!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with It&#x27;s so BIG Volumizing mascara! I truly feel that this is the best mascara on the market. I do not need to curl my eyelashes with this mascara, which is a huge time saver for me.  Great stocking stuffer too!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on a quest for a new mascara that will make my eyelashes look longer! I like the brush and the silkiness of this mascara. Applied 2-3 coats to achieve desired effect.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I will be ordering more. Very impressed with this mascara.</li>
            <li> No Racoon eyes, exactly what I was looking for!  go ahead and purchase..I am sure you will enjoy it as much as me.</li>
            <li> So this Mascara is incredible. I have been asked whether or not I got extensions or if I am wearing fake lashes. That is enough to give this mascara 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am having a problem getting it off, so I will take any suggestions. I have used makeup remover wipes followed by a facial cleanser and that still leaves the mascara on.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this mascara!  I&#x27;ve been searching for a mascara that will really make my lashes stand out, and I&#x27;ve finally found it. I&#x27;m so glad I tried this product; I&#x27;ll certainly order it again.</li>
            <li> It makes your eye lashes looks funny it clumps it into a few sticks. Horrible and three to four times the regular price. I was fooled by reviews and I wonder who wrote the reviews?!!!!! I won&#x27;t trust the reviews any more! I feel responsible to warn people about this product. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and struggle to find mascara that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itchy and red.  This mascara was easy on my eyes and as others have posted didn&#x27;t leave me looking like a raccoon.  It takes a couple of coats to thicken the lashes, but gives you great length with just a few coats.  I usually use Lancome&#x27;s Definicils and this product was easily as good but at a lower price point.  Would recommend this product and seller to anyone looking for great lashes.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used! I sweat a lot and smudginess has always been an issue until now. My lashes look long and beautiful but at the same time are not overly stiff and dry.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this this mascara. My sister had a sample and I tried it and new immediately I had to buy it. It makes my lashes look longer and thicker. And it doesn flake off by the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> Love the brush, no clumps, love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have thin, short lashes and this is the best mascara I have ever used.  It gives volume and length and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> tried every mascara out there stumble upon this and was amazed at how big and long it made my lashes look I&#x27;m definitely hooked this is the one for me</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in a beauty subscription box. I loved it so much, I had to buy a full size. It lengthens and thickens without looking clumpy. The brush is amazing. I&#x27;m a BIG fan!</li>
            <li> Everyone raves about this stuff, and I really didn&#x27;t like it! I&#x27;m hoping the consistency will get better, but it does nothing for my thin, short lashes.  I was expecting a major change, but for the $20 price tag, it&#x27;s worse than a lot of drugstore brands that cost half the price!  I apply it, it doesn&#x27;t thicken much, and when I layer, it thickens the base, but the tips just stick together, and the effect just makes my lashes look weird, not lush.  Definitely will not be buying this product again...</li>
            <li> I love the wand on this brush. It is one of my favorite wands I&#x27;ve ever used. Mascara dries quickly though, so its not easy to go back in and separate lashes.</li>
            <li> Awesome mascara, easy to wash off and it looks great on.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! If you are a gym rat like me then you know how sweaty you get after a good workout. My eyes are very small so I have to have some mascara in order to see my eyes. This mascara makes my eyes look big and stays on without making me look like a raccoon!!  This is my second time ordering and I will do it again !!</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply. Does not take multiple coats to get that look. Does not run or smudge like so many others do. I used to always have to wipe under my eyes during the day to clean up mascara even from ordinary perspiration. Not this stuff! Keeps lashes separated, dark, volumized, and long even after a day at the beach. Because you don&#x27;t have to apply numerous coats to get your desired look. the product lasts longer than most.</li>
            <li> I sent for a free sample of So BIG Volumizing Mascara and couldn&#x27;t have been happier with the product. I loved it so much that I ordered a full size right away! I have never found a product that makes my lashes look so long AND full! This will be a staple in my make up drawer from now on!!</li>
            <li> My eyelids became like sandpaper for a week after using this mascara so a total waste of money :/</li>
            <li> The mascara does what a very good mascara should:  volumizes, applies with ease, stays put, and removes without excessive effort.</li>
            <li> OMG...it&#x27;s just as the name of the product &amp;#34;BIG&amp;#34;  this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used...and I tried all off them no matter how expensive they were or cheap they were.  You will be very happy.</li>
            <li> Definitely does not add volume!</li>
            <li> Not a big fan...the brush doesn&#x27;t allow for all over coverage and it clumps easily</li>
            <li> My new favorite.  It doesn&#x27;t clump or run--and, depending on layers, really makes lashes look thicker.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have spent most of my adult life being disappointed in mascaras. I saw on Amazon that Elizabeth Mott offered a trial size of this mascara for shipping. Cost me $2.79 in postage to find the mascara I have been looking for, for decades. On day 2 of the trial, I ordered the full-size. For me, a $20 investment in a mascara I love is cheaper than continuing my quest for the perfect mascara and wasting money on 2 or 3 different ones annually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara makes my lashes long, and they do not clump together. It wears well on 2 morning coats during the entire day, and it washes off nicely in the shower. It does make those funny flakes when washing it off....but not when I am wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am cursed with ultra-blonde (nearly invisible) lower lashes, and have always had a problem showing them off. While, I do make lower lid application smudges when applying (try looking for the invisible) I can make a really decent job on them with this mascara. It&#x27;s the first mascara I can say that about. I use the tip of the wand, and stroke across them, and they come out nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No idea of how the hourglass wand makes my lashes long and defined, and some things you just have to accept on faith. It does, and I accept it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the cost of postage you can try this mascara; if you don&#x27;t like it you are not out a fortune.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I was rather obsessed with mascaras until I found this one, my holy grail. Now, I only have eyes for the one. My sensitive eyes that really seem allergic to all waterproof mascaras and maybe half of the other ones have never had a sensitivity to this mascara. A tube usually lasts me 2-3 months (which has only been beaten by Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real!). Something about my eye shape and skin texture, I have a real problem with 99% of mascaras smudging, except with this one. Yet, it&#x27;s not drying out my eyelashes and making me feel like I&#x27;ll have none in five years. I have downright sobbed in this mascara, but I&#x27;ve never had it run down my face. I wash it off every night with Purity (from Philosophy); I doubt that most normal face washes would take it off well, so probably best to use eye makeup remover. I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 years and never looked back. I&#x27;ve heard many makeup artists say that mascaras are pretty much the same and you&#x27;re just buying a different brush that you like. Well 1) I love this type of applicator, 2) this mascara is not like all the others. Buy it. Love it.</li>
            <li> This product is no good. I&#x27;ve had far better mascara for a way better price at Wal-Mart. The only reason I gave a star is you have to give at least one to say how crappy the product is. Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> like this mascara, stays on throughout the day without flaking.</li>
            <li> This is a really highly-rated mascara, and the volume of high ratings influenced my purchase.  My findings: it does lengthen, but does not thicken or otherwise add to volume.  Also, it&#x27;s very liquidy and slow to dry.  I like the length this produced, but the attention I have to pay to apply several coats, and then ensure my lashes don&#x27;t mark my eyelids because they haven&#x27;t dried yet -- sorry, you can do better than this with a drugstore mascara.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It&#x27;s gunky and no better than the least expensive mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  Had to try to separate my lashes with a pin.  Buy something inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I bought it based upon previous review that the product should have good volume. it is not . I will go back to Lamcome which is the best so far</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it goes on very well and it doesn&#x27;t clump.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a reasonably priced well made mascara.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product but admit that I&#x27;m disappointed in it! I received a sample of the mascara in my Ipsy bag and loved it right away. It became my favorite mascara and I told all of my friends to get it. I&#x27;m big on mascara because I love having big eye lashes without having to wear fake ones. I find now that my lashes clump right away so matter what I do. With the small sample, I had no issues, my lashes were big and thick. Sadly, with the full product, it is not the same at all.</li>
            <li> The packaging was great, there were no defects on the item. It was exactly as the seller described. Unfortunately, the item was not worth the 20$ for me. I had heard that this item was great and that it worked marvelously for everyone. If you have thin eyelashes that are weighed down easily by mascara - this is not for you. The brush comes heavily loaded with mascara despite trying to lessen the amount, plus it is heavy. It doesn&#x27;t clump my eyelashes, which is a pro but immediately after I curl and put on mascara they come straight back down. It&#x27;s too heavy and my eyelashes too thin.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m very proud to own this product because it&#x27;s from Honolulu and in fact, there was&lt;br /&gt;a news article about this product in our local newspaper, the Star-Advertiser. So I immediately&lt;br /&gt;went on Amazon to order it  I like it so much, I threw away my Tarte mascara.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on nicely, no clumps and very black.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it makes my eyelashes long and they really pop! I have ordered it several times and will keep ordering it!!! I totally recommend this. It is a must try.</li>
            <li> Very good mascara..better than most..no clumping, easy to apply</li>
            <li> This mascara is awesome! About two years ago my usual brand of mascara was discontinued and had still not found a suitable replacement when a sample of this arrived in my ipsy bag. I&#x27;m so happy it did! It lengthens and thickens my lashes very well!</li>
            <li> Works well, I would purchase again at this good price.  I usually prefer a thicker brush, but this one worked well to achieve the lengthy lashes look!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad. However, compare &amp;#34;Clinc&amp;#34; which I used to use it, the &amp;#34;Elizabeth Mott&amp;#34; does lighter job, and i don&#x27;t feel it gives more volume</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It stays on and it doesn&#x27;t clump and it makes my lashes look long and full. Best one I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve use all the ones Sephora carries plus half the ones in the drug store. I&#x27;m very happy with it. You have to use make up removeror work a little harder with the wash and warm water to get it off but I&#x27;m cool with that. No flaking. No smudging.</li>
            <li> I first tried a sample of this mascara that came in my monthly Ipsy box. Ever since then I&#x27;ve been using this mascara. The formula is great. It has a nice thick coat that separates and defines my lashes...but the mascara never feels clumpy or heavy. Stays on all day long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY WORTH THE PRICE!!! Long-lasting, holds eyelash curl well and volumizes all at the same time. My go-to mascara for sure and I&#x27;ll definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great quality mascara! 2 thumbs up, ELIZABETH MOTT!</li>
            <li> Had to apply few times,but still good.</li>
            <li> No smudges, it lasts all day, my lashes look longer and are more clearly defined.  The best is no clumping!</li>
            <li> I actually stumbled upon this in one of my monthly Ipsy bags. I love it! Lots of volume and definition without looking clumpy or smearing and the thin wand can get to every lash. I rated it four stars because of the packaging. It wasn&#x27;t protected during shipping. The box which was inside an envelope was destroyed and there was no seal on the mascara. When you charge $20 for a mascara, I would at least expect it to arrive intact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every drugstore mascara on the market, and I&#x27;ve always had issue with both clumping and flaking. I did some research on mascaras, and since this one had very high ratings, I decided to try it out. I&#x27;m so glad I did! This mascara lasts all day, does not clump, and does not flake during the day. I&#x27;ll definitely be a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Not oily or smudgy. I&#x27;m hooked. Wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, no clumps, lasts all day - great product.</li>
            <li> Update Ok so the last few I have gotten have been good and this mascara (if you get a good tube) is really that good that I will continue to buy. The good reviews really are because it gives them really good lengthening for those of us with almost nonexistent lashes and yet is also really wearable long-lasting and doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge so you can wear it all day and night. Especially now that price is more reasonable. Don&#x27;t believe the reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t work- what they may not be understanding is you have to layer this on several times (like 25 swipes) &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; it dries- it will build!! It does lengthen more than volumize but it does volumize. Does not smudge or flake- I have oily skin an every other mascara does- can&#x27;t see how anyone could get this to flake- maybe they are rubbing their eyes  or about one of those clumpy dried out tubes that were a bigger problem in 2015 . I swim in this mascara and it looks perfect afterwards! U pdate: they must have transferred manufacturing to China or wherever it was being manufactured just isnt doing the same QC. :( the last several I have purchased have been dry and clumping. It used to be wet and you could build and build without clumps. Now it doesn&#x27;t matter how careful I am it clumps and sticks and looks like Tammy Faye baker. :( very disappointed. The first two tubes I got were great. The last SEVERAL have been bad- yes I figured maybe I was just getting the random bad tube. I didn&#x27;t want to believe the great mascara I had found was gone forever. But alas no tubes have had that initial glide and wet clump free lengthening.  Original: I have tried dozens of mascaras - I have been on a quest for one that doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t make raccoon eyes and yet can build up my short blond lashes and create big black lashes. This is the best mascara ever! It has a wet kind of gel quality that builds and doesn&#x27;t dry too fast so that you can build up volume and length. It doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge. I won&#x27;t be buying anything else. The only thing close is IT mascara which is a close second, but I like this one better. I have tried maybelline (all), cover girl (all), Dior, Lancôme, benefit bad gal, rimmel, tarte, - these all ended up flaky or caused black under eye smudges by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> love my new mascara! thank you!</li>
            <li> Great mascara - it added length and volume without ANY clumping. You can put on less for a more natural look, or vamp it up with extra coats. The wear is long lasting (even if you accidentally sleep in it it doesn&#x27;t end up on your cheeks!!) It removes very easily with warm water.  I will be purchasing again as soon as I&#x27;m in need.</li>
            <li> This mascara is pretty good and works great! My problem is that I want more fullness and this product helps a little bit&lt;br /&gt;But enough.</li>
            <li> I have very straight lashes that refuse to keep a curl. Although this is a very wet formula, they help my lashes stay curl, while providing nice length and volume. I first got this in my monthly beauty subscription bag. I quickly fell in love with it and had to buy the full size!</li>
            <li> Like others have said, it really doesn&#x27;t smudge! Even with all the humidity and perspiration, and coconut oil. I usually only wear mascara, so it has to count. Easy to remove. Very quick and friendly service. I recommend this one</li>
            <li> I was not blessed with full, long eyelashes and have been searching for a great mascara to help volumize and elongate them. I received a sample size of It&#x27;s So BIG in my Ipsy beauty bag a while back and I fell in love.  This mascara is so black in color that it really helps make my lashes pop.  The brush seems to coat all of my lashes. I feel like the travel sized brush has better coverage than this full size, but I still love the product none the less and have been recommending it to my friends and coworkers. This product easily compares to the other midpriced prestige brands of makeup out there that are around the same price.  I will buy a again and continue to recommend to others!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect mascara for a long, long time.  I&#x27;ve finally found it!  This mascara seems to&lt;br /&gt;be somewhat of a gel, and goes on without the clumping and flaking I have experienced with other mascara&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I usually put on one coat, then go back and put on another coat, which better thickens, defines and lengthens&lt;br /&gt;my fine lashes.  I would highly recommend this mascara, and I&#x27;m anxious to learn about other Elizabeth Mott&lt;br /&gt;cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend who had read about online, but couldn&#x27;t find at a local store.  Here is what she said after using it. &amp;#34;LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! the Elizabeth Mott.  It&#x27;s so Big - Mascara! Doesn&#x27;t flake or clump or run. Stays on all day! It&#x27;s my new favorite! Thank you again!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> At first it took me awhile to love this mascara. The first few times I wore it I felt like I couldn&#x27;t get enough liquid on the brush but now I&#x27;ve had the mascara for about two weeks and it&#x27;s so much better. I&#x27;ve been searching for GOOD mascara that&#x27;s not too clumpy and doesn&#x27;t smear during the day. I think I finally found it. The more I use it the more I like it. My favorite part is the way it comes off. It doesn&#x27;t leave black circles under my eyes but it comes off easily with just water (just like the description said). For years I have worn a separate waterproof mascara for my bottom lashes but I can now wear one mascara on both top and bottom. My one complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t lengthen quite as much as some of my other mascaras that I have tried but I&#x27;ll make the sacrifice and keep wearing this mascara.</li>
            <li> I try a lot of mascaras. I&#x27;m looking for full lashes. I have found some good ones but they tend to flake off on me. This is a very good mascara that I will purchase again.  I was also thrilled with how fast I received the product.</li>
            <li> Just like any other mascara! Nothing special at all...it takes 10 coats to give any length and definition! Does not run!&lt;br /&gt;Meah!</li>
            <li> Very impressed with mascara !</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I just ordered my second tube.  Makes my lashes big and no clumping.</li>
            <li> For years I have conducted the Search For the Perfect Mascara. Finding a truly smudge-proof mascara has been the bane of my existence. Finding one that was cruelty-free and didn&#x27;t have that sickening petroleum chemical smell proved to be a greater challenge. I love this mascara because it checks off all the needs/wants on my list. That it washes off with soap and water is an extra bonus. No buyer regret here!</li>
            <li> This fattens up my wimpy, wispy lashes quite well. And it washes off easily too.</li>
            <li> Curled lashes but not much volume. My lashes didn&#x27;t appear thick or dramatic. I have thin and sparse lashes and  looking for volume.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a mascara that I really like!  It lengthens my eyelashes without clumping AND it stays put all day! I received a sample of this mascara in an Ipsy bag and liked it enough to give the full size a try.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I received this via Ipsy.  Best mascara I have ever used. LOVE.  Great brush, does not smudge but comes off easily when washing face.  My new mascara for life.</li>
            <li> This mascara was very sloppy and did not add volume at all. It was super clumpy and overpriced and I have long eyelashes but it looked like a clumpy mess!!!</li>
            <li> Our amazon account is in my husband&#x27;s name, but it is me, the woman, who is writing this rave review. My I love this mascara.  I am 64 years old and wanted a mascara that would make my eyes pop more.  This one does it and more.  Very little clumping.  Goes on easily and does not come off when I sweat like crazy in my Bikram class.</li>
            <li> Really lengthens lashes...as other reviewers mention, it does have some &#x27;fiber&#x27; that comes out on the end of the wand, but overall, it is the best I have tried.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smear when you cry, but does come off with soap and water. Creates long lashes and/or creates voluminous lashes, depending on what you want.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to purchase this product for the price but at the time I felt desperate. I had full, long lashes until getting lash extensions. After removing them my lashes were pretty much non-existent. I read the great reviews on this product and thought it would be worth it. It does not work better for me than my Loreal Voluminous Million Lashes mascara from Wal-Mart. I would say save your  money on this one. One pro about this mascara is it never irritated my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> This mascara is fabulous! I have never found a mascara that did not smudge by the end of the day until I tried this brand. I have very short and thin lashes and was amazed at how lovely they looked as I applied this mascara on them.&lt;br /&gt;My husband noticed the difference also! :-)  I used a curler first and then applied the mascara and I could see the lengthening and thickness appear as I applied 2 coats of mascara. The best part is that soap and water will take the mascara right off!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Elizabeth Mott for such a wonderful product! I have told all my friends about this product line and I can&#x27;t wait to see what new products come out in the future!</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever owned.  I have spent lots of money trying to find the right mascara.  Before buying \\&quot;it&#x27;s so big mascara\\&quot;, I purchased \\&quot;yes their real\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s a good product but wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was wanting (fuller lashes).  So, seeing that I&#x27;m sooooo addicted to Amazon, I researched for other mascaras and stumbled upon \\&quot;its so big\\&quot;.  I could not wait to try it, I literally opened the package and put it on.  I LOVE IT!!  I will never buy another mascara again and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price, maybelline or Mac  mascaras are better. you can get 2 or more for the price of this one</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that I got reeled in by because of the reviews. It happens to me a lot &amp; usually with good reason. Sometimes I think there is a band-wagon mentality. In the case of this mascara I think that maybe you have a large pool of 5 star reviewers that are just hitting the market place &amp; really haven&#x27;t been test-driving mascara&#x27;s for long enough to REALLY know when they&#x27;ve found one of the &amp;#34;Greats&amp;#34;. But of course, I think that the iconic pink tube mascara with the green tube is overrated too. But I digress. I have VERY long eye-lashes. (I buy generic Latisse, an eye lash growing serum for alldaychemist.com, an Indian Pharmacy for CHEAP). My eyelashes are Blonde, as in nearly white so I can really tell on the coverage of a mascara. I will concede, this mascara is probably pretty good if you have short dark eyelashes as I have been using it on my lower eyelashes or as a base coat simply because I have to use it since I bought it. My FAVORITE ALL TIME mascara they no longer sell in stores &amp; I have to buy on Amazon as its only sold in Europe now; Max Factor 2000 Calorie GREAT, Amazing, Truly volumizing, thick coverage, no caking, non-smearing.</li>
            <li> The only good part about this mascara is there is a lot of product in the tube. I don&#x27;t like how the wand gets all goopy and I have to wipe a lot off to use it.No matter what I do, it seems to clump my lashed together, making them look like unnatural spikes.Not the look I was wanting. I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara, but I love the shape of the wand used.  The mascara goes on smooth and I like that.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting some really nice mascara!</li>
            <li> i have tried a million different types of mascara. I almost always do MAC, but was needing a change. My lashes look long and thick, but not clumpy. I definitely recommend this mascara. Don&#x27;t be afraid to layer it on.</li>
            <li> Great volume with this mascara.  Does sometimes clump though :(  I do like the wand shape.  I think that adds to the volume.</li>
            <li> EM&#x27;s It&#x27;s So BIG Mascara gives Benefit&#x27;s mascara a run for its money! It&#x27;s such a shame that this isn&#x27;t available in ALL Sephora and Ulta stores..it&#x27;s SOOO GOOD!!! It lengthens, curls and adds volume to my lashes without a single smudge. It&#x27;s amazing how it even survives an intense HIIT workout at the gym!!! I have relatively weak eye lash follicles so it&#x27;s extremely important that the formula removes easily at the end of the day. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!!!!!</li>
            <li> My new favorite! I highly recommend this mascara. Great volume, great length, no clumps, no flaking. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> A better name will be minimum mascara.  Big and Volumizing are total hyperboles.  Very average product for a huge price.  I wish I can get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;Ellen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You ask for a review, but the Submit does not work.  nice!</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara first came to me by way of my Ipsy Bag.  I threw it in my makeup bag and never tried it because I had a mascara that I liked.  The bad thing about my current mascara was the black that showed up under my eyes about an hour after applying.  I had to constantly check myself in the mirrow for those horrible black marks.  I saw Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s mascara in my bag and decided to try it.  I&#x27;ve never gone back to my old mascara.  No more black marks!  It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara stays on my lashes.  This mascara lengthens well and and I don&#x27;t have to use an eyelash curler anymore.  This is now the ONLY mascara in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I have short eyelashes and really struggle with mascaras.  I also have sensitive eyes and have had to return mascaras because my eyes were running like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara layers very well, stays put and makes my lashes look &amp;#34;there&amp;#34;.  I love this part.  The mascara is very smooth and glides on.  It doesn&#x27;t clump and layers well.  I do have to do 3 coats at least, but that is typical for me.  It does remove easily.  I treat it as a tubular and take a warm wash cloth and squeeze my lashes with it and it slides right off.  This is a nice balance for me as usually tubulars seem to work best for me.  Yes, I&#x27;m buying this one again.</li>
            <li> I have dry eye syndrome and use drops multiple times throughout the day. I needed something that wouldn&#x27;t give me racoon eyes but also came off without needing to rub too hard at the end of the day. This mascara has been great.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara and may consider buying it again, but it is by no means a miracle-worker.  I have yet to find one that is.</li>
            <li> Great!!!! Really long lashes. Lasts a while too.</li>
            <li> Great mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> love love love this. Best mascara I ever used. Does not clump or feel heavy on eyes. Highly recommended. The end</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using this mascara and I love it. The texture of it is so different from all others I have used - it&#x27;s light and smooth. It does define each lash and doesn&#x27;t clump like volumizing mascaras usually do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for awhile for the perfect mascara and have found it! I never leave reviews but I have little to no eyelashes. After trying this one with two coats I have eyelashes. Granted I did use a curler afterwards but here are my results. Oh and I know it doesn&#x27;t say waterproof but it&#x27;s definitely waterproof. The way that I was able to remove it was to be in the shower and literally rub my eyelashes with my face wash. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I love the everlasting look of this mascara.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. It doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my lashes look thick!</li>
            <li> Great product! Have tried them all, from drug store to Dior and everything in between. Everything left me with smudges under my eyes except Too Faced formula that required two step process. This is one step which is easier and gives a fuller look and does not leave me with dark circles from smudged and smeared mascara at the end of the day!</li>
            <li> EYEMAZING Mascara...love the length it gives my lashes with NO clumping.  Stays on all day, I will definitely be buying this again :)</li>
            <li> The last mascara I used cost 80$ ( gift) I really liked it but did not want to spend that kind of money on mascara so I searched for a new brand and discovered it&#x27;s so BIG and let me tell ya, this mascara is better! No clumping, no smearing, no flaking, lots of volume, I love this mascara</li>
            <li> Gotta say, this is a great product! The only mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried that didn&#x27;t smudge or flake (so many brands claim this and they&#x27;ve all failed to deliver, except this one!). Applies really nicely, doesn&#x27;t clump, even after several layers applied. Love that they use a fiber brush (can&#x27;t stand the rubber, silicone ones). It is a touch harder to wash off, but if you gently glide your lashes between your fingers once your lashes are wet, the stuff comes right off. Love this stuff, only complaint is the price tag of $20/tube..yikes! But worth it..</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT SERVICE!  I never write reviews, but I had to share this gem!  You really will receive a free sample and it will arrive within two days.  You&#x27;ll love the product and buy it, just like I am.  My new favorite mascara. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many mascaras and after reading the reviews I had high hopes for this one.  It wasn&#x27;t good at all.  It does not lengthen much and certainly does not give volume.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> No doubt about it, all the praise is deserved.  I am so happy with this product.  I tested it with the ultimate test-I slept with it on and I kid you not, I woke up with no smudges.  I washed it off in the shower with simple Cetaphil and it left behind no trace!  It is worth the money. Best mascara out there!   HG of mascara</li>
            <li> Love love love this mascara! It doesn&#x27;t smear or leave me looking like a racoon. It wears well all day.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I have finally found a volumizing mascara that won&#x27;t leave that black residue under my eyes!  I have tried many, many, many mascaras and this is the only one that is volumizing and leaves no smudges.  I will say that the Blink mascara is also great for no smudges if you are looking for long-wearing and lengthening; however, it provides no volume. It acts much like the ever-popular &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; but without the raccoon effect.  This is the one for me!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used! It is a tad expensive for mascara, but it&#x27;s worth the money. It makes your lashes look amazing and 1 tube will actually last you quite a while! I don&#x27;t plan on ever switching back to anything else and will be a loyal customer for a long time! Thanks for making such a great product!</li>
            <li> OK, as long as they are making It&#x27;s So BIG, I&#x27;ll be buying it! Elizabeth Mott was kind enough to send me a sample, which I absolutely loved, and so I went ahead and bought the BIG one (but I wish they sold the sample size too!). I&#x27;m over 50  and my eyelashes are very sparse... It added incredible length and somehow adhered to tiny lashes I didn&#x27;t even know I had, all without clumping. I also sweat a lot and boy does it stay put - but total washes off easily - amazing! Buy it - it&#x27;s totally worth the price. If there were 6 stars I&#x27;d give it that.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mascara after reading all the good reviews.  I was hoping it would work for me but it didn&#x27;t. May be it works better for people who have naturally curly eyelashes. I curl my eyelashes and this mascara gives me long voluminous eyelashes but it makes them straight. I don&#x27;t like that at all . I tried to curl my eyelashes again with the mascara on. That didn&#x27;t work either of course.  I don&#x27;t recommend buying this .</li>
            <li> Great mascara.  Defines and curls lashes well.  The one thing it didn&#x27;t really do for me was create volume.</li>
            <li> My new mascara obsession. I love the coverage AND the way it washes off easily (but doesn&#x27;t lose volume all day or night).</li>
            <li> Although this is a product my wife bought, When I asked her, she absolutely loved it, color was what she expected, easy to use and she doesn&#x27;t need to re apply it very often. So far she&#x27;s very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it makes my eyelashes very long and is a long last formula. It is also very easy to take off with just water, although I usually use an oil free makeup removers. My only slight caveat is that I&#x27;m not a big fan of the brush shape (the curled wand) I prefer a thinker more bristley large round brush, but that formula is so amazing it still works wonders.</li>
            <li> Looove this stuff! Very clean, smudge proof, great lashes and CRUELTY FREE!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through so many mascaras and have never found one I love like this one! It&#x27;s fabulous. I first discovered it in a subscription make up box and I can&#x27;t use anything else now!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara, lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t get clumpy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice but so far both times the mascara went on great and did a good job of separating my lashes. Brush was good at reaching my shortest inner lashes too. My lashes look really long. This is right up there with Lancome Definicils maybe even better!</li>
            <li> This mascara is flake free and does not run. The only mascara I have used that doesn&#x27;t end up creating black circles underneath my eyes at the end of the day!  Great product</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used. It stays put and never gives me raccoon eyes. Please keep making this great product. I would be lost without it.</li>
            <li> Loreal works the same.</li>
            <li> I have used so many brushes and mascaras over the years. This mascara lengthens and thickens and is extremely easy to remove when I want it off. Thank you for a great product!!</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I had read, I was hoping for much more from this mascara. I have long lashes to begin with, so it doesn&#x27;t take much for me to boost them. When applying, I felt like it was almost clumpy at times, and at other times I feel that I need to put on quite a few coats to get a noticeable look.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day without smudging or flaking but comes off super easy with soap and water. Makes my lashes look extremely long. Layers on really well for a basic day look or dramatic night look. All-in-all, love this mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice mascara. It goes on clean and looks very natural. You won&#x27;t get a major volume with it but it does provide a nice definition and added length.</li>
            <li> This mascara works amazing!!! It&#x27;s builds up volume while keeping my lashes separate. It even adds curl! The wand makes for easy, seamless application, and the formula has zero clump. It also has amazing staying power, yet washes off clean without residue. I received this mascara as part of a Birchbox sample and it became an immediate favorite! I am hooked! Request a sample if you are unsure, but I can guarantee that you will love it. It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Excellent mascara!!! Best I have even owned. Really plumps up your lashes!</li>
            <li> This mascara is nice, gives some good volume and all, but it still clumps just as much as any other cheaper mascara I&#x27;ve tried from the Drugstore. I think I&#x27;ll stick with my Illegal Lengths mascara for half the price.</li>
            <li> The best. Not a crazy plastic brush like many others.&lt;br /&gt;Nice brush -hourglass shaped and great results&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and no residue, keeps lashes separated.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping too!Would definitely purchase again. Great vendor!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this as a gift for my aunt based on the reviews here.  She had been going through hundreds of dollars in the department store trying to find her perfect mascara.  Exhausted from her complaining, I bought her this and she LOVES it.  We now are able to talk about the weather.  Oh yea, her eyes look good too.</li>
            <li> This mascara exceeded my expectations. I was looking at buying Latisse to enhance my eyelashes, but decided to try a new mascara first and I&#x27;m really glad I did!  My eyelashes look fuller and longer with this mascara, and even though it isn&#x27;t waterproof, you can survive a good cry without looking like a hot mess. :)</li>
            <li> This mascara is honestly incredible. I&#x27;ve tried SO many mascaras and there always seems to be one missing piece--either the mascara looks great but requires a primer, or it lasts forever but doesn&#x27;t go on that well, or it goes on well but irritates my eyes after a day of wear, etc.--but with this mascara, I swear I have no complaints. It doesn&#x27;t need a primer, it goes on beautifully and is super easy to build, it never, ever runs, it comes off easily with makeup remover (or even water and a washcloth if you&#x27;re in a pinch), and it never irritates my eyes or makes me feel like I have dry lashes. It looks GREAT. Before trying this mascara I felt like I sort of had to pick between a more subtle, daytime mascara and a more dramatic volumizing mascara, but with this mascara I can wear one or two coats for a softer look, or really layer it for extra volume without clumping or spidery lashes. Insane. I also love that you can get a free sample (that arrives super quick!!) via their website before buying. Perfect perfect perfect.</li>
            <li> Finally, a mascara that delivers!!  I will continue to purchase this for myself as well as my friends!  Great Product!</li>
            <li> Honestly for a mascara called BIG I expected more. Especially for $20. For me it lengthened fine, and definitely made my lashes darker...however it didn&#x27;t do any thickening. It took a good 5 coats to get any thickening. Then when I went to remove it, it would flake off in big chunks. Overall alone it kind of created spider lashes after so many coats. I started using a cheap mascara for the thickening aspect then this one for a final lengthening. I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> My eyes are sometimes sensitive to mascara, but this mascara is excellent and it comes off with soap and water......It stays all day and gives me volume, this will forever be a staple in my makeup bag.....thank you Elizabeth for making such an awesome product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the brush and the size of the tube of the So BIG Volumizing Mascara, but it does tend to flake...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many brands of mascara, from cheap to expensive but none was able to meet my demands.  I have sensitive eyes, thin &amp; short eye lashes &amp; I wear contacts.  My biggest complaints of other brandsis is that they don&#x27;t last, sting my eyes, or require rubbing my eyes to remove all the black smears.  This mascara makes my lashes look long and attractive, stays on all day (one night I forgot to take it off &amp; it still looked good in the AM), &amp; is easy to take off, (flakes off instead of smearing black into my sensitive skin under my eyes). The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it does clump on the applicator after a few times use.  I was happy to receive a sample so I could test it before buying which was a great idea.  I will buy this again &amp; do recommend this great product. I am now using my second order of this mascara and still recommend it.  The little clumping that sometimes occurs when applying it is easily remedied with a Qtip.</li>
            <li> Im 60 something with short thinning lashes.I think have tried every mascara ever made and this is by far the best. Its So Big makes my lashes look thick and long like never before and it does not smudge EVER. It dries fast so its quick and easy to make your eyes look great.And its really easy to remove it never flakes .I have very sensitive eyes and this mascara does not bother my eyes at all. Will tell friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> It definitely works and doesn&#x27;t clump, but it does appear to smudge off easily with sweat which I don&#x27;t love, I switched back to my waterproof XXL one for the summertime</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to find a mascara that truly does what it promises! At the end of each hot, humid day in Hawaii, I can always count on It&#x27;s So BIG Mascara to survive, un-smudged, just as thick and dark as when I applied it in the morning!</li>
            <li> I had great expectations, given the glowing reviews. However, I found the product to be just so so..nothing outstanding and certainly inferior to Mally, Tarte and Lancôme mascaras. Lashes do appear to be longer..but skimpy. If you are on the fence, don&#x27;t bother..</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this mascara in my ipsy glam bag. I immediately fell in love with it. It worked better than any mascara I had ever tried. It really lengthened and darkened my lashes with absolutely no clumping. I&#x27;ve been subscribed to ipsy for a while, and received many great products, but none of them were great enough to convince me to shell out big bucks for a full size product. However after I used this mascara I knew the full size product would be well worth the price. Based on quality alone I was prepared to pay $30 to $35 for this product. I was in complete shock when I saw the price was only $20! I will continue to buy this mascara as long as it&#x27;s available and look forward to trying many more Elizabeth Mott cosmetics.</li>
            <li> it does voluminize but on me it falkes in less than 3 hours, not so impressed for the cost it shouldnt flake</li>
            <li> I have been an aesthetion for over 10 years. I recently started to specialize in eyelash extensions. I have no time to get them myself but want long beautiful lashes too! On top of that I serve in the US Army Reserves. We were called to deploy and the job is intense. I am a hazmat specialist. The only reason I am bringing this in to play is: I wear a protective mask, I sweat like crazy its over 120 degrees some days, and the sand here is like getting microdermabration. BUT my lashes look great!!!! I have tried EVERYTHING from cheap to expensive, nothing works like this. I got a tester from ipsy and loved it for my spa work but I love it for my Army life. its tough enough to last through what i put it through and still make me feel like a girl! thank you sooooo much its like heaven on my lashes!</li>
            <li> I have really long eyelashes already, so when I put mascara on, it should accentuate them even further.  I bought Buxom off Sephora based on reviews and loved it because I had a gift card. I was looking for something different and always willing to try something new. I tried this mascara based on the reviews and it was terrible.  It turned my eyelashes into little crispy strands instead of full feathery, long lashes like I wanted and as depicted on the box.  Going back to Buxom or even the drugstore brands as they are even better than this mascara. Severely disappointed.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
            <li> I have long eyelashes, which can clump very easily with bad mascara. After a few months of clumpy lashes and throwing away a few tubes of mascara, I found Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s mascara on an Amazon search. Ordered it, loved it. My lashes are long and clump-free. My mother, who&#x27;s very critical of beauty products, even loved it. I plan to make this my mascara for time to come!</li>
            <li> I just received the mascara not long ago. I am still using it. It truly doesn&#x27;t smudge. One night I forgot to remove my makeup and woke up in the morning with no raccoon eyes! It also goes on cleanly and nicely. My lashes looked great, although I do think you should use a eyelash curler prior to using this mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this mascara; it does seem to give both length and volume.  Especially nice for someone older whose lashes don&#x27;t seem quite as full as they once were.  The only drawback to me is that it doesn&#x27;t wash off as easily with regular facial cleanser or soap and water as some brands.  I thought I had read in some reviews that it comes off easily.  To completely remove I need to take the extra step of using makeup remover, which to me is simply that, an extra step.  Though overall, I really love the mascara.</li>
            <li> The company that makes this offers samples to try. Once I tried it I fell a little bit in love. They send a nice size sample.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about the applicator brush, but seems to do well. Just got my first real sized mascara. I wear a surgical mask and face shield all day at work. People mostly only see my eyes. My lashes are very light. I had been try different waterproofs and was very skeptical about this product since its not, but it was a free sample. It stays on! I have had waterproofs that smudge and flake during the day and this doesn&#x27;t. Removal is maybe a little messy. I use coconut oil to remove it and it leaves little black specks all over my face. I have not tried swimming with it on.</li>
            <li> After about a month of using the product the &#x27;ring&#x27; at the top of the opening that serves to remove the excess mascara from the brush when it&#x27;s pulled out to apply came loose and is now stuck on the brush, not on the bottle where it should be.  So now when I pull out brush it&#x27;s all  globby with mascara because the excess is not getting wiped off.  So I can&#x27;t use it any longer and need to pitch it.  I have to say, until this happened I really like the product.  Not sure if this is just a fluke or others have had this problem.</li>
            <li> This is the best waterproof mascara I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used many brands;  you name them, I have tried them.  This product is what I have been searching for.  Without being pushy, I am wanting to recommend this to all of my friends.  The mascara glides on easily and stays all day without any clumping.  The result is a very natural look, and it seems that my lashes are getting thicker since I&#x27;ve been using this.  Perhaps my other mascaras were causing me to lose eyelashes.  Either way, I am thrilled with this product, and I really hope that it stays available for years to come.  I am a lifetime customer.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara! Not smudgy, but very dramatic!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about ordering this mascara because the cost was more than double of what I normally pay.  Well, they really will send you a sample to try before purchasing.  I am very happy with this product.  Finally a mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump or flake and still washes away with normal face soap!  Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Great stuff - no flaking, nice build, no irritation, no clumping. I&#x27;ve resisted wearing mascara forever, but this product put me over the line.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got one that was old, but i don&#x27;t understand the good reviews. One of the worst mascaras I&#x27;ve tried. Clumpy, doesn&#x27;t elongate at all... I will be going back to sephora and getting buxom or urban decay</li>
            <li> I am a 52 year old woman who had given up using mascara because I was tired of raccoon eyes, tired of itchy eyes and so on. One day for the heck of it I looked up best-selling mascara on Amazon and came across Elizabeth&#x27;s  It&#x27;s So Big mascara. I ordered it and am very glad I did. I love the brush.... no clumping and super easy to apply... and the product itself is great! No raccoon eyes !! No itchiness or burning or flaking! Awesome mascara!</li>
            <li> This is the FIRST mascara that I have ever used that does not smudge.  I love it!</li>
            <li> *** Happy to report that I can already update my initial review. Soon after leaving my review I was contacted by a friendly rep from Elizabeth Mott, she apologized and offered to send replacement mascara. The customer service is fabulous and very prompt. To my surprise, they also refunded the $20 I originally paid. What a treat. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do like the appearance of my lashes when wearing this mascara but have to give it 3 stars because of the tube itself. 9 times out of 10 when I unscrew the wand from the tube, the small piece that should be attached to the tube to pull of excess mascara from the brush, comes off with the wand. I either have to pull it off the wand and push it back into the opening of the tube, or try to screw the wand back in tightly in hopes that the little piece will stay put in the tube. Overall a nice mascara, but the tube can be frustrating.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! It does what it says (volumizing) my lashes!</li>
            <li> I have used Blinc mascara for years..Thought it was the best thing since sliced bread, until, they changed the formula now it is crap..Which forced me to find a replacement... this is a much harder task than it seems...I have very sensitive greasy eyes lids...All mascaras run on me except original Blinc...Until, I bought this mascara, The search is over!!! This is by far the best mascara i have ever used...First off, you dont feel this mascara your lashes stay soft and natural feeling, second, it builds, lenghens and curls my lashes, and doesnt flake, smudge or smear, and Lasts allllllllll day and the best part is, it washes off very easily with water!!!!!  Love, Love Love this Mascara!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am writing this review after ordering my second tube of this product. It is amazing. My eyelashes are exceptionally long, and I have spent many years looking for mascara that does not give me raccoon eyes. I have worn this product while running, at a water park, and just generally being outside all day. This product stays put and keeps my eyes looking amazing. I took another reviewer&#x27;s recommendation and purchased the Shisheido eyelash base for additional oomf. Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> This by far is the best mascara on the market.  As it advertised  it performed just great. My lashes were full and it the mascara lengthened it beyond belief. I had several people asking me if I was wearing false lashes or if I had my lash extensions,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wear alot of makeup but now in my 40&#x27;s, realized I need to do a little bit to my face - just the sign of the times with age.  So glad I found this.  Need the mascara to help &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; my eyes and make them pop a bit - and this does just that.  A little eye shadow, MAC brown eyeliner and this mascara, I am good to go in the eyes department.  No smudges or irritation - a tad pricey but well worth it!  Definitely my go-to for mascara!!</li>
            <li> So I went a little crazy last week and ordered 3 mascaras. I will rank them, in order, in case anyone else has a severe mascara anxiety meltdown.&lt;br /&gt;1. Lash Factory 3D Fiber - It was at least $10 less than what I paid for the Younique fiber stuff and just as good.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;2. Arbonne It’s a long story – Very smitten with it.  I would say this is the best non 3D/Fiber mascara out there. I wore it and my friend – who is more crazy than I am and has a strange fixation with the fact that I have young looking eyes, so you know she really studies me – said “You’re lashes look super long today”. I actually consider this to be like a middle ground between regular mascara and the fiber stuff.  Mascara purgatory, but in a good way. Sometimes you don’t want to be all decked out but you want that intensity or definition… Also it’s a little cheaper on Amazon, I think my friend spent about $12 more buying from someone else.&lt;br /&gt;3. Elizabeth Mott It’s so big – last place. Don’t get me wrong it’s good, but not as rich and dramatic as the others.  I would say this would be more like a base coat type of mascara, which is how I will use it. And it was the cheapest, so I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this company does not do testing on animals and they make a superior product. This mascara lengthens my lashes like no other yet it is easily removed.  I will be trying more Elizabrth Mott products!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s got great longevity and doesn&#x27;t come off easily. I am also pleased that it doesn&#x27;t appear clumpy or gross when you lay it on thick for extra drama. Overall great product and will be back for more!</li>
            <li> Bought this mascara on recommendation of a beauty vlogger. I really like it- goes on easily, gives volume and little bit of length without clumping. Also lasts all day without flaking! My trouble was removing it- it was difficult to get it all off and if I didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;d wake up in the morning with very irritated eyes. I really wish this wasn&#x27;t the case or my search for &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; mascara would be over... Unfortunatly due to too many morning of eye irritation I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a mascara I really love.  This one is okay.  Have to seem to layer it a lot and just not as impressive as just some drug store ones I normall get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a former Makeup artist for PEOPLE. I have tried every single mascara on the market. YSL Babydoll was my Holy Grail, with occasional visits from Armani Eyes to Kill and DiorShow.&lt;br /&gt;This dark horse, It&#x27;s So Big Mascara, has now eclipsed them all!! If you want a natural look, 2 coats. If you want a dramatic look, keep going!&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the amazing thing: I had a massage, face down on the table, and then went into the steam room! It&#x27;s So Big did not even budge! My lashes were as long, voluminous and flawless as when I walked in!&lt;br /&gt;I really think we have a winner here, folks...</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!!  I have been a loyal Kiss Me mascara user for years and never thought I would switch.  But the cost for one tube is so expensive and I saw so many positive review of So BIG that I figured I would try it.  I love it for everyday use, it doesn&#x27;t smear or crumble under my long lower lashes and it goes on even and not clumply!  And the best part is it washes off easily with my foaming face wash!</li>
            <li> After using this mascara for more than two weeks, it  was disappointing because in spite of other claims, for me it was messy to apply and it did leave clumps on my eyelashes.[[ASIN:B00FAEOCP0 It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara (Black) by Elizabeth Mott Net Weight 0.33 fl oz/10ml]]</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing I&#x27;ve tried several different mascaras from drug store to high end and nothing compares this gives me the most volume as well as length &amp; doesn&#x27;t flake of at all. I would suggest getting a very good eye makeup remover however because this stuff can be tricky to get off.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, short lashes and have been looking for something that would make my eyes stand out a bit more!  I found it!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so Big is not a miracle worker, when you are blessed with short lashes, but it is the best my lashes have ever looked.  Highly recommend:-)&lt;br /&gt;Cypress, TX.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! It is seriously amazing. I have a bad habit of touching my eyes and face a lot, and still this didn&#x27;t smudge. It is more similar to waterproof mascara without being a pain to remove. In fact, it is very easy to take off. I use plain water, no soap, and it comes off in pieces/strands, not smudges. I suspect that this characteristic is what keeps it so smudge-proof. The wand is also great for lengthening and doesn&#x27;t make my lashes look weird and spidery or clumpy, like some mascaras will do. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it zero stars!!&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT waste $20.00.&lt;br /&gt;I found a MUCH cheaper one that is far better on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;(E. L. F. Waterproof.)&lt;br /&gt;It is my favorite right now.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything really for my lashes. The formula left my lashes stiff and thin looking. I have decent lashes as it is, but rely on mascara and different application techniques to enhance them. This formula and brush were just not for me, I really wanted to like it due to all the rave reviews (seriously, I depend on those!) but it wasn&#x27;t meant to be. I did give it two stars due to the fast shipping and cute packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the perfect mascara for many years now, so when I stumbled upon Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s It&#x27;s So Big mascara and read all the amazing reviews I had to give it a try. I ordered a sample from the company&#x27;s website and when I first tried it I was instantly IN LOVE!!! The brush was perfect, the liquid had just the right viscosity, not too runny not to thick, and it went on SO smoothly,I could apply coat after coat without any clumps! It lasted the entire day without any flaking and it didn&#x27;t end up under my eyes. I also went for a run at the end of the day, and the mascara was STILL on my lashes. It has an AMAZING staying power for a mascara that&#x27;s not waterproof, yet washing it off was a breeze. It comes off quickly, you don&#x27;t have to rub it, and it doesn&#x27;t smudge all over your eyes like regular mascara..... It just melts off your lashes. I immediately bought the full size mascara and though I still love it, my only complaint is that I think the opening of the full size tube is too wide for the brush (which is the same size as the brush that came with the sample) so it pulls out a LOT of product and I really have to scrape it otherwise my lashes get clumpy. I ended up swapping the brush to a different one and it works MUCH better. That said, I still highly recommend it, and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I got a sample tube, and loved it, so I came to Amazon to find it.  I do love the way it goes on, but with a brand new tube, it does clump up on the brush where you have to clear the brush off to apply it properly.  I wear contacts, so I appreciate the fact that it doesn&#x27;t flake off. I work long hours and it hangs in there with me!</li>
            <li> This mascara is seriously amazing. I received a trial size in a beauty box and figured it would never beat my favorite pink and green tube.&lt;br /&gt;Not only did it beat it - it completely exceeded all my tests. It stays, no flaking off, no rubbing off under my eyes and? Often I don&#x27;t even need to curl my lashes as the mascara does it for me!!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously the best $20 beauty purchase ever!</li>
            <li> After using this mascara for over a month, I have decided to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth&lt;br /&gt;No clumping&lt;br /&gt;It is black&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be a quality product&lt;br /&gt;Separates the lashes nicely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;It is a very thin mascara and does not thicken the lashes or add any volume as advertized, although some may prefer this&lt;br /&gt;I found that when I tried to apply another coat, it then started to clump the lashes together and this was not a good look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would say this mascara would be good for someone who does not want anything dramatic at all. It would be a good daytime/work mascara.  It will not thicken or give any noticeable volume to lashes, in my opinion and from my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I will go back to my long standing favorite:  BadGal lash mascara by Benefit :)  I like a thicker lash, and that does the job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of different brands of mascara and with long natural lashes, my mascara always flakes off or runs down. Not this one though! So easy to apply, I don&#x27;t need 5 coats like other brands, just 2 and I&#x27;m set!&lt;br /&gt; I HIGHLY recommend you try this out, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have slightly watery eyes, and also fairly prominent dark undereye circles, which makes for a terrible combination with flaky/runny mascara.  I have tried many brands, but always ended up with raccoon eyes by the end of the work-day.  Not with this mascara.  It is by far the best I have tried!  No issues with my contact lenses, either</li>
            <li> Great mascara. This is my first time using and really love it!</li>
            <li> I asked for the free sample. It can quickly. Thus stuff is the best mascara I have ever tried. I love it. Happy to pay $20 for the full size.</li>
            <li> To keep it short and sweet, I am ALWAYS on the lookout for a new mascara, but now that I found this one I am never going back. Doesn&#x27;t run, smear or smudge, and makes my eyelashes look longer.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, does not smudge, easy to take off. Really adds volume and thickness</li>
            <li> I also use Blink mascara and had been using it prior to finding your mascara. I really like your mascara, especially the brush that &#x27;grabs&#x27; the lashes and separates them,&lt;br /&gt;I wish you the best and a sustainable thriving business.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works just as promised. As a 54 yr. old woman, I have used lots of products in my lifetime. This one is one I&#x27;ll be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, if you like tarantulas. I respect spiders, but I certainly don&#x27;t want my eye lashes to resemble them! I&#x27;m one of the few women that have lots of nice, long lashes... except when I put this garbage on it turns my lovely eyelashes into.. 8 stringy daddy-long-leg legs! No thanks, Elizabeth Mott, I&#x27;ll be sticking to Benefits Yes! They&#x27;re Real! mascara. You know what they say. If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it!</li>
            <li> Just got this and so far so good. Absolutely NO flaking or smudging throughout the entire day - WOW! and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had any mascara that can do that. Looks the same as when I first put it on this morning. Also, doesn&#x27;t clump and my lashes don&#x27;t feel brittle. No eye irritation either, which a lot of eye make up will cause, so that&#x27;s a big plus for me. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like, was that it goes on very light and takes awhile to build up the length and thickness I like but, oh well - at least it stays on. I haven&#x27;t tried to take it off yet either - so we&#x27;ll see how that goes. From some of the reviews I&#x27;ve read, I think I&#x27;ll try taking it off first with Coconut Oil.</li>
            <li> Finally, a mascara that does its job!</li>
            <li> This mascara is inexpensive, non-clumping and comes off easily when you want it to.  I like it... good stuff! JB</li>
            <li> Being an older woman with skimpy eye lashes, I have finally found the perfect Mascara!  This has to be the best by far.  It goes on without clumping and if I forget to take it off, it doesn&#x27;t pluck out the skimpy eye lashes I have.  It lasts all day and into the night.  I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> The lash level was excellent and much better than anything else I have used.  It was worth the price that it cost..</li>
            <li> I was expecting big things from this mascara after all the rave reviews on Amazon, but after using it for the first time today, I wasn&#x27;t as wowed as I hoped! It&#x27;s definitely not bad - just not as life changing as some of the other reviews seem to claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;No irritation, which is always a plus. I have sensitive skin so I tend to be wary when using any new products, but this one has given me no issues so far.&lt;br /&gt;No smudging or flaking! That said, I only had it on for maybe 4 or 5 hours before washing my face, so we&#x27;ll see how it holds up for an entire day. So far so good though.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to remove just by washing my face, which was nice - with my usual mascara (Sephora full action extreme effect), if I try to just wash it off it ends up smudging under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not so good:&lt;br /&gt;It went on a little clumpy; I had to manually separate out some of my top lashes after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel like I got as much of a volumizing effect as I was hoping. It wasn&#x27;t terrible, just...not much better than the average drugstore mascara. For the price, I was definitely hoping for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m not sure the product is good enough to justify its price point, and I&#x27;ll likely end up going back to my previous brand.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara!  It doesn&#x27;t flake off or smudge, and it looks great all day. It makes my eyelashes look thick and beautiful. I highly recommend this mascara!</li>
            <li> Makes lashes look long and does nor fall during the day!  i will buy again for sure</li>
            <li> I am a Maybelline Colossal fan and have been for about 6 years. I was hoping I could find something that I liked more and was extremely disappointed. Bummer and waste of $20 for me personally.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge, great for swimming and you don&#x27;t look like a raccoon at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> My wife (who is 50) decided to try this mascara after seeing all of the rave reviews on Amazon.  It does not clump, it is easy to apply and goes on very very very black.  My wife said that even with the best mascaras she often ends up with some spots of black or runny spots from her mascara after working all day and not touching up her make up.  NOT WITH THIS.  Not even a single smear under the eyes.  My wife uses Lancome bi-facial make up remover, and says that this comes off without any problem.  Overall, a great mascara that she will buy again.</li>
            <li> I first received this mascara in my monthly ipsy bag and I fell in love with it. I used up the small sample which actually did last me for a  good amount of time. After I was out I found it on amazon and instantly ordered it. It was way bigger than the sample size which was surprising. It is a little bit on the pricy side compared to regular drug store make up but it does the best job out of all the mascaras I have tried. What I also love is that it is so easy to remove and you don&#x27;t need to be rubbing your eyes much when removing your makeup. I love that I can wear this mascara the whole day and it will not smudge or give me raccoon eyes since I also wear it on my bottom lashes. The fine brush applicator reaches all the lashes creating a BIG voluminous lashes. I highly recommend this product you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, washes off easily.  I haven&#x27;t tried putting on lots of layers, but a couple of coats works well.</li>
            <li> Always searching for a mascara that lasts all day with the same volume as when first applied. This one comes very close!  I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
            <li> Wears all day long!  Comes off easily with baby oil on a cotton ball.  Goes on easily, looks great, I highly recommend it!  Best part, it&#x27;s &#x27;beauty without bunnies&#x27; - cruelty free!</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used.  Does not clump up, maximizies lash length, stays on, yet washes off in shower at night.  I will never use another brand.</li>
            <li> This BIG MOTT mascara has been the first out of the last 8 attempts to replace my LANCOME Defincils mascara that has been successful. YEAH! For Miss Mott. I notice that I get a fair amount of volume and great lengthening. I&#x27;ve often wondered if it&#x27;s the way you use the wand, which is a  great wand. I notice no flaking after a full day in the water world of dentistry. No clumping. It is a great product, but alas... how many hours do YOU have to work to afford a single tube of mascara?</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in my September 2013 Ipsy bag and to my surprise loved it.  I was using Fairy Drops Scandal Queen Mascara which is my ultimate FAVORITE. At first I was little skeptical when I pulled out the trial size of the it&#x27;s so big handle, and a little glob came out with it. After a couple of uses I&#x27;m a BIG FAN!! I ordered two full size from Elizabeth Motts website.&lt;br /&gt;I have very little lashes and this mascara lengthens them significantly hense why I purchased two more.</li>
            <li> great product after I used it the first time I reorder a second tube that day</li>
            <li> I received this as part of an ipsy subscription. I will never use any other mascara now! This mascara doesn&#x27;t run, smudge and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it running down my face by the end of the work day! I def recommend!</li>
            <li> The only thing this product did as promised is that it is smudge proof and easy to come off.  I would purchase this mascara again only because it is smudge proof.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  Excellent product.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Brilliant product. Best mascara I&#x27;ve tried. The formula borders on revolutionary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s especially good at adding length and curl. I have short, stick-straight lashes, but this mascara actually curls my lashes--no curler needed. And I cannot emphasize how clump-free it is. Zero clumps. It&#x27;s the key that makes it dramatically buildable, without ever leaving your lashes looking fibrous and spidery. I&#x27;ve experimented with building my lashes until they look like falsies. There are probably other mascaras that give you bigger lashes faster, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s another that will give you lashes so big and natural at the same time. It&#x27;s also so lightweight that your lashes stay soft and nice to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does not flake, run, clump, or come off until you want it to, and then it rubs off easily with warm water. I&#x27;ve worn it to the gym and run a 10k on the treadmill, sweat pouring down my face. I&#x27;ve worn it to bed and woken up with great lashes. It does not waver. It does not fail. The formula is really something special. It kind of reminds me of Blinc--even though it&#x27;s not \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; per se, it&#x27;s not exactly water soluble either. It doesn&#x27;t turn into wet ink when you get it wet. Rather, when I rub it off in the shower, it comes off in soft pieces, sort of like Blinc&#x27;s \\&quot;lash tubes\\&quot; (google it). But unlike Blinc, It&#x27;s So BIG has a way better formula.</li>
            <li> Chose this because it is cruelty free, that being said this is one of the best mascaras I have used.  It goes on easily and stays on.  No raccoon eyes-yay!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend told me to write a review of this eyeliner, as she is currently busy putting on while being annoyed that I am lazily lounging around on the opposite couch. So here goes: She says: &amp;#34;[she] loves it. It easily earns 5 stars. It is the best eyeliner that she has ever bought.&amp;#34; That is to say I bought it for her. But never the less, I am always happy to leave positive reviews when warranted.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! Beautiful eyelashes, no flaking or smearing, and washes off with water. I have sensitive eyes and this mascara does not bother me at all!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> It really IS the best!</li>
            <li> I was sent a free sample of this mascara, this is nice stuff. I was caught in a rainstorm, got soaked, it didn&#x27;t run, but did wash off very well with soap and water, (this is not the waterproof mascara), It is not clumpy, and did not flake, as some reviewers have stated, and made my lashes look full again. But some beauty products work for some and not others. But for me, i really like this.</li>
            <li> Not sticky or clumpy, goes on smooth . A little flaky at the end of the day ( very minor) . One of the better mascaras I have bought online.</li>
            <li> This mascara stays all day, removes easily, and creates long and thick lashes.  It feels amazing and soft when you apply it, which I love.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have killer allergies, contacts, and a seemingly unbreakable habit of rubbing at my eyes.  This is one of the best mascaras that I&#x27;ve ever tried for keeping me from looking like a raccoon by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revlon Colorstay Overtime is also pretty good at that, but this mascara is more comfortable for me to wear.  I think it may be a matter of fewer clumps or maybe just a more flexible texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of length and volume, it&#x27;s good.  Not glam, but good...natural looking but better.  That&#x27;s what I was looking for, so I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  However, if you&#x27;re going for truly dramatic lashes, you might need to keep layering it on.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly impressed!  The mascara goes on very evenly and I could see a huge difference in length right away! By the 3rd coat I couldn&#x27;t believe how long my lashes were!  It was also extremely easy to remove with soap, water and a wash cloth.  The residue that came off reminded me of the Naris mascara I used to use a long time ago.  I love this Elizabeth Mott mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Guess what!  I just went through a 5-mile run and it still did not smudge or flake!  This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for!!</li>
            <li> the delivery went well, the product was good but too expensive for just a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this mascara before but decided to give it a shot and I&#x27;m not disappointed. This is a great mascara, I recommend it!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the mascara the wand snapped off the lid and is stuck in side the tube.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing. Now because it is past the return date I am told I cannot return it. Wow. Brand new product. Very disappointing to have this happen and then find out the seller will not make good on it. It is obviously defective.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product, but I can&#x27;t say that I do.  I&#x27;ve been trying several mascaras lately, as I&#x27;ve found that many tend to flake or smudge off through the day.  I can&#x27;t say that this product does that, but I will say that it is incredibly dry &amp; difficult to apply.  It felt like there was little to no actual mascara inside the container after I first bought it, and it barely looked like anything was on my lashes after several attempts.  I guess the pro is that I won&#x27;t have to worry about under eye debris...but con is that I may as well have forgotten to put on my mascara.  With light blonde lashes, this is disappointing...I definitely need more.  Back to the drawing board!</li>
            <li> I. Love. This. Mascara.  Makes my  lashes look full, thick and accentuates their length with out being clumpy. Best of all no flakes! If I cry at church, no big deal, it stays in place without running, getting in my eyes or giving me the dreaded raccoon eyes.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara now for several months -- probably six or more.  I absolutely love it.  I&#x27;ve looked for other similar products on the market, but best I can tell they don&#x27;t exist.  I work out a lot, and it doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes, and it comes off so easily it&#x27;s unbelievable.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Most awesome mascara ever! Girl in pedi chair next to me was wearing it &amp; I had to have it. This brand pulls off what other major store brands advertise but can&#x27;t deliver. Lashes come out looking long, full, crossed &amp; therefore thick.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was ordinary, but then i kept using it and it&#x27;s worth the money. It never clumps and it really separates your lashes. I can keep building layers on each other. I use 2 coats for work - I don&#x27;t think 1 is really noticeable. I&#x27;ve never tried more than 4 coats. My bottom lashes stand out more from this mascara than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. You can actually tell they&#x27;re there and they look really long! the brush is so easy to use and I haven&#x27;t had any problems washing it off. I doesn&#x27;t seem to wear off, but always comes off with any soap and water I use. I&#x27;m definitely getting it again</li>
            <li> Works great.  It makes my blonde eyelashes really stand out, coats them well individually so they don&#x27;t clump.  And it doesn&#x27;t flake off during the day like every other brand I&#x27;ve tried.  Normally I end up with some black specs below my eyes that end up smearing and looking like bags (awful!) but this does not.  It does wash off at the end of the day though, not much issue.  I just use normal face soap, too--the kind that doesn&#x27;t hurt the eyes--and wash all over.  Voila!  Right off.</li>
            <li> This mascara is awesome! The formula is light, but still lengthens my lashes. I like the application brush, it&#x27;s different. This product is better than some brands that cost more!!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara - the shape of the brush, and it really stays put. But the only reason I gave it four stars is because it does not come off easily with make up remover. It just takes a bit of extra rubbing. I do like it enough to have ordered another tube.</li>
            <li> This mascara is very sticky &amp; never drys! After all the good reviews I thought I would give it a try &amp; sorry to say but it is no better than some I have purchased from the pharmacy :(</li>
            <li> Wand is terrible; mascara thin yet globby.  Worst mascara ever. Buy the Benefit They&#x27;re Real instead.</li>
            <li> This mascara isn&#x27;t all that they say. It takes about 3 coats to get it thick. Actually Loreal is better than this.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever purchased! It goes on thick and lush, doesn&#x27;t smear, doesn&#x27;t flake, and is a good price. I have purchased all the top line mascaras, but this one (in the price range) is my favorite. Glad I tried it. I will keep purchasing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything great for my lashes</li>
            <li> I always re-curl my lashes after applying mascara... several times,  and I end up having to try and diminish the clumps with my other mascaras.  I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> I dont like it at all. I read the reviews and people said that it was easy to remove and its NOT! Its so hard! Does not gives volume.</li>
            <li> Wow! I love this product it does what it should be doing. Does not smear...</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever!  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the right mascara for a long time...THIS IS IT!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Gives me long dark lashes :)!</li>
            <li> best stuff on the planet. does NOT budge or &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34; and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> This is my first Amazon review, and I buy stuff through Amazon all the time - that&#x27;s how much I love this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really sensitive eyes that water a lot, so I have always bought waterproof mascara so it doesn&#x27;t end up running down my face. The mascara usually ends up irritating my eyes even more. Not so with Elizabeth Mott. It goes on smooth, not at all clumpy, the brush is great. And best of all, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all. Even if I do have teary eyes, it doesn&#x27;t run. Looks great all day too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an all around fabulous product. I would recommend it for anyone, especially anyone with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Great product! not sure if its the best Volumizing mascara, but it does a great job. My eyelashes look nice and long and mascara stays through  the day without any problems. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic,  I will keep purchasing it!</li>
            <li> I found out about this mascara from Ipsy.  This is one of the best mascaras I have ever tried.  I was always a fan of Estee Lauder but I can no longer justify the price and quality.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product, and the reviews got me so excited alas I was very disappointed. Its very thin stuff and it runs all over, giving me dreaded raccoon eyes and random mascara spots. The worst part is that even after I curl my eye lashes once I apply the mascara they get all bent out of shape and straight and clumpy. I wish I could return the item honestly but I threw away the packaging because I really thought Id love it, I spent $20 and I am very unhappy. Back on the market looking for that perfect mascara again.</li>
            <li> My short thinned lashes look long and thick with this mascara! I am so glad I found this product. Great investment!</li>
            <li> This mascara is just what I have been looking for. Long, voluminous lashes w/o clumping, smudging, or flaking. Stays on all day/night, but washes off easily. Perfect!</li>
            <li> This mascara does not help with volumizing or extending lashes, it makes eyelashes clumpy and the brush is not great at all!!</li>
            <li> Very uniform application -- the brush shape really helps separate lashes, and helps application.  It truly does stay on all-day, but washes off with soap and water --- a plus for me!  I will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> Received a sample in an ipsy subscription, liked it so much that I ordered the full size version. Makes my lashes long and separated. Easy to remove with no gunky residue.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!!!! It leaves my lashes long, full, clutter free and lasts all day.  I love it!!!!  I am actually using it without an eyeliner on my upper lids and it looks great.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of mascaras, ranging from lower prices to extremely expensive, but none have done the job like It&#x27;s So Big Volumizing Mascara. It&#x27;s taken me over 40 years of experimenting with all brands, old and new; finally I have found sheer perfection!!!!  I highly recommend this product.  I am thrilled!!!!</li>
            <li> Was not sure if I should believe what others had said but decide to give this mascara a go!  And it really is great mascara and lasts without flaking.  My eyelashes look better than ever!</li>
            <li> This mascara is awesome!  It does not clump, it does not smudge and it looks amazing on your eyelashes - it gives you the mod falsies look!  It comes off very easily with just warm water - I lightly rub my eyelashes at the sink in the evening between my index finger and thumb with some warm water, since the mascara contains fibers to build volume they come off like little tubes and it is great because you don&#x27;t get that Raccoon eyed - I need to wash my face again LOOK.  The fibers just literally rinse away!  This mascara is the best I have ever used (I have tried nearly every designer brand at Sephora)!</li>
            <li> this is such a good mascara, doesn&#x27;t flake, stays on until you take it off, and the best part, its cruelty free!!</li>
            <li> I was so impressed by this mascara after receiving a sample that I bought the full size.  It has a unique formula, the texture kinda looks thick and gluey, like eyelash primers, except very black.  Or if you&#x27;ve ever used Milani infinite eye liquid eyeliner, the texture is kind of like that product, a bit thinner though.&lt;br /&gt;I like that this product really holds up during the day with no smudging or flaking.  It&#x27;s takes at least a day for the product to begin to break down, and it will flake, not smear or run when it does.  It does remove fairly easily with eyemakeup remover, considering its staying power.  And it will come off in flaky clumps or mascara crumbs on the cotton pad when removed.&lt;br /&gt;When I curl my lashes and use this mascara, they slowly go back to being mostly straight again while the product is drying.  :(&lt;br /&gt;But the wand is the reason I rated this mascara 4 instead of 5 stars.  The brush is wide in the ends and narrow in the middle.  Really awkward and given the struggle I have with this design, I think it&#x27;s more fancy than practical.  I wish the brush were a just a practical cone shape, wide at one end and tapers narrow at the other end.  It would be a lot easier for me to use the narrow end where I need it and wide end where I need it.  The narrow part being in the middle is mostly useless to me, esp when I try to rock the brush at the root of my lashes, the narrow part won&#x27;t reach the roots well, and the thick ends end up getting mascara all over my eyelids while I&#x27;m trying to get that narrow part to rock at the root.  Anyway, because of this awkward design, I find myself using the wide end the of brush at the end of the wand only, and it&#x27;s more time consuming to apply mascara than it would be if the brush were just... a little less fancy.  Luckily, this product doesn&#x27;t screw up my eyemakeup if I get it on my lids. once dry the mistakes just kind of fall off.&lt;br /&gt;Despite the few short-comings, I still really like this mascara.  It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, it lasts all day, is nice and black, and just looks pretty.  Not too natural, but not too voluminous and heavy either.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It&#x27;s really good. My eyelash looks really long. At the firts time I felt a little disappointed,  I thought that was a waste of money. But the second time I used it I realized how my eyelashes looked really really long.&lt;br /&gt;Now I recomend this mascara to all my coworkers and off course to my friends too.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
            <li> I will start off my saying I am a mascara fanatic! I am so in love with this product, full lash separation with massive volume!!! Not clumpy at all!! So easy to take off . I wear it my whole shift at work , and no fly away clumps below my eyes !! I am so in love with this mascara, I believe I found my tube for life, it would be a hard competition to beat this one!! Love love love love ittttt!!!!! :D</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t clump or apply too heavy, and the huge brush allows for easy and even application.  In addition, this company&#x27;s commitment to creating cruelty free products is a big plus in my book.  I&#x27;ll be continuing to buy this mascara in the future.</li>
            <li> I have tried SO many mascaras, from drugstore cheapies to designer/Sephora goodies. Hands down, this is my favorite. It goes on really nicely, and STAYS on without smudging, clumping, or flaking. But somehow also manages to be easy to take off! I feel like usually you have to choose one or the other, and smudge-proof mascaras can be really hard to get off, but when I wash my face at night, the wash cloth takes off all of this mascara! Definitely worth the price, and one tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve used to date! I almost was talked into buying the latest direct-sales mascara trend until I did some research and stumbled across this. Not only does it create beautifully long lashes like never before, but doesn&#x27;t flake either! I wear contacts and have always had issues with mascara flaking into my eyes and irritating, not anymore! I highly recommend, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought mascara that was cheaper and much better than this product. It does not last through the day even with careful and multiple applications. I found it very drying and did nothing to help the volume of the length of my eyelashes. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> My mascara had hardly anything in it. I used it twice with what ever was inside. didn&#x27;t see any volumizing about it for the price. went back to store and bought my old revoln volumizing . dont waste your money</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My lashes are long and full, and even better it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or leave me with raccoon eyes :)</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever bought! My long search for a mascara that actually works is over.  Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my previous MAC and a Urban Decay mascaras.  I like this better than the MAC and as much as the Urban Decay although the effects are different.  I do not have long or thick lashes. They are average length and light.  This mascara is a nice, dark black that adds length and lasts all day.  It removes easily with Neutrogena eye makeup remover or Neutragena gentle foaming face wash.  If you like individual long lashes, this is the mascara for you. It lengthens and separates and doesn&#x27;t clump together.  Applying multiple coats will give you a thicker look so maybe that&#x27;s where it volumizes.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Does thicken my lashes and easy to wash off.  I have straight Asian lashes so&lt;br /&gt;Would have likes it to be curling or waterproof so it holds a curl.  Also great bc it doesn&#x27;t smudge.  So no raccoon eyes :-).  This is one of the better ones I tried and would buy again.  Have tried all kinds in the past from drugstore to Chanel and Dior.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no better than the grocery store mascara. It wasn&#x27;t worth the premium price I don&#x27;t recommend it for the cost</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, so far it&#x27;s perfect. You can add coats for more volume and it does not clump up and look ugly. It lasts all day and is not terrible to remove. It gives me very full, very long looking lashes that are not caterpillary. It&#x27;s a little pricey for me but so far it blows everything else out of the water.</li>
            <li> THE BEST! I have tried 100&#x27;s of mascara&#x27;s over the years, never finding one that had it all, but this one does. It goes on smoothly, no clumps, it doesn&#x27;t straighten my just curled lashes, it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; leaving me with raccoon eyes, it washes off easily. After a long day I will have some flakes...but I can live with that. I didn&#x27;t buy it for super long and over coated lashes for length  and volume that some reviewers want, I just want a good product that stays on my lashes.</li>
            <li> The best mascara you&#x27;ll ever buy.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge, flake or smear.  It withstands through humid weather, tears and no &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; eyes.  Plus, it washes off with soap and water.  You couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> No Clumps and stays on.  Great product.</li>
            <li> i like because it doesn&#x27;t smear and it doesn&#x27;t leave clumps on your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I need to change my previous review, but not sure how. My mascara was pretty dry at first, but now it seems to be covering much better. Possibly, I had residue from a previous mascara???? In any event, I do like it now. It covers well, stays on, ad is easy to remove. Oh and the product was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this macara.  It makes my eye lashes bigger and longer.</li>
            <li> Love the BIG mascara!  Makes my lashes look super long, and washes off easily  and Amazon fast shipping what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I have found the mascara of all mascaras!  Won&#x27;t smudge and lasts all day. I will never buy another brand. Not waterproof but sure does seem like it and washes off easily</li>
            <li> Like most of U I have used many mascaras over the years. None of them living up to their claims of truly lushing out your lashes or not clumping or flaking.&lt;br /&gt;To tell the truth I wan&#x27;t expecting much better from this item but, Thanks Gals, it had so many great reviews I decided to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;Well, I LUV it!! Absolutely the best mascara available &amp; that includes even the high end ones.&lt;br /&gt;I have long lashes to begin with but this product totally lengthens &amp; darkens them giving an ultra feminine look.&lt;br /&gt;So much so that often I just dab on a bit of bronzer with this mascara and head out the door feeling Gorgeous!!&lt;br /&gt;Go for it, I feel certain you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers &amp; Shine On,  Zoe</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara.  It adds volume and length to my lashes without clumping easily.  It stays on all day without any flaking, which is my favorite part.  The trade off to this is that it&#x27;s a little difficult to get off (sort of stringy) unless you use eye makeup remover.  Otherwise, far surpasses other mascaras I have tried in the past (Este Lauder, Too Faced, Tarte, etc).</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with this awesome mascara! My eyelashes are pale and rather thin. After applying &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; Mascara I feel like a movie star! Thank you Elizabeth Mott!</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly amazing! Makes me feel like I have falsies when I put it on.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best mascara ever!!! No clumps, no running, no smudging. It also gets and thick and dark as you want it. It goes on really easy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge. Easy off. Like this product</li>
            <li> I really like my Elizabeth Mott mascara, I&#x27;m still trying to figure out what works for me.Should I wait for drying in between coats? I notice if I reapply right away my eyelashes uncurl. So at this point I&#x27;m still experimenting, but I most definitely notice longer lashes!,</li>
            <li> Typical mascara. A bit over priced.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  It is the best at lenghening lashes.  In combination with a volumizing mascara, it is wonderful!  I will order it again.  I will have to check this line to see if they also have a volumizing mascara.  Although this is called volumizing, I feel it is more lengthening...</li>
            <li> Amazing.  Will never buy another brand.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product. Little difficult to remove but overall I would say I am satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but doesn&#x27;t quite fit the description of BIG volume. I have tiny sparse lashes and need something to make them visible.  I was looking for something more dramatic like the L&#x27;oreal Paris Voluminous Original Mascara. What is great about the product is that it does not smear.  I did see a couple of tiny flakes at the end of the day but nothing to complain about. I had previously bought Yves Saint Laurent Volume Effet Faux Cils Luxurious Mascara for a False Lash Effect 1 High Density Black but it would leave smudges within hours--disappointing for $28!  I decided to try this product because of the 2000 plus reviews.  I think I might try L&#x27;oreal on one eye and this one on the other to compare and see what they look like at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed by this cruelty free mascara. I hate spending alot on makeup but this is certainly worth the $20.i would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Excellent! My sparse lashes look restored.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS MASCARA! THE NAME SAY&#x27;S IT ALL!! PLUS, ELIZABETH MOTT HAS IT AT A GREAT PRICE, COMPARED TO THAT OF THE BIG LOCAL BEAUTY STORES.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but seems to take a lot of going over and over.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this mascara has such great reviews. I am really dissapointed in it!  I cannot believe I paid 20 bucks for this tube. My 6 dollar tube is so much better....</li>
            <li> This mascara is absolutely fabulous, and i&#x27;ve tried some well known and seemingly pricey brands that were supposed to be all that and more.  So Big pleasantly exceeds it&#x27;s value in pricing and expectations!  It makes my lashes very long and full, and the things it doesn&#x27;t do make it that much more fabulous... such as it doesn&#x27;t clump, it doesn&#x27;t smudge even when sleeping in with it on, and best of all if i go for a swim without washing my face first it doesn&#x27;t smear or streak at all!  I now recommend this to all my friends who use mascara &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Great mascara. Lengthens without clumping, boosts appearance while still looking natural. Recommended.</li>
            <li> its make my lashes long I wish it can make it thick also</li>
            <li> I tried it twice and threw it out. I went back to my Mabelline Stiletto which is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Finally found my forever mascara thank you</li>
            <li> Saw an article that listed this mascara asthe best~I&#x27;m a mascara junkie so I had to try it. The article didn&#x27;t lie~it is truly the best mascara I have ever used! I don&#x27;t need to re-apply during the day and its easy to remove. I am a fan for life!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money in my opinion. The consistency is sticky and stringy and always leaves a long line of mascara hanging out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why this mascara has such good ratings! It&#x27;s horrible and is not making my lashes any bigger. Waste of my money. I&#x27;ll stick with my old brands. Now I question amazon&#x27;s reviews as they are quite wrong in this case.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara, it makes my lashes long and it doesn&#x27;t smudge which is perfect!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to, for day or night.  Full, long lashes without clumps and does not irritate.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Seems to be as advertised!  No clumping, applies well, makes my lashes look longer.  Unsure yet whether the price is worth the product, but all else equal I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Really like this Mascara.  Goes on smooth...no clumping together.  Nice added length to lashes</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I love &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; mascaras as smearing/smudging is a real issue for me, and this doesn&#x27;t budge. It also washes off very cleanly and I appreciate not having to waste a lot of time with eye makeup remover. It&#x27;s also wonderful in hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way the brush &amp;#34;finds&amp;#34; all of my lashes and gets them all looking long and full. I curl my lashes first but this is a great finishing touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only quibble is that the product removal (as you draw the brush out of the tube) could be a bit more complete/cleaner but I haven&#x27;t really had many issues resulting from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend! I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly... No clumping. Lashes look naturally fuller. Long lasting and what&#x27;s really important to me is that it doesn&#x27;t smudge later in the day. I like this product and would purchase again.- Gena</li>
            <li> Fabulous Product and very affordable. Love that it doesn&#x27;t clump and it actually gives me eyelashes!! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Since I have tried literally every mascara on the market....whether an expensive department store brand or cheaper drugstore brand, I can honestly say that It&#x27;s So BIG Mascara is definitely one of, if not the best I have ever used.  I am 53 yrs. old so the lashes are not as thick as they used to be and does not have the length I had in my younger years.  But, I can have great looking lashes again with this mascara!!  It looks great and applies even better!!  LOVE, love, love this mascara so much!!  Ordering 2 more tubes, and extra for myself and one for my college age daughter!!  Thanks again for a great product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ashamed to say so, but I NEVER leave feedback on items.  I order things on amazon as a Prime member at least a couple times per week. I got the typical email reminder asking for feedback on items and I have to say this particular item is so deserving of me taking the time to leave a review lol.  I got to the point where I avoided wearing mascara for a number of reasons.  I hate the way it smudges or smears or how easy it leaves a dark residue under the eye...Not this stuff...Not at all...yet it stays on...I still haven&#x27;t figured out why this is the ONLY mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge or leave a mess, yet looks fantastic...I am VERY pleased and this is most definitely my new brand.  Nothing else will do. : )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing make-up since high school and have always had problems with my mascara giving me raccoon eyes by the end of the day until I tried this brand. It does not run!! Love this product (I&#x27;m also a huge fan of their mascara tool: lashcard--it really does help to elongate my lashes with no clumps). I tested the &amp;#34;runniness&amp;#34; of this product by going for a jog with the mascara on and still no streaks under my eyes! It just flaked off when I wiped the sweat off my face. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve owned. I love the way it comes off with no tugging or pulling with just water. I have very sensitive eyelashes that fall out constantly with very little pull, and switching to this mascara has definitely reduced the number of eyelashes lost during makeup removal.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Lengthens well. I do have trouble with some minor clumping when used on my left eye which must be from the way I am holding the wand. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is difficult to get off... but that does mean that it stays put all day. No smudging or flaking. I&#x27;m not sure yet whether or not I would purchase again but only because of price... it&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve everpaid for a mascara.</li>
            <li> I have bought this mascara before on a whim, and I haven&#x27;t looked back since! I would highly recommend this product! After just two coats my eyelashes are large and in charge!</li>
            <li> This mascara is a great product. I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it at first, but after playing around with it I really began to like it. The formula allows you to lengthen so easily, and multiple coats add a perfect amount of volume for natural-looking but full lashes. To top it off, it is cruelty-free!</li>
            <li> This is now my go-to mascara. It stays put even when sweating, I have slept in it and woken up without raccoon eyes. I get an occasional clump but I think this is better than most I&#x27;ve used in that regard. By adding coats, I can get the length I want. It doesn&#x27;t give me super thick lashes, but I don&#x27;t want that. I&#x27;m more interested in lengthening. I&#x27;ve been comparing with others I typically used and this is much better. It lasts a reasonable amount of time too. I&#x27;m happy with it and have just received my 3rd tube.</li>
            <li> I have to start by saying that I have very thin and sparse eyelashes, but I don&#x27;t get what all the hype is about. You would think I of all people would benefit from this product, but no. I feel as though the same results can be achieved by applying layers of regular drug store mascara at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I&#x27;ve tried MANY other mascaras and this on is the best by far. I was having problems with mascaras smudging because of eye allergies and summer time heat but this one stays put! I don&#x27;t find it hard to wash off at all like others have stated. The price is a little more then I would like to spend on mascara but you get what you pay for and I will definitely buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Great product! A+ SHIPPING</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this mascara but sadly it doesn&#x27;t live up to its name. Bad Girl Lash is better. I&#x27;m disappointed!</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MASCARA!!! I am 40 something and have tried just about every Mascara on the Planet! (Well a lot in my time) This Mascara doesn&#x27;t clump or flake off leaving dark circles under the eyes! It gives a natural, long look to your lashes! I would and have recommended this product!!! 5+ Stars from me!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This product lived up to it&#x27;s name! After using it, I immediately bought another one!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this mascara!! I got a tube as a sample in a monthly beauty subscription and hesitantly tried it. I cannot use mascara on a regular basis, as it causes my lashes to fall out. Little did I know, this is a tubing formula! It goes on smooth, makes my lashes look 3x longer and fuller, and at the end of the day, a little warm water gets it right off! No smudging, no running, and it lasts forever! I put it on for work, got done, went out, and woke up the next day with lashes that looked freshly done! Whether you have the same mascara issue as I, or you&#x27;re just looking for a great &#x27;false lash look&#x27;, this mascara WILL do the trick!</li>
            <li> I thought this mascara was going to give my lashes more volume.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara!  I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to a drug store (or even a high end) brand after using this!  I know $20 seems like a lot to some people just for a mascara, but the quality of this product is superb!  This lengths, volumizes, thickens and defines my lashes perfectly.  I am so happy that I made this purchase!</li>
            <li> I am a mascara person. I will not leave the house without it and it&#x27;s the only thing I must have on my face. I have small eyelashes and this mascara de them appear a bit longer and didn&#x27;t clump up there fore look nice and seperated.  Every woman wants to have their eyes looking sexy after all this is what is noticed by everyone!!! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice, dark lengthen mascara.  I just stopped using eyelash extensions and my eyelashes are in terrible shape, so this mascara has helped while my real eyelashes grow back.</li>
            <li> This mascara works, but it&#x27;s not anything super extraordinary. It definitely makes my lashes look normal (I have tiny eyelashes) and usually requires 2+ coats to see full, noticeable lashes. Based on the reviews, I thought I was going to be impressed with the lack of clumpy, gross-looking lashes, but I was actually fairly disappointed. This mascara doesn&#x27;t seem to have any particular clumping advantage over Covergirl or Revlon mascaras I&#x27;ve tried, and doesn&#x27;t do a better job of creating more definition between each eyelash, especially some of the slightly longer ones. While I&#x27;m happy with it as a product, it really wasn&#x27;t worth the money I spent VS a normal Covergirl mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a BIG fan of this mascara! First tried it through my ipsy glambag subscription and had to buy more. One coat makes my lashes look long, well-defined, and not too dark for casual daily wear. Multiple coats makes them thicker, bolder, and more dramatic for night / special occasions.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used by far!  No smudge, no flaking, makes lashes soooo long and really opens up your eyes!!  I would highly recomend it.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it was available in the stores.</li>
            <li> After years of avoiding mascara because it seeped into fine lines, I decided to give it another try. This product makes my light lashes PIGGITY-POP without &amp;#34;leaking&amp;#34; color. My eyes tear often due to dry eyes, but it only comes off when I wash my face or use my Clinique eye makeup remover. Super fun to have wow lashes again! Glad I took the leap.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  Doesn&#x27;t clump and extends my lashes.</li>
            <li> Let me say, this is the first formula I have tried that is not waterproof yet won&#x27;t leave me looking like a raccoon. Zero streaks. I almost gave up with Tarte, which everyone was pushing me to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the brush is clumpy as is the formula when putting on my eyelashes. I just comb out the clumps, but this makes my eyelashes look like a stick insect legs if I am not careful to comb my lashes after applying.</li>
            <li> Great lengthening without clumps and super easy to remove - no smearing or smudging either. I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras and this is by far the best yet.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable mascara! I have short, sparse lashes and this mascara works! I have tried practically every mascara on the market regardless of price hoping for the results I get from this mascara. No irritation (I wear contacts) no clumping, flaking or difficult removal, just awesome long lashes, a winner! Please don&#x27;t change the formula, all I ask, please! :)</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in my Ipsy bag and love it! Just one coat makes my lashes look longer and fuller, and multiple coats never look clumpy. I won&#x27;t even try any new mascaras I receive in my sample bags. I definitely recommend this item to others!</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I&#x27;ve ever used that actually noticeably lengthens and curls my lashes. It also doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t flake off (ever), and comes off like magic with a single swipe of eye makeup remover. It&#x27;s amazing. And me, I have short stubby lashes, dead straight, naturally angled slightly downward. With one coat of this mascara, I look like I spent forever meticulously curling my lashes, carefully applying various mascaras to increase length and hold curl, curling my lashes further, then combing my lashes out, when really I swiped it on in under 30 seconds. I actually threw out my eyelash curler after I tried this stuff (no joke). And it is definitely the ONLY mascara I will ever be using in the future. It is my holy grail mascara. I have no idea if it&#x27;ll work the same on everyone, but you definitely need to try it at least once.</li>
            <li> Finally I have found the perfect mascara! This mascara has not only has a great glossy black finish, but it does not smudge even during a long workout at  gym. The design of the wand it great too making for easy, clump free application. I found that two applications gave me great volume and length that lasted all day.</li>
            <li> I used to use Chanel but refuse to spend so much on makeup these days. I went through several other brands and hated each one. This is a great mascara. I usually wash my face every night but every once in a while I&#x27;ll forget and this brand does not make my eyes hurt in the morning. It comes off in a weird chunk like layer but you will not look like a raccoon. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Simply the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used, hands-down, and that it&#x27;s cruelty-free makes it perfect.  I have tried almost every brand of &amp;#34;highly recommended&amp;#34; mascaras in the marketplace, the &amp;#34;top-rated&amp;#34; brands in beauty magazines, online, etc. and they all had issues - clumping, raccoon-eyes, difficult to remove, flaking, length but no volume, spider-eyes, on and on.  I eventually stopped buying mascara after becoming an ethical vegan and trying cruelty-free brands - the last one I bought was Aveda, and I might as well have worn nothing.  A week or so ago, I began searching online for a cruelty-free mascara and thought of Amazon.  I know from experience that products highly reviewed by others often aren&#x27;t satisfying for me at all, but thought I&#x27;d give this brand a try after googling Elizabeth Mott.  I am SO HAPPY I bought this mascara!!  My eyes look brilliant again, dark lashes but not goth-black, easy application, wears well throughout the heat and humidity, easy to remove, no flaking, no itching, no fragrance.  I am a blonde, in my late 50&#x27;s, and with this mascara and a slick of Aveda lipstick, I look decades younger and effectively boost sales of a cruelty-free cosmetic.  EXCELLENT!</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my eyelashes a mile long - but more important, it doesn&#x27;t flake off or smudge or spend the day wandering from my eyelashes to my under-eye area.  It washes off easy, too. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this, great price!</li>
            <li> Editing my initial review, as Elizabeth Mott has provided me a new bottle that worked perfectly! The first one was weirdly wet and clumpy, which was clearly just a random bad bottle. I was quickly sent a replacement bottle and it&#x27;s WONDERFUL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t clump and both darkens and elongates my lashes beyond belief. It&#x27;s easy to take off with just water and a quick swipe with cloth (in case you forget your makeup remover). The style of the brush takes a biiit of getting used to, but it&#x27;s a quick adjustment! I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m hooked and will likely never switch to something else. It&#x27;d be pretty cool if this were also available in a waterproof version one day, but it&#x27;s not going to deter me in the mean time. :P</li>
            <li> One of the beat if not THE best I have used in 20 years! Leaves my lashes long AND thick.(61 years old with thin lashes) will be purchasing again and I am fussy.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used in my life.  I have oily skin (yes --even on my eye lids!) and this stuff does not smudge, smear or relocate to any other place other than where you place it.  I didn&#x27;t bother with the &amp;#34;free trial&amp;#34; size, but trusted the majority of the reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did!  It also keeps my lashes curled all day!  It really is the best mascara and I will not buy any other brand or waste time doing any more internet research.  It is well worth $20 a tube!</li>
            <li> I have average lashes and was looking for something cheaper than false lashes and the likes.  This product is great!  It goes on easily... the shape of the wand makes it easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t get everywhere.  I usually put on 2-3 coats and I really like the result.  It doesn&#x27;t look like I have false lashes, just enhances what I already have.  It comes off fairly easily with my facial cleanser and water. Good price for the value in my opinion.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is horrible.  I can&#x27;t believe all of the good reviews.  It&#x27;s waxy and gross.  If you dare to try to put on more than one coat, your lashes look like gross little insect legs.  Yuck.</li>
            <li> I have used many different types of mascara and have to say that this is one works great! At first brush, it definitely extends the length of your lashes significantly.  Finally a mascara that does what it states it&#x27;s going to do. Thank you very much, will definitely order again and also give as gifts.</li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much every mascara, from drugstore brands to high-end, and this is the best I have ever used. The brush really helps to reduce clumps and in addition to lots of volume, I also get great length. Would definitely recommend this and purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed. Better product can be bought for less at the pharmacy. I&#x27;m going back to my old brand.</li>
            <li> Based on the great reviews on makeupally.com &amp; Amazon I decided to try this.  It is the BEST mascara I have found.  Does not smear or end up under my eyes.  Does not flake.  The brush is nice and makes my lashes longer and fuller than any other mascara I&#x27;ve tried.  Washes off with warm water and Neutrogena Foaming face cleanser.  Too bad Sephora doesnt sell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara beats Lancome, Urban Decay Big Fatty, Dior, Blinc, Bare Minerals Buxom, Loreal, Maybelline, etc.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the mascara would buy it again</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. Been using Benefit Bad Gal forever and bought this on a whim. So glad I did. My thinning middle-aged lashes haven&#x27;t looked so full and long in years!</li>
            <li> My wife is very pleased with the product. It really lengthens and thickens her eyelashes. And as she says it is a super mascara. And you do not need to use special lotion to remove it in the evening, just warm water is enough.</li>
            <li> This mascara is seriously AMAZING ! I LOVE IT ! hands down BEST mascara I&#x27;ve EVER used ! It makes your lashes SO long and curly ! I recommend curling them first for the best effect but they come out awesome ! A little bit difficult to get off, I haven&#x27;t figured out the trick yet, but all and all its a WONDERFUL product and probably the only mascara I will be purchasing in the future :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best. Here is why...it doesn&#x27;t give me the &amp;#34;black eye&amp;#34; effect. It washes of in these clumps, it WORKS my lashes are long and volumized. I love this! General on the lashes and just beautiful. No clumps. Love it!!! Better than any department store mascara I have used. And I wear contacts. This stuff rocks!</li>
            <li> I just love this mascara...it leaves my lashes full and sexy.  But my favorite part is that I  never get the black residue under my eyes like I do with other mascaras. And it comes off so easy in the shower.  I got a sample size from a friend of mine last month, tried it, and now I&#x27;m hooked.  Will never go back to the others.</li>
            <li> I have been on a mascara odyssey for a long time!  This mascara goes on well and STAYS ON WELL.  My eyes are sort of moist so I have to use a formula that is really smudge proof and long lasting.  I am buying my second one.  I would highly recommend.  I have spend much more money and not had as good of results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update----I am still loving this mascara.  It makes my eyelashes very long and thick.  I hope it stays around for a long time.  One good coat will stay on pretty good until the next day.  This is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> Terrific product! extend eyelash very well. What I like most is The result looks very natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service superior.</li>
            <li> Flaky. Had to apply three coats but it did nothing almost as if i wasnt wearing any mascara.</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting a lot with all the amazing reviews. I think in my opinion its a pretty average mascara.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best mascara that I have ever used!!!  I would recommend it 10X times over any other out there!  It doesn&#x27;t smudge and it stays on all day until I wash it off!  I just love it, love it, love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Love love love this mascara... Recieved my first Its So BIG Mascara as a sample... Fell in love with how long, full and awesome my lashes looked i hadto order a regular size mascara tube! By far my favorite mascara... Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> fantastic mascara!  does not smear and love the way my lashes look!  quick delivery too.  Will be reordering!!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice mascara, especially the brush. It has a lot of great ingredients, and doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes!</li>
            <li> Although the mascara is marketed as “volumizing”, I found that it lengthens better than it thickens.&lt;br /&gt;The thickening can be achieved by applying at least 2 coats of the mascara. I find Loreal&#x27;s Voluminous mascara to actually perform better in the thickening department, but it did manage to stay on a long time. In fact, it&#x27;s one of the best smudge-proof mascaras I have ever used. I&#x27;ve applied it prior to my daily 3 mile runs or workouts – it stays put.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is its ease of removal with either a facial towlette or cleanser. No eye-make up remover needed!&lt;br /&gt;Based on the lengthening ability, long wear of the formula, and ease of removal I find it a keeper.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! Just had to order one for my daughter because she was using mine. No clumping, no running or smearing!</li>
            <li> I love this product. No black eyes or smudging!</li>
            <li> I like this mascara and had one small reservation and when word got to the owner she was SO professional and went over and above the call of duty! I was COMPLETELY impressed with her way of handling business! I would recommend buying from a business like this that shows ethics.. not all businesses have that!  Her aim is customer satisfaction and I see high standards! Yay!</li>
            <li> Love it, worked great!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this one.</li>
            <li> It is a great mascare.. no clumping but you do have to swipe it on well so the lashes are coated evenly... it did take a couple of coats to get the length I wanted.  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Simply the BEST mascara I have ever used. I have short blonde eyelashes that are invisible without mascara. Mott&#x27;s mascara makes them thick and luscious ... and it STAYS ON! After years of searching I&#x27;ve finally found the perfect mascara.</li>
            <li> This really is a great product. I have VERY long eyelashes, so it can be a struggle finding mascara that will actually run the length of my lashes without clumping or gluing the lashes together. This product looks great on and the shape of the applicator is PERFECT for my lashes.</li>
            <li> Works well, smooth, Does not come off.</li>
            <li> Finally mascara doesn&#x27;t leave raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li> I have very sparse short eyelashes.  With 2 coats, you can definitely see a difference.  Much longer and thicker.  I look like a movie star now!</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara! very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It lasts all day and does not flake off. My new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> Makes my eye lashes look amazing.  doesn&#x27;t run and will wash off easily with makeup remover and water.</li>
            <li> I have a huge issue with mascara smudging. I&#x27;ve tried so many brands I&#x27;ve lost count. Waterproof stuff can flake, it can be impossible to take off. I got this as a sample and used it when I ran out of my regular. I figured it would be disappointing. I am blown away. This stuff gives you length, volume, makes your lashes seem soft and it doesn&#x27;t smidge. AT ALL. I ran with this stuff on and it did not budge. It comes off easily. I am sold. It&#x27;s spectacular!</li>
            <li> One of the best mascaras I have used. I love it because it doesn&#x27;t wear off, smudge or make those black marks under your eyes and yet when I take it off with makeup remover it comes off so easy. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Big is always better..in eye lashes.</li>
            <li> The best mascara ever! Once you try it you will never go back! It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t smear under my eyes and I&#x27;ve tried them all, even the most expensive brands. Just buy it! You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Not the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used but far superior to store bought.</li>
            <li> This mascara is AMAZING. I highly recommend it! If you have thicker lashes, just don&#x27;t apply as much or if you want really long, dramatic lashes, this is perfect with a few extra strokes of mascara! Love this stuff, I won&#x27;t buy anything else from now on. I am a model and tell anyone who asks to go BIG or go home.</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie...rarely do I buy the same makeup twice because I am always looking to try something new, but I have gone through two tubes of this mascara so far, I have continued to try others just to compare and I have yet to find one that even comes close. I am not easy on my makeup, I work in a warehouse on the night shift and walk up to 8 miles a day. Needless to say I am often tired and sweating, neither which makes it easy to keep mascara on. For a long time I gave up wearing any until one day I came across this product. I tried the sample first because I was apprehensive about spending $20 on a mascara without knowing how well it would work. After one use I was hooked! This is an amazing product, it doesn&#x27;t claim to be waterproof, but it does not smudge or budge however, it comes off very easily when I was my face a night. AMAZING product, you must try this...you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara!!!!!</li>
            <li> Goes on neat and looks awesome!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It&#x27;s really dark, goes on nicely, doesn&#x27;t flake or melt, and it comes off easily.Makes your eyelashes look long and thick!</li>
            <li> Makes my eyelashes clump. As others have said it does not build to a thick lush look. It did not flake, but still not for me. I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every affordable mascara and paying just a little bit more for this one is definitely worth it! Makes my eyelashes so long and full that they look fake! Going on my third bottle! LOVE!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara EVER!!  I have the wimpiest lashes and I have tried every brand - Lancome, Chanel, Jane Iredale, M.A.C., just to name a few.  Nothing has ever come close to the volume and length I can get with this mascara.  It&#x27;s truly a miracle.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I was using They&#x27;re Real, which wore a little heavy on my thin eyelashes. But So Big wears so lightly, it feels great.  And it comes off easily with one Almay makeup remove pad. All that is great, but then add on top of it that it doesn&#x27;t flake, it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, it doesn&#x27;t clump, it goes on smoothly and I have finally --- FINALLY --- been able to absolutely just forget about being concerned whether I had darkened raccoon eyes as the day goes on. Even if I sweat or it&#x27;s humid out, it stays put. I will never ever ever even try another mascara as long as I can get my hands on So Big. I am so happy to have found it!</li>
            <li> So, I wanted to wait a couple of weeks of using this product to find something wrong with it and give it a thorough review, but there is nothing about this product I don&#x27;t like. I read the reviews before I bought it which gave me extremely high expectations but it certainly did not disappoint. First and foremost - CRUELTY FREE - what a beautiful thing, thank you for this!!!   As other reviewers have said, I do believe it does more for length than volume (I&#x27;m a fan of length personally &amp; this is why I bought it) although it does reach onto even the tiniest little in between lashes so it does make you look like you have more eyelashes than usual. I made the mistake of wearing false eyelashes for over a year, so I did some damage to my eyelashes and unfortunately many of them left me due to the abuse. I don&#x27;t blame them! Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s It&#x27;s So BIG makes my eyelashes look naturally long and curly, without it actually looking like mascara. It just looks natural. The brush is just perfect and the formula goes on so silky smooth and really does last all day (&amp; into the next morning - NO RACCOON EYES!) comes off very easily when washing your face or in the shower but be warned: Don&#x27;t try to wipe it off with makeup wipes because you&#x27;ll inevitably take some eyelashes with it.   I&#x27;m somewhat of a mascara snob. I want my cake, and I want to eat it too because what fun is cake if you can&#x27;t eat it? So if you&#x27;re like me and need length, volume, curl and still look like you aren&#x27;t wearing makeup this is the product for you. I won&#x27;t be buying another mascara again. Thank you Elizabeth Mott! Now I think I&#x27;ll try the You&#x27;re so FINE eyeliner because I am thus far very pleased with your products!</li>
            <li> Best mascara EVER!!  I have been asked what mascara do I use and people think that I have eyelash extensions!!  Very happy with this product</li>
            <li> I could be described as a mascara whore. I love trying lots and lots of different brands of mascaras. My favorite was benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real mascara-- but this is so much better! It never smudges, I can even sleep in it and have perfect lashes. It&#x27;s easy to remove when I need to and so easy to apply. This is my new favorite and I love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. I bought this one and another brand that is more bold and I use them both. This one goes on easy and has a nice brush that separates lashes. I use this one on days where I don&#x27;t feel the need to go so dramatic on my lashes but yet it stands out enough to where it could be on the dramatic side with an extra coat. It lengthens lashes a bit and washes off easy, which I like. When I first saw it, I emailed the company to get a sample and she sent me a free trial size to see if I liked it and then I ordered it. I don&#x27;t know of any other companies that do that! I would purchase this one again and it is a reasonable price too. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it! It really lengthens my lashes. I bought based on the other reviews, def worth the buy. Really love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried every mascara on drug store shelves.  I don&#x27;t try the department store ones because I don&#x27;t want to waist all that money.  I took a risk on this one because of the reviews and I am very disappointed.  would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I got a sample size in my Ipsy Glam Bag, and had to order the full size. It makes my eye lashes look longer and curled (even when I don&#x27;t use an eye lash curler) I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> Just started using this product - easy to apply, no big clumps like other volumizing mascaras that I&#x27;ve tried. I love that it&#x27;s cruelty free and the brush is great!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I have tried many different brands...from drugstore to luxury brands, and Elizabeth&#x27;s Mott&#x27;s volumizing mascara has quickly become one of my new favorites (if not my favorite!). I also appreciate that it&#x27;s a cruelty free product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this mascara. I will preface this with saying I have been blessed with thick relatively long eyelashes, but they have a tendency to go wherever they want...and compared to all of my friends and their semi permanent $200 plus eyelashes...they don&#x27;t compete...until now. This mascara is the most fabulous mascara I have ever used. I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how long and thick it makes my eyelashes. The first time my friends saw me with  this on they thought I had caved and gone to a lash  bar. Fabulous product! They&#x27;re so big!!!</li>
            <li> When I first got it (was used 2 days) I gave it high scores for not smudging. Since I&#x27;ve been using a month I think it sucks and not worth the money. It doesn&#x27;t smudge but it flakes, and I have black flecks all over. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you want not only a great product but also a great after sales service this company rocks! I love the product and I love how they treat you if you need help! Amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thinner mascara, so it coats the eyelashes nicely without clumping at all and gives them a really nice length. I wear two coats of it almost every day and have had it for 5 months now, and it has yet to run out or get old or anything. The mascara stays put all day for me, and I have oiler eyelids that cause a lot of mascaras to run or wear off and smudge, this one has yet to do so. This worlds better than some of the designer exspensive ones I&#x27;ve had in the past. And it&#x27;s a really dark black, which is what I need since my hair is black but my eyes are light and my skin gets really light during the winter, it adds the definition and contrast I need! So this is by far one of my favorites out there I&#x27;ve bought as far as mascara goes in a longggg time!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality waterproof mascara that is build-able.  It doesn&#x27;t clump or cause lashes to stick together. I have fine lashes and this mascara thickens and lengthens them. Easy to apply and it doesn&#x27;t take but a couple of coats to see a real difference.  Makes the lashes look natural, instead of looking like caked on mascara.  I tried fake lashes that were applied at a salon....hated &#x27;em.  Felt like heavy hoods on my eyelids.  This mascara is an excellent alternative to salon lashes.  This mascara will give fuller thicker lashes with a formula that doesn&#x27;t flake and will stay on, until taken off;  Feels light and non irritating.  Easily removed with oil or makeup remover. Waterproof formula is great for hot weather, and those who like to apply a little makeup when going to the gym. You won&#x27;t sweat this off.    UPDATE;  I received some mascara by &amp;#34;Make Up Forever&amp;#34;, as a gift. I love that mascara! It really gives NATURAL looking volume to skimpy lashes. It&#x27;s the best I used.</li>
            <li> I am not able to evaluate this because there must be some ingredient that I am allergic to. I used it for 2 days and my eyes started watering and turned red. It has been over a week and is just beginning to clear up. I think it may only be my problem but I am writing this just in case you recieve other reports and need to investagate further.</li>
            <li> Very nice mascara, not a ton of volume, but it doesn&#x27;t clump and adds decent length.  It also comes off pretty easily, but doesn&#x27;t run while it is on, which is nice.  All in all I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I love this.  So worth the money.  I like my eyelashes thicker, so I add powder to my lashes first.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t run or flake!  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I will reorder this product.  I was using MAC mascara, and I like this one better.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I just received a personalized email from elizabeth mott, which was pretty cool. This is really good mascara which doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge at all. I wear contact lenses and that&#x27;s important. I took a shower with it on and even then, didn&#x27;t come off and I still looked like I had lashes. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Love this products. Last all day without flaking or smudging, even on humid days. Can add multiple coats. Washes off easily with just water. Originally received a sample size of this product in an ipsy bag. I&#x27;m generally skeptical of mascaras. Had previously used a tube technology mascara (blinc), because those types don&#x27;t flake/smudge, but disliked that you can&#x27;t add multiple coats. This mascara seems a &amp;#34;best of both worlds&amp;#34;, and I&#x27;m very happy.  Great mascara! The photo is of my lashes after 12.5 hours of wear. I&#x27;m a teacher so any product has to be able stand up to a pretty rigorous reality. This stuff does great!</li>
            <li> Nice coverage, no raccoon eyes in 80 degree heat.  Stays put till I take it off.  Very satisfied, will purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> No raccoon eyes! This stuff is great and though isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; works amazingly!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> BEST MASCARA EVER! Met and exceeded my expectations. No smug, no flaking - ALL DAY and comes off easily with just your facial cleanser and water. It really does make your lashes look thicker too! What more could you ask for. So glad I found a product that actually does what it says it does. Kudos Elizabeth Mott!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty goopy, and the wand shape doesn&#x27;t help, but its very waterproof</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eye shadow. It&#x27;s truly amazing!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara! It does it all - lengthens, thickens and separates. Now that I found It&#x27;s So BIG Mascara I&#x27;ll never go back to any other brand. My daughter just started wearing mascara. She had been using drug store brand - once she tried It&#x27;s So BIG she begged me to buy her one of her own.</li>
            <li> The product was not anywhere near my expectations. Really overpriced, not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every brand of mascara in the marketplace such as Dior, Lancome, Lauder and the list goes on. I read reviews on this mascara so I thought I would give it a shot. One never knows. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to apply and how my lashes had much more volume than some of the other brands that I use. I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> So, I will say: this isn&#x27;t the best mascara on the market. However, it still works very well. I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s worth the $20, though. It does great at separating lashes and giving fullness, but it isn&#x27;t so great at lengthening.</li>
            <li> It has a nice brush and it goes on smoothly but it doesn&#x27;t do much for volume, thus the 3 star review.</li>
            <li> I do really like the way the mascara wand applies the product.  Only negative is that it seems to flake off my lashes as the night progresses.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. It adds length and volume without clumping. Comed off easily yet stays all day!</li>
            <li> High quality mascara that doesn&#x27;t smear or shed.  No funky smell either.  Really like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s So BIG mascara does what it says. It lengthens and thickens my lashes and even more importantly it stays on throughout the day. Unlike most mascaras, this one does not leave dark smudges under my eye at the end of the day. The mascara comes of super easily too. I received a sample in my Ipsy bag and I have since purchased two full size mascaras through Amazon. Definitely worth every penny! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Fantastic mascara! Only wish it came in brown (winkwink)</li>
            <li> Finally! After 10 million tubes purchased and too many decades to count, no more raccoon eyes!  My long, personal mascara nightmare is now over☺</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Separates the lashes well and stays in place (even when you cry or have watery eyes).</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing!  I had given up wearing mascara for years because within an hour I had terrible raccoon eyes.  I&#x27;ve tried drug store brands to $85 bottles of mascara, waterproof etc., and nothing had worked.  I have been using this for about a month and can&#x27;t believe that I can actually wear mascara again. I was able to receive a sample first just because I was very hesitant.  I would definitely say give this a try - I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I originally got a sample of this mascara from Ipsy. It&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s perfect 2 coats for casual look but easily builable for a dramatic look. Does not flake or smudge yet it easily removed with makeup remover. I&#x27;m never even considering buying a different brand, love it!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  It really makes my lashed pop and lengthens them.  But one thing i really love is how easy it is to remove.  It comes off with ease and you&#x27;re not scrubbing your lashes off.  Will be purchasing again!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Love it</li>
            <li> It is so difficult to find a good mascara, add to that finding one that is cruelty free and it seems an impossible task!  This mascara has it all, it does not flake or clump, goes on really smooth and really does make your lashes look extremely long. I have tried numerous different types/brands of mascara and this one is by far the best.  Just make sure you let it dry before adding multiple coats, otherwise you may get some lashes sticking together.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for cruelty free mascara. I must say I was surprised at how well is works! My eyelashes look great and it removes easily with soap and water, yet stays on and stays on looking good until it&#x27;s time to take it off!!!</li>
            <li> I read all the great reviews but didnt allow myself to get my hopes up. Every mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried has been at best OK..usually its all off and on my face by lunch, or a clumpy mess to put on.This was neither! Went on smoothly with no clumping and after a nine hour shift it looks as good now as when I left the house. I have found my fantasy mascara!</li>
            <li> Third time purchasing this product.  Never disappoints.</li>
            <li> I have bever had much luck with mascara. It has either been too clumpy or too thin or it has worn off by early morning. I was extremely excited to see how well this mascara held up. It stays put all day, I can add extra coats for more of an evening look without any clumping and the brush is great. I found my new mascara and I love it!</li>
            <li> Superb!  I have always had trouble with mascara coming off on my upper lids...even waterproof.  This goes on and stays on.  I would recommend this my friends.</li>
            <li> It goes on very nicely. My only complain is that it doesn&#x27;t have enough volume for my lashes.</li>
            <li> This is THE best mascara!!  I still can&#x27;t believe how full and long my lashes are.  I am 47 years old and have tried many different brands.  If you are on the fence about choosing a mascara; It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara by Elizabeth Mott is the one to get.  You will not be disappointed.....</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good mascara and I love this one! It&#x27;s not super heavy so&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my lashes. I love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the good reviews. I don&#x27;t get it! This is the worst mascara I have ever used.  What a waste of money.  Tarte is close to perfection in mascara, and defiantly volume.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this mascara to be much better. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, nor would I recommend it. I like my L&#x27;Oreal mascara much more, and it&#x27;s half the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a-lot of mascaras and this one is up there with the best.  A good value for the quality.</li>
            <li> I love that i put it on, it stays and comes off very easy with out having to rub my eyes. and cruelty free :)</li>
            <li> Product exceeded my expectations. Goes on w/o clumps, and doesn&#x27;t end up under my eyes even after 10 hour work day! Glad I discovered this brand. Will be trying more products from this boutique line.</li>
            <li> This mascara does increase volume of eyelashes.  It also tends to clump a bit, which is resolved by re-brushing.  It is easy to remove with oil-free makeup remover. The seller delivered the product quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best mascara that I have tried..looks great and lasts all day with no smears or smudge. Thank you! Love it!</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve tried so far! Will reorder!</li>
            <li> Like the product goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t smudge but does flake by the end of the day onto skin around my eyes. I would recommend and buy again!</li>
            <li> love this mascara! NO FLAKING at all!</li>
            <li> Great mascara!  It&#x27;s not to thick, perfect texture!</li>
            <li> Love it. Works so well.</li>
            <li> Finally - A mascara that goes on, stays on, doesn&#x27;t smudge and comes off easily with a warm washcloth. Thank You, Elizabeth Mott -&lt;br /&gt;You are a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. Better then high end leading brands. The best mascara in forever!!!</li>
            <li> I like the mascara as ordinary one, can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better than standard loreal or similar brand.</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara but definitely not worth the $20. It separates and volumizes lashes but I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference compared to the mascara I usually use (Rimmel London Scandal Eyes Lycra Flex Mascara). I&#x27;ll continue to use it until it runs out but I won&#x27;t be repurchasing</li>
            <li> 5 Stars.. Love this mascara.  Does not smear, nice brush, BIG Volumizing, beeswax gives it a nice texture. i&#x27;ve tried alot of mascara and I will be purchasing this again.  Thanks Elizabeth Mott.</li>
            <li> Ok, love this seller - takes full responsibility for any issue, unlike most companies theses days. I received a bad bottle and didn&#x27;t know it...just thought the mascara was crap! I wrote about and seller read the review and informed me that i must have a bad bottle. They sent me another for free!!! My opinion is totally different: the mascara makes my, not existent, lashes beautiful. Long sexy and smooth (not clumpy). I love this product and the seller -wish all could be like this!!!</li>
            <li> I love the mascara. Very nice and does not smear!</li>
            <li> Works really nicely, not quite as juicy as I expected....maybe slightly old? Or just a formula I wasn&#x27;t used to. Otherwise I use it and it&#x27;s adequate.</li>
            <li> Effective and no clumps.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good mascara. I like it, and will use the tube I have. However, having used Urban Decay&#x27;s &amp;#34;Perversion&amp;#34; mascara, I will go back to that after this. I believe I bought this for $20... and the Urban Decay mascara is $22 - WELL worth the price. It works miracles. I&#x27;d probably return this if it wasn&#x27;t such a hassle - not that it isn&#x27;t a good mascara, because it is. It&#x27;s just that the brush on the Perversion mascara has longer, fluffy bristles that just make my lashes sing. The bristles on this one are short, which makes getting into the tiny corners a breeze, but to me it felt harder to get my lashes to really grow.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a very timely manner. Very nice mascara, goes on evenly and does not clump.</li>
            <li> Thought this mascara would be wonderful from all the reviews I read. However it flakes off within a couple hours and I have to reapply it. Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best mascaras I have used. I apply it once and it goes on thickly without having to have to put on coat after coat to thicken my lashes. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best mascaras out there. It&#x27;s up there with dior show, they&#x27;re real, and my holy grails eyko and RiRi! This mascara not only elongates but it also separates too. You can put on multiple coats and it doesn&#x27;t get spider like. I would take off half a star because once in a great while I do get fallout, if I try and add more once it&#x27;s dry. Overall if your looking for a great mascara this might be the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros, you can get a free sample, lengths, and separates, clump free, amazing product, can be found on sale often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons,  only sold online that I know of, price is a little high .</li>
            <li> I was expecting to be blown away. I found this mascara to be very average, very chunky in the application.</li>
            <li> OH WOW! Way better than Bad Gal by Benefit or They&#x27;re Real by Benefit, which have been my favorite brand since forever. But I now vow to switch to this mascara.</li>
            <li> I ordered the sample off of their website as suggested by others and came back to by the full version.  It is truly fantastic!  Lasts quite a long time, great applicator, and DOESN&#x27;T FLAKE.  I&#x27;ve tried a few samples in monthly subscription boxes and have since chucked them because they flaked within hours...  I will gladly spend a little more for a product that works well.  And this is it!</li>
            <li> The best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. Well worth the price. Doesn&#x27;t leave a dark circle under my eyes.   LOVE IT.........</li>
            <li> I was specifically looking for a cruelty-free, NON waterproof mascara.  I really like this stuff - it stays put all day long, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and doesn&#x27;t make my lashes stiff and brittle.  It&#x27;s a little less dramatic, and harder to layer than my previous mascara, which was a drug store brand, but that&#x27;s a small price (that I&#x27;m more than willing to) pay for a cruelty free product.  My face wash doesn&#x27;t remove it well, but it&#x27;s an organic, soap-free brand. My make up remover, and other, more traditional soaps/face washes remove it very well.  I&#x27;ll be buying it again!</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve never been the most skilled at applying mascara, this one creates the illusion that I know what I&#x27;m doing. The brush does a nice job of separating the lashes while coating them thoroughly -- no lumps, no smears. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  It adds a LOT of volume and length.  My only complaint is that it does clump a little; however, I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Best Mascara I have ever used and I have been using mascara for 35 years!</li>
            <li> Great if you have naturally curled lashes. I have very straight lashes. Sadly after curling them the mascara would weigh them down and straighten them back out again.</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara I have used that actually did what it said! It curled my lashes. Also when I go to take it off, it doesn&#x27;t leave black under my eye because it comes off in little clumps.</li>
            <li> Got this only because it had such a good rating &amp; Boy! was I pleased.  Very black with little fibers.  Definitely brings out your lashes!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I ever used! My eyelashes are very short, but this mascara expands them. My eyelashes have never looked so good. This is the second time I purchased this product and will go back. I know it is a little expensive, but why buy the cheap when you can have the best! Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> Not that great for the price. Too wet and brush is too thin to volumize-- better for lengthening lashes</li>
            <li> Great mascara -- I can&#x27;t say it curls my lashes, but lash curlers don&#x27;t either. This mascara does a good job of volumizing and lengthening, and goes on smoothly. The brush shape is great! Recommended.</li>
            <li> Did not add any volume at all to my lashes and made my lashes stick together.  If I could return the tube (used twice) up for a refund, I would.</li>
            <li> This mascara is a game changer.  Why? Because it makes your eyelashes look naturally darker instead of looking like you put on dark mascara. Not only that, it truly does come off incredibly easily with plain soap and water. I&#x27;m the type of person that only wore mascara on weekends until now! I can&#x27;t believe this isn&#x27;t #1 on every mascara list.</li>
            <li> This unique hour glass brush distributes the mascara evenly, without clumps and adds volume and length.This mascara does not irritate my sensitive eyes. I am impressed with this product. I normally only use Clinique or Lancôme mascara, not anymore. I am switching to It&#x27;s So BIG from now on.</li>
            <li> too clumpy, thru it out</li>
            <li> Great product coworkers thought I had false lashes :)</li>
            <li> I received a sample in etsy box two years ago and been using ever since. This mascara does it all and doedoes not flake goes on perfect with the great shaped brush and best of all is waterproof BUT comes off easiy with soap and water!</li>
            <li> i was very pleasantly surprised with this product. Eyelashes look long and not too thick (which was a problem with even expensive brands). Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This mascara was true to the reviews and it is now my new daily mascara. It  goes on perfectly. So BIG thickens and  darkens my  thin-ish med length brown lashes. It does not rub-off, cry off or sweat off. It removes easily with my eye make up remover and a cotton ball. I have always looked for a long lasting, gentle and  easy to take off waterproof mascara and  have never found it. After trying this product, I have found the perfect mascara.</li>
            <li> Worst mascara I have ever used! Feels dry when applying, clumps when applying and after 1 hour starts to flake. Save your money &amp; try something else.</li>
            <li> Not any different than store bought mascara. Disappointed! Lashes were flat within 6 hours of wear. I&#x27;ll stick to my grocery store mascara, cheaper and just the same.</li>
            <li> I am more than happy to leave a review about this mascara.  I have to say... my eyelashes aren&#x27;t thick or long and I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras out there.  Some worked for a little bit... but then the mascara got chunky looking and I didn&#x27;t like how it would apply after a couple of weeks.  This mascara goes on so smoothly.  It REALLY makes my lashes stand out.  They look the longest they ever have and I&#x27;m very happy with my experience.  I plan on ordering more when I run out.  :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but not the best mascara I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I confess, I was addicted to Lancome mascara, but was disheartened when they discontinued their Flextencils mascara... I mean, I was jonesing hard for the stuff but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere! I broke down and bought this &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So BIG&amp;#34; Mascara after going through half a dozen mascaras from Target, and googling &amp;#34;best mascara.&amp;#34; What a Goddess-send! I love it! My 54-year old eyes never had better looking, flirtier eyelashes without using those falsies from the 80&#x27;s! Love this stuff, and so much cheaper than Lancome. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Sixty two years old with thinning eyelashes. This product is the bomb. Quick easy application thick long eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This mascara is perfect! It goes on nicely, the color is a perfect jet black and it definitely gives volume. I wish the brush was better. I feel i need to go over my lashes multiple time to get the coverage that i  need. The product itself stays on all day, does not smear or bleed like other products and when i wash my face, it comes off in clumps, instead of giving me panda eyes. I&#x27;m also very sensitive to eye make up and get allergic reactions to most products. I had no issues with this what so ever. High Recommended!</li>
            <li> I had gotten a sample of this in a monthly subscription. I loved the sample so much, I bought the full size here. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t seem to perform the same. The full size is clumpy and flakes off my lashes. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I might like this mascara more than &amp;#34;Better Than Sex&amp;#34;. Works great for curl and length and thickness but has a better brush. Both could use a narrower end for the smaller lashes underneath and the inside of the eye.</li>
            <li> I thought the product was going to add volume &amp; lengthen my lashes, much like I get when I use Revlon&#x27;s Grow Luscious mascaras -- I mean, it is called It&#x27;s So Big Volumizing Mascara. However, this product was more like Blinc Mascaras that use &amp;#34;tube-technology&amp;#34; to form tiny water-resistant tubes around lashes for amplification &amp; hold, rather than painting them. Once applied, Blinc claims that the tubes don&#x27;t run, smudge, clump, or flake. BUT they also don&#x27;t add volume &amp; I got the same lackluster performance with this It&#x27;s So Big Volumizing Mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is probably great for people that already have thick, long lashes, &amp; need a mascara that will last all day. However, if you&#x27;re expecting something that will transform unnoticeable lashes to noticeable, you&#x27;re better off using the aforementioned Revlon Grow Luscious brand -- I know I still am, until I find something even better.</li>
            <li> I will be returning this mascara, since it didn&#x27;t give my lashes more volume.  The drugstore mascara that I have been using is much more effective.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this mascara! I love that it&#x27;s not tested on animals and it washes of easily, but does not smudge at all. In fact, if you go to bed without washing it off, you will look as though you just put it on in the morning. No raccoon eyes here!</li>
            <li> Holy Grail of Mascaras.  Seriously.  I have long lashes already, but this mascara increases the length of my lashes amazingly.  It separates the lashes so they don&#x27;t look clumped together and you get a beautiful feather effect.  I have long bottom lashes and have ALWAYS, and I mean ALWAYS, had a problem with using mascara on them as it just seemed to smudge and flake off.  NO MORE.  I&#x27;m totally serious - NO MORE SMUDGES, NO MORE FLAKES.  This mascara is easy to remove as well.  It&#x27;s just perfect, totally perfect.  Buy it, I would be totally surprised if you are disappointed by this mascara.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected. I did not see any dramatic results though. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great mascara no clumping feels smooth and natural</li>
            <li> Great mascara! Easy to layer for gorgeous lashes. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This mascara never smudges, flakes, or leaves raccoon eyes. I work 13hr days then head straight to the gym and my eyes look the same as they did that morning. The tube lasts a long time too. Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve written a review before, but I definitely wanted to share my experience with this mascara.  Prior to using Elizabeth Mott, my favorite brand was Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real.  This mascara was great, but would still smudge some, especially if I used something like foundation or moisturizer on my skin.  The Elizabeth Mott mascara NEVER smudges.  I can even put mascara on my lower lashes now.  There&#x27;s not any flaking, and it&#x27;s waterproof as far as can tell.  I haven&#x27;t gone swimming with this mascara on, but when I wash my face, the mascara stays put until I use cleanser and rub my eyes.  During the first couple times using this mascara, I thought the formula was very thin and I had to apply several coats to get the volume I wanted.  Now, I apply about 2 coats, but there&#x27;s never any clumping.  The mascara goes on very smooth.  I can&#x27;t suggest any improvements after using this mascara for a couple months.  It&#x27;s even a cruelty-free product.</li>
            <li> Look no more! I was hesitant to spend $20 on a mascara but this one is worth every penny! Finally, I have found a mascara that does not flake, can withstand tears, sweat, a nap, exercise class and humidity. Best of all it is easily removed with soap and water!  When I say tears I mean movie and wedding tears, not a torrential downpour :-)&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky about mascara, but will never switch brands again. I do not know what they put in this stuff but it is FAR superior to any other luxury or drugstore brand I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use mascara much but I love my Bobby Brown Waterproof that my daughter took from me.  I have tried the cheap ones from drug stores so I know the difference when I have one.  I was curious about this since the reviews are so positive.  Nothing is different between this and the others I got from drug stores except the high price.  I&#x27;ll stick with Bobby Brown.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and easy to remove.  Plus it really lengthens and plumps up my lashes.</li>
            <li> I have never spent this much money on mascara and I am so disappointed . This is the worst in my opinion it clumps up like no other I have ever used . Save your money go to CVS and buy a 6 dollar one you will like it better</li>
            <li> I always have a hard time finding mascara. The cheap ones don&#x27;t show much difference and the bottle doesn&#x27;t last too long. The expensive ones, although I like them- to be honest I just feel guilty spending $25+ on a small bottle of makeup. After searching for a long while I ran across this one and must say I&#x27;ve been pretty pleased with it. 4.5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves this product</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever. Makes my lashes look incredible and washes off so much easier than other products I have used in the past. I even said when I bought it that this would be the last mascara I try. If it didn&#x27;t work, I would just use whatever. i figured every mascara would just leave my lashes clumped together and looking less than full. But not this one. Seriously the best mascara I have ever used. No clumping and I hear nothing but compliments and &amp;#34;are those fake lashes?&amp;#34; Great product!</li>
            <li> Works really well -- lengthens and volumizes lashes with just a few coats, and washes off very easily.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive feedbacks from this product, I honestly thought that it would have been amazing. To my surprise, its so not worth it.. I give the product two stars, because shipping was really fast and it helps my other mascaras last longer... It doesn&#x27;t not lengthen your eyelashes in no way what so ever. It spaces out your eyelashes leaving your eyelashes looking thin and scanty... I&#x27;ve had way better mascaras than this... Everyone opinion differs.. But Im honestly very disappointed.... Not impressed</li>
            <li> After 3 uses, it got clumpy and looked terrible.  I threw it away.  I wont be it again &amp; it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  I love how it lasts all day and then when you wash it off its gone without leaving racoon eyes!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I used to actually use two different kinds to get the look I wanted, but with this I don&#x27;t need to.  This makes your lashes long and thick, and does NOT smudge or flake!  One coat for day to day, or layer it on for an awesome evening falsies look. Top all of that off with it not being tested on animals, and it comes off easy with makeup remover. I can&#x27;t say enough about this mascara, so just try it already.</li>
            <li> This mascara builds up my blonde lashes so well without clumping. I usually use two coats and my lashes look great! The last few name brands I bought at the drug store went in the trash after a couple uses because of clumping....this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I like to curl my eyelashes, so finding just the right mascara can be tricky; some are too watery and straighten the lashes, while others are too thick and end up looking clumpy.  It&#x27;s So BIG is great!  It wears well all day, and comes off easily with a mild face soap.  So happy that I found this mascara!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin, blond lashes and this product gives me the length and thickness that I&#x27;ve been searching for.</li>
            <li> This is awesome! It is a great black color, easy to layer without caking or getting gross. I think I am a convert to this product!</li>
            <li> my first purchase was fantastic, it must have been a new mascara tube.  My recent two purchases, one tube was dry &amp; the other almost dry...i take it that they were old products.  very disappointing and waisted money.</li>
            <li> This mascara really is the best. It doesn&#x27;t clump, it separates out my lashes, each coat builds upon the last, making my lashes appear longer. And it never smudges!  Also, it seems &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; when it arrives (NOT clumpy or dry in the tube, like it&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf for months). Since it&#x27;s waterproof mascara, you&#x27;re going to want to have a good quality waterproof eye makeup remover to take it off at night.  I use mostly MAC make-up overall, but since I started using SO BIG Volumizing Mascara by Elizabeth Mott, I haven&#x27;t used anything else.</li>
            <li> I usually wear They re Real mascara but i read other reviews on this one so i thought i would try it.I was pleased with look but what I really like is how easily it comes off.:)</li>
            <li> Very pleased with quality of product and applicator.  Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, really thickens and lengthens lashes.  Does not flake off easily, which is important since I wear contacts, but also not like a waterproof mascara where you have to scrub and scrub to get it off. wonderful!</li>
            <li> I requested a sample and I appreciate the company sending me one. I really wanted to like this mascara because of all the great reviews, but alas this did nothing for my straight asian lashes. If your lashes are naturally curled, you would probably like it (as the many other 5-star reviewers do). After curling my lashes as I normally did, I applied one coat of this mascara and I watched my lashes become straight again -_(\ I was so disappointed! Anyway, I think it helped thicken my eyelashes, but that wasn&#x27;t noticeable since it did nothing to &amp;#34;open up my eyes&amp;#34;. I would say request a sample before you purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazing mascara! I have long lashes but with fewer of them over the years. I was very skeptical as I have tried so many different mascaras in a variety of price ranges that just didn&#x27;t deliver. This mascara can be put on to be natural looking or nice and bold; easily layered to suit your needs. It didn&#x27;t irritate my contacts and when I forgot to take it off my eyes weren&#x27;t all goopy (happened with an all natural mascara!). The brush shape is unique at least to any others I&#x27;ve used. The brush shape makes it simple to curl your lashes a bit, to apply subtly to areas, does NOT smudge or flake yet it is easy to remove, I also haven&#x27;t had issues with clumping. This mascara is with every penny and is the last kind I well likely ever try.</li>
            <li> I have used every kind of mascara and this is up there as one of my favs. It is very volumizing and buildable without clumpiness. It stays all day and doesn&#x27;t smear on my face even in the heat.</li>
            <li> Great mascara, up there with the best. I like that it comes off in flakes while washing instead of smudging off.</li>
            <li> This stuff is EXACTLY what I&#x27;ve been looking for!  I actually look like I have eyelashes now.  Goes on smooth, no clumping or bleeding and my lashes just get longer and longer with each pass.  HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> I wanted a mascara that did the job in making my lashes look long but did not irritate my eyes.  I found it!  This mascara goes on easy without clumping.  It is also easy to remove.  It has never irritated my eyes which is saying a lot as I have very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this mascara.  I don&#x27;t have an issue with the length of my lashes, which is why I&#x27;ve been searching for a &#x27;volumizing mascara&#x27; that would give my eyelashes the appearance of being fuller and thicker.  This mascara does not deliver.  The picture on the side of the box shows a women&#x27;s lashes with 2 coats versus 10 coats - I&#x27;m sorry, but I am not putting 10 coats of mascara on my eyelashes to get the fullness I&#x27;m looking for.  If you have short lashes and are looking for something to lengthen them, absolutely go for this mascara.  If you&#x27;re looking for volume, I suggest L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous or Benefit BADgal Lash Mascara.  And if anyone has suggestions for a volumizing mascara better than the two I already listed I would welcome them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Updated 4/7/2014** I upped this from 2 to 3 stars because of the product creator&#x27;s customer service.  Keeping such a close eye on reviews on a site such as Amazon and seeking to satisfy every customer, whether the product worked for them or not, is admirable.  That being said, this product did not do for me what I hoped it would.  There are plenty of satisfied customers on here that have stated otherwise, and if you&#x27;re looking for a new volumizing mascara and are comfortable with the price tag I say go for it.  Unfortunately based on the results I received from use it is not a product I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> I received the So BIG mascara and found it did not work for me. HOWEVER the Elizabeth Mott company contacted me, sent me another So BIG mascara plus two other products to try. The second mascara worked great and I love the eye shadow and liner that was sent. I can not say enough good things about the customer service. THANKS Elizabeth Mott.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried the free sample before buying this.  As other reviewers mentioned, I&#x27;m surprised at all of the 5 star reviews.  This mascara did not add volume at all, even after applying 3 coats.  I have long lashes that are light and not particularly thick, so I really need a mascara that creates volume.  This did not work for me.  Almay One Coat Triple Effect is less expensive and works way better for me.</li>
            <li> I work long, long days (and nights sometimes) and most mascaras tend to smudge under my eyes and leave me with dark circles.  Not this one!  Glad I took a risk on an unknown brand.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  My favorite for sure.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Must buy more!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  It separates my lashes well, while lengthening and adding voluming: great product. I also love that it&#x27;s not tested on animals!</li>
            <li> The mascara is great. It makes my tiny eyelashes be more noticeable with minimal effort. I am only giving a 4 star rating because the liquid forms clumps and it gets very sticky at the end of the brush. Aside from that, I will still buy and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried!  I was using Lancome and found it was smudging on my lids towards the end of a long workday.  (I&#x27;m not one of those &amp;#34;touch up your make-up in the middle of the day&amp;#34; kind of people - simply don&#x27;t have time.)  This is a great product and I&#x27;m finding that it doesn&#x27;t get too thick and dry towards the end of the supply like some mascaras do.  The eyelash curler works great as well!</li>
            <li> I was not blessed with long eye lashes.  I love this product. I only have to use one coat and there is no need to apply a second.  There is a huge difference immediately.  I will continue using this product</li>
            <li> Great product.  My eyes are sensitive and I wear contacts, so I am careful with the products I buy.  Doesn&#x27;t smear, very little clumping.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this mascara. I am on in and out of my call room where I sleep when I work night shift at the hospital but I still like to wear a bit of make up to look presentable, and this mascara stays on and does not smudge despite multiple times a night in and out of sleep and bed.  Thank you Elizabeth Mott!</li>
            <li> I give 3 stars because it is a good mascara. However, in order to get volume you have apply many layers, which ends up getting very messy and clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like is that it is smudge proof and I don&#x27;t get dark circles under my eyes and it certainly makes my lashes look longer!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t run and washes off easier than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. Makes my lashes look soooo long and full. Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried!!</li>
            <li> The results from using this mascara are decent; however, I don&#x27;t like the application brush. It is awkward and difficult to use for application. Additionally, the mascara can get flaky.</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara - sometimes I have problems with it clumping - it might just be me having to get used to it - but it&#x27;s nothing a lash comb can&#x27;t take care of.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I really love this mascara, and this is coming from a person who usually couldn&#x27;t care less about makeup. It stays on, I don&#x27;t get bits on my face or embarrassing raccoon circles, and it really makes my eyelashes look longer and fuller than other mascaras do. Usually it&#x27;s just one or the other. An all-around win.</li>
            <li> I got this mascara once in an ipsy bag and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since! It separates my lashes and lengthens them like no other mascara has been able to before. Even with just one coat I can tell a major difference. Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> This not only isn&#x27;t worth the outrageous price of $20 but it is not even worth the $5 for an average mascara.  It&#x27;s dry and has a wonky wand and not even useable.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good mascara! The clumping is minimal, and it does a good job of volumizing. For a non-waterproof mascara, it has good staying power but washes of easily.</li>
            <li> Not only do I not see any visible advantage to using this mascara, it flakes off into my eyes all day long. Then my eyes hurt. This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap. Spend that money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have always used drugstore mascaras and was a little hesitant to spend more than eight bucks to try something new out but I am so glad I did! This mascara is lightweight and leaves lashes looking amazing! Comes off very easily without causing eyelashes to fall out like some other mascaras can cause. Will be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> It is SOOO BIG and also does not smudge or get messy as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I was surprised, this mascara was pretty good, made my eye lashes look longer and didn&#x27;t clump as much as some others.  Really decent mascara.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have used.  No clumps.</li>
            <li> wonderful! especially for a natural mascara</li>
            <li> No more raccoon eyes. A plus.  Needs a mild eye makeup remover to clean off  It can be a little stringy, but nothing that would keep me from buying it again.  All in all, a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I have NO idea what the hype is about this mascara. Does it lengthen your lashes, yes. But it is the dramatic awesome length that you get from department store brands such as Dior, Guerlain, Lancome? NO. I&#x27;d rather stick to Cover Girl $5 mascara than pay $20 for something I can&#x27;t tell the difference between. You know when you buy department store mascara for $30, you are getting luxe, amazing quality item that warrants the high price tag. This is just over-priced drug store mascara. And it&#x27;s CLUMPY.</li>
            <li> This Mascara is great.  It does a great job plumping and lenghtening lashes compared to cheaper brands.  I also like that when you wash it off, it doesnt make big black smudges under your eyes, rather it just kind of chips away. it&#x27;s definitly worth the moeny.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara. I will say that I thought it would be a bit more volumizing than it is. It really takes me a couple coats to really get it to look how I want and I was really looking for something that&#x27;d get it done in a few swipes. I&#x27;ll keep looking I guess, but first I&#x27;ll use up this one.</li>
            <li> This company is awesome.  Due no fault of theirs I never received the product and Amazon refunded my order.  The Mott company reached out to me about the refund and sent me a full size mascara free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I am so glad I did.  This mascara is wonderful.  It makes my teeny tiny lashes appear much fuller and longer.  It did last all day without smearing or smudging, especially since I am a contact lens wearer and my eyes tear a bit.  This will now be my go to mascara forever.  I did not give it a 5 because i would like it to be waterproof to handle Florida&#x27;s humidity.  I would also love it if Mott would create another formula with fibers for super long party eyes.</li>
            <li> Perfect mascara!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I came online looking for my usual Benefits Big Lash, didn&#x27;t see it, but Amazon recc&#x27;d this. I&#x27;m happy I tried it. Does separate and define. I feel like they look bigger and better than ever. That&#x27;s what sold me. Not at all clumpy or thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will def buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used. I have oily skin and most mascaras end up smearing. This one is wonderful. It also comes off easily when you want to remove it.</li>
            <li> Best natural-looking mascara ever, and I feel like I have tried every mascara out there. Plus, you can layer it for a more glam look.  It does not move once it dries, never smears, stays put all day long, but then when you wash it off, it ALL comes off and does not leave any raccoon-eye residue. I got this as a sample in a subscription box about a year ago and have been a die-hard ever since.  BEST!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!! It makes my lashes look longer and no clumping!&lt;br /&gt;I use Physicians Formula organic mascara first for fullness and then immediately add the Its So BIG on the tips for length.&lt;br /&gt;you don&#x27;t need to do that every time but I have found that works best for my thin short lashes.</li>
            <li> Love it, not clumpy and natural looking!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> The mascara is great. Stays on all day, I even went swimming with it and it didn&#x27;t smear. I love when it&#x27;s time to wash off your eyes mascara dose not smear, it just comes off like little clumps. I&#x27;m just not big fan of the brush that it comes with. But learned to use it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I love it no smudging or smearing............works great!</li>
            <li> This product made my long sexy eyelashes G.O.N.E ! when I woke up and found I didn&#x27;t have lashes&lt;br /&gt;I thought I am seriously ill after searching and asking friends .. yes believe it or not this mascara is one of these mascara that&lt;br /&gt;makes you lose your eyelashes ..</li>
            <li> I love this product--I rarely write reviews--especially beauty products, but this mascara never clumps and looks natural. If you want to look like a Kardashian this might not be your mascara-, but if you want thick, natural looking lashes, this is for you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Chanel, YSL, Lancome (their told world seller), Urban Decay, Clinique, NARS....everything!  THIS stuff is sooo much better than any of them.  I never have to worry about clumping.  It glides on perfectly while still giving me volume.  Really dark black color so my lashes really pop.  I get compliments all the time.  A must have in my makeup collection.</li>
            <li> Awesome. I have short eyelashes and this mascara is perfect. It made them look long and full. Definitely going to stick with this one.</li>
            <li> Awesome ship time, excellent price, fresh product</li>
            <li> I recently moved to Arizona, and first want to say this mascara does not melt in the heat or get in my eyes when I sweat, which is a big plus! It washes off easily with a facial cleanser (I use Cetaphil or Cerave) and comes off in little clumps. My one criticism would be the brush. The brush is not terribly fluffy and has a bit of an indent in the middle that makes it hard for me to evenly coat all my lashes. Overall, it is a good buy, and I would compare it favorably with big department store mascaras.</li>
            <li> I love it! This is the only mascara I will use from now on</li>
            <li> Really nice mascara, makes an impact without looking fake or caked on</li>
            <li> Most mascaras either left me with smudges or flakes on my face. I received this mascara in a gift box, so I gave it a try. FANTASTIC!!! Not only does it not smudge or flake, it looks great all day and into the night! Won&#x27;t need any other mascara, I have found my favorite!</li>
            <li> I have tried many mascaras over the years and many of them do what they claim to do but this one didn&#x27;t for me.  I use cheaper mascaras and get much better volumizing from them.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. Better than Dior.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to remove product from lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for about two months now, and I really want to like it, but unfortunately I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it will give you dramatic lashes. Yes, it stays on ridiculously well (too well in my opinion.) It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes, which is great.  The problem is when I try to wash it off.. I don&#x27;t want to have to use a special makeup remover to take off my mascara, and I don&#x27;t want to use something with harsh chemicals. I find I have to tug a bit and wipe pretty hard to get the stuff off. It&#x27;s also very drying, making my lashes break off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My natural lashes are noticeably shorter and thinner since using this mascara.. I haven&#x27;t had this problem with any other mascara. I can see why people like this mascara, but I personally don&#x27;t want my natural lashes to be damaged.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh!  The reviews were correct.  This mascara is wonderful, awesome, the best ever!  I used Lancome Virtuose Black Carat mascara for years.  It wasn&#x27;t perfect, but it was the best I could find.  They stopped making it a year ago and since then, I&#x27;ve accumulated a drawer full of mascaras that did not deliver as promised.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to those fibers that flake off and fall in my eye and blur my vision. I have eyes that water - a lot, so I need mascara that doesn&#x27;t smear or drip when wet.  I ride a motorcycle and often my eyes tear something awful from the wind.  Sunglasses can only protect so far.  I can&#x27;t stand mascaras that clump and leave piles of mascara blobs on my lashes and then everything is a thick, sticky mess.  I have been beside myself trying to find the perfect mascara.  This is it!!!  I just received it one hour ago.  I hadn&#x27;t put on makeup yet today so I went right in the bathroom and applied my shadow and liner and then - this mascara  NO CLUMPING!  It goes on so easily.  Just a smooth and easy application and it lifts and separates every single eyelash individually.  No one would know that my lashes are short and point down because this mascara pulls the lashes up into a sweeping butterfly look without any clumps of mascara at all.  It is flawless looking.  It&#x27;s the most perfect mascara I have ever tried.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!  I will be buying this from now on.  Don&#x27;t every stop making it and don&#x27;t change it one bit.</li>
            <li> Works good. Does not clump. Lengthens eyelashes pretty good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome product</li>
            <li> I like the waterproofness of this mascara. I ski patrol and spend long days outside so it&#x27;s hard to find one that doesn&#x27;t cause black smudges....but this one works! The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that the mascara clumps on the wand so I have to wipe excess off with a tissue before I use it otherwise it&#x27;ll clump on my lashes. The free sample wand worked better, so perhaps I got a bad one? I just feel I&#x27;m wasting expensive product each time.</li>
            <li> Love the brush. No clumps and no smudge. How refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is good mascara, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about is the mascara has a large clump on the end of the brush when you pull it out of the tube. It does seem to last most of the day without clumping on your lashes or flaking.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency to apply, not too dry to too wet. Didn&#x27;t undo my curled lashes. Does not come off easily with soap and water. Made my lashes feel very dry and they stuck together so tightly that when I tried to comb through with a metal comb it pulled out a couple lashes. For that reason I&#x27;ll be giving it away. Hopefully it will work better for my friend.  I&#x27;m disappointed because it&#x27;s so hard to find a high-quality, cruelty-free mascara.</li>
            <li> I did not like this mascara at all - I threw it away after 3 uses. The product is sticky/goopy and the brush did not separate the lashes as all, even after wiping off the excess.  I have never paid this much for a mascara before. I&#x27;m not averse to spending money on a good product, but this one really disappoints. I&#x27;ve gone back to my trusty Loreal, which makes my lashes look great for less than half the price of this stuff...</li>
            <li> Terrific product! Lengthens, doesn&#x27;t not smudge and washes off easily. Could not ask for anything more from a mascara</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the good reviews on this product.  I didn&#x27;t like it at all!  When it was brand new, it hardly did anything for my lashes.  Now, after having it about 2 weeks, it&#x27;s almost all dried out.  Complete waste of money.  I went back to my Dior Show and realized how superior that brand is compared to this Elizabeth Mott stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what the big deal is with this mascara. I&#x27;ve used Dior Show for 10+ years and this does not compare. I would say this is a bit better than Great Lash, but really does nothing to thicken or lengthen my lashes. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awesome mascara. Doesn&#x27;t clump. Easy to use. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> It worked as well as any of the good mascaras do.  I just think my eyelashes are too scrawny and hard to keep curled even though I use an eyelash primer before the mascara.  But this is definitely a good one!</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with this product. The color is nice dark black and it stay put and can easily applied layer on top of a layer and so on.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I&#x27;ve tried many in all price ranges and this by far is one of my favorites.  Goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t bleed or flake.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I have tried many different mascaras - Covergirl, Lancome, Sephora, Urban Decay, Clinique, you name it. I have very straight and short lashes so a good mascara is a must. I use this with Blinc&#x27;s lash primer and it looks like I have lush and long lashes. Application is great, not much clumping, and clean up is a cinch. Warm water and face wash or a makeup remover works well. I have also worn this mascara without the primer and it still gives considerable volume and length.  I only wish they also came out with a waterproof formula.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST mascara!!! Amazing volume, length and it stays on.  No smudging, no bleeding, no raccoon eyes EVER!  Thank you for this Elizabeth Mott!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I am very picky about my mascara.  It&#x27;s the one makeup product I use religiously.  This mascara makes my lashes incredibly long without clumping.  It wears so well.  I&#x27;ve tried drugstore brands to high end department store brands.  This mascara wins hands down!!!</li>
            <li> Volumizes without clumping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a good product but it made my eyelashes very dry and brittle. Plus the product description is correct it doesn&#x27;t smuge however with in a couple of hours it did start to flake. I returned the product.</li>
            <li> Have been &amp;#34;testing&amp;#34; different mascaras and this one gets 5 stars from me. It goes on easily and looks great, and even better, it comes off easily (without leaving eye lashes on the cleaning cloth! I am still waiting to see how long the tube lasts. The reason I decided to try this mascara was because of the other 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> I feel very deceived by all the positive reviews here. I have naturally long, curly lashes so it doesn&#x27;t take much to give them a boost. I have tried drugstore brands as well as higher end mascaras all with fairly good results and this is by far the worst mascara I have used since I can remember. The wand is extremely small and it goes on VERY light and thin. After several applications I saw virtually no difference and no lengthening or volumizing at all. The company was kind enough to replace my first order within a few days after I emailed them about my problems, however there was no change in the second mascara I was sent. Save your time and money and try something else.</li>
            <li> Really great length without clumping and gives some body without bulkiness</li>
            <li> Love the product and was shipped very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Nice product and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I found this mascara!  It doesnt make my eyes water, it comes off pretty easily and I am not rubbing it off from under my eyes all day like other brands I have tried.  Plus it is reasonably priced.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mascara 2 weeks and it is AMAZING. No running, no flaking, no smudging even with my oily skin. I also have semi-sensitive eyes and it does not bother them at all. The best part though - my eyelashes look fantastic!! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This mascara didn&#x27;t hit the mark for me. It was more waterproof then the average brand, but it did not add volume or length like I thought it should. Especially for the price😔</li>
            <li> One of the best mascara&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.  No clumping.  I use a makeup remover to remove, but I&#x27;ve also used just soap and water, have not had any trouble.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! I am  glad I decided to go for it and purchase this mascara! Quick Delivery and I love this mascara.  I really like &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; by Benefit, but it is SOOO expensive.  This mascara is very comparable and 1/2 the price.  It also comes off much easier! I am hooked!!!</li>
            <li> I have never left a negative review before. I hate to do it and I am still I search of the perfect mascara. I use latisse and have long, thick lashes. This mascara was very sticky, stringy, and almost impossible to apply neatly. I started out wiping the brush as clean as I could without good results. I even went as far as to swap out the supplied brush for an old fav of mine. Still a complete mess. I would have returned this product but I threw away the original brush. :(</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara!!!! Makes my lashes look fantastic!  Received a sample in my ipsy bag and had to order the full size.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this mascara and applied it right away. While I like the brush and it&#x27;s easy to apply, this mascara will not work for me.My lashes are very thin and I need a few layers of volumizing mascara to make my eyes pop. I was looking for equivalent quality of the Lancome mascaras, I purchased this one because of the reviews.  I am a big fan of Lancome, have been using it for YEARS and was looking for something cheaper... I would say this mascara is more lengthening than volumizing. I will return it and purchase Lancome again.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and expected great mascara.  Instead I think it is awful.  It makes your lashes long but not full at all. Long skinny lashes are not the look I am going for.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever owned by far!</li>
            <li> I laugh at the picture on the box,which shows massive volume depending on the number of layers you use. Great, except that doesn&#x27;t really work, because the product doesn&#x27;t layer well. Once it has dried, trying to put additional layers on is futile. Also, the brush is just weird. The round tip makes it difficult to get the inner corner lashes, and I have poked myself in the eye several times by accident. I don&#x27;t see how this design makes a difference. It&#x27;s okay but not worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mascara and was always disappointed; this mascara does what it says!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!  I Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This mascara is very lovely.  It separates the lashes perfectly.  Not clumpy. Leaving a very natural but volume  lash.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth $20 but whatever.  We&#x27;re worth it aren&#x27;t we girls!!</li>
            <li> How do people not know about this?  I was looking for a glossy mascara that did not give me the raccoon look.  You know what I&#x27;m talking about.  You&#x27;re ready to walk out the door.  The last step in your makeup routine is the mascara.  You&#x27;re out for awhile and later when you check yourself in the mirror, it&#x27;s not the broccoli in your teeth that&#x27;s catching your eye, it&#x27;s that damn mascara all smudged under there . . it&#x27;s under both eyes.  This stuff does not do that!  I had ordered one and went back and ordered two more in addition to the gel eyeliner.  I&#x27;ll let you know about that one later once I try it.  Very happy and it&#x27;s a good price point!</li>
            <li> I am a mascara at minimum gal. If I have time for nothing else, I will at least have mascara on. It&#x27;s So Big is like a dream come true for my lashes. It gives me the right amount of body and curl but doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or get crunchy by the end of the day. The best part comes when you wash it off: it doesn&#x27;t run and smear all over the place or cake on for days, it beads off like silicone.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many different mascaras over the years in search of the &amp;#34;perfect one&amp;#34; and I can truly say my search has ended!! I have naturally long eyelashes but they are light in color and therefore don&#x27;t stand out without mascara.  Many of the mascaras I&#x27;ve tried are too clumpy or make me have caterpillar lashes, which is not the look I&#x27;m going for.  I wanted a mascara that would lengthen and accentuate my natural lashes.  I was reluctant to try this one because of the word &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; in the description.  That is normally where I run into problems because volumizing products go on thick and the mascara just kinda piles on my lashes.  Boy, am I glad I tried this one!!  For me, it is absolutely perfect!!  It goes on flawlessly and does NOT clump or flake the whole day.  The product lengthens my lashes beautifully and doesn&#x27;t feel thick or too heavy.  I see my mother regularly and on her own she even commented how nice my lashes looked!  Definitely, definitely give it a try!  I also took advantage of the free sample offered on the website.  The sample arrived quickly and gave me some assurance before making a purchase.  What more could you possibly ask for?  It&#x27;s fabulous!!</li>
            <li> LOVE!  Lengthens, separates, is easy to build on, doesn&#x27;t smear, is great at getting corner and bottom lashes, and is easy to remove. I will never use false lashes again, this works just as great and is more comfortable than falsies. I prefer this over my Dior mascara.  As for not smearing, I use Make Up Forever mist &amp; fix spray and nothing smudges or smears- I love it, no raccoon eyes! I haven&#x27;t worn it with out the fixing spray so I&#x27;m not sure how it does on its own, but my friend says it doesn&#x27;t smear for her and she doesn&#x27;t use any spray to set her makeup.   Will continue to buy and use.</li>
            <li> WOW!  This stuff is really amazing!  It thickened and lengthened my lashes like nothing else has.  It even got the tiny hairs and POW crazy lashes! LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> In 30 years of wearing makeup, I never found a mascara that glided on, was not gloppy and didn&#x27;t clump. I ordered this one despite it being a bit more expensive, but still affordable, but I was skeptical. Now I am happy to say my skepticism was unwarranted. This mascara is fantastic--it glides on, extends lashes in a natural way and does not clump. Unlike other mascaras, my eyes don&#x27;t itch at the end of the day. It washes off easily but I can leave it on overnight if I prefer. I won&#x27;t be using any other product from now on.</li>
            <li> Worst mascara ever! I used it once and threw it away it was so horrible. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara ever! I received a faulty tube and they immediately contacted me and replaced it for free. I am ordering my 5th bottle now. You will be very happy with this product and it doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
            <li> Not the best mascara I&#x27;ve used. Doesn&#x27;t give me the volume that I&#x27;d like, but it does okay.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Might need to order another tube as my 16 year old daughter keeps taking it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting when I ordered this mascara but regardless it exceeded my expectations. This is seriously the best, most foolproof mascara I have ever used. I don&#x27;t even know where to start really. For one thing, it comes right off with water, without streaking or smudging or leaving any residue. It&#x27;s like taking of clothes. That being said, it stays on my lashes all day long, never flakes, never smudges, and somehow even though it comes off with water, it doesn&#x27;t come off when I cry. HOW????? But all that is tertiary to the facts that (1) it doesn&#x27;t clump AT ALL and (2) IT STAYS SOFT. Not wet, but soft. Your lashes don&#x27;t get stiff. This means you can actually layer it and build volume without looking like your lashes are gunked up (seriously I have never been able to layer mascara before without it looking clumpy and feeling sticky). I absolutely love this stuff. It has replaced all my fancy high end mascaras.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  Best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!!!! Finally find one that stays on all day!!!! And no clumps!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I am very picky about mascaras flaking, stay on power. I have used at least 8 different fashion brands from Sephora. I have just bought my 2nd tube of this mascara.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara! It goes on nice and clean, very smooth (I loath clumpy mascara) it seperated my lashes well and it just feels lovely!</li>
            <li> Great mascara!  I received it as a promotional gift from People Magazine, and was hooked from day one.  Doesn&#x27;t smear and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using Maybelline&#x27;s Great Lash mascara for years, but lately it hasn&#x27;t been doing it&#x27;s job on my diminishing, short lashes (I&#x27;m 44 and have noticed that my lashes have been slowly getting shorter and shorter, which also happened to my mom and maternal grandmother). I decided to try It&#x27;s So Big and am thrilled that I did! It immediately builds length and volume and makes my eyelashes reappear again, as if by magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts all day and washes off so easily (I used to look like a raccoon when I washed off Great Lash, this never happens with It&#x27;s So Big).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an official convert!</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my lashes very full - I was hoping for slightly longer but maybe I just need to apply more</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the better mascaras I&#x27;ve tried. It is a nice thick look, and resists clumping. I like the hourglass wand as well. It is a little difficult to wash off - it comes off in bits rather than wiping off cleanly, but doesn&#x27;t irritate, and it does come off with just soap and water (I HATE makeup remover, so this is a must for me), albeit not as easily as some others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m really fussy about it, I can get some of the best lashes I&#x27;ve ever had out of this brand, but it did take some practice to get used to this particular product.</li>
            <li> This mascara is terrific!  It doesn&#x27;t smudge and it doesn&#x27;t clump.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a person who takes time to write reviews on any product but this is an outstanding product which MERITS a review.&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who has fine eye lashs, it is almost impossible to find a mascara that thickens and lengthens their eye lashs.&lt;br /&gt;THIS MASCARA does both.  It is EXCELLENT mascara and I will DEFINITELY be a return customer.</li>
            <li> Because I swim and spin and get generally messed up when I exercise after work, I had been using the same, somewhat clumpy waterproof mascara for at least a decade.  Wanting to try something volumizing, but not clumpy, I looked up reviews and decided to give this a try.  I absolutely love it!  It stays on and does not run, even after an intense spin class after a full day at work.  It is lengthening, plumping, but not clumpy.  It does help, of course, to curl your lashes first.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Best Mascara I have ever used. Stays on all day ,no smudge no flakes</li>
            <li> Its OK won&#x27;t wash off easily</li>
            <li> My favorite everyday mascara... by far! I am a professional gal on the go and this mascara is perfect for my lifestyle. Two things: 1. It layers on as much or as little as you want it to make your lashes bold and beautiful. 2. It washes off so easily and doesn&#x27;t leave your eyes in a black sticky mess. (This is my favorite part and haven&#x27;t experienced this with any other mascara.) Thanks for letting me brag on this product!</li>
            <li> love love love.. best mascara I &#x27;ve ever used... hands down</li>
            <li> Best Mascara so far. I love how it does not smear nor does it shed.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping! Good price!!</li>
            <li> This is by far, hands down, the best mascara I have ever used. It never runs, never gets melted and smeared all over, even when I&#x27;m working up a sweat. I can go dancing, or to the gym and never have to worry that my mascara is going to end up under my eyes making me look like a hot mess. Is also way better and giving length than those &amp;#34;fiber&amp;#34; mascara&#x27;s. Looks natural instead of little pieces sticking out every where.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve finally found the mascara I&#x27;ve been looking for! This mascara works exactly as promised right from the beginning (it always seems like others I try have a &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34; about halfway through). Several beautiful layers can be applied with no &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; look, and my lashes feel soft all day. It doesn&#x27;t wear or smudge, and I&#x27;ve tested it on several long and warm days so far; but it comes off easily with coconut oil and my regular facial cleanser. I&#x27;ll be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This mascara performs similar to others that I have bought. I do like the fact that it is not thick and clumpy. It actually lengthens each lash individually.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey compared to what I normally buy, but if it lasts for 3-4 months I will be happy.  It seems to really hold up and it doesn&#x27;t glop on the lashes like lots of brands do especially when they are just opened.</li>
            <li> Loved this mascara. Totally water proof and the only mascara I have used where it does not smudge off.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! I am recommending this mascara to everyone. It goes on nicely, lengthens my lashes like lash extensions and doesn&#x27;t leave me black under eyes. Product came in as stated and in time stated. Thank you!! Heidi</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews.  When I have FINALLY found the perfect mascara, it&#x27;s cause for celebration and a big thank you for creating this masterpiece.  No clumping. No spider eyelashes.  No little black flakes dotting your face.  It&#x27;s buildable.  It stays put until you take it off.  It&#x27;s easy to take off (I typically use a facial wipe). Fabulous brush----best I have ever found and I have tried many mascaras.  And best of all, for my very sensitive eyes.....no irritation.  LOVE this product.  Please try it. And when you fall in love with it,  tell all your friends so that this does not become another make up product you fall in love with that a company stops making!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I was not given this product to try for any blog or other reason.  I stumbled upon it through reading Amazon reviews.)</li>
            <li> Originally I had written a review complaining about how clumpy and unimpressed I was with the formula - but a representative reached out to me to apologize and offered to send me a new tube for free. I think my original order was a dud or maybe sitting around in inventory because I love this stuff now!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I scrape away the excess on the opening of the tube and use an eyelash comb and still only need one coat. I always get compliments on my eyelashes when I wear this, makes them look like fake in a good way. My only complaint is it does get a little flaky after strenuous activity but that is to be expected. Added a couple of photos on 7/31/15 from different days</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. It really does volumize my lashes without making them clump together. It also lasts all day without running or smearing (but comes off easily at night, without having to wash a million times to get it off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep using this product in the foreseeable future as my daily go-to mascara!</li>
            <li> It oversells what it does.  Not what I expected.  Both Cover Girl and L&#x27;Oreal have better products.</li>
            <li> This mascara really gives me extra long lashes! I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Stays on very well, while surprisingly easy to remove. It&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; as it could be, but still pretty good.</li>
            <li> I live in a hot, humid climate.  I have sensitive eyes and cannot wear waterproof mascara.  NOTHING has ever lasted more than two hours on me, and I&#x27;d given up hope that I could find a brand that would have any kind of staying power.  I stumbled on the page for this brand, and based on the reviews, decided to try it out.  I was so worried to spend this much money on a brand that I&#x27;d never tried- but this turned out to be my dream mascara!  This has lasted on me for twelve hours, without touch-ups- even with my slightly oily skin!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this mascara!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why so many have given this product a great review. Let me start by saying I&#x27;m a woman with fairly straight eye lashes and for me to get any curly length, I have to use an eye lash curler along with waterproof mascara. I saw this and read the reviews so, even though pricey and non waterproof, I went ahead and gave it a try. Honestly, this is the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried, even worse than the cheapest department store brands. There was no length, no curl and even at that, I decided to just keep piling it on to see what kind of thickness it produced, what a joke and what a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may work for some others but definitely not for me. For this price, Macy&#x27;s Landcomb is so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star from me and that&#x27;s being generous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Product!  I thought only Sephora and Nordstrom&#x27;s had the Great Products.  You will love, love, love this!  Not only that - Amazon and seller get this to you - before you can even jump in your car to run to the mall!!  I ordered it on a late Friday night (11P)  and it was here before Church - on Sunday! (by like 9A)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that - the seller - took a real interest in emailing me as to how I like the Product.  Really, who does That anymore?&lt;br /&gt;Long - thick gorgeous  Lashes to die for!  You will love your new look!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daphne</li>
            <li> Really made my lashes look fabulous!  I have tried many many mascaras and this one is totally IT!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara because it does not smudge or smear at all!  It goes on nicely.  You can add extra coats for more volume and it doesn&#x27;t clump.  It also washes off easily.  It is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used ... and I&#x27;ve tried probably hundreds from Maybelline to Estee Lauder.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are fine and grow in such a way that they tend to criss cross. When I apply most mascara, it tends to clump, even when the brand claims no clumps. This Elizabeth Mott mascara, however, goes on smooth and lasts all day, with little to no undereye smudge. It makes my fine lashes pop. Despite the long wear, it&#x27;s still easy to remove with a standard eye makeup remover. AND the ethics of product testing is really important to me. Testing on animals should never happen! I&#x27;m thrilled with my ethically conscious and high quality mascara. The only negative I could possibly find would be that the mascara tends to glob at the end of the wand. However, wiping it on the rim removes the excess. I would HIGHLY recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> I never expected to find a mascara that I can say I really love at this stage of my life....I am 55, blue-eyed, with lashes so light I can barely see them. I have found that as I age, mascara just isn&#x27;t a sure thing anymore, no matter how much I spend on it. But WOW....this stuff is exactly as the reviews are telling you.... it volumizes, it stays on my eyelashes and I love it. I can tell you I&#x27;ve spent way more money on high-end mascara that doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to So BIG. I went with a sample first and immediately ordered a full-size tube. This will be on my list for gifts to all my girls. Try it!</li>
            <li> I should have held out for a sample, but they were out of them.  This mascara requires several coats, which I don&#x27;t have the time or patience to do.  I&#x27;ve tried building up my lashes 4-5 times with this product, but it doesn&#x27;t work well for me.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this mascara before but searched on amazon for best mascara and this was at the top. Thought I would try and I absolutely LOVE this. What I love: gives LONG, thick, clump free lashes and NO FLAKING AT ALL. Also you don&#x27;t get those little black dots under your eye. I sometimes don&#x27;t even use my lash curler and lashes are long and gorgeous. It also leaves your lashes BLACK, like DARK BLACK AND glossy looking, not gray like many others. Lashes stay perfect all day! What I really love is it is SOOOOOOOO easy to remove. I don&#x27;t even have to use a special eye makeup remover. Just use a face cleanser (I like Cetaphil or Purity or sometimes use castor oil mixed with jojoba oil) BUT the mascara comes right off. I would have to say this is one of the BEST mascaras I have used. Thanks Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;2/16/15 - This is a follow up from my 1st review in Oct. I have purchased this mascara a 2nd time because it is so AMAZING. I have tried just about every brand of mascara, from Dior, Mally, Tarte, It Cosmetics, Maybelline, Cover Girl, Too Faced, Lancôme, Clinique, Make Up Forever, you name it. This one by far is the absolute BEST. I get super LONG lashes and they are dark shiny black, not matte grey and flaky. It goes on effortlessly, stays on all day long, no smudging, no smearing, no flaking, not black dots under my eyes. But comes off easily with plain old face cleanser and water (no need for special eye makeup remover). I rarely buy makeup and/or skincare twice since I am constantly buying new things and trying so much but this is one of the very few products that I have bought multiple times and will never be without.</li>
            <li> I was not very pleased with this product. The picture on the package show beautiful lashes after use, but notes that the results are after about 10 coats. Sorry, I am a 2 coat girl and think mascaras should work well within that parameter. Especially one with this kind of price tag...</li>
            <li> Where has this mascara been all my life? I love it.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, and my lashes are amazing ! Well worth the price ! </li>
            <li> I was looking for a mascara that would give me the volume but no raccoon eyes. This mascara exceeded my expectations. I would recommend it to everyone. I have bought much more expensive brands that did not fit the bill</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara to date!</li>
            <li> Takes a few coats to get volume with the length. But it works well. Has a nice dark pigment and a smooth texture. It doesn&#x27;t flake and stays on well. Just water won&#x27;t remove it though. I wish you could build on the length more than you can, but it does give nice length. Overall it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.  It doesn&#x27;t flake or smear, and comes off nicely at end of day.  A little clumpy, but not bad.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t quite understand the hype - it wasn&#x27;t until I was in a situation where I ended up pushed in a pool unexpectedly where this mascara truly shined. I raised my head to my friend and asked embarrassed &amp;#34;Is my mascara all over?&amp;#34; and he responded &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know what you are talking about.&amp;#34; I quickly swiped my fingers under my eyes, and discovered no black!!! It is NOT waterproof, and yet, it does not smear all over the place when wet! Instead, the mascara removes beautifully, like little tubes that just gently come off of each eyelash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, I realized that this is literally the best mascara ever. No raccoon eyes or flakes during the day, and at night, when I wash it off it, it comes off without fuss... just in little pieces. If my eyes water from irritation, I don&#x27;t have to worry about this smearing. Once I realized the value of this mascara, I&#x27;ve never been able to go with another mascara. On the days I misplace my tube of &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; and use something else (like &amp;#34;Loreal Voluminous&amp;#34; also highly-rated), I&#x27;m always annoyed when washing my face at the end of the day. I ended up buying another &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; for emergencies just in case!</li>
            <li> This mascara is perfect. The wand is tapered in the middle, making it easy to reach the inner, and outer corners of your lashes. The formula stays put. No running, or flaking. It thickens and lengthens, without clumping. Washes off easily, with just my facial cleanser, and water.</li>
            <li> Much expectations exceeded. Very impress lengthening.  Many happiness.  So celebrate.  Do use often.  Such compliments given. Very buy now. Wow.</li>
            <li> Above average mascara. Great for thickness, not for length. After reading reviews thought it would be better. Better than your average grocery store mascara.</li>
            <li> Awesome mascara!! It stays put ALL DAY and it doesn&#x27;t smudge AT ALL!</li>
            <li> I first discovered this mascara after receiving it in an ipsy bag. My eyes are sensitive to everything so I was reluctant to even try it but I&#x27;m so glad I did!! It lengthens AND thickens without clumping which I feel like most brands say they do but really do not. I was a Lancôme definicils users for years and just wanted to find some a tad bit less expensive and this product works even better than definicils! Awesome mascara! You won&#x27;t be disappointed if long, defined eyelashes is what you want!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even remember what brought me browsing to the listing for this mascara. I wasn&#x27;t even shopping for mascara! But somehow in my Amazon black hole of &#x27;window shopping&#x27; I ended up here. I was really intrigued by the reviews. I have been looking (off and on) for a mascara that I would like as much as my beloved Full N&#x27; Soft by Mabelline since I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  I&#x27;m one of those consumers that doesn&#x27;t care what the brand name is as long as it works well, is reliable, and serves my purpose. My everyday make-up kit has a mix of high-end and drug store items that I&#x27;m dedicated to. I was a bit unsure of buying this due to the price (I have been disappointed in several higher price tag mascara&#x27;s before) but it overall it was worth it. This mascara has become my new favorite!  To be clear, this mascara isn&#x27;t really like my old Full n&#x27; Soft. That mascara would flake off eventually, but I would forgive it since it looked beautiful/natural and didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I&#x27;m a born redhead with sensitive skin so I like to (and have to) keep to a neutral/natural palette so I don&#x27;t look ridiculous. I do notice that when removing my mascara it does not dissolve off, instead it comes off in little clumps, like it was truly coating my lashes, which explains why it doesn&#x27;t flake off while wearing it.  This mascara, the It&#x27;s So Big - is true to its name. It adds a subtle drama with fullness and length to my lashes that I haven&#x27;t had since I was a teenager. It looks professional, but not overdone. The great thing is that it lasts all day without failing on me or requiring a touch up. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! Makes my baby lashes look BIGGER</li>
            <li> Hi Ladies :-) I just bought 2 more &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; mascara&#x27;s. I first bought one to try it out. Have been using for approx. a month now. I am very pleased and like a lot of you out there have been searching for that mascara. Well, for me this one is it. Yes, FINALLY :-) FINALLY a mascara that doesn&#x27;t flake, clump, or dry out your lashes. They do give GREAT Volume and Long Natural looking Lashes. I am looking forward to using and stocking up on this Elizabeth Mott &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; Mascara :-)</li>
            <li> It came in time but the product, when dry it comes on your skin</li>
            <li> I have searched far and wide for a great mascara. I&#x27;ve tried expensive dept store brands as well as cheaper brands. So far, this is the best I have found.  It requires a couple coats but it stays on all day. No clumps, no mascara under your eyes at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be my dream mascara after all the great reviews, but it seems some of us have the wrong lashes or something. For me. I got kind of gooped together lashes and I had to reapply more often than I would expect with a volumizing waterproof mascara. It seems I run into this a lot with my lashes so I don&#x27;t think it is a bad mascara, there is just a few of us that can&#x27;t get good results with most mascaras. I have only had two work for me and I have to replace them within 2 months or they work any longer either.  I will still keep searching until I find my mas-mate.</li>
            <li> Not as it claimed. I had better</li>
            <li> This mascara is easy to apply and it looks natural. What I like most about this product is that it is easy to remove and does not leave me with racoon eyes; a bunch of black gunk under my eyes. If I have been crying, rubbing my eyes, or in a steam room, it will just flake off and not leave a horrible mess. I would definitely recommend this mascara to anyone who has had trouble removing all of the mascara at night.</li>
            <li> I liked my past mascara, but saw all the reviews on Amazon and thought I would try it. It really is awesome and my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it goes on smooth and adds great volume. Great!</li>
            <li> This is very good mascara.  Lasts until you remove it.  Does help make small eyes look bigger!</li>
            <li> This made my lashes stiff. Seriously not pretty.</li>
            <li> I was thinking this product would give me the BANG OF BLINK or BENEFIT PRODUCTS. Not! Save your money. Product made in China. Have to wonder about quality control ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed. After reading all the other reviews I expected this to be a great lengthener - it&#x27;s not. While it does build some volume, it is not any better than Revlon or Loreal. I will be returning this and go back to using Loreal Paris Double Extend Beauty Tubes for less than half the price.</li>
            <li> Love dis mascara I use it every day n get compliment</li>
            <li> The mascara is really excellent. For me one of the important factors in a mascara is that it stays put and doesn&#x27;t run. This definitely does not - the first one that I have found that really doesn&#x27;t run. The item arrived on time. This is a product that I hope to use for a long time.</li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara, it makes my eyelashes look bigger, it stays all the day, but it is also easy to remove without damaging my eyelashes! Thank you so much for the great product!!!</li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> Too wet.  Globs up.  I have to wipe almost all the mascara off of the brush first.  The brush is weirdly beveled in the middle.  Not the best but it&#x27;s cruelty free so that&#x27;s why I gave it at least 3 stars.  Im using a brush from another mascara to use it.  That seems to help a lot</li>
            <li> I have very short stubby lashes. This didn&#x27;t do much for them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how much mascara costs me, I will pay the price if does everything I want. And this is what I want from mascara: volume, length, definition, waterproof/smudge proof, no clumping or flaking. I&#x27;m always trying different brands and still searching for the perfect one. Clinique and Mac have a few that are perfect but not waterproof, or they are waterproof but nothing special. For me, this mascara didn&#x27;t clump and it washed off super easy in the shower, no soap or ripping out eyelashes. But it didn&#x27;t give me any volume or definition. I have naturally long and thick eyelashes, but I want more. I want to look like I&#x27;m wearing false lashes. On the packaging for this mascara it shows what it would look like if the chick puts on one coat then another picture if she puts on 10+ coats (who has time for that??) the picture with the 10+ coats OBVIOUSLY shows her wearing flash lashes, and maybe even some eyeliner. I refuse to believe that that look could be achieved using this product....I wish.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great. I have been looking for cruelty-free mascara and I prefer waterproof, but I read the reviews and decided to take a chance. Some cruelty-free mascaras I have tried have been flaky, clumpy, irritated my eyes, etc. But this stuff is smooth and creamy, doesn&#x27;t irritate and wears almost like waterproof! It dries quickly and I even like the brush. I have even slept in it and didn&#x27;t wake up with the dreaded &amp;#34;raccoon eyes!&amp;#34; I am very pleased! And I find the price quite reasonable. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  Eye lashes don&#x27;t clump.  Even if you don&#x27;t wipe it off and reapply sinew the next day,  it still keeps lashes separated and and long. Great buy</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in my monthly beauty subscription haul a couple of years back and absolutely FELL IN LOVE! Once since then, I purchased a different mascara on a whim, but was here on Amazon within days purchasing this instead. As long as this tried and true formula remains the same, I&#x27;ll be an Elizabeth Mott mascara user forever! Great formula, staying power, and NO flaking (which is a problem I have with most waterproof mascaras). While this one doesn&#x27;t advertise as &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;, it lasts through crying and sweating like a dream!</li>
            <li> Love how light this mascara feels on my lashes.  And it doesn&#x27;t clump or flake off.  I got many compliments about my eyes and even had a friend ask me to order her one!</li>
            <li> Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old, and have slightly thinning lashes. I never considered this issue when I was younger, so any mascara was fine. So, at first, I was looking for a mascara to give length and volume. My tip: volume is not as important. I found a few that give volume not length, and it didn&#x27;t look that great.&lt;br /&gt;This fantastic mascara gives you beautiful length, and looks like light false lashes. Excellent. Of course, I use a lash curler. Stays on so perfectly, yet, extremely important to me, it comes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Great mascara, makes my lashes look very full and long!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this through ipsy or birch box (can&#x27;t remember which.) Let me start out by saying that this is the ONLY sample that I have gone on to purchase the full-size version. This mascara is truly amazing. Most mascaras add volume OR definition. This one does both -- without clumps. I&#x27;ve tried a gazillion mascaras, everything from Dior to Eye-ko to L&#x27;Oreal and beyond. But this one really deserves its 5 stars. Curls, adds volume, adds definition, doesn&#x27;t flake....it&#x27;s really the perfect mascara!</li>
            <li> Makes your eyelashes so much longer. Love it</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new mascara that would not clump, flake, or smear and this product definitely fits the bill! I&#x27;ve only used it for a week so I can&#x27;t speak to how long it lasts, but so far I&#x27;m extremely happy with the results. Unfortunately, it is not paraben free so that is the only negative.</li>
            <li> Doesnt fall or flake off. I can sleep in it and it stays in place. The brush is a little weird shape but still workable. Overall I love it.</li>
            <li> After reading excellent reviews, I decided to try it out. Needless to say, I was more than disappointed. This mascara does not volumize AT ALL. It makes your lashes look long and sparse. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried tons of different mascaras and this is the best. i love how you can change your look with more coats. will be returning for more :)</li>
            <li> Update: to the creator of this mascara - Please consider making the same formula with a different brush!!  Preferably one with longer bristles.  Still love the formula, but the brush IS hard to use.  I have many requirements when I look for a mascara, as it is the most important cosmetic for me personally. They are: no smudging/flaking, contact friendly, dark black color, able to create moderate to high drama, and preferably comes off with soap and water. Here is my mascara background: not sure why, but most eye products smear and smudge on me. For that reason, I always wore tubing mascara. More recently, I decided I was not happy with the look of tubing mascara, since it is not very buildable, and I wanted more drama. So I went on a mascara buying spree. I won&#x27;t name all of them, but none of them were &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;. I guess amazon noticed I had been searching for lots of mascara, and It&#x27;s So Big popped up in my recommendations. I was intrigued by all the good reviews, so I ordered a sample. I was really impressed when I tried it. Yes, the formula looks a little weird when the wand comes out of the tube, like black lava or something. But it goes on easy, the brush is not too big or small, the color is dark black, it is super buildable, and the best part, IT DOES NOT SMUDGE OR FLAKE!!!! It also comes off easily for me with a few rounds of soap and water (In flakes, not black smears, yay!).  The only drawback for me at that point was it did take quite a few coats to get the drama I was looking for. Then, just for kicks, I tried it with my Shiseido primer. All I can say is WOW. It takes two coats over the primer, and my lashes are exactly everything I&#x27;ve ever searched for. To the creator of this mascara: thank you!!</li>
            <li> I tried this mascara as a sampler size that a friend gave me.  I love love love it, it makes my lashes full and long. Easy to remove and best of all it&#x27;s the only mascara that won&#x27;t give me raccoon eyes!!!</li>
            <li> Fabulous and lush mascara - it applies well and after a couple of weeks my lashes are visibly thicker and healthier.  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s So Big Mascara really is awesome, the angle and shape of the brush hugs your lashes and gives volume to them! This product really is better than i expected!  Also it seems to stay put all day with no flaking throughout the day but it also washes off very easily with soap and water!! This is my new favorite mascara hands down!</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara I have used that does NOT leave smudges under my eye.  Period.  Mostly claim to be &amp;#34;smudge proof,&amp;#34; but simply are not.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  I used this mascara today and I thought it was good.  I don&#x27;t know if I really like the brush compared to other mascara brushes I have used in the past.  I did purchase this mascara based on all of the great reviews that were written on it and I don&#x27;t think it stands up to them.  I have really short eye lashes and my other mascara I use usually lengthens them and this one didn&#x27;t seem to do that.</li>
            <li> This mascara definitely not worth the price. It clumps and is hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> I waited until I had been wearing this mascara for over a month to write the review--and it is great!  No flakes, clumps or smudging after 14 hours of wear (and I use oil-based eye cream)!  My lashes are too short to curl, but the mascara looks just as good 12-14 hours later as it did in the morning when I put it on.  I used it head-to-head with DS Iconic Overcurl--DS on one eye and It&#x27;s So BIG on the other.  Couldn&#x27;t tell which product was on which eye...not fresh in the morning or 12-14 hours later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara/brush is excellent at separating out every lash so they look full &amp; lush.  This really is a very great product.</li>
            <li> I am always in search of the perfect mascara. It&#x27;s like finding the perfect pair of jeans. Well this mascara is great. Doesn&#x27;t flake or leave raccoon eyes by the end of the day. Very easy to remove as well.</li>
            <li> Good building mascara. Comes off easy with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I registered on Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s website for a free mascara sample and forgot about it until a surprise package in the mail. I have naturally long eyelashes. Many market mascaras clump or bunch my lashes together, causing less of a volume and more of a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara is surprisingly light. The formula makes my eyelashes flutter with fullness without clumping, drying or looking fake. The formula lasts all day without wear and does not smudge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the wand of Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s It&#x27;s So BIG mascara which features an hourglass curve. I can add a touch of additional mascara to my eyelashes for a dramatic effect without worrying about smudging areas I do not want to be as covered.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. Comparable to high end mascaras that sell for the same price or higher. Better than all other drugstore mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.  Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say this did not even live up to the hype..Big Vol well the prouduct was very wet and clumped up the lashes ,,big waste of a lot of money for this very disappointed</li>
            <li> Great Mascara! no clumps.. lots of lash!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great mascara after reading the reviews. Its just OK, it does not ass volume to my eyelashes , it did the opposite. It made my eyelashes stick together and they would not separate, even after using a brush on them. Ill go back to my mac mascara, its a few dollars cheaper. I really did not like this mascara at all.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used and I have gone from Lancôme to cover girl to off brands.  It lasts, doesn&#x27;t smudge...easy to put on and looks good without having to spend 5 minutes sorting out clumps.</li>
            <li> I am a mascara junkie because I have thin sparse lashes. This mascara is the BEST I have ever tried! No clumps, makes my lashes look great. No more shopping around...this is the BEST.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product! Goes on and stays on like magic!</li>
            <li> I have searched and searched for a mascara that would not smudge within an hour or so of applying it and thought that it didn&#x27;t exist, but I was wrong.  The first time I used it I knew this was the mascara I had been looking for (it was a free sample).  It lasted the entire day and didn&#x27;t smudge or run.  It goes on quickly and makes my lashes look longer.  The process of removing the make-up it quick and easy.  I can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about this product.  I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and this works amazingly well with no irritation. Doesn&#x27;t smudge, even when left on overnight. oops! Washes off with my normal face cleanser or by the shampoo while taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are fairly straight and this lets me apply enough to make them turn up and plump up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Still haven&#x27;t found anything near the excellent maybelline lash stylist mascara, which they stopped making years ago (should be criminal - how favorite products are suddenly NLA!!!!)  This is great, in the sense it goes on without clumps.  But, I have to put on t least 3 coats to get the volume I need.  Takes me that much longer to get ready for work in the morning.</li>
            <li> The mascara is SUPER BLACK, which I love. Yet it clumps more than any mascara I have used, pretty disappointed with that.</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed it for the first few weeks.  But now, the liquid inside as well as the brush seem a little dry.  I have to go over my lashes at least 4 or 5 times.  Probably would try something else when I run out completely.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every brand of mascara my whole adult life trying to find one that doesn&#x27;t result in racoon eyes. My search is now over! This is the only one I will use again!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara originally by being a VIP with People magazine.  I love it so I ordered more.</li>
            <li> I have pretty severe allergies and chemical sensitivity, and this mascara is one of the few that don&#x27;t irritate my eyes all day! It provides excellent volume and thickness to my lashes. The wand is perfectly curved to fit the shape of your eye. I also like the fact that this is a smaller brand as I am all about supporting small businesses. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Great mascara, you won&#x27;t look like a panda if it gets wet because it comes out the whole thing as if it is a thin cover to your eyelashes. Makes my eyelashes long and doesn&#x27;t get stuck all together</li>
            <li> Really makes my eyelashes stand out and doesn&#x27;t clump or get little black specs in my eyes. I really enjoy wearing it alone without any other eye makeup because it makes that much of a difference! Goes a long way and is well worth the $20.</li>
            <li> Ok, I never write reviews, but I am soooooo in LOVE with this new mascara I bought!!! I think I am giving it as Christmas presents to everyone! I have oily skin and hate that my mascara tends to get all over my face. It doesn&#x27;t even come off at the gym but it literally washes off w soap and water... It&#x27;s crazy! LOVE! It&#x27;s worth the $20! Trust me.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used.  I don&#x27;t know what it is, but my eyelashes have grown longer since I started using this mascara.  My lashes also seem to be darker.  I live in the SW and most mascara&#x27;s dry out in a month, this mascara has outlasted any other I have used.</li>
            <li> Does not clump.  Does not smear.  Does not flake. No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> Love. Cruelty free AND the best mascara I have ever used.  buying for everyone for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!</li>
            <li> It was just ok. It seemed to clump my eyelashes together and I didn&#x27;t see as much volume as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara. I received a sample and have order this product several times. Other mascaras I&#x27;ve purchased from high- end make-up stores went on great but thought out the day I would get dark circles under my eyes (raccoon eyes) and was constantly having to wipe under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This mascara seems dryer than some, so is easier to apply. My eyelashes need all the help they can get to even be visible, and this did a nice job of making them look normal. Although it was a little pricey (thus a star demerit), I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My favorite  mascara EVER. SERIOUSLY. I&#x27;m on my second one now and I still love it.  No clumps, nice long lashes that make my skimpy ones look almost like falsies. Also no running - it&#x27;s not water proof but I&#x27;ve gotten my face wet with minimal damage. It also doesn&#x27;t run on your face (unlike other more expensive brands, *cough cough Smashbox cough cough*).  I&#x27;m not kidding. Seriously. Can I say seriously one more time? SERIOUSLY AWESOME PRODUCT A MUST BUY. And  no they&#x27;re not paying me to say this, I do in fact pay for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This mascara is OK. I read all the other reviews and decided to try it, but it is just OK.</li>
            <li> After trying DOZENS of mascaras over the years- this one is my favorite. I&#x27;m so happy I found it. I&#x27;ll never buy another brand again.</li>
            <li> I continue to try mascaras and this is the best so far - it doesn&#x27;t end up under my lower lids, on my skin.  I&#x27;m 60+ so I need to moisturize my eye area but then most mascaras smudge and end up darkening under my eye area - not this one.  I will be purchasing again!  You have made a great product!  Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s an update - I tried others since my first purchase - not as good as this one so I&#x27;ve made a second purchase and learned my lesson - I&#x27;m sticking with this one.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found (and at my age, I&#x27;ve tried alot of them!). Now I&#x27;m on my 4th purchase and still love this mascara! Stays on, doesn&#x27;t clump or flake and is easy to remove. Most importantly, to me, no smudging! I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> Fantastic mascara - lengthens lashes, doesn&#x27;t clump.  It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it, and the maker is lovely as well.  When my package got lost, she insisted on sending me another tube for free.  It doesn&#x27;t get better than that!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this mascara!  I live in a large city and haven&#x27;t been able to locate this product anywhere.  Shipping was quick and reasonable.  Best mascara out there!</li>
            <li> Terrible mascara. It immediately weighed my lashes down and made them straight. I didn&#x27;t notice any real volume or length, although I did see a bunch of fibers around my face. I have bought much better mascara from Target.</li>
            <li> The product does a good job lengthening my eyelashes. It also stays put, in the past so often I find the mascara under my eyes. This product stays put very well.</li>
            <li> This is an ok mascara. I have tried many different brands that are cheaper and just as good.</li>
            <li> First time trying it. This is the best mascara I have ever used. it goes on beautifully. no smudges or flakes. it stays on while I work out and comes off with soap and water easily. It&#x27;s rather amazing.</li>
            <li> Decent mascara, but a bit messy when putting on and setting. Definitely too expensive. Loreal Telescopic and Volumizing mascara works as well for less. Tarte and Benefit have better mascaras for the same cost. I have straight, medium length lashes. Perhaps works better for people with longer, curlier lashes?</li>
            <li> I love this mascara so much! It stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes at all.</li>
            <li> I love it! ! No clumping. Dramatic and no flaking.</li>
            <li> I had a trial of this product and was very impressed and so purchased full size product.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a &#x27;thickening&#x27; mascara but very good for lengthening and application is smooth. Doesn&#x27;t flake, doesn&#x27;t clump and oesn&#x27;t rub off. Tick, tick, tick.</li>
            <li> This is really great mascara - I heard about it from a good friend who goes for a bit more made up look than I do so I&#x27;m pretty sure it also layers and builds nicely.  I am a 1 coat of mascara girl myself and I love that this looks as good at 5pm as it does at 5 am when I first put it on.  The color is not deepest black, but that works for me because I&#x27;m a blonde.  I also like that despite its staying power, it comes off completely with just regular eye-makeup remover - no racoon eyes in the morning, when we start fresh.</li>
            <li> Well done!  This mascara is almost impossible to clump - even if reapplied at a later time over existing.  It is really flawless ... if you want more drama, go over again.  Simple daytime?  Just a coat or two will do!  I like it ... will absolutely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it at all. You need several layers to have the same effect my maybelline mascara gives,  and it&#x27;s really difficult to take off at the end of the day.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!!! It goes on easy and makes the lashes long and big yet gives you a wispy look. Very natural look without all the clumps  like the other mascaras do. This is now my go to mascara. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Pretty good mascara. While I am not impressed with the brush, I will say that the waterproof aspect of it is phenomenal. I usually sweat mascara off but this stuff is really great.</li>
            <li> So I got this because I am searching for the perfect mascara right? Well I like it, like it a lot but hearing from the other lady&#x27;s and reading there reviews I thought well... This is it. It is a very good mascara! I agree but I dot thing it is that great, especially for the price, a little pricy for me. I would hands down compare it to my favorite so far NUTROGENA HEALTHY VOLUME mascara. I hate waterproof mascara, so this one is easy to remove, BigOne is harder to remove, both don&#x27;t flake, I have very sensitive eyes. Both look very natural. I like Nutrogena&#x27;s wand a little better, it is straight and simple. And price is night and day. I will be using both :)</li>
            <li> Happily surprised. Like so many others, I&#x27;ve tried everything. This mascara is different - it&#x27;s light and easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t get clumpy. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used! Doesn&#x27;t run or smudge and lasts all day. Comes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> My daughter received the mascara in a sample pack she receives monthly and gave me the sample.  I loved the sample so much that I purchased the regular product.  It stays on great giving full lashes and washes off nicely.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair, which means my eyelashes are practically invisible. I am always looking for something bigger and better in the makeup world and this is definitely a quality product. You can add just one coat for a subtle look and up to 10 for something super dramatic. My favorite thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t clump my eyelashes together, it separates them and keeps them looking natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quick, too! Well worth the money :)</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product. I am a mascara junkie and have to try the &amp;#34;latest and greatest&amp;#34;. I never heard of it before, but I read about it in Glamour or somewhere so I thought I&#x27;d try it. I use it for work mostly when I don&#x27;t want or need outrageous lashes. It goes on smooth and does lengthen,but does not really thicken the lases much. However, I like it because it is not clumpy and does not flake. It is on the expensive side though, don&#x27;t know if it is really worth 19 bucks, you can probably get a drugstore brand just as good for about 10 bucks less.</li>
            <li> I am highly disappointed with this Mascara. Currently, I use &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; by Benefit, and I love it, but I feel that a tube of that stuff usually lasts me 2 weeks before it starts having to take alot more coats.  Anyway, I was looking for something that I felt would take forever to put on and wouldn&#x27;t start dwindling in 2 weeks. I&#x27;ve currently tried putting on the mascara and it makes my eyelashes long but thick. I sat on my eyelashes apply coat after coat for 20 minutes! 20 MINUTES!!!! and nothing.  Am I missing something? am I not doing it right?  I don&#x27;t know. I paired it with They&#x27;re Real and it looks great and better. Just sucks.</li>
            <li> I keep going back to Lancome because I simply can&#x27;t find a mascara that performs as well as theirs. I was hoping with all the great reviews that I may have broken my Lancome habit, but no.  :(  It&#x27;s no different than any other drugstore mascara that I&#x27;ve tried, and is difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge. It stays on, that&#x27;s for sure. :)&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Clumpy after 5 uses, the brush doesn&#x27;t allow the product to flow to the ends to get at the ends of your lashes, it&#x27;s gloppy and thick and hard to work with.  Hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;*************&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1 4/8/14&lt;br /&gt;The company contacted me almost immediately in response to this review, and gave a me a stunning, amazing, and generous response (which included a replacement bottle). I don&#x27;t want to post the specifics as I&#x27;m worried others might take advantage and lie and say they got a bad product just to get the same treatment. However, this is the first time I&#x27;ve had this type of response from a company - and I will update my review upon trying the replacement bottle of mascara.&lt;br /&gt;*************&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/22/14&lt;br /&gt;I received my replacement, and it appears my first bottle was a dud. The 2nd bottle performed well, but it&#x27;s still very hard to take off. I&#x27;ve use two different makeup removers - soaking the pad and letting it sit there on my eyes - and I still have to fight to get it all off. Because of the wear and tear on my lids and lashes, I probably won&#x27;t continue to use it. Everyone else says it slides right off, but I definitely do not have that experience.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different types of mascara from Sephora, Ulta, you name it, and this is the best mascara I have ever purchased! It gives my eyelashes so much volume and you can apply it in many layers without it ever getting clumpy if you love big huge lashes like I do. Would absolutely recommend! I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product. No smearing or flaking. Wand easy to use. It makes my lashes look much longer and they stay curled all day until I remove it at night.</li>
            <li> Definitely buy this--wand is great--defines lashes makes them look SO BIG! Haha. Wonderful product, have been using for a few months now, will never go back to old mascara!!! You need to try!!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in my ipsy bag a few months back and i used it for a while. Needless to say; once it ran out, i ordered the full size and use it every day. This is hands down the best mascara i have ever used. Usually at the end of the work day i can see a trace if black under my eye. Not with It&#x27;s so BIG mascara. I even have gone swimming with it on and didnt come out of the pool with racoon eyes. It looks fabulous on and its super easy to remove. Very long lasting! A+ Elizabeth Mott!</li>
            <li> Applied 3 times for it to even to look like I&#x27;m wearing mascara.  Then mid day its all gone!  Sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller of product great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve begun using this mascara, exclusively,  because it makes my lashes come alive and there is no irritation. It stays on, no smudging or clumping off...and it comes off quite easily with makeup remover. I&#x27;m done with searching for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; mascara. I&#x27;ve found mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn contact lenses for 15 years. I&#x27;ve worn makeup for around the same amount of time, and I&#x27;m sure my fellow contact wearing sisters can commiserate with me about the frustration and pain they have gone through when mascara gets into their contacts, either from crying, in the shower (or crying in the shower), rain, sweat, whatever it may be that causes the mascara to run and get in your eye. It&#x27;s not comfortable for non-contact wearers either, but its especially crappy when you have the stinging and burning and you are trying to see your way to the bathroom through a mascara-induced fog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then another issue I&#x27;ve always had with mascara has been that it always seems to leave a nasty black racoon stain under my eyes, and the effort it takes to get it off makes me wonder if I&#x27;m not causing some serious aging damage to my delicate under-eye area every time I remove my mascara stains. It&#x27;s just a hot mess. But we wear it because we want beautiful, long, thick lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to get a free trial of this stuff and now have an order on the way because I have finally found my solution. This stuff is awesome. It really is sweat-proof and it comes off easily in the shower, but it clumps and rolls so that it isn&#x27;t staining my skin or running down my face all awkwardly. I can now cry in movies and walk out of the theater without shame. It doesn&#x27;t run into my contacts, so I can still see after I wash my face with my contacts still in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it going to give you magically longer lashes? No. I&#x27;ve got long lashes already, so it&#x27;s not my primary goal here, but let&#x27;s face facts. No mascara is going to make your lashes longer. That&#x27;s what eyelash extensions and falsies are for. And if you want to try a cool little trick... do a coat of mascara, then dust your eyelashes with baby powder and coat it a second time. They will look longer and be thicker too. I read it on Pinterest.. so it has to be true, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line, this mascara does what it is supposed to do. It darkens, thickens and shows off your gorgeous lashes. It also doesn&#x27;t make a mess, but it&#x27;s not water proof so it&#x27;s not ripping your lashes out by the root when you scrub to get it off, it comes off easy, it just comes off different than most mascaras. It&#x27;s wonderful. Buy it. Or go to the website and get a free sample and try it., thickens and shows off your gorgeous lashes.

            <li> This is the best mascara I have used in years. It applies evenly and differentiates each lash. It does not clump. It plumps up lashes without making them look overly made up.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.  Thick and long with very little clumping</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous is a fraction of the price and the quality / effect is just as good.  It was nice to try, but I don&#x27;t think it was worth it and I don&#x27;t plan on purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing!  It doesn&#x27;t wash off with water, only soap and water.  It doesn&#x27;t smudge at all!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of &amp;#34;It&#x27;s so BIG&amp;#34; mascara from Ipsy a few months ago and fell in love with this mascara!  Goes on easily and makes my lashes really stand out.  Mascara does not clump and lasts all day.  It&#x27;s also waterproof, yet easy to remove w/ soap and water.  Will definitely be purchasing more of this!</li>
            <li> Not even sure this actually mascara. It&#x27;s extremely goopy and tar-like. Very disappointed. Won&#x27;t buy again!</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t clump, but still makes my lashes look thick and long. You can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every mainstream mascara over the years - and none of them compare the this one. I have normal to oily skin and with other mascaras I have smudges under my eyes by lunchtime - but never with this one. I can also get away with just one coat of it. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!! The price is great and it wears ALL day long. I&#x27;ve even slept in it accidentally and it still looked perfect when I woke up lol. It is also slightly waterproof which is great for outdoor wear and pool season! Plus it also comes off easy!! This is a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves to have perfect lashes all day long. The brush is also designed for getting right down to the root of the lashes. BRILLIANT! The first day I wore it I got compliments. I&#x27;ve even ordered samples for my girlfriends and the customer service has been  excellent - they responded within 2 hours or less on both of my inquiries. For anyone writing reviews where they haven&#x27;t had a good experience it could be in the way they apply their mascara - I use a back-and-forth motion starting at the  bottom of my lashes working up and it works perfect every time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new mascara that would&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. not clump or smudge&lt;br /&gt;2. give good length and volume&lt;br /&gt;3. not make my eyelashes look like insect legs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the sample of this mascara today and it looks gorgeous on my eyelashes! I used Benefit&#x27;s BadGal mascara before, which is around this price range, and it doesn&#x27;t give my eyelashes the same volume and length. What I like most is that this mascara dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t smudge around my eyes. It doesn&#x27;t clump and it has a pretty easy application. $27 for mascara is pretty expensive, but I think I will purchase this mascara as my next go-to mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I requested a sample from Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s site and they ended up sending me all three samples, which is very sweet! I am expecting good things from this company.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great. It goes on easily and does not clump up when trying to put it on. And then at the end of the day, it comes off easily as well! I tried a sample first and loved it, but I purchased a different product because I didn&#x27;t want the parabens and other chemicals in my mascara. However, I went back to this mascara because it&#x27;s superior to the other that I tried. If they could only make it without the parabens...it would really be perfect then!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good mascara. It didn&#x27;t totally blow me out of the park, but it has some really good points. The first is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to smudge or flake. It has great staying power! But it also washes off easily when the time comes. I use a mascara primer underneath just in case, and it&#x27;s basically bullet-proof. I can sleep in it and it&#x27;ll still look fresh the next morning. The second thing is that it really layers - this is almost a con for me though. I want BIG lashes. This mascara gives them to me, but only after lots of layers. But on the other hand, that&#x27;s kind of a good thing because I can layer it as much as I want, and either have a natural look or a really dramatic look. I will probably buy this again.</li>
            <li> I always have trouble with mascara smudging. I ordered this product because it was advertised as smudge proof. I was happy to pay more than I usually do for mascara if it held up to my expectation. It works very well; no smudges, goes on evenly; no clumps. I will definitely order this mascara again.</li>
            <li> This works as well as Dior&#x27;s mascara and is much less expensive.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this mascara, especially for the price.  I think it is just ordinary, and does not do much to volumize my lashes, in fact leaves them sort of spidery.  I much prefer 2000 Calorie mascara for its reasonable price, great application, and making my lashes look fabulous.</li>
            <li> I have always had long lashes but this product is something else. I can actually bat my eyelashes like a cartoon character because there is so much to bat.&lt;br /&gt;Its a miracle worker, the magic mascara for eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;Women look no more</li>
            <li> The resoundingly positive reviews did not steer me wrong. A word of caution: the first time you remove the mascara you&#x27;ll look down horrified and think that all of your eyelashes just fell out. I soon realized that this is not the case; rather, the mascara dries clung as an encasement around the lashes, so when it comes off it&#x27;s like a little mold of each individual eyelash. If you wet a piece of toilet paper with warm water and gently pull your lashes with it, the mascara slides right off in a sort of goo that you can roll into a little ball and throw away</li>
            <li> The box and the bottle is all scuffed up and looks used. It does not say that it&#x27;s used in the listing. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Good to use as a base coat before your favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a mascara, but not sure I would pay $20 again for it when there are a lot of other similiar mascaras on the market for a bit&lt;br /&gt;less.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter and she loves it!</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this mascara.  She recently commented that she no longer has to curl her lashes.  I don&#x27;t know what that means, but she was happy about it.</li>
            <li> I have really thin eyelashes so I am always looking for great mascara that creates volume while not hurting animals. This is does not do the job. :(</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried in years.</li>
            <li> Really builds big lashes that does not flake.  Great mascara!</li>
            <li> No exceptional volume as the name indicates. Gets the job done like any good quality mascara.</li>
            <li> Nice company, works perfectly. great product&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Will not buy again. For this price I expected more. &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; is much better, although it&#x27;s $5 more. Try that, I&#x27;d you want a a high end lengthening mascara. However, any drugstore brand that lengthens will give you better results than &amp;#34;It&#x27;s so Big&amp;#34;. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> i bought 3 and gave 1 away to my sister in law and she loves it as much as I do!!!</li>
            <li> The mascara is nice, but Seriously?  Read the small print regarding the # of coats needed to volumize.  Any mascara would Volumize with that many coats.</li>
            <li> I only wear waterproof mascaras, but lately, most of mine have been running a bit under my eyes - possibly due to my sunscreen, but I won&#x27;t forgo sunscreen, so thought I&#x27;d experiment w/ other mascaras.  Based upon the reviews, this stuff is supposed to wear like iron...and it does!  I have NO racoon eyes w/ this which makes me very happy. Also, when I put drops in my eyes - this stuff doesn&#x27;t budge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do not get much in the way of volume, but I do get nice definition and length.  So, what I&#x27;m doing is using my normal waterproof volumizing mascara on my upper lashes and this on my lower.  Also, fabulous customer service - they responded very quickly when I submitted a question.  Would I re-purchase?  not sure due to expense and not getting the volume I wanted, BUT it solved my SS induced raccoon eye problem, so I guess my truthful answer is I&#x27;m not sure.  If I can find a less expensive alternative then I&#x27;d switch.  However, in the meantime, I&#x27;m quite happy w/ the solution I came up with.</li>
            <li> Not worth what I paid. It did stay on all day but wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> I used to use the big brand mascara, but that has long been tossed now that I found this! It goes on so easy and stays put. Plus, I have sensitive eyes, so this doesn&#x27;t bother me one bit. And it comes off with my normal face cleaning routine, so no extra steps removing mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I really like how well it stays all day, without flaking, but washes off very easily.</li>
            <li> Surprised to find this to be a really great product. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I only need one coat to get the look I want, where other mascaras need about three or more. It doesn&#x27;t smudge and even when I cry it doesn&#x27;t run but it comes off easily in the shower.</li>
            <li> Great mascara, but it is a bit pricy and I&#x27;m not sure that for the price it&#x27;s THAT much better.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this mascara in a gift bag. When that ran out I HAD to get another! This mascara makes my lashes huge and does not clump! I&#x27;m in love with it!!</li>
            <li> CRAZY how good this mascara is.&lt;br /&gt;Big lashes and it stay on forEVER&lt;br /&gt;I did wear it all day, forgot to take it off before I went to sleep, wake up and it was still on looking fab!&lt;br /&gt;I wore it 2 days in a roll. lol dont judge me! loool&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> LOVE this mascara - I have thin tiny lashes and BIG immediately lengthens them.  It does tend to clump lashes together if you layer, but I love it anyway and prefer it over anything I have used.  I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as a gift for my daughter in law and she said she loves it!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush and mascara. Got a sample from a friend and searched for it. Used to use MAC and CHANEL, this is a much better bang for your buck. Love it!</li>
            <li> This mascara is perfect! It gives natural length and volume.</li>
            <li> I am so thankful for other reviews regarding this mascara or I may never have bought it. It cost more than the other mascara I have had in the past but it is the best I have ever used. No more raccoon eyes when I get home from work, hot and tired. My lashes look good all day &amp; night. Easy breezy to remove by using witchhazel.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this great alternative to the 3D effect which can be clumpy and irritate your eyes.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It works very nicely. I&#x27;m still not 100% sure I would pay $20 for it again though. Only problem I have with it is when you pull the wand out of the tube you ALWAYS have to wipe the excess mascara off the end of the wand, or you will have it trailing, where it could end up somewhere it shouldn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s pretty great about defining your lashes and not clumping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what they hype was all about. It&#x27;s ok as mascara goes, but not worth the price. I would probably not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara!!! It goes on easy and DOES NOT FLAKE! I have purchased more than once and will continue!</li>
            <li> BIG. VOLUME. Does what it says on the box. If I wore mascara, I would be wearing this. Instead, I gave it as a gift to the special people in my life.</li>
            <li> I am continually looking for a nice mascara that does not clump, elongates your lashes and does not smudge. This is it. Finally.</li>
            <li> After a popular company discontinued my go-to mascara years ago I&#x27;ve struggled to find something comparable. This exceeds my expectations! It&#x27;s volumizing AND lengthening, it doesn&#x27;t clump or flake and lasts ALL day. Makes my lashes look fake. I will never buy another mascara, this is truly amazing!</li>
            <li> This mascara is definitely misleading. Either I got a defective one, or my eyelashes are just weird. Anyways, the second i received my item, I tried it on, hoping for the great results everyone was talking about. However, it took 4 coats to get some real volume. I was disappointed for sure. So I began to take it off. It was a weird consistency, the product just rubbed off my eyelashes. I couldn&#x27;t believe this, so I put some on my hand and waited for it to dry. Then I rubbed it with my finger, and very well, it came off.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. And what a wonderful product.  Thank you.  I will definitely be doing business again.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product for the price. Leaves my lashes clumpy and short. :(</li>
            <li> Great Mascara! Even better customer service. The 1st one I ordered was defective, but Alice worked with me and sent me a replacement free of charge! Its light weight, holds its shape and lasts all day! What else could you want from a mascara?!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Really good mascara, probably the most effective I&#x27;ve ever used and I have tiny (short, thin, straight) lashes, but it won&#x27;t change your life or anything. Some of the reviews are a little gushy and over the top. I was expecting a little more dramatic results because of them, but it is subtler than that. It does lengthen my lashes and define them very well. The shape of the wand seems well suited to my lashes. It&#x27;s top quality is it does not smudge, even after a shower. You really need makeup remover to get it off. This would be awesome for a few days of camping.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Wins over all the expensive mascaras I&#x27;ve tried. Perfect volume and thickens without clumps or smudging under eyes.  Washes off really well with just water. Very recommend.</li>
            <li> This mascara is the BEST I&#x27;ve found! Every mascara I have tried before this smudges and I look like I&#x27;ve been caught in a rainstorm. The Elizabeth Mott mascara NEVER smudges but also fills in my lashes and lengthens them better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. And if that weren&#x27;t enough, it&#x27;s also easy to take off with just a little cleanser. I really like this product!</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, THE BEST mascara I have ever owned. At first I was skeptical to buy sit since I never heard of this brand before and its price is comparable to other more popular ones. I am  so glad I bought it based on feedback. I have been using this mascara for over two weeks and it is as good as on the first try. It does what it promises to do: voluminizes my eyelashes beautifully, no crumps, doesn&#x27;t smear through the day, and even gives some length. I have normal to long eyelashes, but I like them to look full and vibrant and this product does the trick. 100% recommended.</li>
            <li> This mascara is excellent!!! It looks like you put on false eye lashes but a thousand times better.  We used to use BENEFIT - they&#x27;re real &amp; as much as we loved that mascara , we tried this one and love it even more.  We would continue to use ITS SO BIG VOLUMIZING DEEP BLACK MASCARA!!!</li>
            <li> I usually buy the Falsies one by Maybelline at the grocery store . I bought this one to see if there was anything better out there, turns out there isn&#x27;t. I paid way too much and it doesn&#x27;t do much for me. I am going back to my cheap one because it doesn&#x27;t clump and it makes my already long lashes even longer. Its not that this mascara doesn&#x27;t work, its just that the cheap one does a better job. The length it gives is ok, the fullness it gives is also just ok.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clot or flake and does;t smudge much.  I&#x27;m one of those who doesn&#x27;t take her mascara off at night, and there is a little morning smudging that I can live with.  It doesn&#x27;t do the world&#x27;s greatest job of thickening, but maybe I just need to put on more coats of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this mascara.  Find it a little clumpy, but overall satisfied. thanks!</li>
            <li> I have never fallen in love with a mascara... at least until I tried out this one. It curls my lashes and makes them look thicker. I can wear it all day and it doesn&#x27;t smear and it has never irritated my eyes. I&#x27;m not one to spend money on make-up but this mascara is totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> I usually am a loyal user of Blinc Mascara, which is a tube mascara.  I like my mascara to thicken and lengthen, and most of all, I do NOT want it to smudge after a long day.  I came across this mascara on Amazon and decided to give it a try, based on the numerous positive reviews.  In my opinion, it acts in the same manner as Blinc, only better!  I get more product on my lashes thanks to the big, contoured brush, and the results are spectacular!  My lashes are thicker and more voluminous, I never have any smudges at the end of the day, and washing it off is so simple--a little soap and water and light massage takes it all right off!  I will never use any other mascara again.  I only wish I had found this sooner!  UPDATE 7/27/16- I fell off the It&#x27;s So BIG Mascara bandwagon last year because I felt as if the formula somehow changed, and my lashes were not as voluminous or as dramatic as they once had been when I used this product.  In fact,the mascara left my lashes feeling flimsy, and the formula felt dry and crumbly.  I tried several other mascaras over the next few months and felt disappointment every time.  Nothing had compared to the beautiful, thick lashes that I once had as a result of It&#x27;s So BIG Mascara.  I felt so lost.  On a whim, I decided to contact the company and to explain my disappointment of my most recent tubes of their mascara.  I didn&#x27;t expect anything, I just wanted to inquire if the Elizabeth Mott company had somehow changed their formula or if any other customers had observed a difference with this product.  I have never received such awesome customer service because they promptly replaced my last two failed tubes of mascara at no charge, and apologized for my recent bad experiences!  It was above and beyond anything that I had expected and I am so grateful to their customer service team.  All companies should follow their lead.  Unfortunately, the mascara was still disappointing.  No explanation by the company in that regard.  I hate to remove a star for this but the quality is definitely not what it used to be.  The company itself receives 4 stars alone for impeccable customer service!</li>
            <li> I first received It&#x27;s So BIG mascara as a bonus item with another mascara that I ordered. Oops for that other mascara. I love this stuff! I have short lashes. I&#x27;m always looking for a mascara to bring them out. Make them noticeable. It&#x27;s So BIG mascara makes my lashes pop. But best of all, it doesn&#x27;t make them clumpy thick -- look caked on. My lashes look more naturally dark and long. The contoured brush gives me a very smooth application.</li>
            <li> This mascara is absolutely astonishing. I have used seemingly every mascara---from Lancome to Maybelline---and they all have left raccoon rings under my eyes after awhile (I think I must have very oily skin undr my eyes). This is the first that does not. It is a miracle. Even if I sleep in it, it still stays on. I also use Smashbox lash primer underneath it to keep it extra-secure. Truly a miracle. Big, dark separated lashes!</li>
            <li> Long lashes!! Look natural.</li>
            <li> Mega volume and length!</li>
            <li> Great mascara and quick delivery. What more can you ask for.</li>
            <li> This product is good, but I was hoping for something more. It works well, coats my lashes well.... the other reviews made it sound like it was some miracle mascara but it just seems to be good, standard mascara.</li>
            <li> Gives length and fullness to lashes - Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara a few weeks ago.  I have had MANY comments on my eyes!  The way it comes off reminds me of blinc mascara, you can use warm water and some pressure and it comes right off.  I have slept in it accidentally only to find that it looks great the next day too!  We love it!</li>
            <li> This is good mascara.  It doesn&#x27;t clump and stays open long enough to layer.  I will buy this one again.</li>
            <li> For years I stopped wearing mascara because no matter what it would always end up smudging under my eyes.  Since this product had so many great reviews I thought I would try it out and so happy i did. No more smudging even after taking a nap with it on! The only time I had some minor smudging was after walking in rain/snowy weather.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have always had issues trying to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t end up in my under-eye area after a few hours.  Well I finally found it!  This mascara has great staying power.  I love the hour glass shaped brush--it really does a great job at both thickening and lengthening my lashes.  It&#x27;s not cheap but I love it so much I am willing to pay the higher price.</li>
            <li> For the price of this, I can go to Target and get a better mascara for $8-9.  I want a refund.  This makes no difference in my lashes/appearance.</li>
            <li> This makes my eyelashes really long. I&#x27;ve never had a mascara like this before and I enjoy using it on special occasions.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look longer with this product.</li>
            <li> I received the mascara on time. However, the mascara is awful. It makes my eyelashes look clumpy and little black pieces fall onto my face during the day from the mascara.</li>
            <li> I really like how this product goes on overall; but found it hard to get a good amount of it on. The brush is fantastic. I almost feel as though possibly the cold weather was the culprit. It has always felt a little dry and hard to maneuver. It&#x27;s okay for work; but if I am going out after work I generally need a little more.</li>
            <li> New favorite mascara! I love the brush for this mascara, it&#x27;s perfect for adding volume while preventing the clumping together of eyelashes.Defiantly will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li> ***Update to my previous review + adding 1 star***: It is still not the most volumizing mascara that I have ever used, but at the suggestion of the VERY HELPFUL Elizabeth Mott President &amp; customer service people, I received a tube directly from their company (as they noted that the Amazon product may have been affected by heat/cold/etc. during storage &amp; shipping), and it does seem to be better. My lashes are also not sticking together like they were with the first tube. I&#x27;ve had the new product for quite awhile now, and even with age the mascara is not clumping--a feature I LOVE. I still use this (1-2 coats) under my Max Factor mascara (that one still gives me more volume quickly), but the Max tends to clump a little more (so using them together leads to the best outcome for me personally). I even purchased a tube to ship to my mom to try out.  Additionally, I love a company that gives such great customer service--thanks Elizabeth Mott!    (Previous review):  I had BIG hopes for volume from this mascara, but in my opinion, it does not live up to it&#x27;s name. I will say it doesn&#x27;t seem to clump, and it may give you a little more length, but definitely not big volume (even after several coats). It&#x27;s difficult to make it more than 2 coats anyway without my lashes ending up stuck together (maybe you create volume by making one big eyelash)? ;) The brush does not help to separate them, it usually contributes to the problem.  For volume and lash separation with a good brush, I&#x27;m sticking with my Max Factor False Lash Effect mascara. If you want less volume but little clumps, then this may be the mascara for you. For now it&#x27;s become my \\&quot;first-coat-only\\&quot; mascara (so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste), then I use Max.</li>
            <li> Definitely volumizes my sparse lashes. Thank You.</li>
            <li> Best.mascara.ever! A little more costly than the $9 to $12 price point I usually purchase from, but we&#x27;ll worth the extra few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No clumps. No smearing. Long lasting. Can layer several coats to make your look as natural or dramatic as you would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is available for a long time and never changes!</li>
            <li> Had stopped using mascara for a while because I hated the dark smudges. This is definitely a major step in the right direction. LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.  It does not clump at all and even though I prefer waterproof for the lasting effect, this mascara stays put until the end of the day.  It also builds up to seem substantial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you go on there website for a free sample if you are not sure - that&#x27;s what I did and it was easy and fast with great customer service.  Also received a second sample as well. Then came here to purchase.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. Does the job</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara to date - and I&#x27;ve tried so many. The wand is thin enough to get really defined and lengthened lashes, but not too thin. My favorite thing about this mascara is that it doesn&#x27;t run in the shower or when you wash your face. It comes off very easily with a make-up remover wipe or with soap and water, but I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about it running. It doesn&#x27;t smudge or rub off during the day. I highly recommend this mascara.  Update--Almost 2 years later and I&#x27;m still using this mascara exclusively and loving it. Still highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Good mascara. Doesn&#x27;t come off very easy.  I don&#x27;t think it gives my lashes volume. It makes them look nice though! I ordered it twice.</li>
            <li> This mascara does a great job adding volume to lashes. It&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.  It&#x27;s also priced well for the quality - definitely better than drug store brands which are similarly priced.</li>
            <li> This is a fiber mascara I think. It doesn&#x27;t volumize at all for me. Good for a natural Look I guess because the formula was not thickening for me. Kind of just a tint and lengthens.Will not replace my go to mascara.</li>
            <li> I love that this mascara does not smudge! I have tried everything from drugstore to high end mascaras since I always had a hard time finding one that wouldn&#x27;t smudge under my eyes and finally found this one.  I first tried it when I received a sample through an ipsy box and fell in love with it since then. Only thing I do not like about it is that it sometimes clumps my eyelashes but other than that great mascara with no smudging and provides good volume! Definitely repurchasing!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara! I despise mascara that smudges and is difficult to remove, It&#x27;s So Big solves both of those problems! It makes my lashes look fantastic. They&#x27;re fuller, longer and don&#x27;t smudge. I got my first taste of this mascara in a beauty box and haven&#x27;t used anything else since. Thank you, Elizabeth Mott for making such an amazing product. I will definitely be a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li> I am neither thrilled or disatisfied with the product.  Though I did not get the volume I would have liked, the product went on nicely and did not smear through the day.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d like any other mascara more than Maybelline&#x27;s The Falsies. Until Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s It&#x27;s So B!G mascara came around. It separates my lashes so nicely and within a few coats (let the lashes dry in between each coat), my lashes are longer than ever almost like I&#x27;m wearing falsies! I have short lashes too, but this mascara definitely volumizes and lengthens them. Love it!</li>
            <li> Has taken a little getting used to. I wanted to try something new. I&#x27;ve recently used cheap mascara, as well as more expensive Urban Decay. Everything seemed to flake, run out quickly, and give me &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; after half a day. This does none of those things! I am very happy with my purchase so far.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of mascaras that are claiming to make your eyelashes longer. I have tried several high dollar mascaras waiting for the perfect one. This is it! It really works great!</li>
            <li> This is a great product I love that I can wear this mascara the whole day and it will not smudge. The fapplicator reaches all the lashes creating a big voluminous lashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara gives you full, long lashes that look natural. No clumping or running. The brush is perfectly designed to distribute mascara exactly where it needs to be. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.  Better than over the counter brands.  I would like to see it elongate the lashes more but I do have thick eyelashes.  Overall I think it does what it says</li>
            <li> Works pretty well- I am not overly impressed. I usually buy  optic/ maybeline&lt;br /&gt;For less money and am happy with that too! I think big volumizing mascara is way over priced.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this mascara. I received a sample in a beauty bag subscription and it was love at first use. This product curls, lengthens, and volumizes without making your lashes feel heavy and weighed down. The mascara itself is more dry feeling, rather than wet which I LOVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is easy to use and the mascara goes on nicely. I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different mascaras after running out of the bottle I purchased after using up my sample and haven&#x27;t found anything that I love more than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;d highly recommend this product and will probably be purchasing it for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. Nice build-able consistency without getting clumpy. Great black color with some shine to it, looks very pretty. It&#x27;s not water-proof but doesn&#x27;t smear. It washes off easily with just warm water but comes off in small pieces; kind of reminds me of washing latex paint off of a brush, but easier. Hasn&#x27;t damaged my natural lashes at all. Will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> This really made my lashes look longer and thicker. I will definitely purchase again. Volumizing is definitely the right word for this mascara!</li>
            <li> This product performs as a good mascara should:  goes on smoothly, non-clumping, easy to apply, stays on all day, easy to remove.  This product exceeded my expectations.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Love it! Doesn&#x27;t smudge! Totally recommend it! Wish I could give it 10 stars! Worth every penny</li>
            <li> I love the length and separation. I do not love the flakes. However, that could be me. I am not very good at cleaning all of my mascara off...but I wake up with black flakey uckiness. I do not have that issue with my normal mascara, with the same level of cleaning.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara. I have tried several within the last month this is my new favorite. I am able to accentuate my lower lashes without the clumps. I don&#x27;t like thin nor thick lashes just noticeable ones. You can definitely apply to your desired thickness and length, but I prefer natural looking as I work in a professional surroundings. If you are using this for evening wear you may certainly apply over your day application and it will not clump.It comes off easily at night without pulling on your lashes. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> AMAZING product. I am that person that buys every single new mascara looking for the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; one. I often times end up using multiple mascaras together to get the look I want. This mascara is perfect and doesn&#x27;t need to be used with other mascara. It doesn&#x27;t run or clump and is by far one of my very favorite. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Mascara is dry and doesnt add any length or volume to the lashes.</li>
            <li> This mascara works great !  It was slightly dry when I got it but aded a little contact solution and it is perfect.  I like the way it makes my lashes long but not clumpy :-)</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! I will definitely reorder! It makes big beautiful lashes and is very easily removed with water.</li>
            <li> I apply this mascara once in the morning and don&#x27;t have to worry about it again.  It goes on easily, no big globs, no flaking.  The color is perfect.  It doesn&#x27;t work miracles, but my lashes do look thicker when I use them.  It looks natural enough and comes off relatively easily when I wash my face.  It comes off best with mascara remover though.  It looks better and lasts longer than the store bought brands like revlon and maybelline.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes luge huge  and super long! I used 4-5 different mascaras. Now I only used this one! Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Have tried lots of mascaras with great online ratings just to be disappointed.  This one was a pleasant surprise.  Have been using the same tube for about 2 months and it&#x27;s still going on nicely, so it&#x27;s worth the price.  Will definitely continue to order!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara!  It does not flake, no smudging.  I can swim, cry, sweat without worry.  Great Product!  Stays on all day and I usually have to wear waterproof.  comes off with a little effort</li>
            <li> Great product.  Lasts all day without flaking, easy to remove.  Not tested on animals.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Nice mascara but did smudge under my eyes after a few hours.</li>
            <li> It is a good mascara, doesnt smudgh, but I cannot see it adding volume</li>
            <li> The best mascara I have ever used! It&#x27;s So Big delivers the lash volume that it promises. The best feature of this mascara is that it does not smudge or run. This is the only mascara that I have ever found that stays on my lashes. No raccoon eyes for me anymore! I&#x27;ve ordered this twice and will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> Best mascara, hands down. This mascara as a gel like texture. It gives me full and long looking lashes, doesn&#x27;t clump, does not smear, and my favorite aspect about this mascara is that it is SO easy to remove!</li>
            <li> Volumenizing and lengthening and looks great!</li>
            <li> The reviews didn&#x27;t lie! I love this product. I kind of look like a doll hah. This is worth it big time!</li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara!! I&#x27;ve tried all the brands. This one magically opens up your eyes and does a great job adding length and volume. I don&#x27;t know the secret ingredient but you see/feel the difference. Pretty easy to remove with just soap and water. Love it.</li>
            <li> Thought this wouldn&#x27;t clump, per the reviews. But still goes on the same way as all other mascara. I&#x27;ve managed to get it not to clump, but I&#x27;ve had to use techniques I use with other mascara.</li>
            <li> mascara works very nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s So BIG mascara is the BEST mascara ever....it does not smudge going on and lasts all day! Highly recommend this product to anyone.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you are missing out on a wonderful product.  I will not buy any other brand.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara! I&#x27;ve tried everything including fake and fiber lashes and this is so much easier and never smudges or runs unless I want it off. I will go leave my positive review now!</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing! I have been trying different mascaras for years (my favorite was discontinued) from cheap mascaras to top brand name mascaras, never really sticking with one. This mascara did exactly what I have been looking for. It lengthens and volumizes  without flaking or clumping. It holds my shape after I curl and put the mascara on. And I loved that it is easy to wash off. I found my new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> Great Mascara!!!! I&#x27;;ve been using this mascara and am very pleased with the volume it has given to my lashes</li>
            <li> I ordered this mascara because I try to buy Cruelty Free makeup only , and that&#x27;s becoming increasingly difficult, as many previously lines that don&#x27;t test on animals or use animal products in the makeup have either changed their policies or have been bought out by bigger companies that do! Not so for Elizabeth Mott, and so this was my first puchase from this company. I am happy w/the product, it goes on smoothly and the black is not a harsh black color as many mascaras are. It has a good strong color to it yet has a slightly natural look to it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it didn&#x27;t seem to add as much volume to my lashes as I would have thought. Still, it&#x27;s worth having slightly thinner lashes to know that a make up company places a high priority on respect and love for animals. I hope Mott comes out w/more products. I&#x27;ll be purchasing them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but I prefer the brush to men more in volume or thick. This brush is thin from the middle which doesn&#x27;t make my lashes much bigger.&lt;br /&gt;A good quality product though.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day. No raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. It is water resistant and it does not smudge even after long days. I just purchased another one for a present because I want to share this great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit that is pricey, but it is all worth it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing It&#x27;s So BIG Voluminous Mascara again! It really lengthens the lashes and it never smudges.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different mascaras and this is by far the best out there!  It goes on without clumps, does not flake and is easy to remove. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Great application. Easy and lasting.</li>
            <li> This mascara really is all its cracked up to be and well worth the price. Leaves my lashes looking fuller and curled. Definitely is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The best thing I can say for this mascara is that it definitely darkens the lashes.  As for lengthening the lashes...it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  As for making the lashes fuller, it definitely does not do this at all.  I&#x27;ve used every mascara trick I know to get the most out of this product, but every time I&#x27;ve used it I look like I forgot to put on mascara, and end up putting my usual mascara over it.  Extremely disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smear or flake, no matter what I&#x27;m doing (it actually holds up better to swimming than most waterproof mascaras, even though it isn&#x27;t a waterproof formula), but comes off fine with my facial cleansing cloths or regular face wash. Great volume and length, and no clumping.</li>
            <li> So my original review of this product was that it was terrible. I was contacted via amazon from the VP of the company offering me a refund.&lt;br /&gt;They also let me know that they give free samples. So I ordered a free sample to see if I got a bad tube of mascara. I think I must have because what&lt;br /&gt;I was sent was a million times better than what I paid for. I knew as soon as I opened it, that it was going to be better.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I&#x27;ll order again though. It&#x27;s too much of a hassle to return. They also sent me their shadow crayon which is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this sample size, my full size is super dry though.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara! It does not clump, it stays on for long wear yet it is easy to remove with a simple gentle cleaner. You can apply multiple coats and it does not look messy. It separates my lashes and gives me lots of volume. If I leave it on over night I wake up with very little flakes under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Good mascara, better than any drugstore mascara I have tried. And I have tried dozens of mascaras in all budget ranges, from Covergirl to Lancome. HOWEVER, I much prefer the Benefit They&#x27;re Real or Roller Lash and will go back to one of these when I replace my tube in a few months.</li>
            <li> The wand has an interesting shape which allows you to really work the product into your lashes. One coat-it looks fab. But if you actually want to appear as though you have false eye lashes , this is the product. I used about 4 coats and I used an eyelash comb which I think is important to achieve that look. Much of the success of the product comes from how you hold the wand and manipulate it. I&#x27;ve already told a few friends about it. Would buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for a while, for some reason this one I just ordered is very flaky? The entire reason I spend $20 a tube is bc I HATE flaky mascaras. The last tube I ordered was great maybe I got an old tube?</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite mascara. I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a mascara that goes on thick, stays put all day long (seriously NO smudges - ever!) but still washes off easily with soap and water. I&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mascara that was cruelty-free and this one got really good reviews so even though I wanted a waterproof mascara, I decided to give this a try.  I used to get L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous waterproof and it ran under my eyes by the end of the day.  I tried many others which also ran.  This mascara does not run even after a long day of work!  I was amazed.  It does have an interesting sort of formula which seems less heavy than other mascaras I have tried.  It&#x27;s like the difference between whole milk and skim milk - that&#x27;s the best way I can describe it so it may not seem heavy enough or thick enough for some people.  It does darken and thicken your lashes but there is something different about the way it is formulated.  For me, it works great and stays on all day.  It comes off easily with most soaps although I have had to struggle occasionally to get it off with just soap depending on the soap. Not sure if it stays on in the pool or ocean... Overall very very pleased...and no bunnies had to suffer!!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased that this mascara doesn&#x27;t melt down my face, even in the 90 degree South Florida heat, running around all day with my children. Comes off easily at night with coconut oil and water. Not quite as volumizing as some mascaras I have used, but I put on several coats and it definitely does the job. I do sometimes find little black specks on my cheeks in the AM, which means it&#x27;s not fully coming off at night. But a quick swipe of coconut oil takes care of that. All in all, I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> The best mascara ever.  I use it every day. ..I have tried tons of other mascaras, but this one beats them all. No clumping, no flaking, and never smudges. Washes off without smudging, I am in love!</li>
            <li> I was happy to find that Amazon carries this mascara that I have come to love!  I was given a sample of It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara and used it out of convenience but then discovered that I preferred it to my regular mascara!  I wear contact lenses and so I&#x27;m constantly going back and forth between waterproof and regular mascaras and I love that this one stays on in the presence of tears and contact solution but can be washed off with regular face wash, without need for a separate eye makeup remover.  In addition, I find that my lashes are defined and elongated without any clumping.  Also, my little bottle lasted a long long time because the formula doesn&#x27;t get dry (or, again, clumpy).  Thank you, Elizabeth Mott.  I have tried so many things and I found a winner!!!  P.S.  If you are blanching at the price/comparing to drug store prices, you should make a note of how big this container is.  It contains a lot of mascara.</li>
            <li> This Mascara is OK... It dries really fast on your lashes and stiffens up. Its hard to get more than 2 coats on because it dries so fast. It lengthens but sticks the lashes together.</li>
            <li> This mascara does not smudge or run at all.  I had been buying organic mascara and continually had black smudges under my eyes.  Not useful since I already fight dark circles.  This mascara stays put even if you splash water on your face.  It does seem to make my lashes appear longer.  I am not thrilled about how much comes out and how it can quickly become a mess on lashes sticking together.</li>
            <li> The price is a little steep but overall this mascara is great. I love the thin brush and it doesn&#x27;t clump up like other mascaras.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.  This mascara stays put and doesn&#x27;t clump.  I will be reordering!</li>
            <li> Was not use to using a thin bush however the mascara goes on easy, makes my lashes longer I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I was a slave to waterproof mascara before I received this as a sample in a beauty bag. I&#x27;m about to order my third tube and couldn&#x27;t imagine wearing anything else. I have spring/fall allergies that make my eyes water all throughout the day and even with a little bit of rubbing and tissues, this stuff stays on. In the shower, I just rub the lashes a little bit after I&#x27;ve been in for a few minutes and it comes right off. I barely ever have to use my makeup remover. It also holds my curls all day! Really couldn&#x27;t ask for a better mascara!</li>
            <li> Honestly did not get the hype of this mascara. It was okay, but clumped a HUGE amount and was extremely difficult to remove. I&#x27;d honestly be fine with that if it had the payoff of great lashes but....meh. Won&#x27;t purchase again. My Covergirl mascara is far superior.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write a review but this is it. I get smudge when using any other mascara I tried, including Japanese products and department store brands. But this one&#x27;s the only thing that doesn&#x27;t give me the smudge. I am looking no further.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service!&lt;br /&gt;It provides more length than volume and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  Love it!!!  Much better than the lancome product I used previously &amp; half the price</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have used.  It does not clump up and washes away easily.  This will be the only mascara I will ever use.</li>
            <li> Lengthens my lashes and wears well. I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this mascara.  I have very puny lashes and I also have a difficult time getting it to stay on for the entire day.  Unfortunately this mascara didn&#x27;t give me much volume or have staying power.  I like the applicator brush.  The product went on smooth and without clumping.  I usually end up getting it on my upper eyelids but this offered more control when applying.  After reading many reviews, this product works for  many but not me:(</li>
            <li> The wand does a good job of separating the lashes, and the mascara is high quality and lasts all day. It still clumps up after a few uses and needs to be wiped with a tissue before use, like any mascara.</li>
            <li> This product is good to me but it&#x27;s not GREAT. I feel I can find something for a cheaper price. If you&#x27;re looking for a natural long  eyelash this product would be for you. Not very bold and glamourus.</li>
            <li> Purchased it as a gift. My friend really liked it. I would definitely buy it again for myself and as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara does NOT smudge! Say bye-bye to raccoon eyes. Also easy to remove with eye-makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I work 12 hours.  Up at 5am.  Make-up on at 5:30.  No time to reapply or look in the mirror.  This stuff stays put.  It is my favorite mascara by far.  I use a blow dryer on my eyelash curler first.  Then two coats of mascara.  Only issue is my eyelashes hit my eyelids and I have to get rid of the little black dots they leave right after applying.  It also passes the church test.  I always cry at church.  Always.  I never put eye make-up on because of it.  No eyeliner.  No eye shadow.  Just this stuff...and it stays.  Before this I used Clinique and Mary Kay mascara.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. Love the brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 and this is my favorite mascara I have ever found!</li>
            <li> My wife got a sample from ipsy and decided to buy on amazon. She loves the mascara, goes on great, doesn&#x27;t smudge or clump, and can wear it all day without having to re-apply!</li>
            <li> This mascara does a nice job thoroughly coating lashes. It&#x27;s also easy to remove. The only (slight) complaint I have about the mascara is that the end of the brush is a bit gooey - you must wipe the tip before applying. Otherwise, great!</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes long, however I feel like it gets clumpy. Ive had way better mascaras and this one does make my lashes longer but itx not consistent with the thickness of the application if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> The mascara is not what I expected. I bought it based on the reviews but was totally disappointed by the product. It does not give the volume that it says it would, it clams my eyelashes a lot. Will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Great lightweight mascara for the day and washes off easily.  This is now my day time go to mascara.</li>
            <li> I waited to enter a review on this.  I&#x27;ve had the product for close to a month.  I also ordered a sample pack of mascaras from Sephora (Blinc, Josie Maran, Lancome. Too Faced, Tarte) .  The samples are half the size of the normal.  I wanted to give a fair review.  I absolutely LOVE &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So  BIG.&amp;#34;  Not only do you get the length, I have tiny lashes, but you get volume as well.  I love the brush.  I have had no issue with flaking.  I know we all use multiple mascaras, you do not need to with this one.  It builds fantastically.  I have not had an issue with running, smudging or flaking.  I do need to reapply in the evening but I need to reapply everything in the evening.  I like to look fresh. This is my mascara from now on.</li>
            <li> The best mascara I have ever used! It doesn&#x27;t clump and gives my lashes volume like never before. It&#x27;s also easy to wash off! I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything before, but this mascara has thoroughly impressed me.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! I&#x27;ve tried so many over the years but this is the best. It doesn&#x27;t clump going on and it stays put until I wash it off. No more smears and bits of mascara on my face by the end of the day. I love the wand too!</li>
            <li> I saw this in someone&#x27;s beauty box subscription and I wanted to try it. I had sworn off mascara because they always claim to do something they don&#x27;t. I need it not to smear and make dark circles under my eyes, or make my eyes itch! Well, I finally found one that stays on ALL day and never smudges and I&#x27;m not constantly rubbing my eyes because they itch! Well Done!</li>
            <li> very bad product , L&#x60;oreal works way much better...I do not understand all the good reviews on this! It&#x27;s super  clumpy. Definitely to return</li>
            <li> I have never found a mascara that doesn&#x27;t run or smear...until now.  I could not be more happy with the product.  It lengthens  and builds without ever feeling or looking cakey or clumpy.  I will be purchasing this mascara again.  Totally worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I actually really liked this mascara. I used to use Clinique mascaras but I felt they weren&#x27;t really doing anything to make my eyelashes look different. I already have pretty long and full eyelashes, but wanted something that made them really stand out. This mascara makes my lashes look noticeably longer and fuller. I really like the wand, I feel its design is what makes this mascara great. It also makes it easy to apply The only two drawbacks are that it does tend to stick my lashes together and its hard to separate them after they&#x27;re stuck. But it isn&#x27;t clumpy. The other drawback is that it does leave residue when you wash it off. I&#x27;m used to my Clinique mascaras not leaving anything when I wash my face, but this is probably a normal occurrence. I just used Clinique for years and am used to it. But the difference in the look of my eyelashes is worth the drawbacks!</li>
            <li> best I have ever used</li>
            <li> I do not write reviews sadly, this is a first. I loved this Mascara it is the best I have ever used. After buying Dior and having to throw it out it was terrible, so luckily I tried this one around same time. I am ordering more.</li>
            <li> love this. trust me during summer, you want this because it stays on like water proof, but it comes off easy like any other mascara. so no raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Did not like product at all. The shape of the wand made applying the mascara difficult and messy-application was very uneven and needed to apply several coats to look like I even had mascara on. The only positives were it did not flake throughout the day and was easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I do not understand all the good reviews on this! It&#x27;s super goopey, clumpy, and gets on my eyelid every time it apply it, no matter how careful I am! I will be throwing it away after only a weeks use.</li>
            <li> I liked that this mascara didn&#x27;t clump. The brush helped define each lash instead of just jamming them together to make them thicker. But overall I didn&#x27;t feel like my lashes didn&#x27;t look that amazing: they didn&#x27;t appear longer or really that much bigger, just a little bolder. I like this mascara for everyday use, like going to work or running errands, but it&#x27;s not what I would use for a night out or a date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also easy to get off at the end of the day and doesn&#x27;t flake or make my eyes itchy. It arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Stays on, doesn&#x27;t clump. Works perfectly with the lash conditioner.</li>
            <li> When I go to stores like Target and see mascara is $7, it always seems a little pricy, especially since it rubs off easily throughout the day. Just spend a bit more for this mascara and it won&#x27;t rub off and it doesn&#x27;t take as many layers. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been hunting for a long-wear make-it-through-anything-with-fabulous-lashes type of mascara.  I demand it all.  I have been hunting for years.  I&#x27;m hard on my mascara- I work as a hiking guide in Alaska, and I like to maintain some girliness in my work and part of that includes having fabulous lashes while hiking the windy ridges.  I have spent three years battling black under-eye smudges once I begin sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the mythical creature I have been searching so desperately for- the Perfect Mascara.  I ordered a sample from the company, put it on my lashes when it arrived (so smooth!!) and immediately did a weight-lifting session and then headed out the door for a five mile power walk without looking in the mirror.  I was gonna test this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home, I looked in the mirror....and not one smudge.  Not ONE.  No smear, no moving, just fabulous LONG pretty lashes!  I actually called my husband at work to celebrate.  He didn&#x27;t care.  But I do!!  Not only does this stuff cling to your lashes like a spider monkey to a back, it removes easily with makeup remover (I nearly tear my lashes out with other waterproofs I&#x27;ve worn), there is NO clumping when you apply it, and seriously ladies...it did not MOVE.  I&#x27;m never looking back. This is it, hands down.  And I&#x27;m not allergic.  Almost everything makes my eyes itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what is in this stuff, but ELIZABETH MOTT I LOVE YOU!!!  I officially get to stay pretty while sweating it up with clients in the back country of Alaska.  BOOM.  Life complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend the other products too- they also sent a sample of their eyeliner pencil and I tested that after the mascara- also no moving.  I&#x27;m keeping an eye on this company for ANY new products that pop up!</li>
            <li> I usually purchase Clinique high impact at the Clinique counter, but was lazy and thought I would try this because of comparable price and good ratings.  The mascara I received was on the clumpy side and difficult to apply. I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Mascara is a tough thing for me since I work in engineering and sometimes have to deal with all kinds of conditions.  This one was one that looked great no matter what, was safe on my sensitive eyes and also was cruelty-free.  Very happy with this one.</li>
            <li> I have tried every mascara you could think of from cheap to expensive and this one is the best!  It doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t smear all under your eyes and stays put all day long.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for a number of years.  Love how it doesn&#x27;t leave smudge marks and really makes my lashes long looking.</li>
            <li> Wow....it is so nice to check the mirror at lunch time and not see raccoon eyes.  This is the first mascara that stays put through my busy day.  Thank you for this fabulous product!!</li>
            <li> Overall, a really nice mascara that coats evenly on both top and bottom lashes.  It&#x27;s not a thick mascara (think long vs. fat lashes), but several coats gives a nice dramatic look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have hanging lids, be careful. This mascara stays wet for a minute or two, and if your lashes hit your eyelids, it will leave marks.  I&#x27;ve learned to adjust, but probably won&#x27;t repurchase for this reason.</li>
            <li> Nice it gave my lashes Length more than thicknes</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that a mascara could actually work as well as this one does. You think they&#x27;re all basically the same, but this one does exactly what it&#x27;s name states! Will most definitely purchase again &amp; tell my friends!</li>
            <li> Honestly after reading all the reviews i couldn&#x27;t wait to get the product… Usually i use LANCOME  but i wanted to try smith different… After i got &amp;#34;ITS SO BIG&amp;#34; mascara i was disappoint, it doesn&#x27;t give any volume at all and i have a trouble washing it off&lt;br /&gt;Going back to LANCOME</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best mascara I have ever used in my life! No clumps, no smudges, it&#x27;s perfect! Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! It makes my lashes long. I can fall asleep with it on (which I know I shouldn&#x27;t) and its still on the next day. It doesn&#x27;t flake off.&lt;br /&gt;I have asian eyes so it can get greasy on my eyelids, but it does great.&lt;br /&gt;There is another mascara I was using prior to &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;They&#x27;re So Real&amp;#34;. I like this one better.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love&amp;#34; It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; mascara by Elizabeth Mott.  I&#x27;ve searched my entire adult life for a mascara that I can be faithful to... I&#x27;m sad to report, this isn&#x27;t it.  The time it takes to &amp;#34;build&amp;#34; the lashes is exasperating! The product is very thin, almost like ink, and the applicator brush is too small. I find that I am standing at my mirror for at least 15 minutes longer than I used to,  just applying this product. I don&#x27;t have that kind of time to waste every morning.  Once applied, the mascara does stay where it&#x27;s put, but then so does several other brands at half the price. I&#x27;ve used this tube for a month now and it&#x27;s almost empty. I will not be buying another.</li>
            <li> Nope... The only thing I liked about this mascara is that it stays put. Unfortunately it does not nearly meet the rave reviews in my opinion, not lengthening, not for curl, not for volume, ; ( disappointed, I&#x27;ll stick to my Laura mercier, or perfekt..</li>
            <li> price was write.  marketing was right.  reviews were right.  For me, it just did not work.  I found that it clumped after 1 week of being opened and did not add much volume to my lashes.  I am going back to Lancome as I always end up doing.</li>
            <li> Wonderful mascara! Does not clump and makes lashes look great. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is just like any regular mascara doesn&#x27;t work. I prefer Maybelline</li>
            <li> This mascara does a really good job of making my skimpy lashes longer, thicker and more defined! The brush is easy to use and the mascara doesn&#x27;t have any strong perfume or fragrance. Over time, the mascara does get thicker and tends a bit toward clumping but this is still a great product overall.</li>
            <li> I have tried mascara from department stores, sephora, all the top brands and this is my favorite. It doesn&#x27;t smudge in humidity of Hawaii, comes off easily with soap and water or facial cleansing wipes, doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes or contacts, can apply natural look or lush thick lashes. I wish it didn&#x27;t&#x27; clump so much the thicker I applied but I pinch the tips when it gets too clumpy and just reapply starting at the base to tip to give the tips a more whispy appearance. It also lasts longer than some of it&#x27;s more expensive competitors, I would say daily use will last 3 weeks or more.</li>
            <li> I like it because it goes on easily without clumping and lasts throughout the entire day without flaking! I have even washed my face gently around the eyes (not washing my lashes) and it stayed on without flaking or smudging.  Usually a little soap and water work well to wash off the mascara, however I have had some lashes fall (very few).  I will start using an eye make-up remover to see if it makes a difference.  Overall I like the product.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars because, it is a great mascara and works well. After 2-3 uses it does flake and make little specks when you wash it off. Only when you wash it off though. It comes off easily and does not smear while wearing. I have a more oily skin, especially around the t-zone and eyes, and this does not smear for me. It defines, separates and lengthens very well. If you apply 4-5 coats, it also volumizes well too.Just don&#x27;t let it dry between coats, keep applying until you get the result you&#x27;re seeking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all this is a great mascara, far better than departments store brands. I wish it came in a waterproof option though. To my knowledge, it does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give this a 5 star is because, it claims to(if you use an eyelash curler) to help your eyelashes hold their curl, it does for a short while, but they fall after so long. Not a big deal really, but I wish it did. I still notice a difference in the fullness and length of my lashes however, so no complaints there!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it is a great product and I would recommend it to others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve ever tried and continue to go back to it even though I like to try new mascaras. This one is perfect for everyday and reminds me of the 2000 calorie mascara by Maxfactor (which isn&#x27;t sold in the US anymore). Doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake and only clumps with too many coats. This mascara works best on lashes that have been curled. Unless you have naturally long lashes with a curl, you need a lash curler to achieve the best results. I have Asian lashes so I would know :)</li>
            <li> really works to help my dwindling eyelashes seem so much fuller and longer!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the mascara! I feel like it strengthens my lashes rather than damage them as I have experienced with other mascaras. It stays on just enough so I can use it even if I go swimming but it still washes off very easily with water and a little eye-makeup remover!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara ever. Well worth the price.  My lashes stay curled and fabulous all day</li>
            <li> I have tried so, so many mascaras only to be disappointed as the gradually ran off as the day went by.  NOT this one!  I wear contacts, have allergies and live in a hot climate and can really endorse this product as long wearing!  Not only that, it makes my sad little lashes super long!  Get this one, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever!  No clumping, stays put, gives me nice full eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this mascara through IPSY and I fell in love with the product. I had to order it again once I ran out. It feels great on my lashes, not clumpy, lasts all day and makes my lashes long and beautiful. I also love that this mascara is cruelty free and does not test on animals. I will purchase again and again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this mascara has NEVER smudged!  It also does not clump and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> Best mascera in the world!!!!</li>
            <li> Since I fell pregnant in April I have become allergic to all the make up I&#x27;ve used for years. I got a sample of this mascara in my December Bella Box and thought I&#x27;d try it and have never looked back. Not only can I use it with NO irritation, I LOVE the product as it doesn&#x27;t slide down your face or attach itself to your upper lids like a lot of other mascaras do throughout the day. I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. I have long, thin eyelases. This producy gives lashes volume and still keeps lashes separated with no flaking or clumping. Even looks great if you sleep in it!</li>
            <li> This is a really great product.  It seriously looks like I am wearing false eye lashes.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife. She was worried that it would bother her eyes but to her surprise it doesn&#x27;t bother them at all. She has issues with her eyes but she said she would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have tried several brands of mascara and everyone of them flakes.  I end up with mascara under my eyes. This mascara is wonderful.  No flaking and lengthens my lashes.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky on my mascara and am always in the search of something good but not too expensive and this hit the mark.  I also judge a mascara on how hard it is to get off, and it comes off easy with my makeup remover, home run!  You barely need any to make you lashes look super long, love it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do as much as I&#x27;d hoped to plump up my lashes or make them appear thicker/longer (not like 3D lashes do), but I do like that it doesn&#x27;t smudge or leave black marks under my eyes after a long day at work.  It&#x27;s easy to remove at night, too.</li>
            <li> This makes for a great mascara. Very lengthening, product doesn&#x27;t clump and I like the brush! A really good purchase :-)</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a volumizing mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump for the last 20 years and have finally found it!!!!  I have fairly long lashes but they are thin.  This mascara not only makes them twice as long but it really thickens them with just a few strokes.  I have only been using it for two weeks and have already told at least 5 people about it!  Thanks Elizabeth!</li>
            <li> I am always looking for better mascara; this stuff is really good, I have not had any issues with flaking or smearing; my mother tried it out the other day, and said &amp;#34;Where did you get this; I love it!&amp;#34; It really makes your lashes look lush!</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth-no clumps. It lasts all day without flaking, but it washes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Read about it in the newspaper and thought I&#x27;d try it, the price is reasonable and it&#x27;s excellent, really does make your lashes look thicker and not as clumped as other brands.</li>
            <li> This mascara is wonderful.  My lashes look long and dark.  I would recommend this product to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara if your lashes are thick and you need length only. I had hoped this product would also thicken my lashes, but it does not.  So for that reason I did not find it any better than a good drugstore brand.  I will use it with another thickening mascara and would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> With all the rave reviews I expected something spectacular with this mascara but it just didn&#x27;t deliver. I&#x27;m glad I tried the sample that the company offers before I spent $20 on the full size. It went on easy enough but it was almost like there wasn&#x27;t much mascara on the brush, and I tried two coats to no avail. I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in my naked lashes on the left eye versus the mascara&#x27;d lashes on the right eye. It did stay on the entire day without smudging but then when I washed my face, the mascara came off in giant flakes. I eventually had to use makeup remover (I&#x27;m used to my old brand coming off easily with cleanser) twice to get all the flakes off my lashes and face.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would help the appearance of my thinning lashes (over 50). I find the mascara to be extremely clumpy.  I like the design of the wand, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the gooey mascara.  On the  positive side,  it comes off well with soap and water.  Actually that works better than the non-oily mascara remover.  I&#x27;m not left with raccoon eyes either, which is a real plus.  I also wear hard contact lenses and occasionally I get flaking in my eyes later in the day.  This is too pricey for the results.  I can get the same results using drugstore mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to say I didn&#x27;t like this mascara at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews I was excited to try it, but it didn&#x27;t give me much volume or length which really surprised me. Especially for the price I was bummed for it to go to waste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to stick with Loreal Voluminous, you can&#x27;t go wrong with it!</li>
            <li> Really loved the way the brush was designed. I was able to&lt;br /&gt;get all of my &amp;#34;short asian&amp;#34; lashes!!! Awsome.</li>
            <li> It does not give you a similar result. The brush is not as good as the buxom mascara brush. The mascara its self however is not bad. It does not run and is easy to wash away. It does slightly clump if you try to put on 10 coats as the box suggest. Maybe stick with three coats and you&#x27;ll be fine. But I think I&#x27;m gonna stick with buxom mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a great mascara and finally found it!  During the day, I&#x27;ll apply a couple coats and have a nice professional look but for a night out, a few more and my lashes stand out like they should.</li>
            <li> AVOID AT ALL COST!!! THERE IS NO IMPRESSIVE CHANGE IN VOLUME.THERE IS A LITTLE CHANGE IN LENGTH.LEAVES LUMPS EVERYWHERE. I USED IT ONCE THEN TOSSED IT AWAY..</li>
            <li> I first found this as a sample and immediately baca me a devotee. It gives me great lashes and STAYS PUT all day and then easily washes off at night. Best mascara I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed; flakes after a few hours of wear and isn&#x27;t truly waterproof. Save your money and buy something better.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. Easy to apply more than one coat without clumping and lashes sticking together. Does not smudge. I read reviews before using and they were right. It is fabulous. I found a new mascara.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and have always had trouble with mascara irritating my eyes and smudging onto my face.  This is the first mascara that I have ever used that causes no irritation and stays where it belongs (on my eyelashes only!) all day long.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is great going on, a little hard to remove, but overall I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love it! Not clumpy...natural look to it...goes on perfectly. If I want more oomph I put on a second coat. Highly recommend...</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this is the reviews were true that this is the BEST mascara; however I&#x27;m a believer! I&#x27;ve tried every mascara you can imagine in the cosmetics aisle of CVS and Target and occasionally a higher-end mascara at department stores but nothing compares to this. The mascara separates and lengthens my lashes and still soft and natural looking. In LOVE with it and will always buy this for myself and recommend to anyone. Thanks reviewers for getting me to try this (THUMBS UP).</li>
            <li> I have been on what seems to be an impossible search for the perfect daily wear mascara. I need a product that provides volume, length, stays put, and comes off completely and easily at night. Unfortunately, this product was goopy, clumpy and did not remove without several cotton pads. This is a high maintenance mascara and not one that works for everyday wear. :(</li>
            <li> This mascara definitely adds a significant amount of length. Enough so that I am not completely discouraged about the hefty price, but the price is definitely what will keep me from buying this product again. It works great but there are more out there with a more affordable price. Some great qualities are that it glides on well with no clumps, and it only requires 4 or 5 swipes for a good look. The shape of the brush works well to elongate the lashes but not much volume is being added. Also, it must dry quickly because I never have any stray marks after I am done applying it. I&#x27;ve attached some pictures but they don&#x27;t do it much justice.  1st picture is before and other two are after application    Overall: Great for a one-time buy but the price makes it difficult to justify another purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used.  It truly lives up to it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Big Lash&amp;#34; name, lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and is easy to remove.  I used to wear Lancome, this mascara is much better!  Really happy I found it and have already recommended the product to friends!</li>
            <li> I love this Mascara! FIRST MASCARA probably that I will ever keep for a long time!</li>
            <li> This mascara is so much better than the ones I have used in the past.  No clumping, makes my lashes longer and so pretty.  Hubs noticed it right away, and liked it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Have straight eyelashes. This mascara keeps the curl after using my eyelash curler. Does not smudge. Easy to wash off. Recommend it!</li>
            <li> This was so disappointing. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because they really have something with the shape of the wand. The mascara itself is clumpy and does not apply right. Tarantula eyes comes to mind.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara makes my lashes look longer and thicker!  I will certainly purchase &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara&amp;#34; again,</li>
            <li> I love this Mascara, I typically don&#x27;t leave reviews, and I have quite long lashes already but this mascara is phenomenal. It makes my lashes look twice as big, it is quite amazing, this one is worth every $.</li>
            <li> Nice dark color, not too clumpy, and cheaper than some department store brands that don&#x27;t work as well. Plus no allergic reaction, which is nice!</li>
            <li> What a nightmare!  Eyelashes stuck together in one glumpy mess and racoon eyes by the afternoon.  This is going in the trash!</li>
            <li> This product works very well, it doesn&#x27;t smudge after you brush it on and every coat consistently adds more layers and volume to your lashes! I is just like imju fiber wig but with more product and i doesn&#x27;t have a dry cakey feeling. I highly reccomend it for its price and purpose!</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara. It coats evenly without clumping, and it really makes my lashes longer. It washes off easily, which is nice since I don&#x27;t have to tug at my lashes to get the mascara off. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> The search is over!!  This, by far, is the BEST mascara I have ever used.  Your lashes will look as great, at the end of the night, as they did when you applied it that morning.  Heck, if you forget to wash your face, they will be &amp;#34;ready to go&amp;#34; the next morning.  I LOVE this stuff.  Covers every lash, even the tiny ones in the corners.  Stays on all day, no smearing, smudging or flaking.  Full coverage, plenty of volume and length. I work my bees in 95 degree weather and I am soaking wet, from head to toe when I am done but my lashes look amazing!  One would think that a mascara that performs like that, would take a fancy, oily eye wash to get it off or leave you looking like a raccoon...WRONG! This stuff slides right off your lashes with warm water.  BUY IT!  You will thank me later.  :)</li>
            <li> OK mascara, nothing fancy.  Not sure that I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have tried to find the perfect mascara since my go to  went out of production many years ago. From the reviews I thought this may be the one. I found it to be very close to cover girls lash blast, which is what I have been using. So, I would rather pay $6 for cover girl.</li>
            <li> I first received this mascara in a trial size from monthly Ipsy Glam Bag. I fell in love right away. It does not smudge, and washes off wonderfully (doesn&#x27;t leave you with raccoon eyes). I prefer this mascara over Mary Kay, MAC and Benefit. I recommend to all my friends. This mascara is just FABULOUS!!</li>
            <li> So I have pretty straight, hardly there eyelashes and this mascara changed that. I used to get eyelash extension but the price kept adding up and they itched and poked my eyes when they started falling out so I had to find a backup in order to keep my nice long, full lashes. This mascara went on smooth and never clumped, and instantly after the first swipe I saw a noticeable difference. Way more expensive than pharmacy brands but I would recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for quality.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the color is not an intense black. It would be absolutely perfect if a darker black. Please consider offering this option.</li>
            <li> the search is over - this mascara does everything - lengthens, volumizes but best of all, it does not flake, run or smear!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty great mascara, although at first I was nervous about choosing a brand I had never heard of.  (Clearly you are too, or you wouldn&#x27;t be reading the reviews.) Don&#x27;t worry - you can trust them, because I was actually very impressed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all you get this funky brush with a tiny flail at the end.  (A ball covered in spikes, for those aren&#x27;t nerdy enough to know about medieval weaponry.)  The bristles are nice and close together so they coat your lashes well, and the &#x27;flail&#x27; is great for accessing those hard to reach areas around the corners of your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara is a nice inky consistency that ensures you wont end up with hideous chunks and clumps.  I wouldn&#x27;t say this was a magnificent &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; mascara, but holy cow did it lengthen them.  If they want to slip an innuendo into the product name, they should just call it Lash Extenze.  I have sad, short, thin lashes (to match my hair!) and after I&#x27;ve applied my mascara they look just lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip: definitely curl your lashes first.  I know most of you are already, but for those who find that curling contraption terrifying...muster your courage and please reconsider because it makes a HUGE difference.  How big? It&#x27;s the difference between &amp;#34;bra&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;no-bra&amp;#34;, only for your lashes. Try it.</li>
            <li> Didnt care for this mascara,it was very clumpy. Especially disappointed after all the good reviews I read which is why I bought.</li>
            <li> This mascara is my favorite by far....I get tremendous length from it and get so many compliments on my lashes!</li>
            <li> As a senior with thinning hair...YUK!  I have been searching for a mascara that I can see without my glasses on.  This is the product folks!  I have tried several mascaras and many of them very expensive. However, they are too light, never lengthened my lashes and I couldn&#x27;t tell I was wearing any at all.  So Big Volumizing mascara thickened and lengthen my eyelashes I feel like I have lashes again. I love....love...love this product.  If you purchase you will not be disappointed.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am beyond baffled as to why this mascara has so many great reviews. I feel like I threw $20 out the window. It doesn&#x27;t do anything you&#x27;d want a mascara to do. It&#x27;s not even as good as a $7 mascara you&#x27;d buy in a drugstore.</li>
            <li> Great product...I&#x27;m over 50 and a healthcare professional I needed mascara to stay on for a 12 hr shift w/o it smearing during the course of my work shift....this mascara stayed on !  NO smudges, or smearing.... Love this mascara &amp; highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> This mascara was a huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;For a $20 mascara I expected much more than your regular Loreal, Maybelline and the like.&lt;br /&gt;But... It wasn&#x27;t even as good as those mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I test out different mascaras regularly, I did a test between It&#x27;s So BIG and Stiletto mascara (Maybelline, about $7 in any store):&lt;br /&gt;1. It does add volume, the brush is nice and it catches lashes nicely.&lt;br /&gt;2. It curls lashes, it raises them, which is absolutely awesome!&lt;br /&gt;But...&lt;br /&gt;3. Compared my other eyelashes, which had $7 Stiletto mascara on them, this mascara did NOT make my lashes look any better. They were lifted a bit higher, but if you use a curler before you put the Stiletto on, you will get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;Both left &amp; right eyelashes had comparable volume and length.&lt;br /&gt;4. After 4 hours, Its So BIG had black residue (little black flakes) under my eyes,&lt;br /&gt;Stiletto did not.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s average at best.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your lashes comparably nice to other regular brands which cost under $10, plus it dries up easily and flakes after just a few hours, which is a huge NO-NO in my book.&lt;br /&gt;I HATE having black residue under my eyes...</li>
            <li> Did not clump up or flake. And one application increased length and fullness of lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this mascara!</li>
            <li> I, like many others, have scan the endless types of mascaras in places like Target trying to decide which one will FINALLY be the one for my eyelashes... but I&#x27;m so glad that will not be an issue for me as I&#x27;ve finally found the one.. or The BIG one :)&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue is that my eyes water all the time, especially when I smile (which I often do :)), and even with waterproof mascara I always have a smudging problem.  I don&#x27;t even dare putting mascara on my lower eyelashes or else I&#x27;ll for sure have racoon eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The is the first mascara that does not smudge- AT ALL! All day, I have amazing lashes- AND I get to finally show of my lower lashes with this stuff. It&#x27;s awesome.  I have pretty good length already and I&#x27;ve been told I look like I have falsies with this mascara.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A mascara that does what it says it will do.  I simply love it.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about mascara.  For the last 30 years I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal Lash Out and more recently L&#x27;Oreal Bare Naturale mascara, and nothing else.  I had heard about all the new lash extending mascaras so went on to Amazon to search for some.  This one was the highest rated, though I&#x27;d never heard of it.  Thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Have to say, it is my new favorite and I&#x27;ve bought 5 more to stock up.  I have three requirements for mascara:&lt;br /&gt;  1)  I have sensitive eyes that water very easily, so it can&#x27;t irritate my eyes or run easliy.&lt;br /&gt;  2)  I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t take my make up off at night, so it needs to come off in the shower easily.&lt;br /&gt;  3)  I like a brush that I can use horizontally as well as vertically to get all the inside lashes as well as the bottom lashes.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara lives up to all three.&lt;br /&gt;  1)  My L&#x27;Oreal mascara would run when my eyes watered, but not this.  If anything, it will just come off one or two of the inside lashes.  Like other reviewers have said, the mascara coats the lash so when it comes off it does so as a little tube, which means it doesn&#x27;t smear all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;  2)  It comes off easily in the shower once it gets saturated.  I used to have dark circles under my eyes after my shower, but no longer.&lt;br /&gt;  3)  The brush is easily used both horizontally and vertically.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the hour glass shape - I&#x27;d probably rather it not curve in the middle, but it still works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good about this mascara.  I did find it seems to dry out a little rather quickly, but I just add a couple of drops of water (did that with my prior mascaras as well) and it rehydrates and applies easily.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. Dior doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to this no clump miracle in a bottle :) Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. I tried it after years of using other brands. My problem with other brands is the clump and also having to buy 8 different mascaras to get different effects. This one doesn&#x27;t clump and depending on how many coats you put on, seems to do the job of 8. I can put on one coat for work and then three for going out and it really GOES give you a completely different look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the $20 price I paid was worth it and not expensive at all. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Great Mascara.  Very easy to remove and long lasting with no clumping</li>
            <li> Literally the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m confused as to what is &amp;#34;so big&amp;#34; about it because it&#x27;s not my eyelashes. You&#x27;d be better off going to Walmart and spend $2.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t super impressed. Clumps eye lashes together, kinda of watery.</li>
            <li> I have tried every mascara out there and I thought this would be different!  For my eyelashes it went on way too thin and ended up clumping a lot more than expected. I ended up giving this to a friend who said it worked for her.</li>
            <li> This mascara is good.  Does what it is supposed to do.  I would say it is more of an everyday mascara to open up your eyes and will not leave residue above or below the eye- but (for me) not for the dramatic effect.  A very good mascara that I would probably buy again in 3 months.</li>
            <li> Crap! I have no idea why anyone would recommend this product! No volume or length. Clumpy and horrible after 10 coats. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of different brands of mascara and found this one to be average.  It does lengthen and volumize, however I do think other mascara&#x27;s do it better.  The good thing is this mascara comes off easily in the shower and does not run down your face!</li>
            <li> Great product!!! I can even complete a triathlon and look great!!!</li>
            <li> I have always been a confirmed Lancome mascara user.  I thought I&#x27;d give this a try and am so glad I did.  It stays on all day.  No raccoon look.  Comes off easy enough with make up remover.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> What a rip off!  I&#x27;ve used $1 mascaras that work better. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have bought!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Will  purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this product but I bought because of all the great reviews.  I&#x27;ll be honest, the first time I applied it, I thought it was okay. It seemed like I did not get as much &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; as I did with my other mascaras.  After a few days, I saw that I could build it up relatively well to create a fuller lash so that did not bother me as much.  Then about 2 week later, I accidentally packed only my old mascara when I went away for the weekend.  UGH...the difference was HUGE.  I had not realized how clumpy and crunchy and sticky my old mascara was until I used this for a few weeks.  My eyes felt and looked awful.  I pitched my old crappy mascara when I got home and I am sticking with It&#x27;s So BIG even if it is more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have very long and think lashes and volumizing mascara usually makes my lashes clump together so it looks like I have 5 lashes, this one sadly did the same thing. It definitely made my lashes look even longer (which I didn&#x27;t need).  Also it should be noted that this is made with something that turns into rubber-type material once it dries, so It rubbed off in PIECES instead of the regular smearing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this mascara at all.  Shipping was fast and speedy.  But the mascara burns my eyes and not a good choice if u have contacts.</li>
            <li> Finally a mascara that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes when I have my contacts in.  I received the product quickly &amp; didn&#x27;t mind spending a bit more than I normally would.  I would recommend  this product to anybody!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve tried them all.  We all have different needs from a mascara, which is evident from the very few negative reviews posted here.  I want a mascara that dries quickly, requires very few coats, lengthens, voluminizes, does not smudge, does not irritate my eyes and is a bold rich color.  This met all my demands, no other mascara has.  I can find decent mascaras, but they will smudge under my eyes after a while.  This one has never done that.  I also have very sensitive watery eyes and this does not bother them.  It lasts throughout the day and is easy to remove. I never have the urge to pick it off late in the day like I have other mascaras.  I think this has allowed them to grow and actually stay fuller. I&#x27;m very happy with the product.  I never would have thought I would spend $20 on a mascara, but it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve spent more on buying mascaras and throwing them away in my search for mascara nirvana.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this mascara in a beauty sample box, and I&#x27;ve gone on to purchase it. It gives a lot of length without clumping. It doesn&#x27;t do a lot for volume. But I only do 2-3 coats, and according to the box, you could do many more coats to get that volume. Has no unpleasant odor, as some mascaras do.</li>
            <li> Not as great as I&#x27;d thought it would be</li>
            <li> Seriously.  What everyone else said.  This one is IT -- you can layer and add depth and volume with no clumps.  Better than any of the Benefit or Dior top line products.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that was not tested on animals. Brands are pretty limited. My first time using this product and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it. It does not clump or smear yet washes off in the shower.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was cruelty free and had good reviews, I have very small and fine eyelashes and it looks natural and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The product is what it says, lots of volumizing!  Very quick shipping, Recommend</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I expected fantastic eyelashes.  This is plain old mascara - nothing special - just on the expensive side - and a little difficult to remove.  I&#x27;m going to give this to my niece and go back to Revlon.  Works better for me.</li>
            <li> This works SO well. It makes my eyelashes so long and full! Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Long eyelashes,easy to remove,not too god at volume....I use a volumizing mascara and this one on top to make them longer....</li>
            <li> Well, what can I say? This is THE BEST mascara I have ever tried!!! And I tried a lot!!! It makes your lashes very sexy, it does not give you allergy and does not make your eyes dirty when you wash them!!! I ordered 4 of them for me and my friends-everyone loves it!!!thank you for this wonderful mascara!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite mascara.  I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands both high end and drug store brands and all have had marginal results.  I have average lashes.  Moderate thickness and on the short side.  This mascara looks great giving me length, volume and absolutely no smudging but washes off easily.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I do rotate mascaras with the cheap stuff, but this is by far my favoritemascara. I had heard about it, ordered a sample directly from her site and then purchased the full size on amazon. It&#x27;s lengthening (little tubes on the ends of your lashes) and cleans off easily, but not clumpy when applying (which is...amazing!). So, if you&#x27;re looking for the gunked-on, triple-layered, teenage cholita look, this probably isn&#x27;t for you. For everyone else, I HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> Honestly I love love this mascara, it stays on all day, makes my eyes look fabulous and it doesn&#x27;t flake. When you wash it off it doesn&#x27;t smear like other mascaras, I guess that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t flake. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This is one of the very best mascaras I have ever used!  It goes on even and smooth and makes my lashes long and full.  It doesn&#x27;t smear during the day and it comes off easily in the shower.  It is more expensive than other mascaras, but it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> bought it for my gf, said she likes it alot but its not quite her favorite. and the price is pretty high.  it does look good but i think you could find one just as good for cheaper</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this mascara about 2 weeks ago, and have used it 8 times.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend any money on it - for me, it&#x27;s no different than Maybelline Great Lash, and I would have been furious if I&#x27;d dropped $20 on a tube of this. If you are happy with this price point, but not happy with the product, I would recommend Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real - now THAT is worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros: no clumps, no flakes, wears well and removes easily.&lt;br /&gt;The cons: NO volume to speak of - this is a really thin formula that delivers, at best, a lengthened natural look.  Not unlike what you get with a $4 tube of classic Great Lash.  I also found that I had to re-curl my lashes after applying - which I never need to do with other mascaras - but this formula, as it dries, straightened my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence, do order a sample - you can get one through Mott&#x27;s page.  Mine took less than a week to arrive.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed at all..... It was clumpy and hard to get off!!! Have searched and searched for good mascara and still searching!! :(</li>
            <li> I have been loving this mascara. Im not sure i how where i got it from. But i have been using it every day lately and i love how it makes my lashes look. They look so long, dark, and it does not clump my lashes as i have tried high end brands from sephora and i dont like how they clump my lashes up together its not a good look. This one leaves my lashes really beautiful and i can also get my bottom lashes looking real nice. I dont notice any smell, and the staying power is good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not nearly as volumizing as other mascaras I&#x27;ve used. The best thing about it is the wand has a ball at the end which really helps define those tiny lashes you don&#x27;t get at with a straight wand. This mascara gives more of a natural look than a glamorous one.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this after reading the rave reviews,  and then learning this this product is not tested on animals (that&#x27;s what the 2nd star is for).&lt;br /&gt;The Mascara itself is awful. Maybe I just got a bad bottle,  but I seriously can&#x27;t use it.  It clumps my eyelashes together so badly that I have had to wash it off immediately each time I&#x27;ve given it a try. It&#x27;s so clumpy and crusty that I&#x27;ve lost eyelashes while removing it every time.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Took a little while to get used to the unique shape of the brush, but now I really like it! Stays in all day but is not difficult to remove at night.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE LOVE this!!!  I have very dry, sensitive eyes which are irritated year-round due to allergies.  This mascara doesn&#x27;t flake off into my eyes, it never runs, and it really fills out my sparse eyelashes.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to my daughter who wears contacts.  I remove it with either a Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes (the purple ones) or Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Facial Cleanser and it comes off with no problems.</li>
            <li> So far, not any different than Maybelline or Cover Girl.  I havent tried 10 coats of it yet, like it suggests,  Im thinking I might not be able to keep eyes open</li>
            <li> Before using this proruct I was going to get false eyelashes but not anymore. It makes my own look fuller and longer...just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Mascara is only o.k.  Its fine, it doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all, which is good.  Other than that, its like basic drugstore mascara, not super volumizing as it says.  Its o.k. but not worth 2-3 times what you pay for a drugstore brand.  Better to spend more on a quality product or less on one of the same quality.</li>
            <li> I loved this mascara, but I&#x27;m going to toss it because I try to avoid putting toxins in/on my body (makeup gets absorbed through the skin).  When I checked the toxicity of the ingredients list on the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetic database and found that PROPYLPARABEN gets the highest toxicity score of 10 (scale of 1-10).    Elizabeth Mott, you made an amazing mascara!  Would love to see you make one without the toxins and I would buy it in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> not sure about all the 5 star reviews?  my much, much less expensive drug store mascara is waaay better than this. It clumps big time. I got suckered in, i should have read the one star reviews instead of the 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> This mascara is wonderful.  I have short lashes and this mascara is EXACTLY what I needed. Stays on all day with no smudging too...what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> i like this mascara its doesnt clump</li>
            <li> I have been using Blinc for years and never knew what I was missing. Doesn&#x27;t smudge or clump and lashes stay curled after application.</li>
            <li> makes my lashes appear MUCH longer, but still natural and not clumpy.  it isn&#x27;t waterproof, and can be easily removed with soap and water.  it is EXTREMELY smudge-proof which means its not going to just wear off (unless you swim or cry!).  i&#x27;m 42, so my eyelids are starting to droop a little and sometimes touch my top lashes.  this is the first mascara i&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t smudge on my eyelids.  it literally lasts me all day (again unless i swim or cry).  i&#x27;m on my 2nd tube(?) of &amp;#34;BIG&amp;#34; and plan on staying with this mascara.  hint on applying:  start at the base of you lashes, press wand into them, and slowly pull up.  this technique gives me super long lashes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve looking for long separated lashes w no flaking off and that stay all day - This is the mascara for u. If you are wanting thick, full lashes this isn&#x27;t it. I tried several coats and lashes got longer and longer but not thicker and fuller. That&#x27;s why I gave it a 4. Still an awesome mascara for the price. Comes off super easy in the shower.</li>
            <li> Awesome mascara!  Doesn&#x27;t glump up like many others, always stays fluid.  And the unique brush is terrific!  It really does keep the lashes separated and that in itself, helps makes the lashes look even longer.  Great stuff ~ I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Fabulous stuff.  I have tried more mascaras in the past six months than I care to admit.  This is the only one so far that hasn&#x27;t turned me into a raccoon at the end of the day.  It gives a lush look without heaviness or clumping.  Washes off easily as well.  I think we have a winner....!</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a few weeks after trying this mascara to write a review. I&#x27;m very impressed. I usually have to buy products that are hypoallergenic but I am always at least trying to find a good mascara that adds length and doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes. This product doesn&#x27;t state hypoallergenic but I&#x27;ve had no problems with it. It&#x27;s amazing how it lengthens my lashes but there isn&#x27;t any product breaking off throughout the day. My typical day consists of going to work, the gym, home and it stays on strong with no issues. The most amazing thing is, you would think you would need some heavy duty soap or eye makeup remover to get it off of your lashes but really all you need is warm water and a washcloth. I highly recommend this if you are looking for a lengthening mascara.</li>
            <li> This product was  a big disappointment. I have tried every drug store brand of mascara and was hoping that if I spent a little bit more and trusted in the amazon reviews that I would find a product that was truly volumizing. This product does literally nothing to volumize my lashes. It barely works as well as non-volumizing &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; mascaras. The only plus is that it is truly waterproof but absolutely not volumizing- barely works as well as a regular mascara.</li>
            <li> BEST mascara EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras over the years and have found issue with just about all of them. Either the formula was wrong for me or the brush was difficult to use. Each time a new mascara would hit the market, I&#x27;d have to run out and get it ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister told me about this product and gave it rave reviews. I couldn&#x27;t agree more!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is fluffy, hourglass shaped....love it!  The product goes on easily and coats even the tiniest of lashes. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with smudging or raccoon eyes and at night  it does come off easily with Neutrogena eye makeup remover. I&#x27;m very happy with this item and will definitely be repurchasing !</li>
            <li> The BEST Mascara EVER</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the brush--too big for me&lt;br /&gt;comes off in clumps when removing it--I prefer mascara that dissolves when removed&lt;br /&gt;stays on good but not worth the price</li>
            <li> I have long lashes as is, I bought this because it&#x27;s supposed to be volumizing. It makes my eyelashes look awkwardly long but doesn&#x27;t give it volume at all...</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I have EVER used that does not transfer below my eyes. I got a sample as part of my ipsy subscription, and replaced it with a full size tube as soon as it ran out. It works nicely, staining my lashes and making them look dark and feathery with no clumps. The major thing for me is that it stays on the entire day with zero transfer, smudging or flaking. Amazing!</li>
            <li> The mascara comes out too thick on the brush (it is caked on and individual bristles are not separated).  I believe it is a problem with package design.  Applying makes most of my lashes stick together and look very clumpy.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this mascara to make my fine lashes appear thicker and longer - it does neither.  The mascara substance is very thin - goes on thin, and stays thin instead of building.  I would expect that for what is advertised, it would at least be buildable, but it was not.  Very disappointed in a very thin coating on already fine lashes.  Would not buy again, and feel that the advertising is very misleading.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  I have small, fine eyelashes and this mascara makes them look so long and full!</li>
            <li> The best I have ever used.  I like mascara on my lower eyelashes and it never smears or runs.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve found yet.  Gives me long, full lashes with no smudging or clumps.</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara. It goes on smoothly and stays on throughout the day with absolutely no smudging!  I use this as a top coat to the Younique 3D Fiber mascara to lengthen lashes and prevent smudges. It works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Very smooth application. I did not see the results I was hoping for...no better than my L&#x27;oreal Volumnious mascara. Still, a nice product that goes on well and stays put throughout the day yet removes easily.</li>
            <li> Fantastic mascara!! Really lengthening! I lost my first mascara before I could use it, it fell out of my purse. They sent me another one!! I love that they are clearly good people. Definitely going to be a returning customer!! 👍 thank you!!</li>
            <li> Good product. Doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, I don&#x27;t know why it has so many reviews.  I&#x27;ve used drug store mascaras that work better.  It doesn&#x27;t add length and not too much volume either; I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> It started out really well, but then after a couple months it dried out a bit quicker than expected. However, I really liked it, while it lasted. It was easy to apply and easy to remove with water, even. But it stays on ALL day.</li>
            <li> Good product not the best mascara I&#x27;ve used. For the price I expected more. I have heavy lashes and it seemed to apply to thinly. My lashes didn&#x27;t curl and even after using an eyelash curler they weren&#x27;t as nice as when I use a different mascara I have. I think the brush was a little thin for me. Pro- it isn&#x27;t sticky. I will prob not order again just due to the type of eyelashes I have and will stick to Better Than Sex, which is the brand I currently use. This product would work well for people with lighter waited lashes.</li>
            <li> 20$ on this was a waste!! It clumps the brush doesn&#x27;t separate lashes, and weighs my lashes down not curl them up.</li>
            <li> Very impressed :-) I have short lashes and this product extended them dramatically!</li>
            <li> I have never written a review for anything but this product deserves it. It delivers length and volume without clumping or flaking. Perfection. My quest for an awesome mascara is over!! Thank u thank u</li>
            <li> The best mascara iv used!! Instantly add length and volume</li>
            <li> Okay so I bought this mascara after reading the reviews however I am not really in love with mascara. It does not really do anything for my eyelashes. For the price, I think I will stick to my loreal.</li>
            <li> Good mascara.  Not my most favorite.  But, much better than OTC.  I might buy again.</li>
            <li> I have tried every mascara and this is the best!!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  Have tried many that I hate but this one I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I have oily Asian eyelids. I can&#x27;t a mascara that won&#x27;t smudge and holds a curl all day. (I&#x27;ve low, middle and high-end mascaras.) This mascara is smudge/budge-proof. I&#x27;ve worn it all day and it didn&#x27;t flake or melt. It also lengthens and curls. Overall, it&#x27;s pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that doesn&#x27;t provide any volume. I need volume for my sparse, short lashes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I got a sample from their website.</li>
            <li> Solid product.  I have stumpy short lashes that appear demonstrably longer after I use this mascara (and without curling my lashes).  Overall, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for my lashes.  Unfortunately, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> love this mascara ... the brush is not the usual shape that i prefer but it works beautifully .. however there could be improvement if the tube had a better more thorough way of removing the excess mascara from the wand when its withdrawn from the tube .. otherwise this mascara is awesome.  i the past all mascara&#x27;s gave me raccoon eyes by midday but since using It&#x27;s So BIG not a black under eye to be seen .. thanks Elizabeth</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes. In the past when using volumizing mascaras I developed an allergic reaction due to the flaking of the mascara. What I love about &amp;#34;its so Big&amp;#34; not only does it not flake it gives me the volume but in a natural looking way. My lashes look long naturally not &amp;#34;made up&amp;#34; I also love the brush because of its shape it catches the end of my lashes and extends them evenly with the rest of my lashes.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best mascara I have ever used. It goes on easily without clumping, makes lashes look long and full, and it does not smudge! Amazing. And yet washes off every easily. I slept in it while on a red eye flight and there were no smudges under my eyes. Yes, a few little flakes, but overall it still looked great. I will continue to use this, The only downside is that it does contain parabens, but being that this is mascara and I am not touching my skin with it, I think its okay (but hope they reformulate to no parabens). I don&#x27;t think parabens are absorbed through lashes, and as I said, it doesn&#x27;t smudge so doesn&#x27;t touch the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with the mascara. It goes on perfect for my shirt lashes. And it&#x27;s very easy to wash off</li>
            <li> Am I missing something or not using it correctly?  I was pretty disappointed after using this mascara a few times, especially after reading so many great reviews. Unfortunately I found this mascara clumpy and heavy. I like it when my mascara separates my lashes then makes each individual lash thicker and longer. This did the complete opposite. It made my lashes stick together, look super sparse and clumpy.  It also took the curl away from my lashes, because it was so heavy.  I really wanted to love it, but I guess I&#x27;m with the few it didn&#x27;t work for.  I VERY rarely give one star, but I can&#x27;t find anything positive to say about this product.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this and fell in love with it! It&#x27;s more expensive than drug store brands but totally worth the price! I wear contacts and this is the only mascara that doesn&#x27;t flake onto my contacts and never runs.</li>
            <li> I have tried to many different mascaras I would never be able to keep track.  I have long lashes but they have gotten more sparse in middle age.  I used to really like Lancome mascara, but lately it hasn&#x27;t been doing it for me, and it is a b#%*&amp; to get off.  I came on Amazon and ordered the mascara with the best reviews, and I LOVE IT!  Coats well without clumping, I like the brush shape, and when you take it out of the tube it doesn&#x27;t come out with massive amounts of macara on it as some do.  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  Enough to pay $20. It makes my lashes so long and dark. Others have commented negatively on the wand but I think it works great</li>
            <li> This is a good everyday mascara.  It goes on smooth with no clumps and I love the style of the brush.  I will definitely continue to use this product!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting much different results compared to other mascara&#x27;s I had used, but this really didn&#x27;t change much from any other one I&#x27;ve used.  In fact, I&#x27;d say it doesn&#x27;t show near as much, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> There have been many mascara brands on my lashes, both drugstore and designer brand. Although I do like Bare Minerals mascara this one beats it hands down. Never, and I mean never any flaking or smudging (even when I fell asleep with it on - it was still on my lashes, not under my eyes). After you apply a couple layers you can see the mascara lengthening and bringing volume to your lashes. The brush I think is the key to the wonderful way it manages to catch and separate your lashes. The only issue I have with this product is the small amount of work you have to do to take it off, other than that it&#x27;s really great. Wish it cost a little less, but then again, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on reviews. I have been using this mascara for one month and the applicator broke this morning. ALL the mascara comes out and is impossible to use. I had to throw it in the trash. Prior to this happening I thought this mascara was OK, nothing amazing. I would not order again. I&#x27;d rather go buy my $7 Loreal mascara from CVS.</li>
            <li> Great mascara! Doesn&#x27;t clump, lengthens, stays on and washes clean with soap and water.. A miracle for most water proof mascara!</li>
            <li> Great mascara! Does not flake or bother my sensitive eyes. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have extremely short lashes (I mean very short) and these make my lashes look really long and thick which never happens with any mascara. Because of that, I almost always use shorter fake lashes to make it look like I have anything. But I don&#x27;t need false lashes with this mascara because it looks like I have beautiful natural ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Its really and truly amazing. It also lasts all day but is very easy to take off when need to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a customer for life!!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was eager to try It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara, but I was sceptical that it could really live up to all of the glowing reviews.  I&#x27;m a believer now!  This mascara give a very natural full-lash look without the clumpi-ness of most volumizing mascaras.  Best of all, IT STAYS IN PLACE!  No more racoon eyes.  It passed the ultimate test at my daughter&#x27;s wedding.  It lasted through tears of happiness, dancing, and a warm day and looked as good at the end of the day as at the start of the day.  It&#x27;s my new favorite mascara!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d received a sample of this mascara in an Ipsy bag and immediately I was hooked. It does wonders for my over 40 lashes. As always, I curl my lashes prior to mascara but with most brands, including high end, by midday my lashes are sagging and almost straight. This ISB mascara holds my lashes up and there&#x27;s no flaking. When it&#x27;s time to wash my face it comes off easy with cleanser and I don&#x27;t have the residual raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> I was intending on buying a completely different mascara but when I saw how many positive reviews this one had, I decided to try it. I can safely say that it lived up to my expectations. I apply once in the morning and it stays on all day without flaking off or creating black bags under my eyes. Would highly recommend.!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and like most Asians I have very straight, but long eye lashes. I wanted a mascara that is easy to apply, won&#x27;t smudge, and easy to remove while keeping my eyelashes curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put the mascara on, it is very easy to apply, is not clumpy and goes on smoothly. It is dark black, which I love. It does not smudge throughout the day which I love as well. The mascara is so easy to remove that I use my cleanser oil to remove it in the shower which is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, since my eyelashes are so resistant to being curled, I have yet to find a mascara that will keep curled when applying the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this again if needed, but I want to find something to keep my eye lashes curled rather than having them point straight out when applying my mascara. My eyelashes are just very resistant and stubborn.</li>
            <li> I have only used the product a few times but, so far so good!</li>
            <li> This was not my favorite, not as dramatizing as I would expect from a 20 dollar mascara. I ended up sending it back. I have tried lots of make-up counter mascaras, and my favorite is still voluminous by loreal.</li>
            <li> Amazing mascara! No smudges, long, big lashes with no caking. Lasts all day. Easy to remove at night-just use warm water.</li>
            <li> I finally found a mascara that I won&#x27;t leave now. I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s now, so I have tried and searched many mascaras.  I love how this goes on and especially how it stays on during the day and doesn&#x27;t leave any crease marks on my eyelids, like even the waterproof mascaras do, because I still have oily eyelids. When I splash my face with water it doesn&#x27;t come off but when I wash my face it comes off easily with the Derma E Makeup Remover for eyes and I don&#x27;t have to scrub my eye lashes It does add volume and length to my lashes.  I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I am a make-up snob.  I ordered the mascara and it is the best I have found on the market.  It even arrived on prime Amazon on  a Sunday.  I will be reorder and tell my friends.  It make your lashes long and not clump together.  Excellent product and great price.</li>
            <li> While this is my new favorite mascara, this last tube seemed a bit different. Not sure if the wand changed or what. I still love Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s mascara though and my lashes are still curled by the end of the day!!</li>
            <li> Finally found it!  The mascara that won&#x27;t smudge!  Love love love it.</li>
            <li> I am in the minority because I simply was not impressed at all by this mascara, and as another person pointed out, I&#x27;m a little baffled as to how this has so many positive reviews.  Then again, the mascara just might not work for ME, but works for others.  As another poster said, I have long lashes already, so this mascara should accentuate that.  Instead, my lashes just ended up clumping together, and that was after just one coat.  Like other unhappy customers, my lashes looked like insect legs.  I was looking for an alternative to buying Smashbox Full Exposure, which is slightly more expensive, but totally worth it, as it actually volumizes.  I wanted to like this mascara, but it just did not work for me.  I tried using it about three times and ended up throwing it out.  Glad it works for others, but I&#x27;m disappointed and upset at having spent money on something that I just ended up throwing away.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really add any volume or definition to my lashes...not impressed.</li>
            <li> I have in the past year developed oily under eyes. Since then mascara a have given me terrible raccoon eyes no matter what I did. I tried so many different products all saying smudge proof with poor results. I specifically chose this mascara based on the reviews. This is my forever mascara. It is TRULY smudge proof even after workouts. Even last is separated and thickened. Definitely recommending. Update: I have purchased my second tube (my first would have lasted longer but my daughter kept borrowing). I love, love, love and stand by my previous comment only adding good to the last use.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST mascara I have used for long full lashes without clumping!  It stays on-- doesn&#x27;t flake or run-- yet easy to wash off. I ordered it and received it within a couple of days. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Mott’s “It’s so Big” Mascara is the best mascara I’ve ever used.  The company very generously supplies a sample upon request, so I tried it and I knew I would like it before I made my purchase.  I like the hourglass shape of the brush – it is easy to manipulate and it doesn’t clump my lashes.  With some brands, I ended up picking apart my stuck-together eyelashes with a pin because the mascara had glommed them together.  I’ve never had to do that with Elizabeth Mott’s brand.  I was more interested in volume than in added length, but this mascara does both.  I like applying multiple light coats and the brush works well for this (although I do wipe off any excess mascara that tends to gather at the end of the brush before applying.)  This mascara never rubs off during the time I need it, but it washes off easily and gently.</li>
            <li> Not worth 20$ stick to their real by benifit !!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I discovered this mascara. Other mascaras would flake immediately and/or leave gobs of goop on my lashes that I couldn&#x27;t even comb out with my eyelash comb! This product has a fabulous applicator wand/brush with lots of thick and thin portions to choose how much or how little you want to apply. The mascara lasts all day and I use coconut oil from Trader Joe&#x27;s to remove it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about my mascara and have pretty much tried everything from cover girl to Chanel. THIS mascara is AMAZING and looks like I&#x27;m wearing eyelash extensions. I did find the best way to apply it is to put on a base coat of any mascara and then apply this one. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this, but when it arrived I first noticed the pink box opened.  I then opened the mascara and the smell was horrid.  It smelled like really old mascara!  No way was I using it. Returning for a refund.</li>
            <li> I have fairly full eyelashes, I end up plucking a few in the corner because they tend to tangle no matter how much I curl or shape them. I still try to use mascara, since it only makes my lashes appear even fuller and longer, but in general I can only apply a bit on the inside corners, mostly the bottom row. I&#x27;ve thoroughly tried around 15 brands, and they always always *always* make my lashes tangle and stick when I blink. I tend to spend the lot of my morning fidgeting with my lashes getting them unstuck basically rubbing it all off.&lt;br /&gt;So you can probably guess what I&#x27;m saying next. This brand is the absolute best. I can apply a nice coat to every lash, even the shrubbery in the outside corners of my eyes - and it looks amazing. Noticeable darker and thicker looking lashes. It feels like there is *nothing* on them and I don&#x27;t ever have clumping issues or any smudges/smears. Seriously great stuff.</li>
            <li> This is by far the BEST mascara I have ever used and I have tried them all!  I have naturally very long but fine eyelashes and this adds so much volume and makes my eyelashes appear incredible that they almost look false.  I get compliments all the time on them when I have this mascara on.  I have recently bought this for two friends who are now hooked as well.</li>
            <li> It is a lot like better then sex mascara which I love. It doesn&#x27;t make the lashes as thick but very long.</li>
            <li> I searched online for a good mascara and read many reviews on different mascara brands. That&#x27;s how I learned about It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara by Elizabeth Mott--had never heard of it before.  There were great reviews, so I decided to try this mascara. Wow--it&#x27;s the best mascara I have ever used, and I&#x27;m 60 years old, so I&#x27;ve tried my share of different mascara. My expectations were more than exceeded. This mascara does not smear, flake or fade throughout the day. It stays looking nice the WHOLE DAY long, and I can&#x27;t say that about other mascaras I have used. I&#x27;ve already placed a second order for this mascara, so I&#x27;ll have it when it&#x27;s time to replace the first one I&#x27;m using. This mascara is a keeper, and what I&#x27;ll be using from now on!!&lt;br /&gt;Diana</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Love that it&#x27;s cruelty free. Love how well it works. It does not run onto my skin, lasts all day, and washes off with soap and warm water. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on reviews here at Amazon. I&#x27;ve been very happy with it so far. It goes on easily (the shape of the brush is unique and seems to keep the mascara from clumping on your lashes), it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, and it stays put (I teach fitness classes so it&#x27;s really been put to the &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; test. It&#x27;s easy to remove with make-up remover, and has a slim and pretty case. Definitely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This mascara really does what it says it does! I really like it, but I find that I can only use it when I go out because I do a lot of baking in my home and every time I open the oven door it fries the mascara into balls. This is probably because it really does thicken and lengthen and it looks almost like fake eye lashes, so if you are going for a big look, this is IT. It&#x27;s kind of hard to remove with regular washing, so you do need an eye makeup remover, which is another thing I don&#x27;t love, but hey - you can&#x27;t have everything and with this product you get pretty much what you ask for. Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on reviews.  It&#x27;s blah....I have long, light lashes and it did nothing to build them up.  I&#x27;m back to my cheap brand.</li>
            <li> Read the review and bought this as a result. True to review. Great product!</li>
            <li> I m not at all impressed by this mascara.  I was so excited to receive it based on all the other reviews.  I thought the brush was sub-par and came out of the tube with excess mascara all globbed up.  You need to spend a good minute scraping the brush against the tube so all that extra mascara doesn&#x27;t get all over.  A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Horrible clumps right away my lashes weren&#x27;t long at all worst mascara- This one reminded me of when your mascara is running out and your lashes start to clump - except this was a new bottle - very disappointed-  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but  I could get the same results from a relvon mascara</li>
            <li> I like the mascara. But i think it gives length, but not BIG volume as it is told.</li>
            <li> Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely my new favorite.  This mascara is more waterproof and lifeproof than any &amp;#34; waterproof&amp;#34; mascara I have tried.  I have long 15 hour days ; I want my mascara to be stay where I put it at the beginning of the day.  Done!  Easily removed with a little coconut oil before I wash my face at night. I&#x27;m loving this mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mascara freak!.  I don&#x27;t find many that I can say I LOVE .  This is one of those mascaras ! I have naturally long lashes, and everyone always compliments me on them.  This mascara really separates lashes and extends lashes waaaaaayyy.out.  I would buy this again .</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money. Maybes line makes a better one for 5 dollars</li>
            <li> I like the mascara, it definitely makes them more noticeable, I like the fact that it can be removed with water. Only 4 stars because of chemicals, it has to be possible to make this formulation without the junk added to it and it is not saturated as much with color as I would like, other than that great mascara.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it if you love your lashes! I lost more than five hairs after taking it from first use.</li>
            <li> I usually use L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous mascara. I have used it for years. I was hoping that this mascara would make my lashes look thicker. It didn&#x27;t. It was a very nice mascara. But nothing special. Too expensive for what you get. It&#x27;s just average.</li>
            <li> My wife just absolutely loves this.  I have to order more today!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the beauty industry &amp; have tried hundreds of mascaras, not only on myself but also on others. I was immediately impressed with Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s &amp;#34;It&#x27;s So Big&amp;#34; mascara; it did what it promised to do without clumping, flaking or wearing off. This is my new go-to mascara &amp; will be recommending it to friends &amp; clients.</li>
            <li> I know this is going to be a very unpopular review, but I have to be honest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a really embarrassing hair pulling disorder called trichotillomania. It is a horrible, horrible disorder for a girl to have....especially in high school and college! I pulled my eyebrows, eyelashes, and some hair on my scalp from ages 8 or 9 up until the present, where I&#x27;m now 28. As a result, I now have NO EYEBROWS...they stopped growing at all after so many pulling spells in high school. I don&#x27;t mean I have sparse eyebrows like most girls who say they have none do....I mean I have NONE. I actually just got permanent cosmetics last year for eyebrows and eyeliner tattoos. In addition to no eyebrows, I had no eyelashes....I mean my eyelids were BALD up until now. While they were bald, I hid it by drowning my eyes in a sea of dark, dark liners and eye shadows. However, I finally started to try resisting my pulling urges once I got my eyebrow and eyeliner tattoos. The eyebrow hair has yet to even THINK of trying to come back, but my eyelashes have! My eyelashes, for the first time in 20 years, are back! Granted, they are not luxurious, beautiful lashes I&#x27;ve always dreamed of having, but compared to having none, and not being able to wear mascara for two decades, it is welcomed!. So, they are back but they are very, very, very thin and spaced far apart. But, since they have returned, I have literally tried every mascara I could get my hands on! You ladies who can rock just one coat of mascara and look normal, I envy you! Anyway, I searched for my 15th or 16th bottle in 6 months....trying every single one I could before my urges to pull possibly resurface. I figured this mascara would do wonders according to the rave reviews....but, it didn&#x27;t. If any of you who are reading this know this disorder like I do, you know that even the slightest clump, bump, strayed hair, etc. only eat at your pulling desire even more. That is what this mascara does. It is mediocre at best. Not only does it do a poor job separating lashes, but it also leaves a hard, flaky bit at the tips of your lashes. Not only does that look rather ugly, it also makes urges even worse. I still gave this item 3 stars, not because it causes urges....that is NOT the make up&#x27;s fault....I am fully aware of that....but because it ranks up there with pretty much any mascara you can get at the drug store much cheaper. The best mascara I have used so far is the CoverGirl Volumizing Lash in the orange tube you buy at any ole drug store. Like I said, this won&#x27;t be a popular review, but in case someone else out there is searching for the same reason I was, I hope this is helpful.does it do a poor job separating lashes, but it also leaves a hard, flaky bit at the tips of your lashes.

            <li> This mascara is so soft!  I was surprised by that.  And it really doesn&#x27;t flake off. It is a little easier to take off with a mascara remover but if you don&#x27;t have any your cleanser of choice and water does the trick.  This mascara creates a natural look for daytime and two coats at night a bolder, but still natural look. A nice feature - the hourglass brush gets into the corners without poking yourself with a pointed end. This is a really nice mascara.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and have tried many mascaras, at every price point. This one is proving to be a winner for me. It goes on smooth and does not clump or flake off. I typically don&#x27;t reapply during the day, which isn&#x27;t a problem with this mascara. This is the first Amazon review I&#x27;ve written but felt compelled. Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t please with this mascara. It cost about $10 more than the Maybelline mascara that I have been using and it doesn&#x27;t make my lashes stand out. I put extra coats on but to no avail.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely THE BEST mascara I have ever, ever worn in my life. I am 48 years old. I seriously have tried them all. I have dark lashes and I really wanted a waterproof. I was leery on this purchase. Butttttt.....&lt;br /&gt;Flash to 4 months later and STILL IN LOVE with this. It will separate, it will lengthen, it will define, and it will NOT smudge. No raccoon eyes. Zero. I have cried. I have even fallen asleep with it on, (shhh! I know!), and it&#x27;s on when I wake up, but washes off with soap and water. Miracle Mascara right here. I mean it.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, no clumping and it makes my old lashes look young again.</li>
            <li> I always look for really good mascaras and have tried everything from Maybelline to Sephora and this one outshines them all. It lasts long, never flakes, doesn&#x27;t run (and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even waterproof??) and it doesn&#x27;t go on thick so you can do as many layers as you want and it still looks clean. I have told everyone who is looking for a GOOD mascara to buy this.</li>
            <li> I bought this over a year ago. I only tried using this product twice, it did very little. It was extremely dry upon arrival. Those two times I had to swirl around the brush to do anything to my lashes at all.</li>
            <li> my daughter hated this stuff - said it was super runny and went everywhere and she needed 15 coats just to get enough on the lashes to do any good.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  Every claim they make is true.  The hourglass shaped wand curls your lashes naturally and the mascara is very smooth.  No smudging and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-- Stays on, doesn&#x27;t flake or crumble, for a good 24 hrs. Never had a mascara that didn&#x27;t migrate to the lines under my eyes after 5 hours. LOVE THAT.&lt;br /&gt;-- I mean seriously stays on. Even on a humid, greasy-faced July day. I&#x27;ve gone to bed wearing it and woken up looking just as good.&lt;br /&gt;-- Good look -- I only do one coat and get nice definition and volume (though I do employ an eyelash curler before applying).&lt;br /&gt;-- Great price. For how it performs, I&#x27;d pay twice that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-- Seems a little hard to remove. It says you can do it with a regular face wash, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true -- seems to hang out on my eyelashes and face for a few days after. I remove it with make-up remover now but it still lingers a bit.&lt;br /&gt;-- If you get an errant eyelash with mascara on it poking you in the eyeball, may God help you. It&#x27;s itchy and very painful. Never happened to me before with other mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;-- Given how well it stays put, I sort of worry it might be damaging my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;-- Have recommended it to my mom and bestie. Despite definite flaws, I can&#x27;t see myself wearing any other mascara ever again. Even when I forget and rub my eyes from tiredness or whatever, that stuff stays put. Good product.</li>
            <li> Awesome mascara. It doesn&#x27;t give me as much volume as it says, but I still really like it and will be buying more once I run out. It makes my lashes pretty and it&#x27;s good for my sensitive eyes. I also love the name lol</li>
            <li> I was able to throw away all my miscellaneous tubes of one-time-disappointments when I started using this mascara!  HIGHLY recommended...works better than the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried also!  Stays on, doesn&#x27;t run, smear, smudge, or flake, but rinses off with soap and water easily.</li>
            <li> It works! You have to apply a few coats to get the volume you want which is good because if you just want a natural look you only do a few, you want a more dramatic look apply a few more. I went to sleep with it on because I was too lazy to remove &amp; my lashes were just as pretty as the day before. No raccoon eyes after going to bed with it on. Awesome! Woke up ready to go, no need to reapply!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this mascara in my Ipsy Glam Bag a few months ago. I ran out recently and had to buy more. I have been searching for a great mascara for years. In the last year, I have been only using samples  to try out every higher end brand to find the right one. This one wins! The formula is build-able, not clumpy, and gives you the perfect balance of volume and length. It is also unique in that when you take it off, it doesn&#x27;t run,  It comes off in pieces (hard to explain.)  It also doesn&#x27;t run if you cry or get wet (just don&#x27;t rub it!).  I love it!</li>
            <li> My new favorite vegan mascara! Goes on clean and smooth, stays all day, washes off with water easily at night. Amazing. :)</li>
            <li> I like this product very much. It doesn&#x27;t clump on my lashes and actually separates them nicely. making them look better then ever.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  I just ordered my second tube.  It goes on easily with minimal clumping (never met any that didn&#x27;t clump to a certain degree).  What I like best is that it looks great after application and all day long but removes easily with plain soap and water.</li>
            <li> Good product -- very thick mascara -- but impossible to wash out with just soap and water</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve found. Got so tired of raccoon smudges from &amp;#34;smudge proof&amp;#34; mascaras. This stuff rocks. Goes in slick and fans out my lashes without clumps. If I go all sweaty day without reapplying it just seems to disappear (in talking after at least 12 hrs) which I much prefer to smearing out all over.</li>
            <li> It works only as well as the drug store brands.  Definitely NOT worth $20.  Will NOT buy again.&lt;br /&gt;It works, but it doesn&#x27;t work half as well as Benefit or Lancôme.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It gives great separation, volume, length and stays all day! Will order again!</li>
            <li> My best ever mascara!</li>
            <li> Great product, if you&#x27;re anything like me trying a new mascara seems like such a risk! Well I&#x27;m glad I took this one. Two coats and I&#x27;m good to go. They are so big! Almost seems they are waterproof. No smudging or running so far. Been using a week. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Never had a mascara that lasts and looks good - this does - Love it!!</li>
            <li> OK.  I am a TOTAL product junkie &amp;#34;specializing&amp;#34; in mascara and hair spray.  LOL!  I read the reviews on this mascara and thought I would add it to my collection.  I have very straight eyelashes that are on the short side and am always on the hunt for a mascara that adds volume and length without clumping, flaking or smudging - it HAS to last all day.  This mascara is great!  The brush is awesome and grabs every little lash (top AND bottom) for a perfect application and the formula is not too thick or too thin.  No clumping, flaking or smudging (I will not put up with a smudge).  In a nutshell... this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> Finally, a mascara that doesn&#x27;t leave me looking like a raccoon! I&#x27;ve been using this daily for roughly a month now and have not had ANY issues with flaking, smearing, smudges, etc. I absolutely love this mascara!  Updated 12/01/16: Been using this mascara ever since I originally ordered it. I still love it!</li>
            <li> I like this mascara because it does not smear. That is its best quality, and worth buying for that reason plus it&#x27;s vegan--otherwise, it does not do anything regarding making lashes look longer or bigger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky with mascara and this is my current favorite. I&#x27;ve bought several times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for a while now and I absolutely love it. I have a lot of trouble with mascara leaving dark smudges under my lower lids and this mascara is one of the only ones I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t do that. It gives me long lashes without looking fake and it lasts all day. Not to mention I love the name!</li>
            <li> I had used the same high end product for years before trying Elizabeth Mott mascara. I am a convert. I love the way it goes on, stays on, and how easily it is removed. And it looks so natural, not clumpy at all!</li>
            <li> This is excellent mascara.  It does not clump or flake and the color is not harsh.  It exceeded my expectations!!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used. It performs perfectly and I&#x27;ll never buy anything else.</li>
            <li> Received it first as a free sample from a magazine and I was hooked! Looked all over to find it in stores but ordered via Amazon. Great product, creates long thick lashes with no clumping.  I would like a straight wand instead of it being at an angle but other than that... it&#x27;s wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. It makes my lashes appear thicker and longer. But it does take about 4 coats to get the desired effect. Holds up well to crying. No runs or clumps. At the end of the day, it washes off easily with soap and water. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like how full it makes my lashes look but you must work quickly or it gets clumpy.  When it&#x27;s time to take it off you can actually see all of the &amp;#34;fibers&amp;#34; coming off of your lashes.  All in all a decent purchase.</li>
            <li> This mascara for me was just okay but my lashes are in part to blame.  Im 8 months pregnant and my lashes unlike my hair didnt grow the way I expected and my short nubby lashes turned curly at the ends naturally all of a sudden.  I got this mascara with intentions of it thickening and making my lashes faux like.  Being an ex makeup artist, I will tell you this formula to me is up there with the top brands at sephora and did give my lashes volume and like promised didnt budge until i applied warm water and it came off like little tubes, very much like the japanese mascaras out there.  So A plus for the long wear.  As for the brush, even with my skills, I kept getting the mascara on my eyelid so I needed a q-tip for cleanups which if i got while wet was super easy.  Im gonna keep trying to use the mascara after birth and maybe I will like it more!!!! Definitely worth a try!!!</li>
            <li> I was eager to try this after I read all the reviews. It arrived very quickly but the tube was relatively dry after I opened it. I pumped it several times but the brush and wand were dry. I was hoping for a replacement but they only offer refund.</li>
            <li> Ordered one of these awhile back and fell in love as it did what it promised. I went back recently and ordered 2 more because the price had dropped $5.00 each. Problem is that the 2 I got on sale were clumpy and dried my lashes on contact so they were pretty much useless. I was very unhappy with this recent purchase as I wasted $30.00 for what seemed to be old mascaras. Probably won&#x27;t be ordering this anymore!</li>
            <li> LOVE!!!  Adds volume and definition to my eyelashes and stays put all day long.  Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I actually stopped wearing eye shadow because this mascara makes my lashes look full and very long.  It is really hard to get off though.  I use coconut oil but I always see flakes around my eyes in the morning when I wake up.</li>
            <li> Goes on without clumping, doesn&#x27;t flake or run, easy to remove.  I love it!</li>
            <li> One of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I purchased this mascara because it received good reviews...yep, it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> Great mascara!  Even though it isn&#x27;t waterproof it still works great with my contact lenses.  Stays on nicely and looks great throughout the day.  I bought some for my daughter-in-law too for her birthday!</li>
            <li> The mascara is good: very high quality, looks good on my lashes etc.&lt;br /&gt;But it is not perfect as the rave reviews suggested to me. Not even great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- You can tell it is high quality&lt;br /&gt;- Hypoallergenic (for me; I am allergic to several other brands)&lt;br /&gt;- Looks volumizing and length-extending on eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Can look clumpy&lt;br /&gt;- Hard to get off (Since I am allergic to a lot of eye products I can&#x27;t use harsh chemicals; but the product I use from Payot was able to take off other mascaras easily, but not BiG unless I drown my eyes in it); I often wake up with mascara smudges even though I took it off the night before&lt;br /&gt;- Smudges if you apply twice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the $25? Probably not. My previous Almay mascara was not as length-extending but it also didn&#x27;t smudge, came off easily and cost $10 max.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.  I used.to wear L&#x27;oreal Voluminous when I heard they test on bunnies.  After research I found this &amp;#34;BIG&amp;#34; cruelty free.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Stays on all day, no clumping, no little black specks under my eyes at 10pm!  One coat does the trick for most days and the max I&#x27;ve ever needed to apply for a night out is two.  Hands down the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I expected a lot more for a high priced mascara but it&#x27;s not even as good as a $7 drug store one.&lt;br /&gt;I recently stopped using waterproof mascara because the process of removing it with makeup remover has taken its toll on my lashes so I needed something that could be easily removed. I knew that meant my lashes would be uncurled with washable mascara. &amp;#34;It&#x27;s so big&amp;#34; not only uncurls it but I couldn&#x27;t wash it off with just soap and water and had to use makeup remover. There is no volume either. It clumps my lashes together so it actually looks like I have less lashes than I do. What a huge disappointment! I did find a good one that I like by Lancôme for a few dollars more. But don&#x27;t waste your money on this one. Cover Girl and Loreal make much better ones for 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li> Caused an allergic reaction on my eyes! Could not get the product off fast enough.</li>
            <li> Really wanted to like it. First use...seemed to lengthen. After that, did very little. It dried quickly with very little product adhering to lash. No thickening of lashes noted. Did not smear or clump, but have had drugstore mascara do more for much less cost. Would have returned, but threw out packaging and paperwork after first use. Disappointed and wished it worked for me. Sally</li>
            <li> This is my second order of So Big. My first tube did not clump. This one does clump and takes awhile to dry and makes my eyes itch.</li>
            <li> I got the sample through their website and fell in love! I have short, thin lashes and this mascara really helps give them volume and some length. I absolutely adore the brush applicator! Although it&#x27;s a bit pricey for a mascara, I truly believe it is worth it. I have purchased a full size already!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! I paid more for the Department Store brand I used to buy!&lt;br /&gt;This is better!</li>
            <li> WHAT a tremendous disappointment this Mascara was.  Let me start by saying AMAZON makes you leave a star, or I would not even consider a 1/4 of a star for this product.  The VERY BIG BRUSH that the ad raves about is the size of a regular department store mascara brush, the only thing BIG about this product is it&#x27;s PRICE!!  My lashes look NO different with this $20.00 mascara than they do with a $7.00 Rimmel Mascara purchased at a dept. store there is NO VOLUMIZING at all.  The HYPE over this product is just that, HYPE.  I would return it, but it&#x27;s not worth the drama of dealing with a AMAZON return so I have decided to write the $20.00 off as money wasted.&lt;br /&gt;  My advice, continue using what you currently have for Mascara, you will be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Still doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes even after keeping the eye lash curler on for over 15 sec. My lashes still straighten out flat, but very good at keeping the smudges off my eyes - no raccoon eyes with this mascara!</li>
            <li> Have used mascara for years--cheap and expensive.  This So Big mascara is so far the best I have used and not at a HUGE price.  Very pleased with this product as it is easy to apply and stays applied throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seriously have tried 20 different mascaras ranging from cheap to expensive and I have to say this is the BEST! I&#x27;d recommend for all my family and friends. Awesome product, awesome company.</li>
            <li> If you want big lashes do not get this. I washed out off right after I put it on. I only ordered it because of the good reviews and it sucks so bad it makes me think the reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this mascara faithfully for over a year. Prior to Elizabeth Mott, I was using Buxom mascara from Sephora. During a busy period of my life, I decided to order online because I didn&#x27;t have time to trek downtown to buy make-up. I will never go back. When I first started using this product, people asked if I had false lashes on. It&#x27;s amazing. It goes on without getting clumpy, and its easy to remove. I can wash it off in the shower and it doesn&#x27;t take my eyelashes out like drugstore mascaras do. I highly recommend this product! It works well for about 8 weeks and I usually stretch it out to 12. I buy a new one every 12 weeks or so. Its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Mascara is great. The brush has an interesting shape, so you never apply more product than necessary to eyelashes. It stays all day, and it doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge. I work in a high pace environment and my make-up looks flawless even after 12 hours shift.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money</li>
            <li> I have been buying various mascaras for years, hunting for the perfect all-in-one that would thicken, curl and lengthen all without clumps. This mascara is perfect. It does everything you&#x27;d ever want in a mascara, and a bonus is that it stays put for a long time! If I go to bed with it on, I wake up and still have perfectly mascara&#x27;d lashes. My hunt for the ONE is over. I don&#x27;t like buying the same products twice in a row, but I can&#x27;t imagine buying any other mascara after trying this. Will definitely buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many since Avon discontinued my favorite, and this one is without a doubt the best.  My lashes are skimpy, but this actually makes them look long and like I have way more than I do. Those with oily skin may hesitate to order as the word \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; is not in the name, but don&#x27;t worry- you will be very pleased as it doesn&#x27;t run/smudge at all.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed.  The formula seems thin, doesn&#x27;t thicken my lashes like it claims and I don&#x27;t like the shape of the wand.  Different strokes for different folks I suppose.  Was NOT worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about trying your mascara. But I have to say I was disappointed in it. The shape of the brush make I it clump at the ends of my lashes</li>
            <li> I really like the way it seperates all lmy lashes and is never &#x27;cakey&#x27;. Bravo! I will be restocking later. :)</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on a makeup blogger&#x27;s post. Honestly it did nothing more than any standard drug store mascara.  If anything it is more difficult to remove. Would not Recommend</li>
            <li> LOVE💜💜💜💜 does not flake.  Comes off easy.  Has a rubber like feel, it&#x27;s flexible.  I can even sleep with it on and not wake up with black smeary eyes.  I am definitely a return customer!</li>
            <li> I wish I could leave positive feedback but this mascara was very dried out and was not easy to apply. It really did nothing for my lashes. I was hopeful but I guess I&#x27;m back to Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look double in size. Does a decent job of separating lashes, but I usually still use a lash comb to separate even more. The only part that is aggravating is because it&#x27;s gel, I always have a clump of excess mascara at the tip of the brush every time I pull it out of the tube. First few times I either got mascara on myself, or the clump fell and I wasted some of the pricey product. But a little practice of carefully pulling the wand out and twisting the brush has diminished that issue. Have compared it to a few other lash extending mascaras, and this one looks the most natural while still giving a big pop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mascara in my wish list for a while now. Amazon users rated it highly and so did Makeup Alley. I finally bit the bullet and I bought it. It got here pretty fast and I was so excited to try it on. I tried it on and it didn&#x27;t seem to change my lashes much but I was thinking I probably didn&#x27;t apply it properly so I&#x27;ll do it the next day when I&#x27;m getting ready for work. So I did...and no real change. I tried again on the second day with multiple coats and curling my lashes and it clumped them up but didn&#x27;t really voluminize or lengthen my lashes. Both times were with primer on as well. It doesn&#x27;t smudge and it was pretty easy to wash off but that&#x27;s really it. I&#x27;m really disappointed and I feel gypped. I&#x27;d like to return it. It was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t get what the hype is all about and wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money. First of all, it absolutely does not go on evenly. As far as lengthening goes, it makes the tips looked ragged; as if someone came after my lashes with a chainsaw. I do have fine lashes, so thickening without clumping is hard to find and this mascara is probably one of the worst I have tried. I&#x27;m bringing the meaning of spider-eyes a whole new meaning with a only a few applications. I work 9-7 everyday and sit at a desk, so I never really have an issue with flakiness, since my day is pretty sedentary, but surprise-surprise... flakes. Flakes in my eyes, flakes under my eyes. Lastly, good luck taking it off. My eyelashes are so brittle after applying this stuff, I have to stand under a shower head with the water running in order to soften them enough, so I can remove the mascara without removing or breaking my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got the one messed up tube or maybe my eyelashes are different than everyone else&#x27;s - ??? Doubt it. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I am on my second tube of the It&#x27;s So BIG Volumizing Mascara, and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. It stays on when I want it to stay. It washes easily with soap and warm water. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes in the slightest and it makes my lashes look fabulous. You can&#x27;t beat it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 06/23/15&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my third tube now and this stuff is fantastic. Sometimes I run or circuit train after work. I only wear mascara during the day - no liner or coverup, and I rarely take the time to wash my mascara off before I workout. No matter how sweaty I get, as long as I don&#x27;t rub my eyes hard, this stuff won&#x27;t budge and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all. I will continue ordering this mascara as long as it available. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara! It doesn&#x27;t clump. It doesn&#x27;t feather. It lasts all day &amp; I&#x27;m so glad I discovered it!</li>
            <li> Great mascara....doesnt smudge all day and unlike waterproof mascara it comes off easy w/soap. A must buy!</li>
            <li> Fantastic mascara!  The only brand I buy now as it is the best!</li>
            <li> My new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, this was a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews I was surprised at how bad this mascara turned out to be! I have long lashes but they&#x27;re invisible so I wanted something that would give me volume. This mascara barely coated my lashes.I had found much better mascara at drugstores for a lot less money. I would definitely not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara by far!  I don&#x27;t wear much make-up, but I never go without using this mascara.  I have always had fiber mascaras, because I hate panda eyes, but this formula is better than any of the japanese brands I&#x27;ve tried.  I like how I don&#x27;t have to use a heavy-duty eye makeup remover to get it off also.  I have already recommended to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara because of the insanely high reviews and moderate price on Amazon. It was at my door within 48 hours which is awesome, but after trying it on I didn&#x27;t exactly understand why there&#x27;s so many 5 star ratings. The mascara can get very clumpy and it&#x27;s hard to remove, leaving my lashes feeling crispy; however, I do think that the mascara does a great job of lengthening your lashes and the wand is different from many others. I like the product and I use it every day, but this isn&#x27;t the perfect mascara.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved the mascara!  It stays on all day – rain or shine.  I have very fine eyelashes and watery eyes so finding a mascara that stays in place all day has always been a struggle.  This one passes the test and I would highly recommend it.  It doesn’t clump up either :)</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect mascara for what seems like most of my makeup wearing life. I never thought I&#x27;d find it on Amazon! I usually go into Sephora and see what they have to offer. It&#x27;s pretty expensive and so far I had not found the perfect one. I bought this mascara on a whim, and its really great. Doesn&#x27;t clump at all, doesn&#x27;t come off when it rains, but does come off when I wash my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent. Didn&#x27;t thicken my eyelashes but they did look longer. Didn&#x27;t clump which is nice.</li>
            <li> In the past 9 months, I have started wearing mascara again, and it has been mostly horrible. Spend $6-$10 on a tube, use it once or twice and throw away in disgust. Clumps, lumps, smudge, smears and raccoon eyes within an hour or two. But now, I have It&#x27;s So BIG! It has a nice liquidy formula so it lets go of the brush, but clings to your lashes. Dries quickly, so you don&#x27;t start getting smudges right away. It isn&#x27;t perfect - I started getting smears under my eyese by mid-afternoon, but that was after about 6 hours, not 1 or 2 like the previous products. It&#x27;s a keeper and I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> My wife demands this product only! Must be good!</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.  Makes my lashes look BIG and NO FLAKES!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> As a professional salsa dancer, it&#x27;s been impossible for me to find mascara that doesn&#x27;t sweat off, smear, or flake. I&#x27;ve tried Revlon, Maybelline, Este Lauder, Bare Minerals, and Benefit. No luck. All were runners. Then I found this stuff. Holy wow. I put about 1.5 coats on, and my lashes are about half an inch long, and full without any clumpiness. And to top it off, not only does it make my eyes pop, but it stays throughout an 8 hour session of hot and sweaty salsa. Not a single flake to be found. And it just washes right off. I&#x27;ll never use anything else ever again.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. No clumping and separates lashes. Provides length and volume. I have super fine lashes and has tried many mascaras. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> BUY IT! It&#x27;s better than Maybelline in the pink tube (costs more, too).</li>
            <li> Awesome mascara! The best I have tried.  My lashes are long and thick. It is also easy to remove and does not burn my eyes. Got 2 more for my sisters!</li>
            <li> love it ...never knew my eyelashes could get so long and thick!!! easy to wash off and stays put too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t go wrong really!!!</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I was excited to try this mascara.  It&#x27;s okay, but not my favorite.  I like that the mascara is easy to remove, but it clumps, and I&#x27;m not crazy about the application brush.  I&#x27;m sticking to Benefit&#x27;s &amp;#34;They&#x27;re Real!&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s a little more expensive, and difficult to remove, but creates prettier lashes.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara based on the reviews and I am maybe slightly disappointed. It&#x27;s not the mascara itself at all. I wore it yesterday (after using my new Eyelash Curler - INSTA-CURLER by FUCHSIA Line, which is the bomb-diggity) and the mascara itself is great. I didn&#x27;t even wash it off before bed (I know! I know.) and it didn&#x27;t really run or flake off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had a different brush. I don&#x27;t like the bristles or its shape. Granted, I have long eyelashes and a lot of them so I didn&#x27;t feel like the brush &amp;#34;combed through&amp;#34; my eyelashes as I would have liked them to. A brush that is more shaped like Cover Girl - Lash Exact would be better for me.</li>
            <li> Having been diagnosed this past summer with severe iron deficiency,I lost a good bit of my eyelashes.I just recently completed iron infusions,and noticed my eyelashes stopped falling out.I have been on a quest to find a good lengthening mascara,that does not flake,or pull out even MORE of my eyelashes.I found the perfect mascara in Elizabeth  Mott&#x27;s Volumizing Mascara.Even though I do not have an abundance of lashes,the ones I do have are thick looking and long when using this mascara.You sometimes do not appreciate what you have,until it is gone.Thanks to this amazing mascara,I have my femininity back!</li>
            <li> stays on you without smearing! water resistant! pulls eyelashes up and the best ever! im so happy with it!</li>
            <li> Funny - received a free sample in a People Magazine VIP reward.  I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO raccoon eye with this mascara. None. Zip. Zero. It makes my skinny non-existent lashes and really makes them pop!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  It beautifully separates &amp; lengthens your lashes, and also thickens to your desire, depending on how many coats you apply.  It also washes off more easily than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  A terrific product.</li>
            <li> Not the worst mascara I&#x27;ve used but certainly not a great as I&#x27;d expected base don the reviews. Doesn&#x27;t separate my lashes and gets a little clumpy when applying a second coat.Eh, I&#x27;ll use it but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have short eye lashes and this mascara gives my lashes some length. I love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife since her make up bag was lost.....I made the right choice and she&#x27;s extremely happy with it, price was great and delivery was fast as well.</li>
            <li> The reviews are legit - this stuff is the best. It goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t clump. Your lashes really do get noticeably bigger with repeated applications, although for me, one application is plenty for daily use. But the most amazing thing to me is the staying power. At night I wash my face with an awesome cleanser that leaves not a trace of makeup. Not a trace, except for my perfectly intact mascara. It takes a gentle rub with an eye makeup remover to take it off. Even though it&#x27;s not billed as a waterproof mascara, I&#x27;ve totally been swimming in it with nary a smudge. If they discontinue this makeup, I&#x27;ll curl up in a ball and cry.</li>
            <li> I have spent more than 30 years and no telling how much money seeking my HG mascara and have finally found it! This excellent mascara makes my eyelashes thick, long and they stay curled. Even better, no flaking or raccoon eyes. It  absolutely rocks my world! Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Boy did I need this stuff!  I love it, now I actually look like I have eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I tried this mascara after reading about it in a magazine.  It&#x27;s ok..not a &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; but decent.  I really haven&#x27;t found anything that beats Lancome.  It&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s good stuff.  I probably won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Works...does stay on for length of time and doesn&#x27;t smear during the day...doesn&#x27;t work well w/lash primer as it tends to clump on lash...over-all, satisfied.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever used hands down!!! I have been looking for a great product like this for a long time. I will certainly continue to use this mascara for a long time!!!</li>
            <li> super soft lashes. buildable too and doesn&#x27;t clump!! i am in love. i will be ordering this. finally found an HG mascara.  &amp;#60;3 !</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It looks great, doesn&#x27;t clump, and doesn&#x27;t flake off under my eye.  Sometimes after a particularly long day I notice some wear or dark circles but that could also be from eyeliner, and I haven&#x27;t found makeup yet that doesn&#x27;t do that at least a little if you&#x27;re outside in the elements all day.  For the most part though it stays on nicely, and I&#x27;m pretty picky about mascara.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as volumizing as I hoped, but it really does define, and it&#x27;s smudge proof. In terms of volume nothing beats Dior Show, but that smudges so easily I always have raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li> when I first got this mascara, it was in a box from people magazine, I absolutely loved the product and continue to buy it on Amazon. At some point the formula must&#x27;ve change because the product is not as good as it was, I still like it but I don&#x27;t love it like I did.</li>
            <li> Great mascara. It takes a few applications, but it does create really long, soft and thick lashes. And it seems to have real staying power.</li>
            <li> No clumping! Yay! Goes on easily and leaves lashes looking long and sleek.</li>
            <li> It was old, dry and I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> It is the best!!!!!!!!! Worth to try!</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> Not impressed for the price. Gave me spidery eyes. I&#x27;ve used cover girl mascara that was better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and really like it! The way the brush is shaped really reaches more of my lashes as I&#x27;m applying the mascara. So far it&#x27;s not clumping and hasn&#x27;t gotten dry, which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> works well but I don&#x27;t think it lives up to the price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money .. I was so disappointed when I used this mascara .. The reviews tricked me .. Your better off with a $7 mascara from a drugstore</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I&#x27;ve been searching for a plumping mascara that goes on easily for years. I saw this one recommended and tried it. I&#x27;m on my second tube now. It makes my unimpressive lashes really stand out. I can apply multiple coats without any clumping. It comes off easily too. This will definitely be my go-to mascara for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mascara certainly worth trying if you&#x27;re at all interested. I didn&#x27;t want to pay what I view as a &#x27;hefty&#x27; price tag for a tube of mascara so I ordered the sample size which is a decent size. I just had to pay S&amp;H which was something like $2.75 for me. I&#x27;ve been using it about a week and a half and there&#x27;s plenty to last a few more weeks (I apply it once, daily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let me start by explaining my type of lashes and what I look for in a mascara. I have long, straight lashes that are of standard thickness (if I can say such a thing. Basically, they&#x27;re not thick but they&#x27;re not thin... just normal). And since my lashes are already long, when looking for a mascara I focus on volume and a nice consistency that is not too wet. I find wet mascaras tend to make more of a mess when applying and I can&#x27;t stand having to clean up around my eyes after applying; so, I suppose I like a thick, sturdy formula-- non-runny. Also, so far I don&#x27;t believe any mascara has the true ability to curl lashes--at least mine, so that value is never a focus. Eyelash curler is the only sure way I&#x27;ll get any curl.  SO, basically what I look for in a mascara is its capacity to add volume to my lashes and not make a mess! And this mascara has proven a winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To illustrate it&#x27;s ultimate test, I applied a regular amount one early morning as I was preparing to spend the day snowboarding. Now granted I was wearing goggles, there were plenty of times I had the goggles lifted off my face and was subject to the wintery conditions of the slopes. About half-way through the day or so I stopped to have lunch and while in the restroom inspecting my makeup, I noticed the mascara had not smeared, smudged, or flaked. Any definition they may have had from my curler was done seeing as how facial steam in my goggles straightened them but the volume on the lashes themselves was as they were when first applied. By the end of the day I was extremely exhausted, realized my car was stuckin some snow, realized further that tow trucks were not willing to truck out to my location to help me, cried several tears in overwhelming exhaustion and frustration, and when I went to clean up my face in the restroom, was at least satisfied that my mascara did not run down my face or smear, but simply sat in small clumps under my eyes similar to how a tubing mascara comes off, and I very easily wiped it away with a tissue, still not smearing or smudging. I very much like a mascara that can hold up to watery eyes and a few tears and this did it. And considering it came off in a tasteful manner when I was really crying and rubbing my eyes, this passed the test.  (and btw, I did manage to get a tow truck to come out. But they had to come from over an hour away and it cost $300!!! Crazy. Ugh.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, thumbs up for this mascara. It adds a tasteful amount of volume, layer-able for more if you&#x27;re headed for a night out, stays put, and doesn&#x27;t make a mess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I think $20 is a little high and like I said, the volume is tasteful and buildable, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it added some crazy amount of volume-----BUT, considering all I went through with it, I&#x27;ll probably pay it for the full tube when my sample runs out ;)</li>
            <li> For someone with ultra blonde eye lashes this is a great mascara! Makes my eyelashes long and full. I am really enjoying it so far!</li>
            <li> I adore this mascara. It lasts all day without under eye smudges. It is mostly lengthening, but if you put on a few coats it becomes much more voluminous, too. I also recommend doing some serious lash-curling prior to putting the coats on. I&#x27;m going to stick with this mascara for awhile now.</li>
            <li> For the last few weeks, I&#x27;ve tested the resolve of this mascara by flying down the ski slopes at 35-45 miles per hour. Although the goggles I wear are only the first defense against the high ninja winds, and my eyes do nothing but cry tears of pain (wusses), leaving the mascara as the final line of defense from causing children to run screaming in terror. There were no crying babies - no forest animals ran for the hills. This mascara was stoic and never faltered. May as well put one of those furry hats on my eyelashes and call it a guard at the national gates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I cried my face off thanks to two aggressive onions I took down in battle. The mascara did nothing - no consoling words, hugs or encouragement. I will continue to put myself in harms way knowing this mascara will defend my honor... or at least my self worth.</li>
            <li> I am 62 and I finally found a mascara that stays on and DOES NOT SMUDGE!  This is really a great product.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply and remove!  Thanks for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve used in some time.  Stays on all day, no flaking or smudging.  Goes on smooth and has lasted about 1.5 months before it started to dry out in the tube a bit.  My new favorite!</li>
            <li> The product is OK, it is not the best. it dries out very quickly and it is difficult to reapply. I would not buy it again</li>
            <li> AMAZING. &amp; I thought the Too Faced Better Than Sex mascara from Sephora was the best. I was wrong! This has to be one of the most perfect mascara ever. It easily adds volume and length to your curls, although not to an extreme extent. I think the best thing about this for me is that you can VERY easily remove it with makeup. I used to use the cheap Maybelline mascaras which kept me content for a while, but whenever I try to remove it with makeup wipes, it was NOT an easy job. I felt like I had to scrub harshly against my eyes and the delicate skin around it. But with this mascara, I only had to wipe with minor pressure and BAM it&#x27;s gone. The only downside is that it can indeed cluster your eyelashes together, but I still love it!</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever.  I am a convert for life.</li>
            <li> I first recieved this product as a sample. After that I was hooked! It is the best mascara I have used and I love my mascaras! I have purchased anywhere from $5-$35 mascara and this beats any of the top brands out there!</li>
            <li> I received this product initially through a premium gift package with a People Magazine subscription.  As someone who has short blond eyelashes that grow downward, this product is a miracle.  After use, a friend asked me if I was wearing false eyelashes.  I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> This product is everything it is advertised to be!  Gives your lashes great length and definition, lasts all day long with NO SMUDGES!  I apply it when getting ready for work each morning at 6am, it looks great all day until I remove it with a facial cleaning cloth at 9pm.  Really good mascara is hard to find, but this product is the perfect mascara!</li>
            <li> Great mascara for the price. Easily applied and no re-application needed. I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  Everything about its performance is superb.  No odor, perfect texture, separates and lengthens lashes beautifully without clumping and stays separated all day.  Doesn&#x27;t smudge or run ever and yet is easy to remove.  Received the first one as a gift from People magazine and was happy to track the second one on Amazon because none of the department stores sell it</li>
            <li> No difference with this pricey one and covergirl. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have never before been compelled to write a review, but here goes. I have struggled with lackluster lashes and mascara migration for over 45 years. I even had eyelash extensions so I could have decent looking lashes. Expensive and not as dramatic as I would have liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara makes my lashes look fantastic and does not smudge! I only recently discovered that waterproof and smudge proof are not one in the same.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I have ever had and it never smudges.  I received it in a People VIP box.  My sister tried it out and loved it so I bought her 2 boxes.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money, and unexpectedly so since I usually don&#x27;t spend much money on mascara. That might change after this success!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara... Is doesn&#x27;t clump your lashes..... And is does not smudge on my face which is great!!!! Thank you I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great mascara, goes on smoothly and does not clump or smear.  Stays on all day and makes lashes look much longer and thicker.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other mascaras through the years and this one is by far the best for volume and  length with no clumping or flaking.  My adult daughter also purchased Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s It&#x27;s So Big Mascara and we both have said to each other about the many compliments we receive whenever we wear it.  We both love Elizabeth Mott&#x27;s It&#x27;s So Big Mascara and it&#x27;s the only mascara we will ever purchase again.  Thank you for such a phenomenal product!</li>
            <li> I have tried every mascara put on this earth, well it feels like I have. I have short, sparse lashes...this mascara has added some volume and length. So far... I like it.</li>
            <li> This is a permanent tenant of my make-up bag. It volumizes the hell out of my lashes without clumping! Gives me natural lashes and stays there all day. I&#x27;ve worn this to 90 minute cardio classes and it still looks beautiful afterwards! It&#x27;s just a product I can rely on time and time again. I&#x27;ve purchased this product TWICE already and I am still super satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the volume this mascara added to my lashes. It&#x27;s not your typical mascara either.  It&#x27;s water resistant (at least it didn&#x27;t smear when I cried) and it cleans up easily with make up remover. It doesn&#x27;t get all &amp;#34;schmeery&amp;#34; when removed, it wipes off completely. I will order again for sure.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the best ever....but certainly very good.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Looks great. No smudge under eyes. Last all day.</li>
