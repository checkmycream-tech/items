            <li>So I turned to my good friend amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I have bought others of this brand and loved it.</li>
            <li>honestly this product resales between 250-300 dollars how can you expect to get a warranty when purchasing this amazing product at 75 percent off!  </li>

            <li>But it came with fast shipping and works wonderful, just like the ones in the mall.</li>
            <li>I practiced trying to get nice curls with the straightener for 2 months</li>

            <li>I have used better straighteners</li>
            <li>I had to pass it more than 4  times</li>
            <li>This straightener is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Recommend anyone who needs a Straightener to buy and guarantee you will love it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a cheap plastic straightener!</li>
            <li>Not only the result is perfect, it gets done in 20 mins as well!</li>
            <li>I bought the original at the Kiosk in the mall and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the flat iron is new !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is an awesome flat iron.  </li>
            <li>And this is the best flat iron ever!!</li>
            <li>The shipping time was pretty good for this item.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m excited to give it a shot!</li>
            <li>It works great and she loves how soft her hair is afterwards.</li>
            <li>It heated up very quickly as well.</li>
            <li>so what I&#x27;m getting at is if you&#x27;re buying this straighten in hopes it will be easy to curl and straighten that might not happen.</li>
            <li>The thing is it&#x27;s advertised as doing both easily.</li>
            <li>I have also seen comments about not being able to receive the manufacturer life time warranty on the product which is true but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still fine and some hair products used in sync makes up for where this PYT lacks.</li>
            <li>Super cute and doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy when I straighten it.</li>
            <li>Then it was $99 and included 5 free styling sessions.</li>
            <li>I heard it is supposed to heat up very quick and get very hot.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I were both excited to get it</li>
            <li>I have an original and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited about the price</li>
            <li>Buying it at this price and getting free Super Saver shipping out to Hawaii was a no brainer.  </li>
            <li>Completely and totally satisfied with PYT!</li>
            <li>and then their special discount of 130 (one time offer</li>
            <li>Works GREAT, just as we expected.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my 14 year old daughter and she was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>By the way, my daughters hair stays straight for 3 days (maybe more</li>
            <li>I had to pay full price to buy it again</li>
            <li>and they can break pretty easily.   </li>
            <li>Luckily, nothing caught fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and maintains the heat while straightening the hair.  </li>
            <li>Has power to get very hot.</li>
            <li>I love how little damage is made to my hair as well, and I love the peacock design!</li>
            <li>I got my PYT Peacock Straightness today &amp;&amp; fell instantly in love with the colors and design, naturally i rushed to the bathroom to test it out</li>
            <li>For the price i paid it&#x27;s deffinately worth it...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these, they completely change the look and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li>and this is what makes it worth to buy because the product is covered</li>
            <li>so distraught thinking I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get another one, but Amazon saved me again and this one is just as effective and has a cute design!</li>
            <li>I will never use a different brand as long as PYT continues to make their irons this good!</li>
            <li>this is by far the best flat iron I have owned, way better than the most expensive irons out there</li>
            <li>how much and are off looking for one to buy for themselves!  </li>
            <li>Its the real deal!</li>
            <li>ON SIDES, BACK AND TOP.</li>
            <li>Sure enough Amazon was again the place to turn to.  </li>
            <li>One of my friends even said after having this product for a year, it still got just as hot and worked just as well.  </li>
            <li>She said it even steamed it got so hot.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even straighten my hair nor does it get that hot.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t believe it is getting that hot.</li>
            <li>She rarely uses it now because she realizes their is a trade off with severe damage to her straight hair if she over uses this tool:/  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>The first PYT that I bought I got at a bridal show for $100</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I can straighten my hair by myself.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend purchasing from this seller.</li>
            <li>My hair would be super straight after that much heat and its not.</li>
            <li>Honestly I love his flat iron</li>
            <li>I got much silkier hair the first maybe 2 or 3 weeks of use which dissipated.</li>
            <li>I have used a flat iron as i styling tool for 6 years and the only one i have found that works as good as this is the CHI</li>
            <li>This straightener is very nice.it status flick on your hair and leaves the hair very smooth for a very long time.</li>
            <li>The one at the mall made my hair shiny and smooth&#x27;sleek and not dry hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>i ordered one at AMAZON the peacock design that she wants...</li>
            <li>I believe this is a knock off not the real deal.</li>
            <li>My hair is think and doesn&#x27;t touch it really.  </li>
            <li>I asked her how much she bought it for</li>
            <li>but that really doesn&#x27;t matter to me</li>
            <li>My daughter had adopted mine as her own for the last several months</li>
            <li>MY HAIR HAS ALWAYS BEEN LONG, STRONG AND THICK.&lt;br /&gt;AFTER</li>
            <li>I was weary about buying something other than a Chi, but so glad I did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it is a unique solid straightener.</li>
            <li>Misuse being the heat is way too high, over-use/abuse of heating tools on hair, failing to use heat protecting sprays with use of heating tools.</li>
            <li>I can straighten my hair much quicker with this tool than with my old one.</li>
            <li>and I just had to buy a new one....</li>
            <li>please beware of knock-offs and know that the product is available with lifetime warranty only from specific dealers</li>
            <li>and it did not disappoint, it really does work to make your hair wavy, curly or straight and left my hair feeling very soft</li>
            <li>I got it due to after two years, my Solia straightener broke, and I heard this product was much better for not only straightening but curling your hair.  </li>
            <li>I just bought this exact flat iron in the mall yesterday for $100</li>
            <li>and it was a lot cheaper with the same design they are selling for a very high price...</li>
            <li>They gave me a beat up box too, it was falling apart and they tape the box with clear tape.</li>
            <li>no burning smell and her hair looks silky and soft..</li>
            <li>He pointed out a 4 year old girl having her hair curled a la Toddlers &amp; Tiaras.</li>
            <li>No issues so far.</li>
            <li>my boyfriend accidental broke my old one that I had for 3 years</li>
            <li>My daughters hair is really curly and we tried to straighten it with my Chi flat iron..</li>
            <li>I am not sure if turning down the heat will affect the damage and the curl hold...but am thinking the high heat is why the curl stays for days with fine straight hair...</li>
            <li>This one never got as hot as the other ones I bought.</li>
            <li>/&gt;TLDR- Average straightener with a pretty design.</li>
            <li>This one dries my hair just like my old flat iron with GHD.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair already but this makes it soft, curly, or crimped and only takes a few min.</li>
            <li>My husband dropped my first pair a few times and broke the plates.</li>
            <li>but once you open the packaging, which was damaged and obviously recycled, the flat iron plates were dull and it was made from  cheap materials.</li>

            <li> MY HAIR HAS ALWAYS BEEN LONG, STRONG AND THICK.&lt;br /&gt;AFTER</li>
            <li> I was weary about buying something other than a Chi, but so glad I did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it is a unique solid straightener.</li>
            <li> Misuse being the heat is way too high, over-use/abuse of heating tools on hair, failing to use heat protecting sprays with use of heating tools.</li>
            <li> I can straighten my hair much quicker with this tool than with my old one.</li>
            <li> and I just had to buy a new one....</li>
            <li> please beware of knock-offs and know that the product is available with lifetime warranty only from specific dealers</li>
            <li> and it did not disappoint, it really does work to make your hair wavy, curly or straight and left my hair feeling very soft</li>
            <li> I got it due to after two years, my Solia straightener broke, and I heard this product was much better for not only straightening but curling your hair.  </li>
            <li> I just bought this exact flat iron in the mall yesterday for $100</li>
            <li> and it was a lot cheaper with the same design they are selling for a very high price...</li>
            <li> They gave me a beat up box too, it was falling apart and they tape the box with clear tape.</li>
            <li> no burning smell and her hair looks silky and soft..</li>
            <li> He pointed out a 4 year old girl having her hair curled a la Toddlers &amp; Tiaras.</li>
            <li> No issues so far.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend accidental broke my old one that I had for 3 years</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is really curly and we tried to straighten it with my Chi flat iron..</li>
            <li> I am not sure if turning down the heat will affect the damage and the curl hold...but am thinking the high heat is why the curl stays for days with fine straight hair...</li>
            <li> This one never got as hot as the other ones I bought.</li>
            <li> /&gt;TLDR- Average straightener with a pretty design.</li>
            <li> This one dries my hair just like my old flat iron with GHD.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair already but this makes it soft, curly, or crimped and only takes a few min.</li>
            <li> My husband dropped my first pair a few times and broke the plates.</li>
            <li> but once you open the packaging, which was damaged and obviously recycled, the flat iron plates were dull and it was made from  cheap materials.</li>
            <li> This is my second flat iron from PYT.</li>
            <li> Note that I bought 2ea flat irons.</li>
            <li> USING THE FLAT IRON FOR 6 MONTHS</li>
            <li> we went to the mall and saw this kiosk with PYT Flat Iron Products...</li>
            <li> She would rather stick with her cheapo flat iron than use this one.</li>
            <li> I whipped out the iPad, found the flat iron on Amazon for $36 shipped to my door.  </li>
            <li> This gets it Marcia Brady flat and it lasts for days.  </li>
            <li> so my hair could be flat</li>
            <li> As for the flat iron itself, I haven&#x27;t gotten the opportunity to try it yet</li>
            <li> it last me a long time!</li>
            <li> I ordered this flat iron on Wednesday and received it by Friday morning!</li>
            <li> She initially wanted the purple leopard print, but was stoked to get the limited edition Peacock.</li>
            <li> I have long thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the plates of the iron are sort of sticky, but only to each other.</li>
            <li> (seeing as I&#x27;m waiting for my hair to dry)</li>
            <li> it did not work at all, LOOSE WIRE</li>
            <li> you will also loose the staying power of the curl.</li>
            <li> Never going to the salon for a blow dry again!</li>
            <li> Same results, half the price.</li>
            <li> I already being a frequent amazon shopper, am sooooooo mad at myself for not looking on here first.</li>
            <li> I would chose the pink keratin hair straightener over this.  </li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS SOFT ,THIN AND SHORT.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on this flat iron.</li>
            <li> The downside is the heat level which is extreme ruined my daughters hair within a month or so</li>
            <li> the other straighener</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH YOUR TIME</li>
            <li> however they are often uneven and not very flattering in my experience.</li>
            <li> ISSUE: It does not automatically shut down after non-use.</li>
            <li> The salesperson straighten her hair in less then 20 minutes...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through like 5 flat irons in the past year because I&#x27;m never satisfied.</li>
            <li> My little sister had one of these used on her in the mall.</li>
            <li> At least not as expected.</li>
            <li> The seller gave her a coupon to knock the price down from some ridiculous number to $130.  </li>
            <li> , i was skeptical at first, worried it might be a fake.</li>
            <li> Very messy.</li>
            <li> I have seen some negative comments on here about the PYT straightener</li>
            <li> It has to be at least 150 euro.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m very disappointed and will be sending it back and spending the extra money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Only bad thing is that theres no warranty</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not fair for me to compair this to that.</li>
            <li> :((( at least it is a quality flat iron and knocks CHI wayyyyy out of the park.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you have thick hair!</li>
            <li> We have very thick, wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the product at all.  </li>
            <li> I had it was beyond pencil thin and stayed that way for days.  </li>
            <li> expensive</li>
            <li> I randomly decided to look up the straightener online</li>
            <li> which is a bad thing to do.</li>
            <li> BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT!</li>
            <li> I actually hate this product,</li>
            <li> VERY BAD</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed never going to get it again!</li>
            <li> Even coming with the holder that price was insane.  </li>
            <li> but the price they quoted was outrageous..</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> PYT Ceramic Styling Tool:&lt;br /&gt;This product is way below my expectations. How come this one doesn&#x27;t work well like the one that I tried at the mall? The one at the mall made my hair shiny and smooth&#x27;sleek and not dry hair. This one dries my hair just like my old flat iron with GHD. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s 50 dollars? How can I do with this? Please explain to me why the product is different with the one at the mall (They are exaclt the same). They gave me a beat up box too, it was falling apart and they tape the box with clear tape. Very messy. I don&#x27;t think the flat iron is new !!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to return it back. Note that I bought 2ea flat irons. One for myself and one for my sister. Please help. Thanks. Holly</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my straightener. Anyone who uses it always ask where I got it, how much and are off looking for one to buy for themselves!  Its the real deal! Love that I can curl my hair with it too! Good quality, great look!</li>
            <li> DON&amp;#34;T USE THESE TOOLS FOR HAIR STRAITHING. CAUSED SEVERE DAMAGE TO MY SHOULDER LENGTH HAIR. NOW I HAVE BALDING AND 1 INCH HAIR ALL OVER MY HEAD. VERY BAD ON SIDES, BACK AND TOP. MY HAIR HAS ALWAYS BEEN LONG, STRONG AND THICK.&lt;br /&gt;AFTER USING THE FLAT IRON FOR 6 MONTHS MY HAIR IS SOFT ,THIN AND SHORT.  HAVE TO SEE A DERMATOLOGIST NOW.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and cheap!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has wanted this ever since she saw it at a kiosk in the mall.  The seller gave her a coupon to knock the price down from some ridiculous number to $130.  She kept talking about it for some time so I decided to look for it online cheaper.  Sure enough Amazon was again the place to turn to.  Buying it at this price and getting free Super Saver shipping out to Hawaii was a no brainer.  She has said nothing but good things about this straigtener.  Hopefully this will last, bought a different brand straightener that used water to create steam and it only lasted a couple months before it started leaking.  All in all, this was excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> I got my PYT Peacock Straightness today &amp;&amp; fell instantly in love with the colors and design, naturally i rushed to the bathroom to test it out and it did not disappoint, it really does work to make your hair wavy, curly or straight and left my hair feeling very soft, it did not tug or pull on my hair or leave split ends and actually made it shinier to. It heated up very quickly as well. I have seen some negative comments on here about the PYT straightener and i honestly can&#x27;t see why you are complaining. I have used a flat iron as i styling tool for 6 years and the only one i have found that works as good as this is the CHI For over 200 dollars. I have also seen comments about not being able to receive the manufacturer life time warranty on the product which is true but honestly this product resales between 250-300 dollars how can you expect to get a warranty when purchasing this amazing product at 75 percent off!  All in all great product i am very satisfied. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Great product very high quality at a fraction of the cost I would have paid via a retailer.</li>
            <li> Ordered it two times from here...1st and 2nd IT had the same problem, the product was defective it did not work at all, LOOSE WIRE AND DID NOT HEAT UP. Very disappointed never going to get it again! I had to pay extra money to pay for shipping. BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT! NOT WORTH YOUR TIME AT ALL.</li>
            <li> This product does not work well at all.  I got it due to after two years, my Solia straightener broke, and I heard this product was much better for not only straightening but curling your hair.  I heard it is supposed to heat up very quick and get very hot.  One of my friends even said after having this product for a year, it still got just as hot and worked just as well.  She said it even steamed it got so hot.  I don&#x27;t know whether to judge this product on the actual product or the seller.  I feel as though this product may have even be used! Gross!  I&#x27;m not happy with the product at all.  It doesn&#x27;t even straighten my hair nor does it get that hot.  I have yet to try to use this product as a curler.  Very disappointed.  DEFINITELY would recommend SOLIA straighteners!</li>
            <li> Great styling tool and perfect for curly, frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 14 year old daughter and she was thrilled.  In the malls, they were priced at over $100.00.  Even coming with the holder that price was insane.  Great product, great price, great service!</li>
            <li> The shipping time was pretty good for this item. There are some flaws in the peacock pattern, but I don&#x27;t mind that considering I paid $50 here instead of $300 on PYT&#x27;s website. Also, the plates of the iron are sort of sticky, but only to each other.</li>
            <li> Maybe for white pple hair but takes a lot longer to straighten if you have ethnic hair like mine expensive</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is really curly and we tried to straighten it with my Chi flat iron..it did not work that good..we went to the mall and saw this kiosk with PYT Flat Iron Products...I told my daughter that if this one do the job we will purchase it...The salesperson straighten her hair in less then 20 minutes...no burning smell and her hair looks silky and soft.. but the price they quoted was outrageous..it went from 250..230...and then their special discount of 130 (one time offer only)..well I told her i will think about it and when I went shopping i checked the prices Amazon.com and it was a lot cheaper with the same design they are selling for a very high price... By the way, my daughters hair stays straight for 3 days (maybe more but she needs to wash her hair)...She loves it and she asks me to buy her one...so to surprise her today..i ordered one at AMAZON the peacock design that she wants...</li>
            <li> It shows 450 degrees on the iron but I don&#x27;t believe it is getting that hot. My hair would be super straight after that much heat and its not. I believe this is a knock off not the real deal. The box looked beat up inside and it came with Spanish instructions. My daughter and I were both excited to get it and even she doesn&#x27;t want to use it. She would rather stick with her cheapo flat iron than use this one. So I&#x27;m very disappointed and will be sending it back and spending the extra money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through like 5 flat irons in the past year because I&#x27;m never satisfied. Completely and totally satisfied with PYT!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I were ambushed at a mall kiosk by an overly aggressive, male PYT accessory salesman. It was like he was selling used cars or mattresses.  The price started at $200. Then it dropped to $150. Then it was $99 and included 5 free styling sessions. At the mall. We do not travel to the mall to have our hair styled. He pointed out a 4 year old girl having her hair curled a la Toddlers &amp; Tiaras. I am 46, not 4.  He then came up with his magical employee discount he said he could give us just that one time. I whipped out the iPad, found the flat iron on Amazon for $36 shipped to my door.  He stammered that it would not be covered by the super-valuable warrantee.  In my 35 years of hair product ownership, I have never had a curling iron repaired.  And Amazon is beyond reproach in Customer Service should it have arrived damaged.  This is an awesome flat iron.  We have very thick, wavy/curly hair. This gets it Marcia Brady flat and it lasts for days.  Buy it here. I&#x27;d rather buy magazine subscriptions from a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness at my back door than deal with the mall ambush tactics.</li>
            <li> Are you kidding me...for such price! It has to be at least 150 euro. I have an original and it realy makes magics</li>
            <li> I love my straightener! It is so versatile in either straightening or curling my hair. I love how little damage is made to my hair as well, and I love the peacock design!</li>
            <li> Best straightener i have ever owned</li>
            <li> this is by far the best flat iron I have owned, way better than the most expensive irons out there</li>
            <li> I was in the mall and seen these for $165 then I asked the lady to do a deal for me and she said she would give it to me for $99 but then I went on Amazon and found this for 50 bucks I&#x27;m excited about the price but the product is ok..not the best but not bad either.. I have used better straighteners I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t buy it for $165! For the price i paid it&#x27;s deffinately worth it...I&#x27;m just use to a $200 straightner so it&#x27;s not fair for me to compair this to that. Overall it&#x27;s a nice straightner and great color choices!</li>
            <li> This is just like the one we tried in the mall for much more $$$ and works great.  The downside is the heat level which is extreme ruined my daughters hair within a month or so and we had to cut off a couple inches of damage from all the brittle ends....She rarely uses it now because she realizes their is a trade off with severe damage to her straight hair if she over uses this tool:/  I am not sure if turning down the heat will affect the damage and the curl hold...but am thinking the high heat is why the curl stays for days with fine straight hair...I think if you cut back the heat (and damage from it) you will also loose the staying power of the curl.</li>
            <li> I did not like it..... I had to pass it more than 4  times so my hair could be flat which is a bad thing to do.</li>
            <li> I went to the mall and seen this even got to test it out from one of the booths. They SOLD me.....but they wanted $200 for it. I found it on here for way cheaper. I have straight hair already but this makes it soft, curly, or crimped and only takes a few min. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I already being a frequent amazon shopper, am sooooooo mad at myself for not looking on here first. I just bought this exact flat iron in the mall yesterday for $100 and then I see that its online for wayyy cheaper :((( at least it is a quality flat iron and knocks CHI wayyyyy out of the park. Very good for your hair.</li>
            <li> Super cute and doesn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy when I straighten it. I was weary about buying something other than a Chi, but so glad I did. Same results, half the price.</li>
            <li> I have always bought these from the stands in the mall, but i recently started shopping on Amazon. When mine broke i thought i should check the price out on here for them, i was skeptical at first, worried it might be a fake. But it came with fast shipping and works wonderful, just like the ones in the mall. I would recommend and will always buy from here now. And the peacock print is super adorable!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> it last me a long time! felt the need to finally write a product review.</li>
            <li> I would chose the pink keratin hair straightener over this.  My hair is think and doesn&#x27;t touch it really.  I actually hate this product, the other straighener I had it was beyond pencil thin and stayed that way for days.  Don&#x27;t buy this if you have thick hair!</li>
            <li> This is my second flat iron from PYT. My husband dropped my first pair a few times and broke the plates. I absolutely love these, they completely change the look and feel of my hair. People always ask me what salon I go to after I use these. I will never use a different brand as long as PYT continues to make their irons this good!</li>
            <li> The company will not warranty product that was bought online, and they can break pretty easily.   I ordered PYT from Amazon but it was not an authorized dealer so my product was not covered under any warranty   please beware of knock-offs and know that the product is available with lifetime warranty only from specific dealers and this is what makes it worth to buy because the product is covered No-Matter-What! I had to pay full price to buy it again but now I have nothing to worry about because I have lifetime warranty. And this is the best flat iron ever!!</li>
            <li> This straightener is fantastic! Seen it at conventions for 4 times the cost! It curls as well as staightens! Instant heat!</li>
            <li> This was a great price and one of the best straightener&#x27;s out there. Recommend anyone who needs a Straightener to buy and guarantee you will love it.</li>
            <li> This straightener is very nice.it status flick on your hair and leaves the hair very smooth for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I wanted curls! This didn&#x27;t deliver in that aspect. At least not as expected. I practiced trying to get nice curls with the straightener for 2 months so what I&#x27;m getting at is if you&#x27;re buying this straighten in hopes it will be easy to curl and straighten that might not happen. The thing is it&#x27;s advertised as doing both easily. You can get curls however they are often uneven and not very flattering in my experience. I have long thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is a unique solid straightener. Run of the mill in operation. I felt that in the beginning the plates had a coating. I got much silkier hair the first maybe 2 or 3 weeks of use which dissipated. It&#x27;s still fine and some hair products used in sync makes up for where this PYT lacks. The tool does get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SAFETY ISSUE: It does not automatically shut down after non-use. One day in a rush I found this out when I got home and it was still on. Luckily, nothing caught fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most straighteners will burn hair with misuse. Misuse being the heat is way too high, over-use/abuse of heating tools on hair, failing to use heat protecting sprays with use of heating tools. That said I have not had any issues with my hair getting &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; in anyway with the PYT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR- Average straightener with a pretty design. Has power to get very hot. Does not automatically shut off if not in use after an extended period of time.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and maintains the heat while straightening the hair.  I can straighten my hair much quicker with this tool than with my old one.</li>
            <li> I received this item promptly and all in one piece! Very beautiful and well put together! It isn&#x27;t a cheap plastic straightener! This is the real deal! My sister is just going to FREAK when she sees it! Definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine who is a hair dresser has this straightner and I loved it. It worked so well with my hair. I asked her how much she bought it for and she said $200... Not in my budget. So I turned to my good friend amazon.com. It has worked great for me. No issues so far. Only bummer is there is no warranty!</li>
            <li> It worked great when it worked... 3 months in it broke</li>
            <li> The sides are damaged so every time I turn the PYT my hair gets stock.  I just got it for christmas so I have not yet contacted them to see what their exchange policy is.</li>
            <li> My daughter had adopted mine as her own for the last several months so this one was purchased for her. Works GREAT, just as we expected.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener! The first PYT that I bought I got at a bridal show for $100 so when my husband broke it I was so distraught thinking I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get another one, but Amazon saved me again and this one is just as effective and has a cute design!</li>
            <li> Honestly I love his flat iron my boyfriend accidental broke my old one that I had for 3 years and I just had to buy a new one.... So I got it from amazon for great price</li>
            <li> Has this Pro styler before and it works great.  This is all that much better and price was awesome!</li>
            <li> It saved my life! Never going to the salon for a blow dry again! For the first time in my life I can straighten my hair by myself. Not only the result is perfect, it gets done in 20 mins as well!</li>
            <li> I have bought others of this brand and loved it. This one never got as hot as the other ones I bought.</li>
            <li> This is a knock-off. I bought the original at the Kiosk in the mall and it was amazing. I had it for three years, before I decided to replace it. I though this was a bargain but once you open the packaging, which was damaged and obviously recycled, the flat iron plates were dull and it was made from  cheap materials. Don&#x27;t waste your time on this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I ordered this flat iron on Wednesday and received it by Friday morning! This was the fastest shipping I have ever gotten from an order off of Amazon. I would most definitely recommend purchasing from this seller. As for the flat iron itself, I haven&#x27;t gotten the opportunity to try it yet (seeing as I&#x27;m waiting for my hair to dry) but I&#x27;m excited to give it a shot!</li>
            <li> My little sister had one of these used on her in the mall. They told her it sold for $150 (almost three times what I bought it for on here). She refused to buy it for that price and asked for it for her birthday. She initially wanted the purple leopard print, but was stoked to get the limited edition Peacock. She loves it and was so thrilled for her birthday! It works great and she loves how soft her hair is afterwards.</li>
            <li> Saw this at a mall kiosk and were offering it to me for $120. The lowest the lady went was $60 but I didn&#x27;t have the money at the time. I randomly decided to look up the straightener online and what do you know, Amazon had it! And for waaaaaay cheaper! The straightener looks and feels exactly like the one at the mall and works so good! Only bad thing is that theres no warranty but that really doesn&#x27;t matter to me</li>
