            <li>I was surprised at how beautiful this smells its intoxicating.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Smells good light musky smell with a bit of sweet,, but the downfalls are it wears off very quickly and</li>
            <li>I have never bought perfume without smelling it first, but after reading all the positive reviews for Kiss, I was convienced that this could be a cheap yet wonderful perfume.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed one bit!</li>

            <li>Can&#x27;t say why I love this cheap perfume....</li>
            <li>Lovely light fragrance.  </li>

            <li>The fragrance is too strong.</li>
            <li>:) think I&#x27;ll order another right now!</li>
            <li>even i though was more sweet, that&#x27;s why four stars) but even like this, i wear every time i go out.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, yet not too light.</li>
            <li>I am a huge Kiss fan so years ago when the perfume came out</li>
            <li>just think how much you will enjoy this nice Kiss perfume for w</li>
            <li>it says it&#x27;s an aphrodisiac and it kind of is haha by boyfriend</li>
            <li>I know that Gene is the entrepreneur, but it would also be great if Paul marketed lipstick that was similar to the one he wears on stage.</li>
            <li>Got this for a birthday present from my husband, smells great.</li>
            <li>Starts off with a light floral scent, but then after it&#x27;s been on it seems to get  a musk like scent.  </li>
            <li>, I am so happy to have finally found it again!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell cheaply made at all, I can wear it and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for and it is a cheap smell.  </li>
            <li>The price was cheap</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent</li>
            <li>just fresh and sexy...</li>
            <li>cuz I love the fresh scent after my shower...</li>
            <li>Meh...This perfume smells as cheap as it was.</li>
            <li>Kiss smells fantastic and it lasts a lot longer than the others too.</li>
            <li>However, the price does not match the smell meaning the scent doesn&#x27;t smell cheap (</li>
            <li>Maybe that why it was selling so cheap.</li>
            <li>well packaged, I LOVE the band KISS, and it was well worth my 10 dollars.</li>
            <li>Shipped on time &amp; the price was fantastic.</li>
            <li>And my boyfriend made fun of me for buying KISS perfume, to top it off.</li>
            <li>Was definitely a great present.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thankfully this product WAS cheap.</li>
            <li>It is so light that I can spray it on like body mist.</li>
            <li>has always loved the smell of it as well :) would definitely roccemmend this perfume.</li>
            <li>Been wearing this perfume since my freshman year of high school (2008) and I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li>and the cover and everything is so pretty and neat!!</li>
            <li>But I checked some perfume rating sites and all were very complimentary.</li>
            <li>A good price, and the bottle is actually pretty large.</li>
            <li>Its light and fresh!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet but not too strong and has a unique scent.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recomend this perfume super love it :)))</li>
            <li>This fragrance comes on strong but dries down beautifully.</li>
            <li>Of all the perfumes that I have used through out the years, I can honestly say that KISS is by far the most intriguing, senseual, and stimulating perfume I have ever worn.  </li>
            <li>i have had many many (women especially) ask me what perfume i am wearing because they love how it smells...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy, and I smelt this for the first time forever ago, and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Better to buy a fragrance you can try first.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much!</li>
            <li>but I am not sure if it is excellent.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and was so excited about getting it.</li>
            <li>It smells great and it lasted a long time!</li>
            <li>I do not know the smell of this perfume, but I take the chance to buy it based on the customers review and they are all right!</li>
            <li>This started as a family joke, with everybody kidding that they wanted to smell like a 70&#x27;s band after performing in full make-up and costumes.  </li>
            <li>I love wearing it and every man wants to know what it is.</li>
            <li>I get complimented on how good I smell when I wear it all the time, especially from guys.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price which was cheap</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price which was cheap  </li>
            <li>Love this so much.</li>
            <li>Floral and Sweet</li>
            <li>a good perfume to splash on after a hot shower before bed or sex or what ever lol without suffocating your partner :-)</li>
            <li>so I gave her my full bottle of perfume</li>
            <li>It is fresh, light, and not overly floral.</li>
            <li>Perfume is not bad.</li>
            <li>This perfume spray is not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful fragrance, a bit spicy, still a little floral, very contemporary.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong very soothing scent!</li>
            <li>I bought it based on the great reviews from other shoppers, (</li>
            <li>The only reason I bought it was the reviews I read, it smells wonderful, it smells very feminine, yet unique and Young</li>
            <li>Its sort of this fresh and clean smell.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering and smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>This is definitely going to be on my top list :)</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>This is a very sweet scent, very feminine.  </li>
            <li>Arrived very fast!</li>
            <li>So overall, I was very pleased with this</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell anything special or different, it just smells nice.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s way better than most $50 perfumes and it lasts really long.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very soft and lovely.  </li>
            <li>who didnt love this scent after smelling it for the first time, it will definitely make you women more kissable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bigger sized bottle so love it for the price!</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Not cheap smelling, even though it is a great price.</li>
            <li>When I initially smelled it, I was not too thrilled.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time, it has such a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>it is a nice big bottle and it does look pretty cool.</li>
            <li>There are some fresh notes too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so inexpensive and worth a try...</li>
            <li>I can almost guarantee you will love it, young or \\&quot;mature\\&quot;</li>
            <li>it is worth the price</li>
            <li>I like the more masculine perfumes for women that don&#x27;t gag my allergies.</li>
            <li>and when I first have it on but the scent fades quickly and no one could even tell I was wearing a perfume at all.</li>
            <li>Maybe the chemistry with this perfume and my skin doesn&#x27;t mix well like it can with other people who gave this perfume good reviews.</li>
            <li>it is really fruity with a rich floral mix.</li>
            <li>Its good for everyday use as its light and not expensive.</li>
            <li>its the right smell but</li>
            <li>I really miss the gift sets that were available when the perfume first came out.  </li>
            <li>my daughter got me a small bottle of the cologne as a novelty, and it smells great.  </li>
            <li>I cant really describe the scent, its clean and sexy at the same time...</li>
            <li>It smells good, but I&#x27;m a little too old for it, its very fruity and cute smelling.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like the smell much !</li>
            <li>First person i&#x27;ve heard that uses this perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this perfume since I first saw it in stores, about...</li>
            <li>My two teenage daugthers LOVE IT as well</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it &amp; have already gone through multiple bottles.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s when I realized that I misjudged the first time.</li>
            <li>first of all, i have prime and what should have been two day shipping turned into four days.</li>
            <li>Thanks Kiss!</li>
            <li>First, I never take the time to review items online...</li>
            <li>It its similar and BETTER than Issye Miyake</li>
            <li>I actually like it more than Issey Miyake now</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described,</li>
            <li>I am definitely going repurchase this scent for many years.  </li>
            <li>;) I would recommend this perfume to anyone</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Especially if you love Kiss</li>
            <li>First time I am buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>received it so fast!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered and I got in fast and in one piece!</li>
            <li>it is not a teen smell for sure, I must say from ages between 24-50.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box it was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers, but it doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like soap, but it does smell fresh and clean but a little sexy, too.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but it does not last the entire day.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old and this perfume makes me feel young and sexy.</li>
            <li>Found it to be a little pungent early on, but it is a very nice floral scent after awhile on the skin.</li>
            <li>I too purchased this based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Purchased this fragrance based on all the positive customer ratings that it&#x27;s gotten, and because I&#x27;ve been a fan of Kiss since 1976.</li>
            <li>i am very dissapointed because its the first time i order something without smelling it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft but has a sweet aroma.</li>
            <li>It goes on a little strong, but as it wears it tones down very nicely.</li>
            <li>So I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect, all I knew was there was a lot of positive reviews, so I took my chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some others are commenting that the smell wears off quite quickly, and to be honest, it&#x27;s hard for me to tell how strong a perfume is (you know how you get used to a scent and don&#x27;t notice it as much when the scent is constant?)</li>
            <li>Not only does it have a great scent, but it is also one of the few perfumes I can wear and still smell on myself at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Being a huge fan, I simply had to try it.  </li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>He could really say...</li>
            <li>Thanks,</li>
            <li>A gross woodsy perfume that&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>Surprisingly high quality sent for the price, I get compliments all the time!</li>
            <li>I really like the scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cultish and very seductive.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry about how much it costs</li>
            <li>For the price I paid, it is reasonable.</li>
            <li>thanks ladies!)but</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to like it that much.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>reminds me of a combo of Issye Miyake and Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue....</li>
            <li>IMO, Light Blue smells lemony, but I dont detect any lemon/citrus in the Kiss...</li>
            <li>On my mom however it is very musky \\&quot;Chanel like\\</li>
            <li>Very feminine.  </li>
            <li>Kiss for Him ....not so much.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and product came looking a described.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable, so I decided to keep it in the end.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant buying this but for the price I couldnt beat it.</li>
            <li>I really like this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It has hints of Dolce Gabanna Light Blue in it</li>
            <li>and I really did not like it at all, so</li>
            <li>I wants to keep the bottle when the parfume is gone.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure exactly how long it&#x27;ll wear for but very happy with scent overall.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend likes it a lot, and being a very masculine guy who absolutely refuses having anything feminine to do with him or about him, he even let me spray some on his arm!</li>
            <li>She loves it to death and only uses it on special occassions</li>
            <li>VERY light but fresh &amp; hard to describe.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>My husband is a complete fan of the band and was first to point out when this item came out on the market.</li>
            <li>In order to get the full effect you need to actually try it on versus smelling the bottle.</li>
            <li>TYPICAL SCENT BUT STILL LOVE TO WEAR IT OUT</li>
            <li>I found it in a local store and when I went back to get more after I ran out</li>
            <li>I mainly wanted it because it&#x27;s a parfume by Kiss.</li>
            <li>The only downside is it does not seem to last that long, but because the scent is so good &amp;</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen this perfume since I was in high school, 6 years ago.</li>
            <li>A complete surprise!!</li>
            <li>it have a soft smell and believe any women any age range can wear this my girl wear kiss more then more expensive perfume</li>
            <li>I have tons of perfumes but this is the one that I use the most for everyday and work.</li>
            <li>Recommended if you like a fresh smell for a daily use.</li>
            <li>Next time i go to a $1.00 store and buy 9 dollars worth of impression scents</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long, but for the price overall, its pretty good.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers have said, this does have a D&amp;G \\&quot;Light Blue\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>I bought this parfume because I wanted to try new things</li>
            <li>I like to try new scents.</li>
            <li>The bottle is HUGE - it will easily last 6-12 months of even daily use.  </li>
            <li>I expected more of a regular fragrance box on the plus side</li>
            <li>Very mature scent, I will buy again.</li>
            <li>I am very surprised.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars because it can&#x27;t beat out my favorite of all time, Hugo Boss Deep Red.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a big bottle for a while and finally found one that was worth the price!</li>
            <li>I was scared this would be the same for this one, but actually it does smell decent, not too strong and it last for a while.</li>
            <li>I received a brush with glitter in it also from kiss,as long as it&#x27;s the right fragrance</li>
            <li>I wear it all year long, when the mood is right.</li>
            <li>(well i mean the price IS pretty cheap ba-dum-psh).</li>
            <li>I am normally not a floral smell person, but this is light enough it works for me.  </li>
            <li>Very cheap scent,  wears off in 30 minutes,  u can buy it from dollar store, large pretty bottle,  small cheap smell,  reviews were definitely wrong</li>
            <li>The shipping was extremely quick and the box came with some samples from other companies.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to everyone, from teenagers to adult.</li>
            <li>when looking and the reviews, i saw that one person said that it smelled like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>I ended up giving it to my 9 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>It has lasted me a long time, because you really don&#x27;t have to use a lot!</li>
            <li>I was surprised</li>
            <li>LUV this one &amp; wow</li>
            <li>Unless your over 50 years old.</li>
            <li>But this perfume is defiantly for young girls and college girls.</li>
            <li>I was surprised</li>
            <li>It has an old smell to it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance itself is light, but like a musk, just not heavy like one, a few spritz is all you need.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s not real common</li>
            <li>this perfume has a scent that is sweet as well as fierce, its sexy but at the same time casual.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells okay for like, ten seconds, then it stinks like very cheap perfume, and doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have an older lady musky smell, or a younger girl, in-your-face smell.</li>
            <li>MAJOR PLUS!)</li>
            <li>My only issue has been with longevity -  after a few hours, I can no longer smell it, but that&#x27;s easily remedied with another spritz.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a little bit lighter and doesn&#x27;t hit your nostrils as hard as LB, but these are all good things.</li>
            <li>On me its very crisp with little hints of flowers.</li>
            <li>The Victoria Secret store has way better cheap perfumes for about the same price, less in the bottle, but who cares?</li>
            <li>Very soft, womanly, sexi smell...</li>
            <li>No regrets!</li>
            <li>a lot of the other reviewers have mentioned, it&#x27;s kind of hard to describe the scent.</li>
            <li>and I mean ONLY issue is that it sprays on intense and fades quickly..</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical about buying a perfume without actually smelling the perfume, but with the price and the great reviews and rating i just took a chance.</li>
            <li>This really is no problem because I don&#x27;t mind applying two more sprays than usual.</li>
            <li>old Jewish guys from Brooklyn</li>
            <li>I was devistated when they stopped selling it most places, but alas.</li>
            <li>I bought this for fun and was shocked at how lovely the scent is.</li>
            <li>Inevitably, the conversation turns humorous when they hear the story behind our fascination with the product, but in the end everybody enjoys it.</li>
            <li>I found a small sample bottle of this at Wal-Mart a few years ago, and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>but, it is not long lasting..</li>

            <li> Not too strong, yet not too light.</li>
            <li> I am a huge Kiss fan so years ago when the perfume came out</li>
            <li> just think how much you will enjoy this nice Kiss perfume for w</li>
            <li> it says it&#x27;s an aphrodisiac and it kind of is haha by boyfriend</li>
            <li> I know that Gene is the entrepreneur, but it would also be great if Paul marketed lipstick that was similar to the one he wears on stage.</li>
            <li> Got this for a birthday present from my husband, smells great.</li>
            <li> Starts off with a light floral scent, but then after it&#x27;s been on it seems to get  a musk like scent.  </li>
            <li> , I am so happy to have finally found it again!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell cheaply made at all, I can wear it and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for and it is a cheap smell.  </li>
            <li> The price was cheap</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent</li>
            <li> just fresh and sexy...</li>
            <li> cuz I love the fresh scent after my shower...</li>
            <li> Meh...This perfume smells as cheap as it was.</li>
            <li> Kiss smells fantastic and it lasts a lot longer than the others too.</li>
            <li> However, the price does not match the smell meaning the scent doesn&#x27;t smell cheap (</li>
            <li> Maybe that why it was selling so cheap.</li>
            <li> well packaged, I LOVE the band KISS, and it was well worth my 10 dollars.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time &amp; the price was fantastic.</li>
            <li> And my boyfriend made fun of me for buying KISS perfume, to top it off.</li>
            <li> Was definitely a great present.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thankfully this product WAS cheap.</li>
            <li> It is so light that I can spray it on like body mist.</li>
            <li> has always loved the smell of it as well :) would definitely roccemmend this perfume.</li>
            <li> Been wearing this perfume since my freshman year of high school (2008) and I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> and the cover and everything is so pretty and neat!!</li>
            <li> But I checked some perfume rating sites and all were very complimentary.</li>
            <li> A good price, and the bottle is actually pretty large.</li>
            <li> Its light and fresh!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet but not too strong and has a unique scent.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recomend this perfume super love it :)))</li>
            <li> This fragrance comes on strong but dries down beautifully.</li>
            <li> Of all the perfumes that I have used through out the years, I can honestly say that KISS is by far the most intriguing, senseual, and stimulating perfume I have ever worn.  </li>
            <li> i have had many many (women especially) ask me what perfume i am wearing because they love how it smells...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and I smelt this for the first time forever ago, and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Better to buy a fragrance you can try first.</li>
            <li> and I love it so much!</li>
            <li> but I am not sure if it is excellent.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was so excited about getting it.</li>
            <li> It smells great and it lasted a long time!</li>
            <li> I do not know the smell of this perfume, but I take the chance to buy it based on the customers review and they are all right!</li>
            <li> This started as a family joke, with everybody kidding that they wanted to smell like a 70&#x27;s band after performing in full make-up and costumes.  </li>
            <li> I love wearing it and every man wants to know what it is.</li>
            <li> I get complimented on how good I smell when I wear it all the time, especially from guys.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price which was cheap</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price which was cheap  </li>
            <li> Love this so much.</li>

            <li> so I gave her my full bottle of perfume</li>
            <li> It is fresh, light, and not overly floral.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s so inexpensive and worth a try...</li>
            <li> I can almost guarantee you will love it, young or \\&quot;mature\\&quot;</li>
            <li> it is worth the price</li>
            <li> I like the more masculine perfumes for women that don&#x27;t gag my allergies.</li>
            <li> and when I first have it on but the scent fades quickly and no one could even tell I was wearing a perfume at all.</li>
            <li> Maybe the chemistry with this perfume and my skin doesn&#x27;t mix well like it can with other people who gave this perfume good reviews.</li>
            <li> it is really fruity with a rich floral mix.</li>
            <li> Its good for everyday use as its light and not expensive.</li>
            <li> its the right smell but</li>
            <li> I really miss the gift sets that were available when the perfume first came out.  </li>
            <li> my daughter got me a small bottle of the cologne as a novelty, and it smells great.  </li>
            <li> I cant really describe the scent, its clean and sexy at the same time...</li>
            <li> It smells good, but I&#x27;m a little too old for it, its very fruity and cute smelling.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the smell much !</li>
            <li> First person i&#x27;ve heard that uses this perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this perfume since I first saw it in stores, about...</li>
            <li> My two teenage daugthers LOVE IT as well</li>
            <li> I fell in love with it &amp; have already gone through multiple bottles.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s when I realized that I misjudged the first time.</li>
            <li> first of all, i have prime and what should have been two day shipping turned into four days.</li>
            <li> Thanks Kiss!</li>
            <li> First, I never take the time to review items online...</li>
            <li> It its similar and BETTER than Issye Miyake</li>
            <li> I actually like it more than Issey Miyake now</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described,</li>
            <li> I am definitely going repurchase this scent for many years.  </li>
            <li> ;) I would recommend this perfume to anyone</li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially if you love Kiss</li>
            <li> First time I am buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> received it so fast!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered and I got in fast and in one piece!</li>
            <li> it is not a teen smell for sure, I must say from ages between 24-50.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box it was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers, but it doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like soap, but it does smell fresh and clean but a little sexy, too.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but it does not last the entire day.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and this perfume makes me feel young and sexy.</li>
            <li> Found it to be a little pungent early on, but it is a very nice floral scent after awhile on the skin.</li>
            <li> I too purchased this based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Purchased this fragrance based on all the positive customer ratings that it&#x27;s gotten, and because I&#x27;ve been a fan of Kiss since 1976.</li>
            <li> i am very dissapointed because its the first time i order something without smelling it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft but has a sweet aroma.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little strong, but as it wears it tones down very nicely.</li>
            <li> So I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect, all I knew was there was a lot of positive reviews, so I took my chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some others are commenting that the smell wears off quite quickly, and to be honest, it&#x27;s hard for me to tell how strong a perfume is (you know how you get used to a scent and don&#x27;t notice it as much when the scent is constant?)</li>
            <li> Not only does it have a great scent, but it is also one of the few perfumes I can wear and still smell on myself at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Being a huge fan, I simply had to try it.  </li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> He could really say...</li>
            <li> Thanks,</li>
            <li> A gross woodsy perfume that&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> Surprisingly high quality sent for the price, I get compliments all the time!</li>
            <li> I really like the scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cultish and very seductive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about how much it costs</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, it is reasonable.</li>
            <li> thanks ladies!)but</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to like it that much.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> reminds me of a combo of Issye Miyake and Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue....</li>
            <li> IMO, Light Blue smells lemony, but I dont detect any lemon/citrus in the Kiss...</li>
            <li> On my mom however it is very musky \\&quot;Chanel like\\</li>
            <li> Very feminine.  </li>
            <li> Kiss for Him ....not so much.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and product came looking a described.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable, so I decided to keep it in the end.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant buying this but for the price I couldnt beat it.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It has hints of Dolce Gabanna Light Blue in it</li>
            <li> and I really did not like it at all, so</li>
            <li> I wants to keep the bottle when the parfume is gone.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure exactly how long it&#x27;ll wear for but very happy with scent overall.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend likes it a lot, and being a very masculine guy who absolutely refuses having anything feminine to do with him or about him, he even let me spray some on his arm!</li>
            <li> She loves it to death and only uses it on special occassions</li>
            <li> VERY light but fresh &amp; hard to describe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My husband is a complete fan of the band and was first to point out when this item came out on the market.</li>
            <li> In order to get the full effect you need to actually try it on versus smelling the bottle.</li>
            <li> TYPICAL SCENT BUT STILL LOVE TO WEAR IT OUT</li>
            <li> I found it in a local store and when I went back to get more after I ran out</li>
            <li> I mainly wanted it because it&#x27;s a parfume by Kiss.</li>
            <li> The only downside is it does not seem to last that long, but because the scent is so good &amp;</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen this perfume since I was in high school, 6 years ago.</li>
            <li> A complete surprise!!</li>
            <li> it have a soft smell and believe any women any age range can wear this my girl wear kiss more then more expensive perfume</li>
            <li> I have tons of perfumes but this is the one that I use the most for everyday and work.</li>
            <li> Recommended if you like a fresh smell for a daily use.</li>
            <li> Next time i go to a $1.00 store and buy 9 dollars worth of impression scents</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long, but for the price overall, its pretty good.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, this does have a D&amp;G \\&quot;Light Blue\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this parfume because I wanted to try new things</li>
            <li> I like to try new scents.</li>
            <li> The bottle is HUGE - it will easily last 6-12 months of even daily use.  </li>
            <li> I expected more of a regular fragrance box on the plus side</li>
            <li> Very mature scent, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because it can&#x27;t beat out my favorite of all time, Hugo Boss Deep Red.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a big bottle for a while and finally found one that was worth the price!</li>
            <li> I was scared this would be the same for this one, but actually it does smell decent, not too strong and it last for a while.</li>
            <li> I received a brush with glitter in it also from kiss,as long as it&#x27;s the right fragrance</li>
            <li> I wear it all year long, when the mood is right.</li>
            <li> (well i mean the price IS pretty cheap ba-dum-psh).</li>
            <li> I am normally not a floral smell person, but this is light enough it works for me.  </li>
            <li> Very cheap scent,  wears off in 30 minutes,  u can buy it from dollar store, large pretty bottle,  small cheap smell,  reviews were definitely wrong</li>
            <li> The shipping was extremely quick and the box came with some samples from other companies.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to everyone, from teenagers to adult.</li>
            <li> when looking and the reviews, i saw that one person said that it smelled like old lady perfume.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving it to my 9 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> It has lasted me a long time, because you really don&#x27;t have to use a lot!</li>
            <li> I was surprised</li>
            <li> LUV this one &amp; wow</li>
            <li> Unless your over 50 years old.</li>
            <li> But this perfume is defiantly for young girls and college girls.</li>
            <li> I was surprised</li>
            <li> It has an old smell to it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance itself is light, but like a musk, just not heavy like one, a few spritz is all you need.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s not real common</li>
            <li> this perfume has a scent that is sweet as well as fierce, its sexy but at the same time casual.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells okay for like, ten seconds, then it stinks like very cheap perfume, and doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have an older lady musky smell, or a younger girl, in-your-face smell.</li>
            <li> MAJOR PLUS!)</li>
            <li> My only issue has been with longevity -  after a few hours, I can no longer smell it, but that&#x27;s easily remedied with another spritz.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little bit lighter and doesn&#x27;t hit your nostrils as hard as LB, but these are all good things.</li>
            <li> On me its very crisp with little hints of flowers.</li>
            <li> The Victoria Secret store has way better cheap perfumes for about the same price, less in the bottle, but who cares?</li>
            <li> Very soft, womanly, sexi smell...</li>
            <li> No regrets!</li>
            <li> a lot of the other reviewers have mentioned, it&#x27;s kind of hard to describe the scent.</li>
            <li> and I mean ONLY issue is that it sprays on intense and fades quickly..</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying a perfume without actually smelling the perfume, but with the price and the great reviews and rating i just took a chance.</li>
            <li> This really is no problem because I don&#x27;t mind applying two more sprays than usual.</li>
            <li> old Jewish guys from Brooklyn</li>
            <li> I was devistated when they stopped selling it most places, but alas.</li>
            <li> I bought this for fun and was shocked at how lovely the scent is.</li>
            <li> Inevitably, the conversation turns humorous when they hear the story behind our fascination with the product, but in the end everybody enjoys it.</li>
            <li> I found a small sample bottle of this at Wal-Mart a few years ago, and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> but, it is not long lasting..</li>
            <li> Walked past him and told me I smell really</li>
            <li> I usually wear L&#x27;eau Dissy, Issey Miyake...and The One, D&amp;G.   My bank account needed a much deserved break this month, and although I would prefer my favs...</li>
            <li> Happened to stumble upon it online again last year, and now I go through a bottle every 6-7 months!  </li>
            <li> The sent last all day long.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long.   </li>
            <li> Scent last a long time.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, lingers all throughout the day until the next shower.</li>
            <li> The scent&#x27;s a little weaker than if you buy it new at a department store, but I don&#x27;t think they have this scent on the shelves anymore</li>
            <li> that sounded ridiculous to me because i really needed the money back</li>
            <li> ok if i spray it on clothes, but it really stinks on my skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to go a long way.</li>
            <li> I like the smell although the scent doesn&#x27;t stay with you long.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is an old batch because it smell funny like something was wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I hope that you will consider other items such as bath salts, soap, body lotion, etc.</li>
            <li> This is the worst smelling fragrance I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time and luckily it wears off quickly.  </li>
            <li> Now a few years later after using it all up</li>
            <li> I was front row center.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed on at 8am and by 11am it was a distant memory</li>
            <li> then I expected as well.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong for the price, wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had expected  </li>
            <li> A little spritz goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Maybe other makeup ideas could follow.  </li>
            <li> It can be smelled on you from arms length away, but it&#x27;s pretty faint.  </li>
            <li> Along with a lot of other people, I didn&#x27;t know what this perfume smelled like when I bought it.</li>
            <li> The other perfumes I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t stand a chance.</li>
            <li> I recommend this over every other perfume.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I can complain about is how the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work as well as a usual sprayer.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t smell it on every other girl, like you do alot of other perfumes.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t figure out what the alluring part of this is..very playful &amp; slightly fruity.</li>
            <li> I seriously think I remember smelling something similar in my Grandmother&#x27;s house.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t to crazy about the scent at first.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about getting this because i didnt know what it smelled</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about getting this because i didnt know what it smelled</li>
            <li> The first time you buy this perfume, I was pretty doubtful, because he thought the price so low as to maybe a bad perfume, always read the recommendations of other users, and guide me to make my purchase.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my little sister.  </li>
            <li> the color of the fragrance was a bit brown,maybe it&#x27;s a bit old idk,but it came in a store display case which was weird</li>
            <li> I ran out a few months ago &amp; can&#x27;t find this product anywhere</li>
            <li> Have been wearing this sent for a few years now</li>
            <li> leaked a few</li>
            <li> Even at $10.00 I considered it a waste.</li>
            <li> , we march to chow in the sweltering heat everyday</li>
            <li> I am not a huge KISS fan</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong and overpowering, and not &amp;#34;burn</li>
            <li> the perfume last all day long and reminds me of an expensive feragamo perfume that I purchased before, and this one they can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> is the price unbelievable</li>
            <li> I small while wearing it.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy perfume before smelling it and after this experience I know to stand by that through and through.</li>
            <li> I will be using this perfume as my everyday perfume!</li>
            <li> My aunt bought a small bottle of this for me one Christmas</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the very few perfumes that do not give me a headache!</li>
            <li> Bought this for someone for Christmas they hated it at first</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the price ($8.00) and since the perfumes are like my weak spot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scent for about 5 years now, and it&#x27;s very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I decided to look on amazon for random perfumes that are reasonably priced so if I don&#x27;t like the smell I won&#x27;t feel so bad for buying it!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because it seemed a little cheesy.</li>
            <li> It smells expensive, but no one has to know how little i paid for it !!!</li>
            <li> If you like victoria secret and other fruity/elegant smelling body products, you will probably hate this too.</li>
            <li> my bottle leaks if its not straight up which is annoying but</li>
            <li> I put it on and went to the store and received at least 4 compliments!!</li>
            <li> Man oh man was I wrong.</li>
            <li> People can&#x27;t believe it when I tell them what I&#x27;m wearing, they think it is an expensive designer brand.</li>
            <li> I must have read the reviews wrong.</li>
            <li> and this was a blind buy for me but afer reading the reviews</li>
            <li> I purchased 5 bottles as stocking suffers and gifts.  </li>
            <li> Now I feel bad, it smells</li>
            <li> , i like kiss the group and was shocked to find this.</li>
            <li> and I got sick of smelling like sweat.</li>
            <li> :{</li>
            <li> And, was I disappointed?</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed at the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li> how could anyone hate this perfume??</li>
            <li> For the price, it isn&#x27;t terrible and I have been wearing it to work.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This perfume is what got my crush to noticed me! lol well kind of. Walked past him and told me I smell really good!!!&lt;br /&gt;*squealed* Thank you kiss! This is definitely going to be on my top list :)</li>
            <li> Been wearing this perfume since my freshman year of high school (2008) and I absolutely LOVE it! Haha it says it&#x27;s an aphrodisiac and it kind of is haha by boyfriend has always loved the smell of it as well :) would definitely roccemmend this perfume. ❤</li>
            <li> After I purchased the Kiss from amazon I saw it in a catalog I r&#x27;cv often and ended up with another bottle, same size, for only $5.50..close out price..retail value $70+...don&#x27;t knock it til you try it!</li>
            <li> Of all the perfumes that I have used through out the years, I can honestly say that KISS is by far the most intriguing, senseual, and stimulating perfume I have ever worn.  My husband is a complete fan of the band and was first to point out when this item came out on the market. Both he and I purchased the perfume and cologne. I can&#x27;t pull myself away to wear anything else. Thank you KISS for marketing this product.  I hope that you will consider other items such as bath salts, soap, body lotion, etc. I know that Gene is the entrepreneur, but it would also be great if Paul marketed lipstick that was similar to the one he wears on stage. He could really say...KISS ME with red lips on a white box! Maybe other makeup ideas could follow.  I really miss the gift sets that were available when the perfume first came out.  Maybe it could be considered again.  The lipstick with the perfume would be awesome.    I wanted the best, I got the best....KISS!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the smell much !</li>
            <li> very good product.....</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast! I love this perfume and I most definately am going to be ordering another one. The smell is just wonderful and people compliment me when I am wearing it.</li>
            <li> Got this for a birthday present from my husband, smells great. The fragrance itself is light, but like a musk, just not heavy like one, a few spritz is all you need. It lasted most of the day. I only gave it 4 stars because it can&#x27;t beat out my favorite of all time, Hugo Boss Deep Red.</li>
            <li> its the right smell but the color of the fragrance was a bit brown,maybe it&#x27;s a bit old idk,but it came in a store display case which was weird I expected more of a regular fragrance box on the plus side I received a brush with glitter in it also from kiss,as long as it&#x27;s the right fragrance I guess it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> fabuloso,excelente aroma.  lo compre porque tiene excelentes comentarios.  huele exquisito, comprenlo no se arrepentiran , soy de piel morena y su aroma dura todo el dia en mi. aplico en mi sueter o blusa y el aroma perdura varios dias.</li>
            <li> SMELL GOOD. the scent is very economical but it is very rich. aroma is very nice, I love :) :)</li>
            <li> Just received my order of Kiss for her. Wasn&#x27;t to crazy about the scent at first. I noticed that the longer it&#x27;s on the better it smells. Starts off with a light floral scent, but then after it&#x27;s been on it seems to get  a musk like scent.  Love it!! You don&#x27;t need much to go a long way. The scent seems to stay for hours.  Delivery was quick. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, she love it.</li>
            <li> This started as a family joke, with everybody kidding that they wanted to smell like a 70&#x27;s band after performing in full make-up and costumes.  Now, however, the joke is on us as we all love the smell of this perfume and have many people ask what the scent is.  Inevitably, the conversation turns humorous when they hear the story behind our fascination with the product, but in the end everybody enjoys it.</li>
            <li> My sister bought this parfume for me for christmas two years ago. I love wearing it and every man wants to know what it is. They love the smell. Even my husband loves when I wear it. Great to give to every woman.</li>
            <li> Got complaments when I wore it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister (24yrs) and she absolutly loves it. Nice smell, not to strong.First person i&#x27;ve heard that uses this perfume.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It&#x27;s so romantic and you can get lost in the smell. In order to get the full effect you need to actually try it on versus smelling the bottle. I can see myself wearing this perfume every day. I&#x27;m so happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it ! Great price and fast shipping ! Would like to be able to choose the symbol on the bottle, but oh well . Thanks,</li>
            <li> I tried to like it. But i just can&#x27;t find something to like about this perfume. Maybe the chemistry with this perfume and my skin doesn&#x27;t mix well like it can with other people who gave this perfume good reviews. But it smells like... A gross woodsy perfume that&#x27;s cheap (well i mean the price IS pretty cheap ba-dum-psh). But yeah no I didn&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! Smells great and was delivered quickly! I would like to say though for me its more of a SUMMER perfume.. Its light and fresh! If your looking for something to compliment winter months i suggest something that smells richer! But LOVE this perfume!</li>
            <li> I found a small sample bottle of this at Wal-Mart a few years ago, and I fell in love with it.  Happened to stumble upon it online again last year, and now I go through a bottle every 6-7 months!  It smells so good, and the smell lasts all day.  My coat smells especially great!  You can&#x27;t beat the price, either!</li>
            <li> Really nice fragrant for the price. The sent last all day long.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly high quality sent for the price, I get compliments all the time! Very nice light fragrance that stays with you all day, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this perfume since I first saw it in stores, about... 8 years now I think? I am constantly complimented on it and everybody knows me by this scent now, it&#x27;s my signature! I work at a bar/restaurant and work up to 10 hours with blue cheese and beer spilling on me and by the end of the night I&#x27;m still getting compliments. It&#x27;s one of the very few perfumes that do not give me a headache! I love it!</li>
            <li> Compre este perfume por los comentarios de los demas clientes y en efecto es espectacular! El aroma es exquisito, tiene un toque de vainilla, no es dulce y dura todo le dia... 100% recomendado</li>
            <li> Great woman smell (even i though was more sweet, that&#x27;s why four stars) but even like this, i wear every time i go out.</li>
            <li> I love this! I found it in a local store and when I went back to get more after I ran out they no longer sold it. Thank goodness you can find almost everything on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I do not know the smell of this perfume, but I take the chance to buy it based on the customers review and they are all right! the perfume last all day long and reminds me of an expensive feragamo perfume that I purchased before, and this one they can&#x27;t beat the price! I absolutely recomend this perfume super love it :)))</li>
            <li> this is the best perfume i have ever used. I Love It!!!! Is is not too strong and just the right amount of beautiful aroma! I recommend it to everyone, from teenagers to adult. My two teenage daugthers LOVE IT as well</li>
            <li> I am a huge Kiss fan so years ago when the perfume came out I bought it not caring what it smelled like. I fell in love with it &amp; have already gone through multiple bottles. I ran out a few months ago &amp; can&#x27;t find this product anywhere, I am so happy to have finally found it again!</li>
            <li> Love this scent. This is m second order, and I never buy the same perfume twice. Def. an all time favortie.</li>
            <li> Una fragancia excelente que combina notas de vainilla. Me encantó este perfume, lo compre por los  buenos comentarios de otros compradores y no me equivoque al pedirlo. A un precio asequible y razonable obtienes una fragancia inolvidable y que perdura todo el día.</li>
            <li> Great it was much better then I thought.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume based solely on the reviews. I was sooo wanting to like it. It smells very nice coming out and when I first have it on but the scent fades quickly and no one could even tell I was wearing a perfume at all. I have tried three different times and the same thing every time. It might work for you tho. But I was dissappointed. :{</li>
            <li> This is a very sweet scent, very feminine.  It&#x27;s a bit strong upon application, but settles very nicely.  It can be smelled on you from arms length away, but it&#x27;s pretty faint.  I would definitely recommend this. :D</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume based solely on the glowing reviews it had already received, and I&#x27;m adding mine to it!  I was hesitant to buy something without smelling it, but for the price I decided to give it a try.  It&#x27;s a wonderful fragrance, a bit spicy, still a little floral, very contemporary.  The bottle is HUGE - it will easily last 6-12 months of even daily use.  My only issue has been with longevity -  after a few hours, I can no longer smell it, but that&#x27;s easily remedied with another spritz.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews I couldn&#x27;t understand why no one described the way it smells, but everyone loves the scent...well, I can&#x27;t describe what it smells like, but I really love the scent! It&#x27;s light, but it lasts a long time. It doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers, but it doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like soap, but it does smell fresh and clean but a little sexy, too. It doesn&#x27;t smell cheaply made at all, I can wear it and it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li> I discovered this perfume one day and decided to give it a chance and fell in love with it. Now a few years later after using it all up I decided that it was time to purchase it again. No regrets!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance it is really fruity with a rich floral mix. The fragrance lingers all day and it a steal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why all the big department stores discontinued it.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped properly and packaged well.  The fragrance is very soft and lovely.  I liked the size of the bottle and the amount of perfume received for the price.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s way better than most $50 perfumes and it lasts really long. My wife loves it and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom and she liked. Perfume is not bad. Its sort of this fresh and clean smell. Its good for everyday use as its light and not expensive. Its not the best, but its not bad. Seller was prompt and I received in time.</li>
            <li> Kiss is my favorite perfume after randomly buying it at Walmart one day.  Not only does it have a great scent, but it is also one of the few perfumes I can wear and still smell on myself at the end of the day.  I get complimented on how good I smell when I wear it all the time, especially from guys.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> When I initially smelled it, I was not too thrilled. Then I received the bath splash and used them together, that&#x27;s when I realized that I misjudged the first time. This fragrance is absolutely exquisite and very affordable might I add.Buy it you will not regret it. Take it from someone who is quite picky when it comes to perfumes.</li>
            <li> I have never bought perfume without smelling it first, but after reading all the positive reviews for Kiss, I was convienced that this could be a cheap yet wonderful perfume. Man oh man was I wrong. This perfume is not for people in their twenties. If you like victoria secret and other fruity/elegant smelling body products, you will probably hate this too. This perfume smells slightly better than the cheap perfumes that elderly women are known to wear. I wish I would of listened to the two reviews that said this product didn&#x27;t smell that great. I could&#x27;ve saved 11 bucks. Hopefully my review can save someone else their 11 dollars.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen this perfume since I was in high school, 6 years ago. Oh how I missed it! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This is the worst smelling fragrance I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time and luckily it wears off quickly.  You get what you pay for and it is a cheap smell.  I will stop now, since my parents taught me if you don&#x27;t have anything nice to say, don&#x27;t say nothing at all.  That is it.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent so did my mom so I bought her some for Christmas (I&#x27;m 17 btw)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say why I love this cheap perfume....perfect perfect perfect.  ordered some Kiss for Men because I&#x27;d love to smell it on my husband.  thx</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite perfume! I use it all the time, it has such a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> first of all, i have prime and what should have been two day shipping turned into four days. then of course i opened it and sprayed the perfume to smell it. i wasn&#x27;t impressed. when looking and the reviews, i saw that one person said that it smelled like old lady perfume. and it does. i really wanted to like this stuff after reading all the good reviews on it. for me, it smells ok if i spray it on clothes, but it really stinks on my skin. i won&#x27;t ever be ordering this again. i just hope i can stand the smell to be able to use all of it. it is a nice big bottle and it does look pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance. Got it today and it seems very lovely. Not too strong, yet not too light. It reminds me of all the great smelling perfumes I smell in magazines. You know, the ones where you have to open the flap to preview the smell. Mmmmm... nice!</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought it was the reviews I read, it smells wonderful, it smells very feminine, yet unique and Young simply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Arrived within 3 days w/ free shipping option! The scent&#x27;s a little weaker than if you buy it new at a department store, but I don&#x27;t think they have this scent on the shelves anymore</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cultish and very seductive. I wear it all year long, when the mood is right. This fragrance comes on strong but dries down beautifully. It stays and stays. Great for date night or drinks with the girls. would not wear it to the office or on the job, but if you are the daring type you might. Marketed as a floriental, it is spicy with a flowery heart. There are some fresh notes too. A winner and the price does not reflect the quality of the scent. AND you do not need to be a fan of Kiss to enjoy it, but it is nice to those of us who are.</li>
            <li> I gave this fragrance away. I didnt like the smell and would not ever purchase again. The price was cheap so I purchased, never again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about how much it costs just think how much you will enjoy this nice Kiss perfume for w</li>
            <li> I have never smelled this scent before and never heard of it, tried it for the great price and am really glad I did.  It Smells really good!</li>
            <li> it was a gift for my wife. It smells good, but it does not last the entire day. For the price I paid, it is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell and cheap</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent and I wear this quite often. I get compliments from my friends and also my peers!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I am writing this...but this pefume does NOT suck! At all!   I got it today and it has worn wonderfully thoughout the day.  I bought it based on the great reviews from other shoppers, (thanks ladies!)but I didn&#x27;t expect to like it that much. I usually wear L&#x27;eau Dissy, Issey Miyake...and The One, D&amp;G.   My bank account needed a much deserved break this month, and although I would prefer my favs...I am MORE than pleased with this fragrance for now. I think even when I return to my staples I will keep a bottle of this as well anyway. It&#x27;s a warm and welcoming, easy to wear scent.  It contains oriental and deep floral (not flowery)notes. Quite clean and yet nice and spicy all at the same time.  Try it...spend the 10 bux and be prepared to be delighted. I am...! Thanks Kiss!</li>
            <li> First, I never take the time to review items online...I saw this perfume at a local clearance store for abt $5....I actually smelled the tester as a joke, wondering what the heck a \\&quot;Kiss\\&quot; scent would smell like...old Jewish guys from Brooklyn haha lol?? All I can say is WOW!!!!!  I cant really describe the scent, its clean and sexy at the same time...reminds me of a combo of Issye Miyake and Dolce and Gabbana Light Blue....IMO, Light Blue smells lemony, but I dont detect any lemon/citrus in the Kiss...It its similar and BETTER than Issye Miyake...I get compliments all the time on this scent...men LOVE it!!!!  It&#x27;s not floral and cloying...just fresh and sexy...I even use it at night cuz I love the fresh scent after my shower...It&#x27;s so inexpensive and worth a try...I can almost guarantee you will love it, young or \\&quot;mature\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Along with a lot of other people, I didn&#x27;t know what this perfume smelled like when I bought it. But also along with almost everyone else, I&#x27;m glad I bought it because it smells amazing :] The bottle is tall and fancy. The one thing I didn&#x27;t like about the bottle, is that mine was the Catman&#x27;s face instead of the Starchild&#x27;s like it shows on the box. (Paul is my favorite) So overall, I was very pleased with this and it only took 2 days to ship! I&#x27;m going to wear this perfume every day and order another box soon!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, and so does my husband but it doesn&#x27;t last long.   I wish they made it in a more concentrated perfume.</li>
            <li> KISS played in my town,Lafayette,La., back in &#x27;85 and i got to meet Paul and Bruce.  I was front row center.  been a fan since i was 11. my daughter got me a small bottle of the cologne as a novelty, and it smells great.  i got her one for x-mas,and the mens for my son. then i ordered another for me and i&#x27;m ordering another bottle asap for backup.  i wish they would put out a lotion,soap,and anything else girly they can in this scent!</li>
            <li> very good smell was very suprised for the price and the package and bottle are very cool thinking of getting the mens also</li>
            <li> Very cheap scent,  wears off in 30 minutes,  u can buy it from dollar store, large pretty bottle,  small cheap smell,  reviews were definitely wrong</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying a perfume without actually smelling the perfume, but with the price and the great reviews and rating i just took a chance. The shipping was extremely quick and the box came with some samples from other companies. A complete surprise!! The perfume is a must for the summer and into the fall. I put it on and went to the store and received at least 4 compliments!! On me its very crisp with little hints of flowers. On my mom however it is very musky \\&quot;Chanel like\\&quot; Im completely in love and will be repurchasing again.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is amazing! A little spritz goes a long way. The scent last all day. This makes a great stocking stuffer for this Christmas :-)</li>
            <li> this is a really great scent that lasts all day. i have had many many (women especially) ask me what perfume i am wearing because they love how it smells...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gift.The person it was gifted to liked the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say it is a good product.</li>
            <li> The scent is feminine, sweetly lingering and pleasant. I LOVE it! I have had many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I actually took a chance and purchased this from Amazon without even knowing what it smelled like.  I never knew KISS even made a fragrance.  Being a huge fan, I simply had to try it.  Glad I did.  Smells very nice.  Very feminine.  I just received it about an hour ago so I&#x27;m not sure exactly how long it&#x27;ll wear for but very happy with scent overall.</li>
            <li> This is the best fragrance.  I actually like it more than Issey Miyake now and that&#x27;s all I used to wear.  Lovely light fragrance.  I&#x27;m asked all the time what I have on and men seem to love it.  You can not beat the price either.</li>
            <li> This is a huge bottle of perfume and a great value. It smells good, but I&#x27;m a little too old for it, its very fruity and cute smelling. Best probably for teenagers and 20&#x27;s. I wear it anyways though :)</li>
            <li> Meh...This perfume smells as cheap as it was. I bought it based on the reviews and because I am a KISS fan.  I ended up giving it to my 9 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about getting this because i didnt know what it smelled like ,I&#x27;m a big kiss fan so i just took the chance. I was glad i did because i absolutly love the fragrence.Definitely worth the price which was cheap and it came in a big bottle plus the fragrence doesnt fade.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance based on the reviews I read. And, was I disappointed? Absolutely not!! I sprayed it the very moment I received it and keep smelling my clothing cause the fragrance is so awesome. I haven&#x27;t gotten any compliments as yet cause I haven&#x27;t worn it on the outside but I do believe I will be getting lots of that.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, this does have a D&amp;G \\&quot;Light Blue\\&quot; scent. It is a little bit lighter and doesn&#x27;t hit your nostrils as hard as LB, but these are all good things. Some others are commenting that the smell wears off quite quickly, and to be honest, it&#x27;s hard for me to tell how strong a perfume is (you know how you get used to a scent and don&#x27;t notice it as much when the scent is constant?) However, I spritzed this in my hair at night and in the morning my man sniffed my hair and sleepily mumbled, \\&quot;mmmm...I love what you&#x27;re wearing, you smell so good\\&quot;. I&#x27;m a fan!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells awesome!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about getting this because i didnt know what it smelled like ,I&#x27;m a big kiss fan so i just took the chance. I was glad i did because i absolutly love the fragrence.Definitely worth the price which was cheap  and it came in a big bottle plus the fragrence doesnt fade.</li>
            <li> Awesome smell! love this perfume, great price. Scent last a long time. Not fruity smelling, a very trendy scent. Love this so much. It has lasted me a long time, because you really don&#x27;t have to use a lot! :) Will definitely re-order this.</li>
            <li> My daughter has always loved this perfume since she saw it four of five years ago.  I was so happy to see it for sale on Amazon as it isn&#x27;t sold very much anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume after reading all the great reviews. If you are truly a perfume lover, please never ever buy this perfume.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this scent! Kiss for Him ....not so much.  This is the second bottle I have purchased. Very nice fragrance especially when you catch a great sale!</li>
            <li> This cologne deserves a 5 star, simply amazing, i haven&#x27;t met someone yet who didnt love this scent after smelling it for the first time, it will definitely make you women more kissable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent ! I learned my lesson never buy cheap stuff!</li>
            <li> smells good I was surprised</li>
            <li> I got this a while back at a local store and it is great. The other perfumes I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t stand a chance. Kiss smells fantastic and it lasts a lot longer than the others too.</li>
            <li> I too purchased this based on the positive reviews. I was not disappointed in the least! This fragrance is just delightful! VERY light but fresh &amp; hard to describe. It lasts a long time, lingers all throughout the day until the next shower. Can&#x27;t figure out what the alluring part of this is..very playful &amp; slightly fruity. LUV this one &amp; wow is the price unbelievable :) think I&#x27;ll order another right now!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my fiance, i am the kiss fan so i thought it would be cool, smells great i have actually bought 3 bottles</li>
            <li> I received the gift box that included a shimmer power brush! Was not expecting that, but loved it!!</li>
            <li> I love how this stuff smells, and I get a ton of compliments when I wear it.  It&#x27;s not strong and overpowering, and not &amp;#34;burn your nose hair out&amp;#34; like a lot of colognes.  I got a bottle as a gift and have since ordered more.  People can&#x27;t believe it when I tell them what I&#x27;m wearing, they think it is an expensive designer brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for this coming Christmas.  Nice packaging, nice bottle.  I opened it up because I bought it without knowing how it smells.  Now I feel bad, it smells so go I don&#x27;t want to give it to my her.</li>
            <li> This is my go to fragrance. I absolutely love it. I always get complimented on how good I small while wearing it.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells soooo good!! It&#x27;s soft but has a sweet aroma. I love it!! how could anyone hate this perfume?? Unless your over 50 years old. But this perfume is defiantly for young girls and college girls. I&#x27;m in college and I love it!!! Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great, thank you very much for the good service! I totally recommend it. Great service, great quality, great prices always! This is a very cheap perfume with an amazing and sweet fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for someone for Christmas they hated it at first and after it settles it has become a signature fragrance, i like kiss the group and was shocked to find this. this is a scent for anyone not just college students it smells great and not bad for the price either.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells lovely.. Floral and Sweet&lt;br /&gt;The only.. and I mean ONLY issue is that it sprays on intense and fades quickly.. I sprayed on at 8am and by 11am it was a distant memory&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and product came looking a described.</li>
            <li> The first time you buy this perfume, I was pretty doubtful, because he thought the price so low as to maybe a bad perfume, always read the recommendations of other users, and guide me to make my purchase. When I received could not believe the smell so incredible that I had this bottle. Whenever I stand perfume in the morning to go to work, and when I get home at night, my husband left my skin smelling the scent is so divine that is inlaid into my last pore. Do not hesitate to make a second purchase. Ladies buy this perfume is the most divine and the price is incredibly amazing.</li>
            <li> Have been wearing this sent for a few years now and I absolutely love it. Item was exactly as described, packaging was nice neat and secure. Arrived very quickly. Will definitely come back to in the future and hope this seller still has my sent.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves this fragrance at work.&lt;br /&gt;Not a strong fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Very good deal for the price.&lt;br /&gt;My only complain that it leaks a bit at the spray-head.&lt;br /&gt;I kept it in my work bag, when it turned&lt;br /&gt;upside-down by accidentally&lt;br /&gt;it leaked a few times.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise i think it is great.</li>
            <li> i am very dissapointed because its the first time i order something without smelling it and i did not like the smell it smells like a mans colonge with peanuts and so i decided to return it because also the bottle was leaking and i wanted to get the return label and it says FOR SAFETY REASONS WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO RETURN THINGS THAT ARE FLAMMABLE AND CUSTOMERS SHOULD DISPOSE OF THEM???? then how are we supposed to get our money back? that sounded ridiculous to me because i really needed the money back thats why im so pissed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas. I was skeptical because it seemed a little cheesy. But I checked some perfume rating sites and all were very complimentary. I have to say, despite the logo and packaging, this is a very nice perfume. It goes on a little strong, but as it wears it tones down very nicely. Very mature scent, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This smells like something you would use to cover up your chain smoking habit.  It is very strong and only a spray or two is necessary.  For the price, it isn&#x27;t terrible and I have been wearing it to work.</li>
            <li> This smells so good! It is a way bigger bottle then I expected as well. Nothing but good things to say. Get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this fragrance based on all the positive customer ratings that it&#x27;s gotten, and because I&#x27;ve been a fan of Kiss since 1976. Found it to be a little pungent early on, but it is a very nice floral scent after awhile on the skin. The price was reasonable, so I decided to keep it in the end.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I have decided to try various perfumes this year. I decided to look on amazon for random perfumes that are reasonably priced so if I don&#x27;t like the smell I won&#x27;t feel so bad for buying it! Lol With that said, the reviews are right about this product!!!! It smells sooooo good!!! And the price is AWESOME!!!! However, the price does not match the smell meaning the scent doesn&#x27;t smell cheap (MAJOR PLUS!). I was surprised but I absolutely love it!!!! Very soft, womanly, sexi smell...a good perfume to splash on after a hot shower before bed or sex or what ever lol without suffocating your partner :-) I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Great scent!  The only downside is it does not seem to last that long, but because the scent is so good &amp; the price was great, it is worth it!</li>
            <li> O.k . This buy was a mistake but , it work in my favor it have a soft smell and believe any women any age range can wear this my girl wear kiss more then more expensive perfume</li>
            <li> Smells so good &#x3D;)  I am definitely going repurchase this scent for many years.  Perfume arrived on time and was packaged nicely &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I was devistated when they stopped selling it most places, but alas. I found it. Came within a week too &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy It has an old smell to it. Maybe that why it was selling so cheap. I bought this because of the reviews and I did not like it. I think this stuff is an old batch because it smell funny like something was wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the price ($8.00) and since the perfumes are like my weak spot I was like I must have it. I loved it!! and is so big. I have tons of perfumes but this is the one that I use the most for everyday and work.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this based on the reviews but I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the smell. It&#x27;s too musky for me. Almost a man&#x27;s cologne style. I must have read the reviews wrong. I like a more floral smell a bit better</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance. Not cheap smelling, even though it is a great price. Sophisticated scent and not overpowering, will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I ordered this without ever having smelled it. I have to say, i am impressed. It is very good for the price and the fragrance is nice and not over-powering.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong for the price, wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had expected  it was a gift and they seemed to have liked it</li>
            <li> I bought this in 2012 and paid $10.00. The fragrance is too strong. Even at $10.00 I considered it a waste.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice and the bottle is elegant. Although my friends do not know who Kiss are, they all love this perfume.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how beautiful this smells its intoxicating. I was expecting some more \\&quot;KISS\\&quot; like. Gene Simmons knows what women want.</li>
            <li> this parfume very good,, but i order 5 item and  i just received only 3. please follow up.&lt;br /&gt;thanks you</li>
            <li> Smells like a form of Twilight woods, sort of. I like it though, I&#x27;ve come to know it as &amp;#34;my&amp;#34; scent. It last all day. Yay.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my little sister.  She loves it to death and only uses it on special occassions</li>
            <li> I bought this parfume because I wanted to try new things so I gave it a chance. It smells very very good, I love it! Recommended if you like a fresh smell for a daily use.</li>
            <li> I usually do not buy perfume offline, but I was very happy with the product when I received it. It smells great and it lasted a long time!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Kiss her\\&quot; the perfume smell really awesome i loved it! and the cover and everything is so pretty and neat!! i really loved it. :)</li>
            <li> this perfume has a scent that is sweet as well as fierce, its sexy but at the same time casual. I am 30 years old and this perfume makes me feel young and sexy. I say give it a shot and its a steal at under 10 dollars. I don&#x27;t think you will be dissapointed at all i know i wasn&#x27;t and this was a blind buy for me but afer reading the reviews i thought id give it a shot and im so glad that i did this has a speacial place in my perfume collection and i will definately be re purchasing it when i run out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and I smelt this for the first time forever ago, and I fell in love with it.  I recommend this over every other perfume.  Just sayin.</li>
            <li> It smells..like perfume. I don&#x27;t smell anything special or different, it just smells nice. Spells like how you would picture perfume to smell, like the perfume section in Macy&#x27;s. I like it, however. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, it came extremely fast- well packaged, I LOVE the band KISS, and it was well worth my 10 dollars.</li>
            <li> Just got my perfume today I was nervous about using it and what it would smell like but to my suprise it smells sooo good !!! The smell is not too strong I just love it , excited to wear it out ;) I would recommend this perfume to anyone it&#x27;s awesome !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I had purchased this perfume years ago from the mall, but they discontinued it. I was so happy when I found it here., I &amp;#60;3 it! My husband likes the scent too and he&#x27;s picky about perfumes I wear :) Shipped on time &amp; the price was fantastic. Definitely recommend this item! :D</li>
            <li> el producto llego en  excelentes condiciones, llego en el tiempo pactado y lleno mis expectativas sobre el producto. los recomiendo. very good</li>
            <li> Perfumes no matter what you pay for them depend on the person. This smells like baby powder on my mom and somewhat fruity on me. I love it a lot.</li>
            <li> I personally would not buy this again. It&#x27;s smells okay for like, ten seconds, then it stinks like very cheap perfume, and doesn&#x27;t last at all. You can go to a discount dollar store and buy the cheapest bottle of 1.00 perfume and it will smell about the same as this stuff. And my boyfriend made fun of me for buying KISS perfume, to top it off. The Victoria Secret store has way better cheap perfumes for about the same price, less in the bottle, but who cares?</li>
            <li> Sometimes you may buy some thing that you have not  had bought before the person really loved this gift and I&#x27;m off the hook</li>
            <li> Most of us read these reviews skeptical if they will like it or not. I have always been a body spray type of person, always body mists in a plastic bottle. Never perfume in glass. So I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect, all I knew was there was a lot of positive reviews, so I took my chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a lot of the other reviewers have mentioned, it&#x27;s kind of hard to describe the scent. Each time I spray it, I try to figure out what it smells like, but I just cannot put my finger on it lol. It does however, smell very nice. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have an older lady musky smell, or a younger girl, in-your-face smell. It just smells.... good. My boyfriend likes it a lot, and being a very masculine guy who absolutely refuses having anything feminine to do with him or about him, he even let me spray some on his arm! He thinks it smells very good.. on girls of course ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re wondering if it&#x27;s a good scent, and worth the purchase, yes it is. You&#x27;ll be happy you bought it. A good price, and the bottle is actually pretty large. 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> Got this for my best friend. She loved it and even asked where she could buy more. Was definitely a great present. Especially if you love Kiss</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the army and I&#x27;m training in Arizona, we march to chow in the sweltering heat everyday and I got sick of smelling like sweat. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product and my bf tells me I smell awesome everyday, and he&#x27;s never shy about telling the truth!! Definitely recommend this to people who want the lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> have to admit I bought it cuz it was KISS... its ok perfume doesnt smell the best.. but its almost gone and I will keep the bottle....</li>
            <li> i have ordered this perfume before and there were no problems with it. but the last one that i ordered was opened and used.</li>
            <li> I like it, this perfume smells nice, it is sweet and nice smelling, the package came in good condition and for the price paid it is worth it! my coworker loved the perfume on me so I gave her my full bottle of perfume and she wants more, so I just ordered 2 more bottles, one for me and one for her!</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant buying this but for the price I couldnt beat it. I am not disappointed one bit! It smells amazing. Its feminine, great scent, strong but not overpowering. I am very surprised. This will be a staple in my perfume collection.</li>
            <li> This perfume was a suprise, thought it would smell cheap ! Not so---- well worth the money! Very sexy smell as well !</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in fragrance.  Not what I expected.  Would not recommend.  But that&#x27;s my personal opinion.  Better to buy a fragrance you can try first.</li>
            <li> I love this smell.  I am normally not a floral smell person, but this is light enough it works for me.  I&#x27;ve been looking for it for a couple years, not thinking Amazon had it all this time.</li>
            <li> Buenas tardes, les recomiendo esta fragancia huele bien. Gracias&lt;br /&gt;le volví a encargar otra fragancia espero que me llegue así como la otra .</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I&#x27;ve been looking for a big bottle for a while and finally found one that was worth the price! Not overpowering and smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> First time I am buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell,worth it for the price.I&#x27;ll recommend this to all my friends  :)</li>
            <li> I must say... I was very excited about this perfume after reading all the reviews of how AMAZING!! and GREAT!! this product was. I usually don&#x27;t buy perfume before smelling it and after this experience I know to stand by that through and through. I was so disappointed at the smell of this perfume. I seriously think I remember smelling something similar in my Grandmother&#x27;s house. I was very pleased with all the coupons and samples I received in my box. But that&#x27;s about it... I may give this to my Grandma or I might save it for when I&#x27;m 70.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an earlier post, I saw where if you are in your 20&#x27;s this product is not for you. I am 22 and I back that up. I am going back to my Armani: Code and Juicy Couture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully this product WAS cheap.</li>
            <li> I simply love this KISS scent for women and they are not carrying it in my stores anymore and the price was great on here. I will buy my perfume on line now.</li>
            <li> I really like this fragrance.  Its a great value and addition to my collection.  I&#x27;m glad I read the reviews.</li>
            <li> I purchased 5 bottles as stocking suffers and gifts.  Whats not to love about KISS it is just a great go to scent! I got it for $5.00 per bottle you can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> So I got this perfume for my birthday and I love it so much! It has hints of Dolce Gabanna Light Blue in it and I get plenty of compliments on it. The staying power is good but I am not sure if it is excellent. The only thing I can complain about is how the sprayer doesn&#x27;t work as well as a usual sprayer. This really is no problem because I don&#x27;t mind applying two more sprays than usual. It is a lovely fragrance and I was amazed by how big the bottle was.</li>
            <li> Not too strong very soothing scent! Never heard of Kiss before after good review i decided iam going to give it a try and sure was the best purchase!!!! big bottle too! received it so fast!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bigger sized bottle so love it for the price! I bought it for my mom since she loves kiss and I&#x27;m so excited to give it to her for christmas!</li>
            <li> IM A HUG KISS FAN AND TO HAVE A PERFUME MADE FOR FEMALES BY KISS IS JUST A MUST HAVE. TYPICAL SCENT BUT STILL LOVE TO WEAR IT OUT</li>
            <li> I bought this for fun and was shocked at how lovely the scent is. I wear it often and always get compliments. My husband seems to get more cuddly with me when I wear this.</li>
            <li> I quite like this spicy/aromatic fragrance. It is so light that I can spray it on like body mist. Yes, I&#x27;m granny age to some reviewers, and I&#x27;m madly in love with Ed Hardy fragrances, so age is no indication of taste, nyah. I was glad to get this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered and I got in fast and in one piece! I bought it as a gift and she loved it! It smells very good, pretty sexy!</li>
            <li> it would be more like a neutral smell, I had the one for men and I really did not like it at all, so I was scared this would be the same for this one, but actually it does smell decent, not too strong and it last for a while. it is not a teen smell for sure, I must say from ages between 24-50. and the chances are you might like it or might not.</li>
            <li> This perfume spray is not bad for the price.  It smells pretty good.  The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long, but for the price overall, its pretty good.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I like to try new scents. I would give it a five star but, it is not long lasting..i have to spray lots to keep good smelling. Next time i go to a $1.00 store and buy 9 dollars worth of impression scents</li>
            <li> Smells good light musky smell with a bit of sweet,, but the downfalls are it wears off very quickly and my bottle leaks if its not straight up which is annoying but it is worth the price</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend just based on the reviews. I figured for the price I&#x27;d take a chance. She loves it. It&#x27;s sweet but not too strong and has a unique scent. I like the fact that it&#x27;s not real common so you don&#x27;t smell it on every other girl, like you do alot of other perfumes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scent for about 5 years now, and it&#x27;s very hard to find. Thanx to Amazon, I can always find it, and always at a low cost. It smells expensive, but no one has to know how little i paid for it !!!</li>
            <li> Just purchased this perfume. Tested it on my skin and its amazing! I will be using this perfume as my everyday perfume! It is light, fun and sexy!</li>
            <li> My aunt bought a small bottle of this for me one Christmas and I loved it. This and Vampires are the only scents I wear now. I like the more masculine perfumes for women that don&#x27;t gag my allergies.</li>
            <li> My daughter love this parfume.  This is her second bottle.  Great sent, I would even wear it on occations.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was so excited about getting it. When I opened the box it was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I like the smell although the scent doesn&#x27;t stay with you long. It comes in a cute bottle. I mainly wanted it because it&#x27;s a parfume by Kiss. I wants to keep the bottle when the parfume is gone.</li>
            <li> I am not a huge KISS fan but I love this perfume!!  It is fresh, light, and not overly floral.</li>
