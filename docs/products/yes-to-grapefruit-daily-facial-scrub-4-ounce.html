            <li>a very mild and effective scrub.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product and the scrubbing effect.</li>
            <li>and I tried it and fell in love</li>
            <li>Definitely satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>Love all the yes-to products.</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, texture, and lack of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll update when the results are in :)</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite face scrub.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub.  </li>
            <li>Great gentle exfoliant and divine scent.</li>
            <li>and it has maintained healthy glowing skin with no breakouts.</li>
            <li>After using this for about two months, I&#x27;m not as in love with it anymore.</li>
            <li>some days it&#x27;s more a cloudy consistency...)</li>
            <li>If I get them they fade better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many scrubs and this is my go to now.</li>
            <li>Best facial scrub on the market in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>This is maybe my favorite scrub and definitely my favorite drug store scrub.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite Yesw To line.</li>
            <li>However, I still love the product and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>Love the scent too.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I try to make sure I keep it stocked at all times.</li>
            <li>I love it and so do my two sisters, to whom I have recommended it.</li>
            <li>ohhhh my god, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for about six months.  </li>
            <li>I also love the scent.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and throughly cleansed skin</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin smooth and glowing!</li>
            <li>Best facial scrub I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I love what this scrub does for my skin.</li>
            <li>I then ran out of the stuff and at the time I couldn&#x27;t get any more.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have fairly oily skin and (lucky me :P ) large pores.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh and smells great.</li>
            <li>The amazing aroma of a freshly cut grapefruit is intoxicating and invigorating.</li>
            <li>Not as chemically filled as many others.</li>
            <li>I rely on this stuff to make my skin soft and happy every night</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for my skin, not too tough and it smalls incredible.</li>
            <li>I love scrubs because I feel like it is truly getting my face clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and not to drying.</li>
            <li>It smells so good, if you like citrus and particularly grapefruit.  </li>
            <li>Nice concisity with very gentle exfoliant that did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the grapefruit scent and the way it leaves my face smooth and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>This one works fine</li>
            <li>I love this entire line, so nice!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super picky about my facial products and this one is a GOOD one!</li>
            <li>Switching to this scrub made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This is a great facial scrub.</li>
            <li>I like that this product is Paraben free, that&#x27;s why I bought it</li>
            <li>This scrub fit the bill.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating is gently and effective.</li>
            <li>and it has made my face really smooth and acne free.</li>
            <li>I use in the shower and enjoy the citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>awesome pantry filler item straight from Amazon w/ no extra trip to the supermarket needed!</li>
            <li>Love the fresh clean feeling.</li>
            <li>After each use, I notice that my skin tone has a nice, healthy glow and my face feels super soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>, along with my new Olay Pro-X Brush, Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner, and CeraVe cleanser and moisturizer, my skin has never been softer.</li>
            <li>Lovely, lovely natural grapefruit fragrance.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean after using this product.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the most amazing facial scrub.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super refreshing and the fine particles - while gentle on your skin - clean your face thoroughly, getting rid of all the leftover makeup and grease.</li>
            <li>like i do, its not reallly a true scrub which is great because it won&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right!  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a sweet grapefruit scent, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price and definitely worth repurchasing!</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>On the positive side, smell was quite pleasant, a nice citrus smell that was not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>(this was the only YES TO product that didn&#x27;t work for me), and the Repairing Night Cream, Nourishing Body Wash and Moisturizing Body Lotion from the YES TO Carrots line (these were all very good for my skin and even my husband loved the body wash and the lotion), and while I am mostly very satisfied with all of them, the YES TO Grapefruit Daily Facial Scrub is my one and only true</li>
            <li>Too soon to tell on any actual benefits, but it does clean and rinse nicely.</li>
            <li>This perfect, gentle exfoliator will help slough away dead skin and leave your skin feeling soft and smooth and looking radiant!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite face scrub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed it exfoliates my skin pretty well!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great wash for using a few times a week.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and citrus-y like grapefruits of course.</li>
            <li>I use it every day without irritation, and my skin feels fresh and glowing afterwards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27; serially worth a try.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about how nice this face wash is.</li>
            <li>Kept my face clean, smooth, and clear!</li>
            <li>Since trying this product, I have bought many other &amp;#34;YES TO&amp;#34; products and have been satisfied with them all.</li>
            <li>and now my skin is happy again; it is soft, smooth and glowing and my dark spots and scars are healing and fading.</li>
            <li>is right there in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>This product may be best for teens or ladies in their early twenties who do not need the extra moisture in a facial scrub.</li>
            <li>A gentle exfoliating wash that can be used daily with a light, refreshing grapefruit scent.</li>
            <li>After my job got me a free facial, the lady told me some things I should be doing more often, and I was looking for a new skincare regimen</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean and natural, exfoliates without drying.</li>
            <li>Definitely makes my skin brighter but not my favorite one that I have used.</li>
            <li>One fingertip&#x27;s worth cleans your whole face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a more of a grapefruit mixed with soap smell...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t blame that solely on the Yes to Grapefruit, but it&#x27;s enough to make me want to keep seeing if there isn&#x27;t a better cleanser for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This facial scrub is a favorite with me as well as my two daughters.</li>
            <li>I love this facial scrub -</li>
            <li>I love the facial scrubs, including this one, but ended up switching to the</li>
            <li>This, with its stellar reviews and just throwing in the fact</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like those sugar-coated gummy grapefruit wedges that you can buy at specialty candy stores, which makes me hungry.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of these soon, as I have no desire to switch to a different product.</li>
            <li>Really love the smell, feel and results from using this facial scrub!  </li>
            <li>I love how it literally shrinks my zits and that it actually smells like grapefruit.</li>
            <li>Such a refreshing  way to start the morning.</li>
            <li>However, the Mychelle fruit enzyme scrub, Alba pineapple enzyme scrub and Alba Even scrub worked much better for my 30-some combination skin because they contained larger scrub particles.</li>
            <li>but then again, that&#x27;s really what it is, right?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently switched to only using natural products and this is by far the best scrub.</li>
            <li>My acne is also clearing up very nicely, and no new acne is coming back.</li>
            <li>It is not overwhelming, just an amazing, sweet smell.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>the smell if this product is so great and the beads inside are not to rough so it can be used daily</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel squeaky clean but soft...</li>
            <li>Leaves skin clean &amp; soft.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your face clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>I really love this stuff, it is kinda like a 2 for 1 product, where it has the gentle exfoliation and also the softness of a silky daily cleanser,  </li>
            <li>(some days I get a squeeze full of exfoliators, some days it&#x27;s just clear cleanser,</li>
            <li>The product itself is great, but the bottle came open in the box and half the contents was spilled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I like it a lot better than some of the other brands I have tried (Clean &amp; Clear, Aveeno, even Murad)</li>
            <li>and I am trying not to since it seems like this face wash works fine without doing all the extra work.</li>
            <li>This scrub leaves my skin clean yet not dry!</li>
            <li>It is a very \\&quot;milky\\&quot;/sunscreen like liquid, feels \\&quot;sandy\\&quot; on skin.</li>
            <li>It does seem to leave a sandy residue on my face no matter how much I rinse</li>
            <li>Smells great and is a gentle enough scrub to use daily without rubbing your entire face off.  </li>
            <li>It really smells like you are washing your face with grapefruit.</li>
            <li>and I received it relatively fast.</li>
            <li>Smells like lemon and grapefruit and really helps even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I have very toned skin</li>
            <li>Feels like it is really exfoliating.</li>
            <li>It is exfoliating but gentle.</li>
            <li>I really like this face wash</li>
            <li>It works really well in removing dirt and oil.</li>
            <li>The smell is very citric-y (grapefruit)</li>
            <li>This has really helped my combination skin.</li>
            <li>I feel it looks brighter and feels much smoother.</li>
            <li>I just got the exfoliating cloths too and really like them.</li>
            <li>I wanted a facial cleanser with more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This calms my skin down and the smell is lovely, it is not overwhelming but just light and fruity enough to smell good.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It has grapefruit and lemon and therefore smells more bitter than sweet, which I personally like.</li>
            <li>I use it with the grapefruit serum and my skin has significantly improved in the last month.</li>
            <li>The texture is thicker than I usually prefer, but it does a good job cleaning my face and is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it does anything to clean out my pores but overall</li>
            <li>Felt refreshing, but really watered down feeling.</li>
            <li>have dry skin and use this in the summer and do fine with it.</li>
            <li>so sadly I have to shop online for it - thrilled to find it reasonably priced and available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t pay too much for (in my opinion)</li>
            <li>I broke down and got more of this stuff</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thinner and more gel-like than what I&#x27;ve used previously, but that isn&#x27;t an issue for me.</li>
            <li>I tried this only once, I absolutely love this product, I can see improvement especially in the  tone already!!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth and soft without making it scaly like traditional scrubs.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very vibrant and clear as well.</li>
            <li>and I also have large pores, which makes keeping my skin clear of blackheads a challenge.</li>
            <li>I really love that after working it in for a bit, this scrub starts to foam a little.</li>
            <li>I like this face wash because it definitely leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m loving the moisturizer, the dark spot correcting serum will take some time to see results as I&#x27;ve only been using for about 4-5 days now.</li>
            <li>We use this everyday at our house and we love it</li>
            <li>This scrub seems to exfoliate without drying or abusing my skin, the scent is fantastic and I&#x27;ve noticed my complexion is clearer when I use this than when I swap to some of my other cleansers.</li>
            <li>I was already planning on a new face scrub before I was halfway through with this bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has very fine beads for exfoliation, but is gentle enough for daily use even with my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Before buying this scrub,I was using a much harsher scrub (larger granules) and she could tell that it was too much for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have had back acne for years, and this cleared it up fast!</li>
            <li>delish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have any problems with acne, but I do get an occasional pimple around THAT time of the month, and using this facial scrub helped clean up my skin way faster than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
            <li>This stuff will make your skin soft and clear up any acne you have!</li>
            <li>love it, yes, but it is a little bothersome how necessary it has become to my routine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super abrasive, rinses clean, and has evened out my skin.  </li>
            <li>whether the product was old ...</li>
            <li>I work in an open kitchen restaurant, so even if I work at the cash register, my face still get very greasy at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I like that this is a mostly natural product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I have noticed any improvements to my skin as far as &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;reduce hyper pigmentation, correct skin damage and enhance radiance&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 99% natural, was placed it in my cart instead of an Aveeno</li>
            <li>had forgotten whether or not I liked the smell of grapefruit, but so many reviewers raved about it, so I thought &amp;#34;Why</li>
            <li>This is the only product that has gotten rid of the acne I&#x27;ve had my whole life.</li>
            <li>So far, I have tried the YES</li>
            <li>Not to mention smelling completely</li>
            <li>and so far I am seeing improvement on my face.</li>
            <li>I use it 3 times a week even with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>You barely need to squeeze out much liquid to use on your entire face as the product becomes foam once you use as directed.</li>
            <li>skin type is 50 years old, very oily t-zone and dry everywhere else.</li>
            <li>Not very grainy for exfoliating and has a funny smell - like a grapefruit that is about to mold.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been slowly switching to more natural skin care products, and I tried this one as an alternative to the Olay Regenerist facial scrub I was using.</li>
            <li>Since I began using this scrub over a year ago, I have noticed that my pores have become smaller, i have less blackheads, and even some of my sun/age damage has become less prominent!</li>
            <li>The last time I got a facial (after I had been using this for weeks), she said that my skin looks very well taken care of.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the ingredient list isn&#x27;t all that healthy -</li>
            <li>I use this every day and it is gentle enough to not irritate my skin, but still really buffs off the dead skin.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new in my daily facial routine, so I purchased this item.</li>
            <li>This scrub also does not seem to dry out my skin (I have normal to oily skin).</li>
            <li>used another scrub for a few days (when I ordered something from a skin care company they sent me a tiny sample of another exfoliating cleanser in the box) and my face felt SO clean, and then when I went back to Yes to Grapefruit, my skin felt like there was a residue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have acne problems and have normal skin (not oily or dry).</li>
            <li>And the exfoliating action is intense without being too harsh.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face clear and soft and minimal break outs.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my scars and I have very sensitive dry skin and miraculously this works with my skin.</li>
            <li>this scrub, a little goes a long way, so while it&#x27;s not the cheapest product on the market, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use everyday, but you may want to alternate days if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Rather than the fresh smell of grapefruit, there is a very harsh lemon smell that is rather off putting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle scrub with small particles, so if you have sensitive skin, it may work for you.</li>
            <li>At first use, it doesn&#x27;t feel as rough as expected.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that when I received it, there was no seal on the product and it seemed like it wasn&#x27;t entirely full.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the the produce is little runny and I will tend to squirt out too much.</li>

            <li> I usually buy it from target and the scrub has always smelled delicious and felt great on my skin.</li>
            <li> a very mild and effective scrub.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and the scrubbing effect.</li>

            <li> Definitely satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Love all the yes-to products.</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, texture, and lack of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll update when the results are in :)</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite face scrub.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub.  </li>
            <li> Great gentle exfoliant and divine scent.</li>
            <li> and it has maintained healthy glowing skin with no breakouts.</li>
            <li> After using this for about two months, I&#x27;m not as in love with it anymore.</li>
            <li> some days it&#x27;s more a cloudy consistency...)</li>
            <li> If I get them they fade better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many scrubs and this is my go to now.</li>
            <li> Best facial scrub on the market in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> This is maybe my favorite scrub and definitely my favorite drug store scrub.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite Yesw To line.</li>
            <li> However, I still love the product and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the scent too.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I try to make sure I keep it stocked at all times.</li>
            <li> I love it and so do my two sisters, to whom I have recommended it.</li>
            <li> ohhhh my god, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for about six months.  </li>
            <li> I also love the scent.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and throughly cleansed skin</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin smooth and glowing!</li>
            <li> Best facial scrub I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I love what this scrub does for my skin.</li>
            <li> I then ran out of the stuff and at the time I couldn&#x27;t get any more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin and (lucky me :P ) large pores.</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh and smells great.</li>
            <li> The amazing aroma of a freshly cut grapefruit is intoxicating and invigorating.</li>
            <li> Not as chemically filled as many others.</li>
            <li> I rely on this stuff to make my skin soft and happy every night</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for my skin, not too tough and it smalls incredible.</li>
            <li> I love scrubs because I feel like it is truly getting my face clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and not to drying.</li>
            <li> It smells so good, if you like citrus and particularly grapefruit.  </li>
            <li> Nice concisity with very gentle exfoliant that did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the grapefruit scent and the way it leaves my face smooth and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> This one works fine</li>
            <li> I love this entire line, so nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super picky about my facial products and this one is a GOOD one!</li>
            <li> Switching to this scrub made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial scrub.</li>
            <li> I like that this product is Paraben free, that&#x27;s why I bought it</li>
            <li> This scrub fit the bill.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating is gently and effective.</li>
            <li> and it has made my face really smooth and acne free.</li>
            <li> I use in the shower and enjoy the citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> awesome pantry filler item straight from Amazon w/ no extra trip to the supermarket needed!</li>
            <li> Love the fresh clean feeling.</li>
            <li> After each use, I notice that my skin tone has a nice, healthy glow and my face feels super soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> , along with my new Olay Pro-X Brush, Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner, and CeraVe cleanser and moisturizer, my skin has never been softer.</li>
            <li> Lovely, lovely natural grapefruit fragrance.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean after using this product.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the most amazing facial scrub.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super refreshing and the fine particles - while gentle on your skin - clean your face thoroughly, getting rid of all the leftover makeup and grease.</li>
            <li> like i do, its not reallly a true scrub which is great because it won&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just right!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a sweet grapefruit scent, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price and definitely worth repurchasing!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> On the positive side, smell was quite pleasant, a nice citrus smell that was not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> (this was the only YES TO product that didn&#x27;t work for me), and the Repairing Night Cream, Nourishing Body Wash and Moisturizing Body Lotion from the YES TO Carrots line (these were all very good for my skin and even my husband loved the body wash and the lotion), and while I am mostly very satisfied with all of them, the YES TO Grapefruit Daily Facial Scrub is my one and only true</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell on any actual benefits, but it does clean and rinse nicely.</li>
            <li> This perfect, gentle exfoliator will help slough away dead skin and leave your skin feeling soft and smooth and looking radiant!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite face scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed it exfoliates my skin pretty well!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a great wash for using a few times a week.</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh and citrus-y like grapefruits of course.</li>
            <li> I use it every day without irritation, and my skin feels fresh and glowing afterwards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27; serially worth a try.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about how nice this face wash is.</li>
            <li> Kept my face clean, smooth, and clear!</li>
            <li> Since trying this product, I have bought many other &amp;#34;YES TO&amp;#34; products and have been satisfied with them all.</li>
            <li> and now my skin is happy again; it is soft, smooth and glowing and my dark spots and scars are healing and fading.</li>
            <li> is right there in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This product may be best for teens or ladies in their early twenties who do not need the extra moisture in a facial scrub.</li>
            <li> A gentle exfoliating wash that can be used daily with a light, refreshing grapefruit scent.</li>
            <li> After my job got me a free facial, the lady told me some things I should be doing more often, and I was looking for a new skincare regimen</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean and natural, exfoliates without drying.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my skin brighter but not my favorite one that I have used.</li>
            <li> One fingertip&#x27;s worth cleans your whole face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a more of a grapefruit mixed with soap smell...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t blame that solely on the Yes to Grapefruit, but it&#x27;s enough to make me want to keep seeing if there isn&#x27;t a better cleanser for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This facial scrub is a favorite with me as well as my two daughters.</li>
            <li> I love this facial scrub -</li>
            <li> I love the facial scrubs, including this one, but ended up switching to the</li>
            <li> This, with its stellar reviews and just throwing in the fact</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like those sugar-coated gummy grapefruit wedges that you can buy at specialty candy stores, which makes me hungry.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of these soon, as I have no desire to switch to a different product.</li>
            <li> Really love the smell, feel and results from using this facial scrub!  </li>
            <li> I love how it literally shrinks my zits and that it actually smells like grapefruit.</li>
            <li> Such a refreshing  way to start the morning.</li>
            <li> However, the Mychelle fruit enzyme scrub, Alba pineapple enzyme scrub and Alba Even scrub worked much better for my 30-some combination skin because they contained larger scrub particles.</li>
            <li> but then again, that&#x27;s really what it is, right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched to only using natural products and this is by far the best scrub.</li>
            <li> My acne is also clearing up very nicely, and no new acne is coming back.</li>
            <li> It is not overwhelming, just an amazing, sweet smell.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> the smell if this product is so great and the beads inside are not to rough so it can be used daily</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel squeaky clean but soft...</li>
            <li> Leaves skin clean &amp; soft.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your face clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, it is kinda like a 2 for 1 product, where it has the gentle exfoliation and also the softness of a silky daily cleanser,  </li>
            <li> (some days I get a squeeze full of exfoliators, some days it&#x27;s just clear cleanser,</li>
            <li> The product itself is great, but the bottle came open in the box and half the contents was spilled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I like it a lot better than some of the other brands I have tried (Clean &amp; Clear, Aveeno, even Murad)</li>
            <li> and I am trying not to since it seems like this face wash works fine without doing all the extra work.</li>
            <li> This scrub leaves my skin clean yet not dry!</li>
            <li> It is a very \\&quot;milky\\&quot;/sunscreen like liquid, feels \\&quot;sandy\\&quot; on skin.</li>
            <li> It does seem to leave a sandy residue on my face no matter how much I rinse</li>
            <li> Smells great and is a gentle enough scrub to use daily without rubbing your entire face off.  </li>
            <li> It really smells like you are washing your face with grapefruit.</li>
            <li> and I received it relatively fast.</li>
            <li> Smells like lemon and grapefruit and really helps even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have very toned skin</li>
            <li> Feels like it is really exfoliating.</li>
            <li> It is exfoliating but gentle.</li>
            <li> I really like this face wash</li>
            <li> It works really well in removing dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> The smell is very citric-y (grapefruit)</li>
            <li> This has really helped my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I feel it looks brighter and feels much smoother.</li>
            <li> I just got the exfoliating cloths too and really like them.</li>
            <li> I wanted a facial cleanser with more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This calms my skin down and the smell is lovely, it is not overwhelming but just light and fruity enough to smell good.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It has grapefruit and lemon and therefore smells more bitter than sweet, which I personally like.</li>
            <li> I use it with the grapefruit serum and my skin has significantly improved in the last month.</li>
            <li> The texture is thicker than I usually prefer, but it does a good job cleaning my face and is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it does anything to clean out my pores but overall</li>
            <li> Felt refreshing, but really watered down feeling.</li>
            <li> have dry skin and use this in the summer and do fine with it.</li>
            <li> so sadly I have to shop online for it - thrilled to find it reasonably priced and available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t pay too much for (in my opinion)</li>
            <li> I broke down and got more of this stuff</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thinner and more gel-like than what I&#x27;ve used previously, but that isn&#x27;t an issue for me.</li>
            <li> I tried this only once, I absolutely love this product, I can see improvement especially in the  tone already!!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth and soft without making it scaly like traditional scrubs.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very vibrant and clear as well.</li>
            <li> and I also have large pores, which makes keeping my skin clear of blackheads a challenge.</li>
            <li> I really love that after working it in for a bit, this scrub starts to foam a little.</li>
            <li> I like this face wash because it definitely leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m loving the moisturizer, the dark spot correcting serum will take some time to see results as I&#x27;ve only been using for about 4-5 days now.</li>
            <li> We use this everyday at our house and we love it</li>
            <li> This scrub seems to exfoliate without drying or abusing my skin, the scent is fantastic and I&#x27;ve noticed my complexion is clearer when I use this than when I swap to some of my other cleansers.</li>
            <li> I was already planning on a new face scrub before I was halfway through with this bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has very fine beads for exfoliation, but is gentle enough for daily use even with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Before buying this scrub,I was using a much harsher scrub (larger granules) and she could tell that it was too much for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have had back acne for years, and this cleared it up fast!</li>
            <li> delish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have any problems with acne, but I do get an occasional pimple around THAT time of the month, and using this facial scrub helped clean up my skin way faster than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
            <li> This stuff will make your skin soft and clear up any acne you have!</li>
            <li> love it, yes, but it is a little bothersome how necessary it has become to my routine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super abrasive, rinses clean, and has evened out my skin.  </li>
            <li> whether the product was old ...</li>
            <li> I work in an open kitchen restaurant, so even if I work at the cash register, my face still get very greasy at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I like that this is a mostly natural product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I have noticed any improvements to my skin as far as &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;reduce hyper pigmentation, correct skin damage and enhance radiance&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s 99% natural, was placed it in my cart instead of an Aveeno</li>
            <li> had forgotten whether or not I liked the smell of grapefruit, but so many reviewers raved about it, so I thought &amp;#34;Why</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has gotten rid of the acne I&#x27;ve had my whole life.</li>
            <li> So far, I have tried the YES</li>
            <li> Not to mention smelling completely</li>
            <li> and so far I am seeing improvement on my face.</li>
            <li> I use it 3 times a week even with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You barely need to squeeze out much liquid to use on your entire face as the product becomes foam once you use as directed.</li>
            <li> skin type is 50 years old, very oily t-zone and dry everywhere else.</li>
            <li> Not very grainy for exfoliating and has a funny smell - like a grapefruit that is about to mold.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly switching to more natural skin care products, and I tried this one as an alternative to the Olay Regenerist facial scrub I was using.</li>
            <li> Since I began using this scrub over a year ago, I have noticed that my pores have become smaller, i have less blackheads, and even some of my sun/age damage has become less prominent!</li>
            <li> The last time I got a facial (after I had been using this for weeks), she said that my skin looks very well taken care of.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the ingredient list isn&#x27;t all that healthy -</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it is gentle enough to not irritate my skin, but still really buffs off the dead skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new in my daily facial routine, so I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> This scrub also does not seem to dry out my skin (I have normal to oily skin).</li>
            <li> used another scrub for a few days (when I ordered something from a skin care company they sent me a tiny sample of another exfoliating cleanser in the box) and my face felt SO clean, and then when I went back to Yes to Grapefruit, my skin felt like there was a residue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acne problems and have normal skin (not oily or dry).</li>
            <li> And the exfoliating action is intense without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clear and soft and minimal break outs.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my scars and I have very sensitive dry skin and miraculously this works with my skin.</li>
            <li> this scrub, a little goes a long way, so while it&#x27;s not the cheapest product on the market, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough to use everyday, but you may want to alternate days if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Rather than the fresh smell of grapefruit, there is a very harsh lemon smell that is rather off putting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle scrub with small particles, so if you have sensitive skin, it may work for you.</li>
            <li> At first use, it doesn&#x27;t feel as rough as expected.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when I received it, there was no seal on the product and it seemed like it wasn&#x27;t entirely full.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the the produce is little runny and I will tend to squirt out too much.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day with special attention given to my T-zone where I usually get lots of blackheads.</li>
            <li> The product rinses clean, so grit is left behind.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The 4 oz of it made me worried, thinking it won&#x27;t last me long, but I only use about 1-2 pea drop sizes and it covers my face</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure the appearance of those have changed much.</li>
            <li> its was nothing but pure runny liquid and hard white crusty chunks in it.</li>
            <li> small tubes of facial products since I use them on a daily basis, but this one completely surprised me!</li>
            <li> However, I this left my face with a really dry feeling</li>
            <li> but some trouble spots, hoping some of the products I am using will get y skin back to silky soft again eventually,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with uneven complexion and acne for years, and people have noticed a marked difference in my skin since I began using this (combined with the grapefruit CC cream).  </li>
            <li> A few months ago I had bought this stuff and it cleared up my acne and made my face feel polished, soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> Very concentrated so a little goes a long way,  it will last longer ever though it seems like a small 4 oz tube</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every morning after searching for years for something that cleaned my face without leaving me feeling like I had just excavated every single drop of moisture from it.  </li>
            <li> To Grapefruit facial moisturizer and dark spot correcting serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also noticing less grease in the T-zone, especially around the corners of my nose.</li>
            <li> The consistency took a little getting used to as it is not as thick as the Olay scrub, but that&#x27;s the only draw back and now that I&#x27;m used to it, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Minus one star since it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I was not really impressed with this product overall, but gave it three stars because I live overseas</li>
            <li> I also like the little scrubs inside of the gel, they&#x27;re small enough to get those pesky blackheads but not big or hard enough to scratch your skin to pieces.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel overly dry or tight afterwards either.</li>
            <li> I use this scrub every other day.</li>
            <li> I expected that I would have to make some sacrifice in quality in order to get cruelty-free products, but that is not the case!</li>
            <li> I have used other scrubs that seems to feel like they scratch my skin.  </li>
            <li> Had to try all the other grapefruit products.</li>
            <li> Leaves you a little dry</li>
            <li> It also helped even out my skin tone and get rid of the dark circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of my dark spots have disappeared.</li>
            <li> But other than, this is my HG scrub!</li>
            <li> I then mix a little cleanser with it and rub it around my face before rinsing.  </li>
            <li> This does leave my skin a little flakey in the winter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells like a very sour grapefruit.</li>
            <li> I bought this scrub because I was having trouble finding another citrus scrub that I use all the time.</li>
            <li> have had a few breakouts, as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product helps lighten dark spots like another reviewer had mentioned</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least a month and a half</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have bad skin days anymore</li>
            <li> or i am not sure of the case....</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure any improvements have been made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult for me to find in local stores</li>
            <li> It does brighten my skin whenever it looks dull.  </li>
            <li> I used to want a hard exfoliating wash until I realized those are damaging.</li>
            <li> I used to scrub my face too hard</li>
            <li> I may be slowly Pavlovian-ing myself</li>
            <li> but I hate the weird smell, plus it didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but it definitely wakes me up.</li>
            <li> I was overall disappointed by this scrub.</li>
            <li> It broke out worse, even after two weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin tingles when I apply my serums (Mad Hippie) afterward.</li>
            <li> If I do not have this I will be sad because my skin will then continue to freak out!</li>
            <li> its smelled really bad</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get brown marks from blemishes as bad as I used to.</li>
            <li> I had used another cleanser I still had on my bathroom shelf, and my face hated it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but the smell is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and the scrubbing effect. Leaves you a little dry so I use the Yes to Cucumber moisturizer after I use it.</li>
            <li> This scrub is amazing!!! :D</li>
            <li> whether the product was old ...or i am not sure of the case.... its smelled really bad its was nothing but pure runny liquid and hard white crusty chunks in it.</li>
            <li> Not a gritty scrub.  Not a wimpy scrub.  It&#x27;s just right!  Lovely, lovely natural grapefruit fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love the fresh clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I use this scrub every other day. Ironically my boyfriend had this in his shower and I tried it and fell in love so I had to get one myself! It&#x27;s cheaper here as an add-on item than at my local Target or Walmart so I figured why not. I use it every other day with special attention given to my T-zone where I usually get lots of blackheads. I&#x27;ve noticed it exfoliates my skin pretty well! Definitely satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> a very mild and effective scrub. it leaves my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Love all the yes-to products. Definitely makes my skin brighter but not my favorite one that I have used. Prefer carrots, cucumbers, and tomatoes.</li>
            <li> It was ok. Felt refreshing, but really watered down feeling. I was already planning on a new face scrub before I was halfway through with this bottle.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, texture, and lack of chemicals.  Perfect exfoliant &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; size...not too abrasive that it irritates your skin.  My husband uses it too - he likes it before he shaves.</li>
            <li> I work in an open kitchen restaurant, so even if I work at the cash register, my face still get very greasy at the end of the day. This scrub leaves my skin clean yet not dry! Just love it!  Plus it smells very refreshing!</li>
            <li> This stuff will make your skin soft and clear up any acne you have! Its the best, highly recommend! I have had back acne for years, and this cleared it up fast!</li>
            <li> I bought this scrub because I was having trouble finding another citrus scrub that I use all the time. This one works fine but the smell is horrible. I was expecting a bright, sweet, citrusy smell. It&#x27;s nothing like that. It&#x27;s smells like a very sour grapefruit. After using it once, I had to wash my face with soap to remove the fragrance but the smell lingered in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super picky about my facial products and this one is a GOOD one! It makes your skin feel squeaky clean but soft...How does it do that? I don&#x27;t know either but I love it! The smell is fresh and citrus-y like grapefruits of course. I also bought the Yes To Grapefruit facial moisturizer and dark spot correcting serum. While I&#x27;m loving the moisturizer, the dark spot correcting serum will take some time to see results as I&#x27;ve only been using for about 4-5 days now. So I&#x27;ll update when the results are in :)</li>
            <li> This is a great facial scrub. I use it every day without irritation, and my skin feels fresh and glowing afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite face scrub. It&#x27;s has very fine beads for exfoliation, but is gentle enough for daily use even with my dry skin. The smell is great and a little goes a long way. The only downside is that the the produce is little runny and I will tend to squirt out too much. But other than, this is my HG scrub!</li>
            <li> Carry in bag for gym or freshening up. Very nice</li>
            <li> This face wash smells SO good and cleanses great. My skin gets so oily and it keeps the oil at bay for a couple of days. The best thing I love about it is that the company is organic and doesn&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li> This face wash smells really excellent, and provides the right amount of exfoliation. I like using it as a morning face wash.</li>
            <li> Too thin/watery than I would prefer.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been slowly switching to more natural skin care products, and I tried this one as an alternative to the Olay Regenerist facial scrub I was using. I love the grapefruit scent and the way it leaves my face smooth and clean feeling. The consistency took a little getting used to as it is not as thick as the Olay scrub, but that&#x27;s the only draw back and now that I&#x27;m used to it, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> A great exfoliant for the morning, gives skin a cooling feeling. Bright citrusy scent. It is a very \\&quot;milky\\&quot;/sunscreen like liquid, feels \\&quot;sandy\\&quot; on skin. One fingertip&#x27;s worth cleans your whole face.</li>
            <li> I like the grapefruit scent of this product during my morning shower - very refreshing and helps wake me up. The texture is thicker than I usually prefer, but it does a good job cleaning my face and is gentle on my sensitive skin. I would buy it again, but wouldn&#x27;t necessarily prefer it over similar facial scrubs.</li>
            <li> awesome pantry filler item straight from Amazon w/ no extra trip to the supermarket needed!</li>
            <li> I like that this product is Paraben free, that&#x27;s why I bought it but I hate the weird smell, plus it didn&#x27;t last long at all. I am going back to my Neutrogena grapefruit scrub!</li>
            <li> This face wash is great.  I bought it because I want to stop using products that test on animals.  I expected that I would have to make some sacrifice in quality in order to get cruelty-free products, but that is not the case! I&#x27;ve struggled with uneven complexion and acne for years, and people have noticed a marked difference in my skin since I began using this (combined with the grapefruit CC cream).  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> SMELLS WONDERFUL!!! I am self-proclaimed grapefruit addict, and feel like I&#x27;m in heaven everytime I use this wash. It&#x27;s also a plus that my face feels really nice after washing :)</li>
            <li> It does brighten my skin whenever it looks dull.  The product rinses clean, so grit is left behind.  Smells nice, too.</li>
            <li> I like this face wash because it definitely leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. It does seem to leave a sandy residue on my face no matter how much I rinse and I don&#x27;t think it does anything to clean out my pores but overall, it&#x27;s a great wash for using a few times a week. As for the smell, I kind of like it. It&#x27;s really a more of a grapefruit mixed with soap smell... but then again, that&#x27;s really what it is, right?</li>
            <li> I love this scrub.  Smells great and is a gentle enough scrub to use daily without rubbing your entire face off.  I have used other scrubs that seems to feel like they scratch my skin.  This scrub does not do that and feels great to use at the end of the day.  This scrub also does not seem to dry out my skin (I have normal to oily skin).</li>
            <li> Great gentle exfoliant and divine scent. It really smells like you are washing your face with grapefruit. In fact, my husband asked if I could buy grapefruit juice to drink with breakfast because he gets such a craving from using it in the morning! The citrus scent is a great energizing way to start your morning and it has maintained healthy glowing skin with no breakouts.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, it is kinda like a 2 for 1 product, where it has the gentle exfoliation and also the softness of a silky daily cleanser,  Absolutely love at Yes To Products!!!</li>
            <li> After using this for about two months, I&#x27;m not as in love with it anymore. As others have noted, it is a bit inconsistent (some days I get a squeeze full of exfoliators, some days it&#x27;s just clear cleanser, some days it&#x27;s more a cloudy consistency...) and I actually find that it can leave a bit of a greasy residue behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used another scrub for a few days (when I ordered something from a skin care company they sent me a tiny sample of another exfoliating cleanser in the box) and my face felt SO clean, and then when I went back to Yes to Grapefruit, my skin felt like there was a residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a few breakouts, as well. I can&#x27;t blame that solely on the Yes to Grapefruit, but it&#x27;s enough to make me want to keep seeing if there isn&#x27;t a better cleanser for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it a lot better than some of the other brands I have tried (Clean &amp; Clear, Aveeno, even Murad) but I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s The One for me.</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean and natural, exfoliates without drying.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean after using this product. Using it twice a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched to only using natural products and this is by far the best scrub. My face is always smooth and the smell is great.</li>
            <li> I got this with the towelettes and alternate use. At first use, it doesn&#x27;t feel as rough as expected. I used to want a hard exfoliating wash until I realized those are damaging. So you won&#x27;t feel your skin scraping during use and that&#x27;s a good thing. I used to scrub my face too hard and I am trying not to since it seems like this face wash works fine without doing all the extra work. It is gentle enough to use everyday, but you may want to alternate days if you have sensitive skin. It did not cause acne or exacerbate any acne I already had. In about 3 weeks I have noticed my skin is overall clearer and I don&#x27;t get brown marks from blemishes as bad as I used to. If I get them they fade better.</li>
            <li> This facial scrub is a favorite with me as well as my two daughters. The Amazon price is lower than our local chain drugstores</li>
            <li> This is great if you have senstive.dry skin like i do, its not reallly a true scrub which is great because it won&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Walgreens as an impulse buy. I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;ve tried many scrubs and this is my go to now. It&#x27;s thinner and more gel-like than what I&#x27;ve used previously, but that isn&#x27;t an issue for me. My skin tingles when I apply my serums (Mad Hippie) afterward. My thought is that they&#x27;re actually penetrating my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin type is 50 years old, very oily t-zone and dry everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I love this facial scrub - it&#x27;s great for my skin, not too tough and it smalls incredible. Since trying this product, I have bought many other &amp;#34;YES TO&amp;#34; products and have been satisfied with them all.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new in my daily facial routine, so I purchased this item. The smell is wonderful, and I like that it is a clear gel. However, I this left my face with a really dry feeling and I broke out a bit after using. I was not really impressed with this product overall, but gave it three stars because I live overseas and I received it relatively fast. This product may be best for teens or ladies in their early twenties who do not need the extra moisture in a facial scrub.</li>
            <li> This has the best scent! I love the facial scrubs, including this one, but ended up switching to the Yes To Tomatoes line.</li>
            <li> Best facial scrub on the market in my opinion.  Leaves skin clean &amp; soft.  Not as chemically filled as many others.</li>
            <li> This is maybe my favorite scrub and definitely my favorite drug store scrub.  It makes my skin very vibrant and clear as well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Yesw To line. I get comments all the time about how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it is gentle enough to not irritate my skin, but still really buffs off the dead skin. Smells like lemon and grapefruit and really helps even out my skin tone. I love this entire line, so nice!</li>
            <li> I tried this only once, I absolutely love this product, I can see improvement especially in the  tone already!! I have very toned skin but some trouble spots, hoping some of the products I am using will get y skin back to silky soft again eventually, but this product is fantastic!!</li>
            <li> I like that this is a mostly natural product. It smells nice. Makes me feel like summer is right there in my bathroom. I love scrubs because I feel like it is truly getting my face clean. I use this scrub once daily. I don&#x27;t know if I have noticed any improvements to my skin as far as &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;reduce hyper pigmentation, correct skin damage and enhance radiance&amp;#34;. This is my second bottle and I&#x27;m not sure any improvements have been made. I don&#x27;t have acne problems and have normal skin (not oily or dry). I do have a lot of sun spots or freckles and I&#x27;m not sure the appearance of those have changed much. However, I still love the product and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it! Works so well for me. Love the scent too. Had to try all the other grapefruit products.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the smell. A scrub without being abrasive.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every morning after searching for years for something that cleaned my face without leaving me feeling like I had just excavated every single drop of moisture from it.  This magic grapefruit concoction smells amazing and does the job, and I have no idea what I will do if Say Yes To ever decides to discontinue it.  No burning, no irritation, no breakouts - this stuff solved all of my morning face problems.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this facial cleanser for months now and there is nothing like it. There is a noticable difference in my face when I run out and I try to make sure I keep it stocked at all times. Keeps my face clear and soft and minimal break outs. No irritation and keeps the oil at bay. The only cleanser I will buy.</li>
            <li> I love it and so do my two sisters, to whom I have recommended it.</li>
            <li> After my job got me a free facial, the lady told me some things I should be doing more often, and I was looking for a new skincare regimen, I wanted my skin to feel amazing every day. One thing I was looking for was a scrub to exfoliate. This, with its stellar reviews and just throwing in the fact it&#x27;s 99% natural, was placed it in my cart instead of an Aveeno scrub.&lt;br /&gt;And ohhhh my god, I love this stuff. I have a Tree Hut body scrub, and in comparison, this is a LOT gentler, because it&#x27;s for your face. I really love that after working it in for a bit, this scrub starts to foam a little. It just makes me feel a bit cleaner, and lets me see where I&#x27;ve gotten.&lt;br /&gt;The 4 oz of it made me worried, thinking it won&#x27;t last me long, but I only use about 1-2 pea drop sizes and it covers my face fine!&lt;br /&gt;I had forgotten whether or not I liked the smell of grapefruit, but so many reviewers raved about it, so I thought &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34; It smells amazing. It is not overwhelming, just an amazing, sweet smell.&lt;br /&gt;This, along with my new Olay Pro-X Brush, Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner, and CeraVe cleanser and moisturizer, my skin has never been softer. I really don&#x27;t have bad skin days anymore, I&#x27;m going out every day without makeup. I rely on this stuff to make my skin soft and happy every night</li>
            <li> Great scent, will really wake you up in the morning! Feels like it is really exfoliating. Minus one star since it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I wanted a facial cleanser with more natural ingredients. This scrub fit the bill. It is exfoliating but gentle. It smells awesome too!</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin and (lucky me :P ) large pores. This scrub seems to exfoliate without drying or abusing my skin, the scent is fantastic and I&#x27;ve noticed my complexion is clearer when I use this than when I swap to some of my other cleansers. It&#x27;s difficult for me to find in local stores so sadly I have to shop online for it - thrilled to find it reasonably priced and available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Use daily and have seen improvement in skin</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance. Effective face-wash. Inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin and use this in the summer and do fine with it. In the winter I will switch to something else and just use this once a week or so.</li>
            <li> Not very grainy for exfoliating and has a funny smell - like a grapefruit that is about to mold.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Awesome natural face wash.  It smells so good, if you like citrus and particularly grapefruit.  The exfoliating is gently and effective.</li>
            <li> The product itself is great, but the bottle came open in the box and half the contents was spilled. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin too much. Could not continue using.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell on any actual benefits, but it does clean and rinse nicely. The smell is not what I was expecting. Rather than the fresh smell of grapefruit, there is a very harsh lemon smell that is rather off putting. Nice concisity with very gentle exfoliant that did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a sweet grapefruit scent, this isn&#x27;t it. It has grapefruit and lemon and therefore smells more bitter than sweet, which I personally like. I really like this face wash, it smells nice and feels good to put on. My only complaint is that when I received it, there was no seal on the product and it seemed like it wasn&#x27;t entirely full. It seemed like either it had been used or they just don&#x27;t give you enough product. However, I decided to keep it and I like it. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for about six months.  I spread it over my face when I get in the shower and leave it on while I shampoo and wash.  I then mix a little cleanser with it and rub it around my face before rinsing.  Like all of the &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; products, the fruity smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> As a fan of the Yes to.... products line, this facial scrub did not disappoint. A gentle exfoliating wash that can be used daily with a light, refreshing grapefruit scent. It smells exactly like those sugar-coated gummy grapefruit wedges that you can buy at specialty candy stores, which makes me hungry. I may be slowly Pavlovian-ing myself every time I wash my face but damn if my skin doesn&#x27;t look amazing.</li>
            <li> I have used yes to grapefruit scrub for years now. I usually buy it from target and the scrub has always smelled delicious and felt great on my skin. After ordering a bottle from amazon, it&#x27;s not the same product. It smells gross and the bottle and scrub consistency are different. It&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li> Great scrub!  Leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.  I also love the scent.</li>
            <li> This product makes my face feel so good and I like the citrus fragrance...not overpowering, but rather a hint of grapefruit.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it with the entire line now, but even when I just used the serum, I could tell it was a quality line.&lt;br /&gt;It cleared up my acne scars beautifully. Only problem is that when I ran out I was breaking out and they came back until I bought it again.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, yes, but it is a little bothersome how necessary it has become to my routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least a month and a half and it has made my face really smooth and acne free. I will continue to use this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has gotten rid of the acne I&#x27;ve had my whole life. This does leave my skin a little flakey in the winter but I just use this at night and Yes to Tomato in the morning during the colder months. That seems to help with the dryness.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and throughly cleansed skin, I use it three times a week . I really love this grainy, bubbly skin purifing product! Very concentrated so a little goes a long way,  it will last longer ever though it seems like a small 4 oz tube</li>
            <li> So far, I have tried the YES TO Cucumber Facial Towelletes (this was the only YES TO product that didn&#x27;t work for me), and the Repairing Night Cream, Nourishing Body Wash and Moisturizing Body Lotion from the YES TO Carrots line (these were all very good for my skin and even my husband loved the body wash and the lotion), and while I am mostly very satisfied with all of them, the YES TO Grapefruit Daily Facial Scrub is my one and only true love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like real grapefruit (in the most wonderful way you can imagine), and just using it in the morning (or before going to sleep), makes me feel happy. It&#x27;s super refreshing and the fine particles - while gentle on your skin - clean your face thoroughly, getting rid of all the leftover makeup and grease. It leaves your skin smooth and glowing! Not to mention smelling completely delish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have any problems with acne, but I do get an occasional pimple around THAT time of the month, and using this facial scrub helped clean up my skin way faster than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used before. It also helped even out my skin tone and get rid of the dark circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this scrub, a little goes a long way, so while it&#x27;s not the cheapest product on the market, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money. I will be buying more of these soon, as I have no desire to switch to a different product. This is THE product for me.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite face scrub. I use it morning and night and just love the feel and smell! The amazing aroma of a freshly cut grapefruit is intoxicating and invigorating. And the exfoliating action is intense without being too harsh. It&#x27; serially worth a try.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but it definitely wakes me up. The last time I got a facial (after I had been using this for weeks), she said that my skin looks very well taken care of. Before buying this scrub,I was using a much harsher scrub (larger granules) and she could tell that it was too much for my skin. Switching to this scrub made a huge difference. I&#x27;m also noticing less grease in the T-zone, especially around the corners of my nose.</li>
            <li> Really love the smell, feel and results from using this facial scrub!  It&#x27;s not super abrasive, rinses clean, and has evened out my skin.  My only complaint is that the ingredient list isn&#x27;t all that healthy - it has a 4 or 5 rating on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep.  Would be 5 stars if it was better for me!</li>
            <li> Great cleanser.  I use in the shower and enjoy the citrus scent.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> I only used it for a month and so far I am seeing improvement on my face. Some of my dark spots have disappeared. I love how it literally shrinks my zits and that it actually smells like grapefruit. I am looking forward to buying it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product helps lighten dark spots like another reviewer had mentioned but that&#x27;s not what I was looking for. I bought this because I wanted a nonabrasive scrub that I could use on a daily basis and this serve the purpose. It works really well in removing dirt and oil. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> We use this everyday at our house and we love it</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about how nice this face wash is. Such a refreshing  way to start the morning. Leaves your face clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t pay too much for (in my opinion) small tubes of facial products since I use them on a daily basis, but this one completely surprised me! You barely need to squeeze out much liquid to use on your entire face as the product becomes foam once you use as directed. The smell is very citric-y (grapefruit) so that could be a downside to some folks. Kept my face clean, smooth, and clear! Definitely worth the price and definitely worth repurchasing!</li>
            <li> love this stuff!  it leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh and smells great.</li>
            <li> I was overall disappointed by this scrub. On the positive side, smell was quite pleasant, a nice citrus smell that was not overwhelming. However, the Mychelle fruit enzyme scrub, Alba pineapple enzyme scrub and Alba Even scrub worked much better for my 30-some combination skin because they contained larger scrub particles. In the summer, I found that this grapefruit scrub just wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; enough and I haven&#x27;t bothered with it in the colder weather. It&#x27;s a gentle scrub with small particles, so if you have sensitive skin, it may work for you.</li>
            <li> This has really helped my combination skin. I feel it looks brighter and feels much smoother. No breakouts. And I like the smell. I just got the exfoliating cloths too and really like them.</li>
            <li> Best facial scrub I have ever used! Who knew grapefruit and lemon balm were miracle workers for your skin?! This perfect, gentle exfoliator will help slough away dead skin and leave your skin feeling soft and smooth and looking radiant! I have several sun/age spots on my face and I also have large pores, which makes keeping my skin clear of blackheads a challenge. Since I began using this scrub over a year ago, I have noticed that my pores have become smaller, i have less blackheads, and even some of my sun/age damage has become less prominent! After each use, I notice that my skin tone has a nice, healthy glow and my face feels super soft afterwards. Did i mention it smells delicious?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my scars and I have very sensitive dry skin and miraculously this works with my skin. It makes my skin smooth and soft without making it scaly like traditional scrubs. I use it with the grapefruit serum and my skin has significantly improved in the last month. Definitely a good buy and line of products</li>
            <li> I love what this scrub does for my skin. I even like the smell. I use it 3 times a week even with my sensitive skin. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Pfttt... After 2 days of using it or so I broke out like Nothing happened So, Nope.</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> This has a nice smell and leaves my skin feeling rejuvenated but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the most amazing facial scrub. Does the job though.</li>
            <li> the smell if this product is so great and the beads inside are not to rough so it can be used daily</li>
            <li> A few months ago I had bought this stuff and it cleared up my acne and made my face feel polished, soft and glowing. I then ran out of the stuff and at the time I couldn&#x27;t get any more. I had used another cleanser I still had on my bathroom shelf, and my face hated it. It broke out worse, even after two weeks. I broke down and got more of this stuff and now my skin is happy again; it is soft, smooth and glowing and my dark spots and scars are healing and fading. My acne is also clearing up very nicely, and no new acne is coming back. I love this stuff. It is my go to product. If I do not have this I will be sad because my skin will then continue to freak out! This calms my skin down and the smell is lovely, it is not overwhelming but just light and fruity enough to smell good. It also doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel overly dry or tight afterwards either. I also like the little scrubs inside of the gel, they&#x27;re small enough to get those pesky blackheads but not big or hard enough to scratch your skin to pieces.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft and clean feeling.  It helps even out skin tone.  Easy to use and not to drying.</li>
