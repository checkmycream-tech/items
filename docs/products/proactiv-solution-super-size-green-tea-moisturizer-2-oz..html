            <li>This is the best moisturizer ever!  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a very good moisturizer</li>
            <li>This product is actually a great after shave lotion for someone with inclinations towards acne.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with how this moisturizer absorbs nicely into my skin.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even safe for under the eyes!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch</li>
            <li>So...if you are NOT looking for a product that would help you with your acne, this cream is actually very light and refreshing, and feels very nice and calming on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizers nice but did not shrink whiteheads.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase, and will be ordering more when needed.</li>
            <li>&amp; I was happy I got it so quickly after order was placed.</li>
            <li>Not as rich as I would have liked and washes off with water, but when you need quick moisture that soothes the skin, this is great.</li>
            <li>This product goes on very smoothly, and moisturizes until I wash it off.</li>
            <li>so I ordered this large size and I am very pleased!</li>
            <li>Since it was formulated to work as a set, it is better to use it that way in the end.</li>
            <li>I love all proactiv products, i have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>Just makes my skin feel softer, cleaner and better.</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied with product and how much better my skin feels now.  </li>
            <li>Love the size.  </li>
            <li>Great for combination skin or the skin of mixed girls like me :)</li>
            <li>I bought the original set for my 14 year old grandson, it did a great job removing his acne.  </li>
            <li>Huge.  </li>
            <li>Huge bottle</li>
            <li>Light summer moisturizer.</li>
            <li>A nice, light moisturizer that really makes my skin feel fresh and not clogged up by something heavier.</li>
            <li>For instance, rosehip oil is a wonderful moisturizer when mixed with natural face lotion.</li>
            <li>So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is light, non greasy and very soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>There are so many natural and cheaper skin remedies.</li>
            <li>Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice light cream that I enjoyed using DESPITE the fact that none of the Proactiv products work worth of crap.  </li>
            <li>really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time.</li>
            <li>I love it because it penetrates the skin quickly and leaves my skin soft and neither dry nor oily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer to say when I want the stuff, thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soothing without causing a build-up of oil on my face.</li>
            <li>I had this in the smaller size as a free gift and used it</li>
            <li>not sticky but very moisturizing</li>
            <li>It has such a clean scent to it and you might think you have been to a spa...</li>
            <li>Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results.</li>
            <li>If you have super dry skin, even in the summer, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>and I have rosacea and usually am very sensitive to products on my face.</li>
            <li>It is very light and not the least bit greasy.  </li>
            <li>having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The water severly dries my sensitive skin out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so moisturizing , helps my eczema near my scalp.  </li>
            <li>I am addicted it makes my skin look young clear and strong !</li>
            <li>Buy from Amazon to avoid the &#x27;offers&#x27; from Proactiv if you agree to sign up for regular deliveries.</li>
            <li>Really like this stuff though it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>

            <li> They do have a few pore clogging ingredients in them which makes me so mad at proactive.  </li>
            <li> Expensive as gold</li>

            <li> A nice, light moisturizer that really makes my skin feel fresh and not clogged up by something heavier. Really like this stuff though it&#x27;s a little pricey. Buy from Amazon to avoid the &#x27;offers&#x27; from Proactiv if you agree to sign up for regular deliveries. I&#x27;d prefer to say when I want the stuff, thanks.</li>
            <li> Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch - you have to keep at it. Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results. This is the case for any acne treatment product really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time. So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne. Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin. It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin. Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands.... having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it. If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed once you stop using Proactiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: Do use all three components of the set if you can. Since it was formulated to work as a set, it is better to use it that way in the end.</li>
            <li> Do not order anything from this seller!!! I ordered this over one month ago, and have still not received it - or my money back!!!!!!!!!!  Seller has not responded to any of my e-mails!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love all proactiv products, i have been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice light cream that I enjoyed using DESPITE the fact that none of the Proactiv products work worth of crap.  Yes, yes, I know...use the products for at least 60 days, follow the instructions, use the products as directed, don&#x27;t expect immediate results, results may vary...blah, blah, blah...did all that and still saw absolutely NO results from the Proactive products.    So...if you are NOT looking for a product that would help you with your acne, this cream is actually very light and refreshing, and feels very nice and calming on the skin.  Expensive as gold I might add (about $20 + S&amp;H for 1 bloody oz. of product).  Needless to say, I opted for a different brand of green tea moisturizer.</li>
            <li> this company used to be called brands4less till they changed it to #1products or whatever, this is a shady company, you will never recieve your items, i still havnt recieved mine and i dont think i ever will</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t give this product a bad review but I&#x27;m not oevrly impressed with it.  I prefer the Proactive non-oily moisturizer.  Just makes my skin feel softer, cleaner and better.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  But the description is for 1 2oz bottle.  What I received was 2 1oz bottles.  Not really a big deal but the advertisement should be updated to reflect what the consumer is actually getting.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Proactive Green Tea Moisturizer for my daughter because the size that comes with her regular shipment was never enough. The 2 oz. size lasts the perfect amount of time and the product itself restores the perfect level of moisture to her skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been asking for this for a while now. She was very happy to receive it &amp; I was happy I got it so quickly after order was placed.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent!  It is one of the best moisturizers that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  My daughter uses it every day.  It is very light and not the least bit greasy.  Another big plus is, it doesn&#x27;t make you break out!  Great size!  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied with product and how much better my skin feels now.  Definitely recommend to others, whether you are using Proactiv acne products or not.</li>
            <li> Not as rich as I would have liked and washes off with water, but when you need quick moisture that soothes the skin, this is great. And doesn&#x27;t make you break out from what I can tell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a couple of years now and can&#x27;t think of not ever using it.  It has such a clean scent to it and you might think you have been to a spa...also it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy at all...no burning or sensitivity with it and I have rosacea and usually am very sensitive to products on my face.</li>
            <li> Works Great!!! Very light, but still moisturize&#x27;s !!! I recommend this product to anyone who suffers from acne or bad breakouts!!!</li>
            <li> I am addicted it makes my skin look young clear and strong ! I use after ever shower I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with how this moisturizer absorbs nicely into my skin. No greasy feeling. It has a pleasant smell and I think it will help my skin condition. Thank you for your prompt service.</li>
            <li> Light summer moisturizer. If you have super dry skin, even in the summer, this is not for you. Great for combination skin or the skin of mixed girls like me :)</li>
            <li> This product is actually a great after shave lotion for someone with inclinations towards acne. It&#x27;s really soothing without causing a build-up of oil on my face.</li>
            <li> Love the size.  Huge.  Awesome seller.  Product was sealed which is so Important.&lt;br /&gt;Proactive works  It does.  But it doesn&#x27;t stop my breakouts.  Just slowed them down a lot.  They do have a few pore clogging ingredients in them which makes me so mad at proactive.  Google acne ingredients to avoid.  One combo is a 4 on the pore clog scale.&lt;br /&gt;I still rate 4 stats as if you like proactive this is the seller to buy from.  Huge bottle</li>
            <li> This product feels very silky once applied, and a very small amount goes a long way.  I will continue to buy this product</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer I use under my makeup. I love it because it penetrates the skin quickly and leaves my skin soft and neither dry nor oily.  I have never even had an acne problem, but use it daily with or without makeup.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer arrived in a timely manner, which is about 10 days because I&#x27;m deployed. The water severly dries my sensitive skin out. This product goes on very smoothly, and moisturizes until I wash it off. It&#x27;s even safe for under the eyes! I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase, and will be ordering more when needed.</li>
            <li> I had this in the smaller size as a free gift and used it, it&#x27;s a very good moisturizer and I have oily skin,  so I ordered this large size and I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is lightweight and does not leave my skin greasy - a great base for make up and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I bought this item to help moisturizer my face, and help remove whiteheads.  It moisturizers nice but did not shrink whiteheads.  I do like the Pro-active items.  I bought the original set for my 14 year old grandson, it did a great job removing his acne.  I will also try another product.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to try, definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so moisturizing , helps my eczema near my scalp.  Switched from neutropenia to this and I am very happy</li>
            <li> The Proactiv products are overpriced and undersized. There are so many natural and cheaper skin remedies. For instance, rosehip oil is a wonderful moisturizer when mixed with natural face lotion.</li>
            <li> not sticky but very moisturizing</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer ever!  I have oily skin and I can use this with my face being too oily.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing. I use it after a retinoid cream at night. It is light, non greasy and very soothing to my skin. I will definitely&lt;br /&gt;keep it in my skin regimen.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
    </ol>
