            <li>This Nu Bra is great!</li>
            <li>The BEST thing about this bra????</li>
            <li>and I ordered the adhesive with them, that product is awesome too.</li>
            <li>the best thing...</li>
            <li>I would go for that, but if not, then this is your best bet</li>
            <li>Great product for the price!</li>
            <li>it hides well in my clothes and is perfect for backless clothes but the 2 cups are not even...</li>
            <li>Happy!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not the perfect silicone bra in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The best strapless bra I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It said for a size D and my daughter who is a B could wear it perfectly.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied!</li>
            <li>Price was great for the product.</li>
            <li>The adhesive isn&#x27;t that great, but it didn&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li>These are great but you should consider going up a cup size.  </li>
            <li>this bra does the job but isnt great quality.</li>
            <li>It fits and sticks great.</li>
            <li>a great fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box arrived bend</li>
            <li>Worked great for the snowball dance for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>I STRONGLY recommend the fabric glue/skin glue along with them though as in the summer if you sweat the self adhesive tends to come unstuck but the skin/clothing glue will fix that problem perfectly.</li>
            <li>But all in all they are a good product, ordering was a breeze as always, and I received them in 2 days with the 2-3 shipping option.</li>
            <li>good thing is, though, that it keeps you from &amp;#34;weather broadcasts&amp;#34;  and you can wear it with strapless and backless clothing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What was good about the seller however, was that it was processed and shipped out almost immediately after being purchased.</li>
            <li>good product and works good.</li>
            <li>good customer service as well.</li>
            <li>good product and works good.</li>

            <li>this bra is good for women who dont have boobs</li>
            <li>this looks good on her</li>
            <li>It is sufficiently sticky and gives a good support.</li>
            <li>Good bra.</li>
            <li>It fit perfectly..</li>
            <li>It is good for a nipple cover</li>
            <li>it feels great on your skin and it does a better job that strapless bra.  </li>
            <li>Outstanding!</li>
            <li>I really love my Nu Bra!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m pretty impressed with these.</li>
            <li>but it if you&#x27;re more than an A cup!</li>
            <li>Just wish they had more than one use!</li>
            <li>the Size D fit great.</li>
            <li>It holds things in place without the straps, so you can wear the nice strapless dresses without straps showing</li>
            <li>Nice to have on hand if u have some satrapy shirts or dresses.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to try them before to make sure they will look good under my dresses</li>
            <li>Honestly, these kind of suck.</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because it did come intact and was nice and sticky.</li>
            <li>more comfortable that a bra!!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The clasp is still as strong as ever, too!</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, it still has its adhesive</li>
            <li>NO BRA FAT ROLLS!!!!!! I LOVE</li>
            <li>Once I get my implants I would order these again, and I&#x27;m sure they would work for me then :)</li>
            <li>More like a B cup.</li>
            <li>Nice fit.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I showed so many friends and now they are going to be getting them too.</li>
            <li>It truly is one of my favorites and i will be getting more.</li>
            <li>they are a lot thinner than the better brand.</li>
            <li>They look ok, but I don&#x27;t want to wear them yet.  </li>
            <li>Glad I listened to the reviews to buy one size up.  </li>
            <li>Do I love this bra?  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this bra.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got this self adhesive backless strapless bra.</li>
            <li>Love these bras.</li>
            <li>I have to add more words</li>
            <li>so I OK to purchase</li>
            <li>It became my favorite bra and opened up many clothing options for me.</li>
            <li>They work ok but the floral outline still show when I&#x27;m wearing fitted shirts and workout bras.  </li>
            <li>I love that you can adjust the amount of cleavage</li>
            <li>What a joke, I was better off using bandaids and tape.</li>
            <li>so GLAD</li>
            <li>sure.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural &amp; my husband thought it was very sexy!</li>
            <li>An added bonus is that it came in a nice little cheetah print zip pouch(~6inx4in), which is the perfect size to use as a makeup bag.</li>
            <li>The fit &amp; function of this adheasive bra is outstanding..</li>
            <li>So please  make sure you can fit in  the product before you order if you don&#x27;t want have another piece of garbage at home just like me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very busty woman but my good friend recommended this product for me because I had a wedding that needed a strapless bra.  </li>
            <li>Easy to wear with everything.</li>
            <li>I bought this to wear with a backless top and it feels secure and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rather large chested, and yet this bra really did offer great support.</li>
            <li>Only increased my breast size, and did nothing attractive for my evening gown.</li>
            <li>Should have done without this proud entirely</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit at all.</li>
            <li>This is great to wear for those backless dresses and white tank tops.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These provide a comfortable seemless fit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 34D and this fit quite well.</li>
            <li>and I cannot BELIEVE how cheap it was AND</li>
            <li>so far so good...</li>
            <li>I bought true to size and it fits just fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the novelty will wear off soon enough if I do wear it out one day, but in any case, it&#x27;s nice to have something like this just in case.</li>
            <li>Hey large chested ladies, I get the frustration, but sometimes you&#x27;ve got to get a bit creative.</li>
            <li>Which is good because it will now give me time to find a different bra before my vacation.</li>
            <li>When I had a smaller chest I loved these bras for strapless dresses.</li>
            <li>Really stays in place and love it.</li>
            <li>It shipped very quickly and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Now, If I could figure out a way to sew a built in bra into every single shirt I own, I would never buy another bra with straps again!</li>
            <li>Granted i probably wont do that agian because pools of sweat are found when taken off :P pretty gross but for 80F it will be a dream!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t don&#x27;t any super vigorous activity in it</li>
            <li>while I got a D the actual size is more like a B at the most.  </li>
            <li>This is fine in a garment with some structure to it in the chest, but definitely wouldn&#x27;t look great in something more loose or flowy.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I had purchased the same box at a flea market at a slightly higher price and loved them.  </li>
            <li>These are great for evening dresses, workout clothes or everyday use.  </li>
            <li>I wear this bra very often because it is so comfortable.</li>
            <li>Perhaps these would be effective on a smaller cup size.</li>
            <li>They add nice fullness when paired with an actual bra though.</li>
            <li>So give it a shot, it truly is worth it</li>
            <li>No, but it is better than going bra-less when my dress was completely backless.  </li>
            <li>and I have used them frequently for most of my dresses.</li>
            <li>so I love it look so natural</li>
            <li>for the price was worth the wait</li>
            <li>but once you get it in the right spot you&#x27;ll know.</li>
            <li>It takes some practice to get it right though.</li>
            <li>fits great despite the fact that I usually wear a C.</li>
            <li>Do not buy if you have a large chest!</li>
            <li>However, they are very natural looking and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I will also recommend getting one size larger than your normal cup size as this give you a better fit for extra clevage, or regulare wear under a backless top or dress.</li>
            <li>them many times &amp; still going after several times.</li>
            <li>a year old with near daily wear and still sticks great.</li>
            <li>I need to make better purchase decision next time.</li>
            <li>This bra is perfect for tops and dresses that have an open or low back.  </li>
            <li>I had one a few years ago and loved it until I had to move</li>
            <li>so I recommend a larger size than you would normally use, other wise they are great, but takes a long time to arrive!</li>
            <li>Ill be purchasing more !!!</li>
            <li>It does work better with loser fitting or low neckline clothes because it has a tendency to just jut out of your chest in tighter clothes, and it doesn&#x27;t necessarily make you look like you are wearing a bra, just like you are lucky enough not to need to.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought a cup size bigger than normal works</li>
            <li>The description said that the D cup would fit up to a 40, so I figured being a DD, I&#x27;d be able to squeeze into it to wear it for at least a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>what can you really say about silicon that glues on in place of a bra.  </li>
            <li>even the adhesive may wear off much sooner than is intended, so I will need to keep watch for that.</li>
            <li>This worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Served the purpose very well.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my expectations were too high!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t stick very well.  </li>
            <li>I have a farm and it stuck really well while chasing goats in the Tennessee heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks my corset.</li>
            <li>Feels so very unnatural and really makes me self-conscious, but they do they job</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t hold up much of anything.</li>
            <li>Since I did not remove any of the wrapping on it or even try it on, I&#x27;m hoping that I will be able to return it for my money back, however, I&#x27;m not sure if I will be able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just as described and a great price, but since it came from out of the USA I had to wait a little too long!</li>
            <li>So far I have had no problem with them sticking, just make sure that your skin is dry before placing them.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it not stick but it does not seem true to its size.</li>
            <li>One caution, make sure that you wipe yourself down with alcohol before applying&lt;br</li>
            <li>They fit true to size, but they don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try these out with my new dress for Vegas!</li>
            <li>Make sure you get one or two sizes bigger than your regular cup size.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin and never touches my main fibro spots\nerves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleans up much easier than my old cloth covered stick on.  </li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t have to keep pulling it up like a normal strapless bra.</li>
            <li>If your dress will take a different kind of bra (like halter, low back, etc.)</li>
            <li>Go up a size or two from your normal cup</li>
            <li>I tried a few more times</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very large C+ &amp; had to work on getting the outer corner up high enough to lift &amp; support.  </li>
            <li>They provide enough coverage and lift once you find the right position that works for your body.  </li>
            <li>My breasts are very small and seem to want to sag a lot since I lost 30 lbs, and so holding me up on it&#x27;s own didn&#x27;t work, I had to use a strapless bra with them.</li>
            <li>The inside of the entire cup is adhesive, so be careful taking them off :)  </li>
            <li>Very soft too.</li>
            <li>I was unsure if I should because I am on the small side of a C cup, but I went for the D and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I got the correct size and regardless of whether I got a different size, they would have been so awkwardly fitting and uncomfortable that I still wouldn&#x27;t be able to use them.</li>
            <li>The Photo on the box matched exactly - the writing matched so it looked like it was the same manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>It fits great, which is difficult for me to find sometimes because I have submuscular breast implants, but definitely go up a cup size.</li>
            <li>Well I have to say I am pleasantly surprised by this.</li>
            <li>Go to target and get the real deal for the same price, and not have to wait for overseas shipment.</li>
            <li>Only downside is that if it&#x27;s really steamy out, these have a tendency to not stick (even with additional glue.)  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the amount of support the clasp and the clingyness</li>
            <li>Still the new bra has the strongest stick initially, so it&#x27;s probably my fave.</li>
            <li>what do you really have to loose even if it doesn&#x27;t work (which it will)</li>
            <li>The only good then is that they were inexpensive and I can throw them in a plain bra for just a little extra padding.</li>
            <li>I wore them under a white lace dress (for my bridal shower) and while they didn&#x27;t give much of a lift (obviously) they did keep me supported enough to rock my backless dress.</li>
            <li>Apparently nobody else did either.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely worth a few bucks,</li>
            <li>These are not going to work on my larger chest, the barely cover the bottom section</li>
            <li>Obviously because my boobs are very big, the D cup didn&#x27;t even come close to covering my breast, but the final look under clothes was seamless enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little uncomfortable at first, but that&#x27;s kind of expected</li>
            <li>Because I have extremely large and heavy breasts, I knew the chances of them working were low.</li>

            <li> so I OK to purchase</li>
            <li> It became my favorite bra and opened up many clothing options for me.</li>
            <li> They work ok but the floral outline still show when I&#x27;m wearing fitted shirts and workout bras.  </li>
            <li> I love that you can adjust the amount of cleavage</li>
            <li> What a joke, I was better off using bandaids and tape.</li>
            <li> so GLAD</li>
            <li> sure.</li>
            <li> Looks very natural &amp; my husband thought it was very sexy!</li>
            <li> An added bonus is that it came in a nice little cheetah print zip pouch(~6inx4in), which is the perfect size to use as a makeup bag.</li>
            <li> The fit &amp; function of this adheasive bra is outstanding..</li>
            <li> So please  make sure you can fit in  the product before you order if you don&#x27;t want have another piece of garbage at home just like me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very busty woman but my good friend recommended this product for me because I had a wedding that needed a strapless bra.  </li>
            <li> Easy to wear with everything.</li>
            <li> I bought this to wear with a backless top and it feels secure and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rather large chested, and yet this bra really did offer great support.</li>
            <li> Only increased my breast size, and did nothing attractive for my evening gown.</li>
            <li> Should have done without this proud entirely</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit at all.</li>
            <li> This is great to wear for those backless dresses and white tank tops.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These provide a comfortable seemless fit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 34D and this fit quite well.</li>
            <li> and I cannot BELIEVE how cheap it was AND</li>
            <li> so far so good...</li>
            <li> I bought true to size and it fits just fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the novelty will wear off soon enough if I do wear it out one day, but in any case, it&#x27;s nice to have something like this just in case.</li>
            <li> Hey large chested ladies, I get the frustration, but sometimes you&#x27;ve got to get a bit creative.</li>
            <li> Which is good because it will now give me time to find a different bra before my vacation.</li>
            <li> When I had a smaller chest I loved these bras for strapless dresses.</li>
            <li> Really stays in place and love it.</li>
            <li> It shipped very quickly and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Now, If I could figure out a way to sew a built in bra into every single shirt I own, I would never buy another bra with straps again!</li>
            <li> Granted i probably wont do that agian because pools of sweat are found when taken off :P pretty gross but for 80F it will be a dream!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t don&#x27;t any super vigorous activity in it</li>
            <li> while I got a D the actual size is more like a B at the most.  </li>
            <li> This is fine in a garment with some structure to it in the chest, but definitely wouldn&#x27;t look great in something more loose or flowy.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had purchased the same box at a flea market at a slightly higher price and loved them.  </li>
            <li> These are great for evening dresses, workout clothes or everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I wear this bra very often because it is so comfortable.</li>
            <li> Perhaps these would be effective on a smaller cup size.</li>
            <li> They add nice fullness when paired with an actual bra though.</li>
            <li> So give it a shot, it truly is worth it</li>
            <li> No, but it is better than going bra-less when my dress was completely backless.  </li>
            <li> and I have used them frequently for most of my dresses.</li>
            <li> so I love it look so natural</li>
            <li> for the price was worth the wait</li>
            <li> but once you get it in the right spot you&#x27;ll know.</li>
            <li> It takes some practice to get it right though.</li>
            <li> fits great despite the fact that I usually wear a C.</li>
            <li> Do not buy if you have a large chest!</li>
            <li> However, they are very natural looking and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I will also recommend getting one size larger than your normal cup size as this give you a better fit for extra clevage, or regulare wear under a backless top or dress.</li>
            <li> them many times &amp; still going after several times.</li>
            <li> a year old with near daily wear and still sticks great.</li>
            <li> I need to make better purchase decision next time.</li>
            <li> This bra is perfect for tops and dresses that have an open or low back.  </li>
            <li> I had one a few years ago and loved it until I had to move</li>
            <li> so I recommend a larger size than you would normally use, other wise they are great, but takes a long time to arrive!</li>
            <li> Ill be purchasing more !!!</li>
            <li> It does work better with loser fitting or low neckline clothes because it has a tendency to just jut out of your chest in tighter clothes, and it doesn&#x27;t necessarily make you look like you are wearing a bra, just like you are lucky enough not to need to.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought a cup size bigger than normal works</li>
            <li> The description said that the D cup would fit up to a 40, so I figured being a DD, I&#x27;d be able to squeeze into it to wear it for at least a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> what can you really say about silicon that glues on in place of a bra.  </li>
            <li> even the adhesive may wear off much sooner than is intended, so I will need to keep watch for that.</li>
            <li> This worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Served the purpose very well.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my expectations were too high!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stick very well.  </li>
            <li> I have a farm and it stuck really well while chasing goats in the Tennessee heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks my corset.</li>
            <li> Feels so very unnatural and really makes me self-conscious, but they do they job</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold up much of anything.</li>
            <li> Since I did not remove any of the wrapping on it or even try it on, I&#x27;m hoping that I will be able to return it for my money back, however, I&#x27;m not sure if I will be able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just as described and a great price, but since it came from out of the USA I had to wait a little too long!</li>
            <li> So far I have had no problem with them sticking, just make sure that your skin is dry before placing them.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it not stick but it does not seem true to its size.</li>
            <li> One caution, make sure that you wipe yourself down with alcohol before applying&lt;br</li>
            <li> They fit true to size, but they don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try these out with my new dress for Vegas!</li>
            <li> Make sure you get one or two sizes bigger than your regular cup size.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin and never touches my main fibro spots\nerves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleans up much easier than my old cloth covered stick on.  </li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t have to keep pulling it up like a normal strapless bra.</li>
            <li> If your dress will take a different kind of bra (like halter, low back, etc.)</li>
            <li> Go up a size or two from your normal cup</li>
            <li> I tried a few more times</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very large C+ &amp; had to work on getting the outer corner up high enough to lift &amp; support.  </li>
            <li> They provide enough coverage and lift once you find the right position that works for your body.  </li>
            <li> My breasts are very small and seem to want to sag a lot since I lost 30 lbs, and so holding me up on it&#x27;s own didn&#x27;t work, I had to use a strapless bra with them.</li>
            <li> The inside of the entire cup is adhesive, so be careful taking them off :)  </li>
            <li> Very soft too.</li>
            <li> I was unsure if I should because I am on the small side of a C cup, but I went for the D and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I got the correct size and regardless of whether I got a different size, they would have been so awkwardly fitting and uncomfortable that I still wouldn&#x27;t be able to use them.</li>
            <li> The Photo on the box matched exactly - the writing matched so it looked like it was the same manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> It fits great, which is difficult for me to find sometimes because I have submuscular breast implants, but definitely go up a cup size.</li>
            <li> Well I have to say I am pleasantly surprised by this.</li>
            <li> Go to target and get the real deal for the same price, and not have to wait for overseas shipment.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that if it&#x27;s really steamy out, these have a tendency to not stick (even with additional glue.)  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at the amount of support the clasp and the clingyness</li>
            <li> Still the new bra has the strongest stick initially, so it&#x27;s probably my fave.</li>
            <li> what do you really have to loose even if it doesn&#x27;t work (which it will)</li>
            <li> The only good then is that they were inexpensive and I can throw them in a plain bra for just a little extra padding.</li>
            <li> I wore them under a white lace dress (for my bridal shower) and while they didn&#x27;t give much of a lift (obviously) they did keep me supported enough to rock my backless dress.</li>
            <li> Apparently nobody else did either.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s definitely worth a few bucks,</li>
            <li> These are not going to work on my larger chest, the barely cover the bottom section</li>
            <li> Obviously because my boobs are very big, the D cup didn&#x27;t even come close to covering my breast, but the final look under clothes was seamless enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little uncomfortable at first, but that&#x27;s kind of expected</li>
            <li> Because I have extremely large and heavy breasts, I knew the chances of them working were low.</li>
            <li> It takes a few tries to get on just right, but that may just be me.</li>
            <li> Terrible fit!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother clipping the middle together because that just squished my boobs and made them look flat.</li>
            <li> I went out and it stayed on all night long.</li>
            <li> I have since also ordered other such bras and realize it&#x27;s not the bra.</li>
            <li> A bit of a waste of money, but at least now I know to get the kind with the adhesive wings so that there is at least some semblance of support!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not able to wear completely backless dresses and tops without worrying about my bra showing.</li>
            <li> Comes loose.  </li>
            <li> one is much thicker than the other and that can look a little uneven</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a push up but gives you massive cleavage and a slight lift.</li>
            <li> I wish they made a cup that was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> doing everything expected ...</li>
            <li> this product had absolutely no support at all, and i feel is made for women who never had children.</li>
            <li> So when I first tried them, I was not surprised how terrible the fit was.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m always adjusting them and they are not very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; But this item totally can not fit me.</li>
            <li> You can only wear this for a few times until the stickiness starts falling apart.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little more expensive but it works!</li>
            <li> not very sticky either and provides absolutely no support!</li>
            <li> I ordered this in a cup size larger than I usually wear, and it turned out alright, but I do feel like getting it in a C wouldn&#x27;t have hurt.</li>
            <li> The standard shipping took longer than usual (about 2 weeks) because they were shipped from China.</li>
            <li> I did based on other reviews and the D</li>
            <li> I bought the size &amp;#34;D&amp;#34; due to peoples reviews about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced that the positive reviews of this bra in a D cup are all fake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just my breast shape is not right for this bra</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say about this product, I only give it a 2 rating, because it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> The silicone is thick enough that my nipples do not show.  </li>
            <li> I tried positioning them in every way I could think of and they just squashed everything down.</li>
            <li> This time I flipped them upside down and reversed he sides.</li>
            <li> and they tend to slip down</li>
            <li> Not only did it look ridiculous, there was no support whatsoever.</li>
            <li> but I guess cuz I pulled it too tight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky to put on</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> this did not fit at all in either size i bought.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Even a few bucks are money too.</li>
            <li> I have bought quite a few self adhesive bras before</li>
            <li> Could not fit me.</li>
            <li> The pin at the middle is broken now</li>
            <li> If you have even moderately heavy breasts, this product will not work.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less than $15 including shipping!</li>
            <li> these run a little small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 34 D with heavy breasts and these things suck!</li>
            <li> however, when I got it, the cups were just as small as an A size bra.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s the manufacturer who made the cups run so small.</li>
            <li> I bought a size D and they were too small for my boobs.</li>
            <li> and they are way too small to add any lift.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> It small like a B Size.</li>
            <li> About six months later I had a very frustrating dress I had to wear.</li>
            <li> It stayed put all night, but I was not thrilled with the support (or lack thereof).  </li>
            <li> It lasts 4 at least 5 times use.</li>
            <li> i hate this product it should say not mean for women who wear D size bras</li>
            <li> but I needed something strapless which is difficult for me because it requires dropping to a 30DD to find a bra that won&#x27;t slide down during wear.</li>
            <li> I had a reduction done several years ago, and the scar tissue keloided badly to the point of needing 2 scar revision surgeries.</li>
            <li> This strapless/backless silicone nude color bra isn&#x27;t actually all that bad.</li>
            <li> The size is way wrong.</li>
            <li> Has worked as well as the expensive version.</li>
            <li> and then I retired them, what a fail.</li>
            <li> But then, the adhesive failed after 6 wears.</li>
            <li> This bra sucks!!!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this item.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;ll take some practice), and taking it off slowly isn&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> the adhesive didn&#x27;t fail!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I tried positioning them in every way I could think of and they just squashed everything down. Perhaps these would be effective on a smaller cup size.</li>
            <li> They fit true to size, but they don&#x27;t last very long.  Even shorter  if you sweat, but that is to be expected.  They add nice fullness when paired with an actual bra though.</li>
            <li> I had a reduction done several years ago, and the scar tissue keloided badly to the point of needing 2 scar revision surgeries. Regular bras hurt the scars and cause me to constantly have to re-adjust my bra. This Nu Bra is great! I had one a few years ago and loved it until I had to move and it got lost. I STRONGLY recommend the fabric glue/skin glue along with them though as in the summer if you sweat the self adhesive tends to come unstuck but the skin/clothing glue will fix that problem perfectly. I will also recommend getting one size larger than your normal cup size as this give you a better fit for extra clevage, or regulare wear under a backless top or dress. The BEST thing about this bra???? NO BRA FAT ROLLS!!!!!! I LOVE MINE!!!!!</li>
            <li> One word to describe this &amp;#34; Excellent&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> these run a little small so I recommend a larger size than you would normally use, other wise they are great, but takes a long time to arrive!</li>
            <li> helpful but tape is also needed</li>
            <li> what can you really say about silicon that glues on in place of a bra.  It does just what it says. It holds things in place without the straps, so you can wear the nice strapless dresses without straps showing</li>
            <li> The fit &amp; function of this adheasive bra is outstanding.. doing everything expected ... (filling me out and plumping me up) and they last &amp; last&lt;br /&gt;reusing them many times &amp; still going after several times. Outstanding! One caution, make sure that you wipe yourself down with alcohol before applying&lt;br /&gt;to make the adheasive last longer.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this item. I wear a 32D, and that&#x27;s not too big but I still doubted that this could give any sort of support but I needed something strapless which is difficult for me because it requires dropping to a 30DD to find a bra that won&#x27;t slide down during wear. Well I have to say I am pleasantly surprised by this. It does work better with loser fitting or low neckline clothes because it has a tendency to just jut out of your chest in tighter clothes, and it doesn&#x27;t necessarily make you look like you are wearing a bra, just like you are lucky enough not to need to. However it take A lot of practice, i fear the number of times I had to re position it to get it to look even the adhesive may wear off much sooner than is intended, so I will need to keep watch for that.</li>
            <li> Terrible fit!!!! Do not buy if you have a large chest!</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say about this product, I only give it a 2 rating, because it just didn&#x27;t work for me. My breasts are very small and seem to want to sag a lot since I lost 30 lbs, and so holding me up on it&#x27;s own didn&#x27;t work, I had to use a strapless bra with them. But all in all they are a good product, ordering was a breeze as always, and I received them in 2 days with the 2-3 shipping option. Once I get my implants I would order these again, and I&#x27;m sure they would work for me then :)They do support and I ordered the adhesive with them, that product is awesome too. It&#x27;s just my breast shape is not right for this bra, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for sagging boobs period!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced that the positive reviews of this bra in a D cup are all fake. I&#x27;m a 34 D with heavy breasts and these things suck! They don&#x27;t stick and they are not an actual D cup. More like a B cup. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I needed a bra for a backless formal dress on a recent cruise. This worked very well.  I practiced applying it several times before actual formal night.  Served the purpose very well.  I&#x27;m a very large C+ &amp; had to work on getting the outer corner up high enough to lift &amp; support.  It just took some practice!  Cleans up much easier than my old cloth covered stick on.  Looks very natural &amp; my husband thought it was very sexy!</li>
            <li> Nice fit.  no straps to put pressure on your shoulders or back.&lt;br /&gt;easy to wear.  Easy to wear with everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Nubra for almost 8 yrs and I absolutely love them.&lt;br /&gt;If you like wearing your back out in clothing. Nubra will work for you.</li>
            <li> I really love my Nu Bra! I&#x27;m a 34D and it actually did the job. It&#x27;s a little tricky to put on but once you get it in the right spot you&#x27;ll know. I showed so many friends and now they are going to be getting them too. Don&#x27;t think that just because your a D it wont work. I will say that 34D is probably the biggest it will hold though. Even while in Dubai with 120F it the adhesive didn&#x27;t fail!!! NOT LYING! Granted i probably wont do that agian because pools of sweat are found when taken off :P pretty gross but for 80F it will be a dream!! it&#x27;s not a push up but gives you massive cleavage and a slight lift. My fiance LOVES the way it makes my chest look and the best thing...NO STRAPS! I get to wear backless without having to hassle with the straps and trying to hide them and i don&#x27;t have to keep pulling it up like a normal strapless bra. It truly is one of my favorites and i will be getting more. Think about it what do you really have to loose even if it doesn&#x27;t work (which it will) because it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s $50 it&#x27;s less than $15 including shipping! So give it a shot, it truly is worth it, I wouldn&#x27;t be wasting my time writing a review if it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This bra is definitely not made for larger cup sizes. There is no support or lift or anything of that nature.&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is, though, that it keeps you from &amp;#34;weather broadcasts&amp;#34;  and you can wear it with strapless and backless clothing.</li>
            <li> The description said that the D cup would fit up to a 40, so I figured being a DD, I&#x27;d be able to squeeze into it to wear it for at least a couple of hours. however, when I got it, the cups were just as small as an A size bra. I know this is not the sellers fault, it&#x27;s the manufacturer who made the cups run so small. Since I did not remove any of the wrapping on it or even try it on, I&#x27;m hoping that I will be able to return it for my money back, however, I&#x27;m not sure if I will be able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was good about the seller however, was that it was processed and shipped out almost immediately after being purchased. and I received it immediately with the two day shipping. Which is good because it will now give me time to find a different bra before my vacation.</li>
            <li> Just like the ones I paid $50 for at the prom store. Nice to have on hand if u have some satrapy shirts or dresses. Price was great for the product.</li>
            <li> Only increased my breast size, and did nothing attractive for my evening gown. Should have done without this proud entirely</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m pretty impressed with these. I&#x27;m a DD so every strapless product I&#x27;ve ever bought has never worked for me. These did. I wore them under a white lace dress (for my bridal shower) and while they didn&#x27;t give much of a lift (obviously) they did keep me supported enough to rock my backless dress.</li>
            <li> Lumpy and wrinkly.  Didn&#x27;t like the Silicone at all.  Apparently nobody else did either.  I wondered why I found these for $5.82.</li>
            <li> no fabric covering on exterior like a regular bra, looks like rubber implant/breast supplement. Go to target and get the real deal for the same price, and not have to wait for overseas shipment.</li>
            <li> Well they are usable but not for me. they are a lot thinner than the better brand. I bought a size D and they were too small for my boobs.</li>
            <li> The did not arrive in a box.  They look ok, but I don&#x27;t want to wear them yet.  I will have to repost in Sept. since I will be using them at a wedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes, I know I said Sept. but I wanted to try them before to make sure they will look good under my dresses so I did, and these do not work well at all...Maybe my expectations were too high!</li>
            <li> Glad I listened to the reviews to buy one size up.  I was unsure if I should because I am on the small side of a C cup, but I went for the D and I am glad I did.  Do I love this bra?  No, but it is better than going bra-less when my dress was completely backless.  It stayed put all night, but I was not thrilled with the support (or lack thereof).  If your dress will take a different kind of bra (like halter, low back, etc.) I would go for that, but if not, then this is your best bet and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The adhesive isn&#x27;t that great, but it didn&#x27;t fall off. I wore it once. It did the job, although I don&#x27;t know that it would last to be worn multiple times.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this bra. I went out and it stayed on all night long. It&#x27;s a little uncomfortable at first, but that&#x27;s kind of expected, it&#x27;s basically a sticker. I&#x27;m rather large chested, and yet this bra really did offer great support. I&#x27;m not able to wear completely backless dresses and tops without worrying about my bra showing. LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> good product and works good. good customer service as well. good product and works good. good customer service as well.</li>
            <li> so far so good... it feels great on your skin and it does a better job that strapless bra.  Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> The size is way wrong. They don&#x27;t fit at all. Very disappointed. I would like to send back and get my money back.</li>
            <li> i hate this product it should say not mean for women who wear D size bras this bra is good for women who dont have boobs</li>
            <li> These are great but you should consider going up a cup size.  I&#x27;m at 36 C and the Size D fit great.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that if it&#x27;s really steamy out, these have a tendency to not stick (even with additional glue.)  However, they are very natural looking and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this self adhesive backless strapless bra. They are so versatile and I have used them frequently for most of my dresses. They are so comfy compared to your traditional strapless bras. Make sure you get one or two sizes bigger than your regular cup size.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price! This is great to wear for those backless dresses and white tank tops. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this strapless to my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all!! not very sticky either and provides absolutely no support! it might work for smaller cup sizes... but i doubt it!</li>
            <li> Love these bras. Expecially for all summer clothes. I am a D cup. I wish they made a cup that was a little bigger. The price is a lot lower than anything you will find in the store.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stick very well.  Comes loose.  I have to add more words but that is all I have to say.</li>
            <li> These offer no lift and support for large-breasted women. Works well on B-Cups, maybe C if you&#x27;re already perky. Does nothing for D&#x27;s. Disappointed. When I had a smaller chest I loved these bras for strapless dresses. Now I&#x27;m screwed.</li>
            <li> Second time ordering this bra. Go up a size or two from your normal cup size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a year old with near daily wear and still sticks great. I have a farm and it stuck really well while chasing goats in the Tennessee heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT FOR MY FIBRO. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin and never touches my main fibro spots\nerves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only bra I wear now!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clasp is still as strong as ever, too!</li>
            <li> My wife purchase this looks good on her so I love it look so natural so I OK to purchase</li>
            <li> this bra does the job but isnt great quality. it hides well in my clothes and is perfect for backless clothes but the 2 cups are not even...one is much thicker than the other and that can look a little uneven</li>
            <li> this did not fit at all in either size i bought. this product had absolutely no support at all, and i feel is made for women who never had children.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought a cup size bigger than normal works well took a while for shipping but for the price was worth the wait</li>
            <li> Bought this to wear under low backed shirts and dresses. Has worked as well as the expensive version. I bought true to size and it fits just fine</li>
            <li> This bra sucks!!! It does not stay up dont waste your money on this product. I recommend the brand NuBra it&#x27;s a little more expensive but it works!</li>
            <li> These are not going to work on my larger chest, the barely cover the bottom section and they are way too small to add any lift. The only good then is that they were inexpensive and I can throw them in a plain bra for just a little extra padding.</li>
            <li> Just what it described. It fits and sticks great. Really stays in place and love it. Very soft too. Happy!</li>
            <li> Honestly, these kind of suck. I got the correct size and regardless of whether I got a different size, they would have been so awkwardly fitting and uncomfortable that I still wouldn&#x27;t be able to use them. A bit of a waste of money, but at least now I know to get the kind with the adhesive wings so that there is at least some semblance of support! I gave it two stars because it did come intact and was nice and sticky.</li>
            <li> I have read a lot of contradictory reviews. Despite that I purchased them, if only to experiment. Because I have extremely large and heavy breasts, I knew the chances of them working were low. So when I first tried them, I was not surprised how terrible the fit was. I tried a few more times and then I retired them, what a fail. About six months later I had a very frustrating dress I had to wear. It struck me to try it again. This time I flipped them upside down and reversed he sides. I didn&#x27;t bother clipping the middle together because that just squished my boobs and made them look flat. And somehow this worked. I got some lift and finally comfort. Obviously because my boobs are very big, the D cup didn&#x27;t even come close to covering my breast, but the final look under clothes was seamless enough. It became my favorite bra and opened up many clothing options for me. But then, the adhesive failed after 6 wears. So I&#x27;ve just ordered clothing adhesive in hopes of reviving my bra. I have since also ordered other such bras and realize it&#x27;s not the bra. It&#x27;s the How you put it on. Still the new bra has the strongest stick initially, so it&#x27;s probably my fave. Hey large chested ladies, I get the frustration, but sometimes you&#x27;ve got to get a bit creative. If you need some help figuring it out, let me know.</li>
            <li> Just as described and a great price, but since it came from out of the USA I had to wait a little too long!</li>
            <li> I ordered this in a cup size larger than I usually wear, and it turned out alright, but I do feel like getting it in a C wouldn&#x27;t have hurt. I&#x27;m not displeased with this bra, but it does almost nothing to give any lift to my breasts whatsoever. This is fine in a garment with some structure to it in the chest, but definitely wouldn&#x27;t look great in something more loose or flowy. I don&#x27;t regret this purchase and it&#x27;s definitely worth a few bucks, but it&#x27;s not the perfect silicone bra in my opinion.</li>
            <li> You pay what you get. I regret this purchase. Even a few bucks are money too. I need to make better purchase decision next time.</li>
            <li> never buy it. I used this bra with my wedding dress and I was upset becuase I could lost it. Thanks my corset. The bra doesn&#x27;t hold on your breast</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product. Not only did it not stick but it does not seem true to its size. I have bought quite a few self adhesive bras before so I know what to do to make them stick. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> The best strapless bra I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I have the reusable silicon nipple cover in the regular and larger size.  They work ok but the floral outline still show when I&#x27;m wearing fitted shirts and workout bras.  I also have regular strapless bras and they tend to slip down, I&#x27;m always adjusting them and they are not very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These provide a comfortable seemless fit.  It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m not even wearing a bra.  The silicone is thick enough that my nipples do not show.  The adhesive is also well made.  Buy these and you will not need to spend anymore money on similar products.  These are great for evening dresses, workout clothes or everyday use.  I am a 34D and the size D was a great fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box arrived bend but it did not damage the product since they are made of silicone anyway.  The standard shipping took longer than usual (about 2 weeks) because they were shipped from China.</li>
            <li> This strapless/backless silicone nude color bra isn&#x27;t actually all that bad. I was surprised at the amount of support the clasp and the clingyness(?) of the material provided. I&#x27;m a 34D and this fit quite well. While I don&#x27;t regret this purchase, I will definitely exercise some caution whenever I, or anyone else, should decide to wear a strapless/backless bra. I&#x27;m sure the novelty will wear off soon enough if I do wear it out one day, but in any case, it&#x27;s nice to have something like this just in case. An added bonus is that it came in a nice little cheetah print zip pouch(~6inx4in), which is the perfect size to use as a makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Feels so very unnatural and really makes me self-conscious, but they do they job they say they do and I haven&#x27;t had one fall off yet. But that may be because I feel like I walk around holding on to my breasts while I&#x27;m wearing these. There is zero sense of security with them unless I am also wearing one of those shirts with a built in bra. Now, If I could figure out a way to sew a built in bra into every single shirt I own, I would never buy another bra with straps again!</li>
            <li> Do not buy from these people.&lt;br /&gt;Product was not what the picture was and they were nasty.&lt;br /&gt;I think I got MRSA from these and had to throw them out.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 32 DD &amp; this bra has been doing it&#x27;s job for me. I love that you can adjust the amount of cleavage (it&#x27;ll take some practice), and taking it off slowly isn&#x27;t painful. I haven&#x27;t don&#x27;t any super vigorous activity in it so I can&#x27;t vouch for that but I can vouch for it staying put while babysitting 5 kids. I&#x27;ve worn it 4 times &amp; the 5th time around the adhesive is still functional.</li>
            <li> It is sufficiently sticky and gives a good support. It takes some practice to get it right though. Good bra.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very busty woman but my good friend recommended this product for me because I had a wedding that needed a strapless bra.  The product was packaged well, the problem started when I put the cup up to my breast and it only covered my nipple. Not only did it look ridiculous, there was no support whatsoever. I might as well have put two pieces of tape on my nipples, it would have been cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It said for a size D and my daughter who is a B could wear it perfectly. I would not recommend this bra to anyone who has ANY ample sized bosom at all.</li>
            <li> I order a &amp;#34;Self Adhesive Silicone Nu Color Backless Strapless Bra size D&amp;#34; But this item totally can not fit me. It small like a B Size. But the  seller replay me they don&#x27;t accept exchange or return if is not the quality problem. But even they accept the item , you still need pay for the mailing. I feel so upset with that service  attitude. So please  make sure you can fit in  the product before you order if you don&#x27;t want have another piece of garbage at home just like me.</li>
            <li> I bought this to wear with a backless top and it feels secure and comfortable. It takes a few tries to get on just right, but that may just be me. It fits great, which is difficult for me to find sometimes because I have submuscular breast implants, but definitely go up a cup size. I did based on other reviews and the D fits great despite the fact that I usually wear a C.</li>
            <li> Could not fit me. Not recommended for big breast girls.i had to give it away to a smaller person  to wear</li>
            <li> It shipped very quickly and was exactly as described.  Can&#x27;t wait to try these out with my new dress for Vegas!</li>
            <li> What a joke, I was better off using bandaids and tape. Don&#x27;t but it if you&#x27;re more than an A cup!</li>
            <li> The inside of the entire cup is adhesive, so be careful taking them off :)  Worked great for the snowball dance for my daughter.  Just wish they had more than one use!</li>
            <li> I have a size &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; chest.... I bought the size &amp;#34;D&amp;#34; due to peoples reviews about it. OH MY GOSH!!! Im so GLAD I did !!! It fit perfectly.. it pulls all my cleavage together and adds OOOMPH!! I am planning to wear it in Vegas next  month with a backless dress and I cannot BELIEVE how cheap it was AND how well it works!!! Ill be purchasing more !!! hey why not!!!! more comfortable that a bra!! thats for dang sure. BUY BUY BUY this!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick, makes my bosom look flattened out and saggy. It may not be for someone my cup size (32d) but it definitely doesn&#x27;t work either way. Never wore it once</li>
            <li> It lasts 4 at least 5 times use. The pin at the middle is broken now but I guess cuz I pulled it too tight.</li>
            <li> This bra is perfect for tops and dresses that have an open or low back.  So far I have had no problem with them sticking, just make sure that your skin is dry before placing them.  They provide enough coverage and lift once you find the right position that works for your body.  I wear this bra very often because it is so comfortable.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold up much of anything. I didn&#x27;t pay much for it, but it was still a waste of money. If you have even moderately heavy breasts, this product will not work.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, it still has its adhesive</li>
            <li> You can only wear this for a few times until the stickiness starts falling apart.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had purchased the same box at a flea market at a slightly higher price and loved them.  The Photo on the box matched exactly - the writing matched so it looked like it was the same manufacturer.  I think they copied the box and use a different product because the one I received was about 1/2 the thickness and weight of the one I got at the swap meet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P. S.  while I got a D the actual size is more like a B at the most.  It is good for a nipple cover</li>
