            <li>Lovely, but breaks easily</li>
            <li>Very pretty but very easy to break the tips off while trying to put into your hair.</li>
            <li>Rest of the pins were fine</li>
            <li>Good for the price and totally disposable.  </li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t be handled too roughly or the top will break off from the prongs, which will render them useless unless you have metal soldering to put it back on.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very fragile so handle carefully.</li>
            <li> Long time coming</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cost much but they are no good.</li>
            <li> , I was expecting them a little bigger</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t rough with it, maybe it was damaged in shipping?</li>
            <li> O stars if I could took forever to get here and there crushed and broken so angry because it was for my daughters hair for a special occasion.  </li>
            <li> but you know what you&#x27;re paying for when you look at them a little closer.  </li>
            <li> (As a side note on the seller: when the package is not well protected, a lot of the little hairpins come damaged when you get them.  </li>
            <li> One came broken, but the other 19 were in tact,</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with the seller for how they pacakged it to me.)</li>
            <li> Shipping was a bit slow, but came when promised.</li>
            <li> but when I received it, 3 of them were broken.</li>
            <li> 2 were broken when I got them..</li>
            <li> This came to me everyone was broken.....</li>
            <li> Four of the flowers on the pins was broken.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by that.</li>

            <li> very nice look but the pieces break off the minute you try to pin your hair. So no I would not purchase them again.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Same as the picture. Very nice.</li>
            <li> O stars if I could took forever to get here and there crushed and broken so angry because it was for my daughters hair for a special occasion.  Now I have to find something else</li>
            <li> One of the pins came with the flower detached. They&#x27;re very fragile so handle carefully. Rest of the pins were fine</li>
            <li> Tiny little hair decorations that are pretty to look at from afar but you know what you&#x27;re paying for when you look at them a little closer.

            <li> Product perfect but shipping took forever</li>
            <li> I only need one and only put one in my cart -- somehow was charged for three and received three. Still looked beautiful. Will probably gift away the others.</li>
