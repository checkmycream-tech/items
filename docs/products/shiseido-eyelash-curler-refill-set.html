            <li>Had another brand for 30Â± years, this is a great lash curler.</li>
            <li>Great for any eye shape.</li>
            <li>I read reviews on Macy&#x27;s website that this curler is great, does not pinch, etc, but I felt the pinch.  </li>
            <li>Provides great curl all day and doesnt pinch or pull lashes.</li>
            <li>Great eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>but it fit perfectly to my eye</li>
            <li>and I hope this product turns out to be a good buy.</li>
            <li>Loved it recommend buyer.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Curls my lashes nicely.</li>
            <li>By far the BEST eyelash curler out there!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I was able to get it through here....</li>
            <li>I see quite a difference after only 2 uses and very happy with my investment.</li>
            <li>I love this curler, and would recommend it to anyone who would like to extend their lashes.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>This one works a lot better for me, I had probelms with the Shu Uemera rubber pads falling out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results with a cheaper curler.</li>
            <li>Many drugstores brands would do way better...</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>On the top it says 800 yen, so that would be just $7 US, and the replacement packet is 100 yen, so</li>
            <li>Favorite curler, I will never buy another.</li>
            <li>This one takes me 5 or 6 more squeezes to get the curl I want.</li>
            <li>This curler does a far superior job at curling my lashes, and without breaking them!  </li>
            <li>Using the Shiseido eyelash curler opened up my eyes - they had a beautiful, natural curl and the lashes were evenly spread out.</li>
            <li>I did not experience any more pinching since the arch shape was not as rounded, but more flattened out to fit my eye shape/flat face.</li>
            <li>It will give you the perfect curl and is great for many different eye shapes (especially Asian).</li>
            <li>Perfect for Asian eyes ;)</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve used yet and cost less.</li>
            <li>To be honest, my expectations were very high.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the genuine product.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I love how it fits my whole eye</li>
            <li>But the main difference is that the shape of the curve of the Shiseido fits my eyes better.  </li>
            <li>Again, it&#x27;s mostly about the curve of any particular curler and how it fits your eyes that can determine how well it works for you.</li>
            <li>a big deal for my hooded eyes!&lt;br /&gt;I will never use a different eyelash curler, this one is PERFECT!</li>
            <li>It was also nice that it came with a refill set and even an extra one in the original packaging.</li>
            <li>The clamp is big, so it covers a lot of your lashes, and it curls them beautifully without pinching (my old one always pinched my eyes, so</li>
            <li>Fit really well and doesn&#x27;t pinch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really nice to have the extra refills that come with it.  </li>
            <li>Eh, Trish McEvoy is by far better than this curler.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of curling all my lashes and doesn&#x27;t seem to pinch as some of the other curlers do.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is slightly less curved than other curlers (I have tried several), so it follows my lashline perfectly, curling every single lash perfectly, and...</li>
            <li>I think this would work better for eyes that protrude a little bit because I had to angle this upwards to make sure that it gets all my lashes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this Shiseido eye lash curler!!!</li>
            <li>all my old curlers didn&#x27;t fit right.</li>
            <li>so I have a different eye shape than most and</li>
            <li>First eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve ever owned that didn&#x27;t pinch my lids or pull out my lashes.</li>
            <li>Arrived the first estimated day of delivery.</li>
            <li>This is my first Shiseido curler.  </li>
            <li>I love this eyelash curler and it is now the only brand I&#x27;ll ever use!</li>
            <li>This is the first Shiseido item I have purchased and would buy again.  </li>
            <li>maybe just $8 US at most, but it costs double the price on Amazon and even a whooping $19 on sephora!</li>
            <li>eyes look so much larger and more awake...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The very first time I used these, I knew I would never have to search for a new eyelash</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the real one before and this one is obviously way more curved than the real one.</li>
            <li>A little smaller than my previous curler, but works great, and I love that it comes with refills!</li>
            <li>I bought my first Shiseido eyelash curler when I was in high school and used it for 4 years.</li>
            <li>It happens to fit the curve of my eyes very well and curls my entire lash line without pinching.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper on amazon then macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>And the curl really lasts.</li>
            <li>It will curl stubborn straight lashes.</li>
            <li>The Shiseido seems to hold the curl and it curls all of my straight downward lashes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pinch and curls the lashes very well.  </li>
            <li>You have to buy the whole curler all over again.  </li>
            <li>Very well made</li>
            <li>Makes me wonder if this is really from Shisheido.  </li>
            <li>Not saying mine is not, but just based on reviews I read, and using the one I ordered, I don&#x27;t feel much difference and have some doubts.</li>
            <li>I just started using it and, honestly, it doesn&#x27;t seem much better than the other ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>I think this one is better than most because it is wide enough to cover the entire length of my eye-lid.  </li>
            <li>so it occurs a strange sound.</li>
            <li>Does not pinch the skin, provides a nice, full curl and is easy to use at multiple angles to get all the little lashes at the corners of the eyes and on multiple depths of the lash (deep vs. nearer the tips).</li>
            <li>My first one was bought at a cheap asian department store in Toronto, and ever since then, I had always believed that my asian lashes will never ever curl and will remain straight forever.</li>
            <li>This is a whole new world of eyelash ecstasy for</li>
            <li>Most Asian eyes don&#x27;t need such a severe curved curler.</li>
            <li>I ordered this eyelash curler as a replacement for a Maybelline one that I had been using since high school.  </li>
            <li>I have a Revlon one that I owned which also pinches, which is why I tried this after reading the reviews, it might be a little better, but still pinches.  </li>
            <li>It was time for a new one.</li>
            <li>But when it come down to it, most eyelash curlers are constructed much the same.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely happy that I spent a little extra to buy this.  </li>
            <li>I have stick straight lashes and this curler barely did anything for them.</li>
            <li>Came with a ton (three) of refill pads for the curler and thus far has worked perfectly as far as eyelash curlers go!</li>
            <li>After watching a Japanese youtuber use this curler, I decided to pay a little more to buy this and hope that it would work.</li>
            <li>More expensive than others but worth it.</li>
            <li>This curler, though much more expensive, looks and feels very much like my old faithful Maybelline curler.  </li>
            <li>You get a full tight curl with one squeeze.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the same mascara but can see the difference between Shiseido (new) and the Revlon (old).  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t lay flat on my eyelids so the front part of it is way too far when I try to curl normally.</li>
            <li>The inserts are really high quality so these should last quite a long time.</li>
            <li>So it gets even those short, slight eye-lashes at the very outer corner of my eyes making the curl seem fuller and thicker.  </li>

            <li> They are a little less curved than more western brands but they just require a little different placement when placing on the lashes.  </li>
            <li> I had some really high hopes for this product, but after receiving this product and going to Sephora to see the real one I realized I got a fake one.</li>
            <li> Definitely not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Wondering why I waited so long?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so strange that this is $16 though.</li>
            <li> I am Asian, have almond shaped eyes with mono lids and my lashes are average length.</li>
            <li> Packaging was slightly crushed but the product was intact with no damage.</li>
            <li> the curlers were too deeply curved to ever get all my lashes, resulting in crimped, uneven lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (sorry if not written right, but you know what I meant).</li>
            <li> Splurge on other things.</li>
            <li> have struggled for decades trying to make my eyelids conform to other eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li> Its a lot flatter than a typical curler and the rubber</li>
            <li> I typically heat up the curler with the hair dryer before curling my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I think that this Shiseido curler has less of a curve so it fits eyes</li>
            <li> I thought these were the bomb, but I couldn&#x27;t even get a tight grip on my lashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not smooth when I use it</li>
            <li> I should have just gone to Sephora rather than risking it and saving a few bucks.</li>
            <li> This means that it may not fit all eyes.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it! This is the only eyelash curler she will use</li>
            <li> By far the BEST eyelash curler out there! It sits well on my eye and no pinch! You get a full tight curl with one squeeze.  I&#x27;m happy!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for Asian eyes ;)</li>
            <li> I love it! I&#x27;ve always used this Shiseido curler. But recently the curler that I could get locally is no longer made this way and I didn&#x27;t want my friend from Japan ship it to me again. I&#x27;m glad that I was able to get it through here....the quality is what I&#x27;m looking for. I can&#x27;t live without this Shiseido eye lash curler!!!</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations! It is lightweight but the quality is still there. Came in with a total of 4 of the rubbers (2 in the pack itself and 2 extra for refills) so I will be set for awhile. It is a tiny bit smaller in size overall than the Revlon eyelash curler I am replacing but it does not make a difference to me. I am Asian, have almond shaped eyes with mono lids and my lashes are average length. Using the Shiseido eyelash curler opened up my eyes - they had a beautiful, natural curl and the lashes were evenly spread out. I did not experience any more pinching since the arch shape was not as rounded, but more flattened out to fit my eye shape/flat face. I see quite a difference after only 2 uses and very happy with my investment.</li>
            <li> I love this curler, and would recommend it to anyone who would like to extend their lashes. Much cheaper on amazon then macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyelash curler! Doesn&#x27;t pinch and doesn&#x27;t take a lot of effort or attention. Never buying another brand again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian so I have a different eye shape than most and all my old curlers didn&#x27;t fit right. They used to always pinch my skin and I just thought I was using the curlers wrong like the Revlon eye curler. But when I got this curler, I thought it was a miracle! No more pinched skin! Its a lot flatter than a typical curler and the rubber is durable. It was also nice that it came with a refill set and even an extra one in the original packaging. Great buy!</li>
            <li> First eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve ever owned that didn&#x27;t pinch my lids or pull out my lashes. And the curl really lasts. They are a little less curved than more western brands but they just require a little different placement when placing on the lashes.  I love them.</li>
            <li> Definitely not what I expected. I thought these were the bomb, but I couldn&#x27;t even get a tight grip on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I had some really high hopes for this product, but after receiving this product and going to Sephora to see the real one I realized I got a fake one. I have stick straight lashes and this curler barely did anything for them. The curl was lost after 30 minutes. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this eyelash curler as a replacement for a Maybelline one that I had been using since high school.  This curler does a far superior job at curling my lashes, and without breaking them!  I&#x27;m definitely happy that I spent a little extra to buy this.  It&#x27;s also really nice to have the extra refills that come with it.  The inserts are really high quality so these should last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Arrived the first estimated day of delivery. Packaging was slightly crushed but the product was intact with no damage. Came with a ton (three) of refill pads for the curler and thus far has worked perfectly as far as eyelash curlers go! Does not pinch the skin, provides a nice, full curl and is easy to use at multiple angles to get all the little lashes at the corners of the eyes and on multiple depths of the lash (deep vs. nearer the tips).</li>
            <li> I had been using the Shu Uemera eyelash curler for about 6+ years before I discovered this one. This one works a lot better for me, I had probelms with the Shu Uemera rubber pads falling out but I have never had an issue with this one. This one also comes with additional rubber pads which is also a plus.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Shiseido eyelash curler when I was in high school and used it for 4 years. It was time for a new one. I used to work in a makeup store and everyone always asked me what eyelash curler I used and this was the one I recommended. It will give you the perfect curl and is great for many different eye shapes (especially Asian). It will curl stubborn straight lashes.</li>
            <li> Great price and best lash curler on market!</li>
            <li> Best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> This is my first Shiseido curler.  I love how it fits my whole eye and it doesn&#x27;t pinch! I bought a Tarte a while ago, and all it does is pinch, pinch, pinch! The Shiseido seems to hold the curl and it curls all of my straight downward lashes.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> One of the best eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> Had another brand for 30Â± years, this is a great lash curler.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. I&#x27;ve had better results with a cheaper curler.</li>
            <li> Best curler out there. Lashes stay in place for hours. Great for any eye shape. More expensive than others but worth it.</li>
            <li> I feel upset because I received a defective item.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t work properly.&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to clamp the curler together.&lt;br /&gt;It is not smooth when I use it so it occurs a strange sound.</li>
            <li> I think this would work better for eyes that protrude a little bit because I had to angle this upwards to make sure that it gets all my lashes. This doesn&#x27;t lay flat on my eyelids so the front part of it is way too far when I try to curl normally.</li>
            <li> To be honest, my expectations were very high. All the buzz around this eye curler, it&#x27;s just that. I did my homework, for I had to replace my Shuemura (sorry if not written right, but you know what I meant). After all the reviews stating that this WAS the curler for me, I have tried it for about 2 weeks. That&#x27;s when I realized that an eye curler is just an eye  curler. Many drugstores brands would do way better...Splurge on other things.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of curling all my lashes and doesn&#x27;t seem to pinch as some of the other curlers do.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Was a little wary when I received this because it was a lot smaller than my usual eyelash curler but it fit perfectly to my eye and it gave my lashes a perfect curl without any pain. I love this eyelash curler and it is now the only brand I&#x27;ll ever use!</li>
            <li> Fits well for Asian eyes.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve used yet and cost less.</li>
            <li> I have tried different eyelash curler from drugstore brand to department store products.  This is my favorite.  It doesn&#x27;t pinch and curls the lashes very well.  I typically heat up the curler with the hair dryer before curling my eyelashes.  It curls all my lashes well.  I also appreciate the extra refill!</li>
            <li> I bought this eyelash curler for my Asian daughter.  She had had a Shu Uemura before but they do not sell refills for it.  You have to buy the whole curler all over again.  Shiseido does sell refills and my daughter says she likes it even better than the Shu!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first Shiseido item I have purchased and would buy again.  Very well made and I hope this product turns out to be a good buy.</li>
            <li> This eye lash curler works great!</li>
            <li> I got a fake Shiseido. I&#x27;ve used the real one before and this one is obviously way more curved than the real one. Most Asian eyes don&#x27;t need such a severe curved curler. I should have just gone to Sephora rather than risking it and saving a few bucks.</li>
            <li> Who would think that a simple eye-lash curler would make such a difference!?  I think this one is better than most because it is wide enough to cover the entire length of my eye-lid.  So it gets even those short, slight eye-lashes at the very outer corner of my eyes making the curl seem fuller and thicker.  I&#x27;m using the same mascara but can see the difference between Shiseido (new) and the Revlon (old).  Wondering why I waited so long?  I like this one too, because I can buy replacement rubber parts!</li>
            <li> I just started using it and, honestly, it doesn&#x27;t seem much better than the other ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.  However, even though it seemed expensive, it came with 3 refills.  I&#x27;ll keep using it for now.</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder if this is really from Shisheido.  I read reviews on Macy&#x27;s website that this curler is great, does not pinch, etc, but I felt the pinch.  I have a Revlon one that I owned which also pinches, which is why I tried this after reading the reviews, it might be a little better, but still pinches.  For just about $4 difference, I would buy form Macy or big dept store just for the assurance it&#x27;s the genuine product.  Not saying mine is not, but just based on reviews I read, and using the one I ordered, I don&#x27;t feel much difference and have some doubts.</li>
            <li> This is my second eyelash curler. My first one was bought at a cheap asian department store in Toronto, and ever since then, I had always believed that my asian lashes will never ever curl and will remain straight forever. After watching a Japanese youtuber use this curler, I decided to pay a little more to buy this and hope that it would work. It does work! The clamp is big, so it covers a lot of your lashes, and it curls them beautifully without pinching (my old one always pinched my eyes, so I thought my skills were just bad). I guess this just says that sometimes expensive stuff do work better.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so strange that this is $16 though. On the top it says 800 yen, so that would be just $7 US, and the replacement packet is 100 yen, so maybe just $8 US at most, but it costs double the price on Amazon and even a whooping $19 on sephora!</li>
            <li> Favorite curler, I will never buy another. Provides great curl all day and doesnt pinch or pull lashes.</li>
            <li> Eh, Trish McEvoy is by far better than this curler. This one takes me 5 or 6 more squeezes to get the curl I want. Trish McEvoy does it in 1 or 2 squeezes.</li>
            <li> I do like this eyelash curler for my lashes. It happens to fit the curve of my eyes very well and curls my entire lash line without pinching. And I like that it includes refills.  But when it come down to it, most eyelash curlers are constructed much the same.  This curler, though much more expensive, looks and feels very much like my old faithful Maybelline curler.  But the main difference is that the shape of the curve of the Shiseido fits my eyes better.  This means that it may not fit all eyes. I think that this Shiseido curler has less of a curve so it fits eyes that are not deep set. Again, it&#x27;s mostly about the curve of any particular curler and how it fits your eyes that can determine how well it works for you.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than my previous curler, but works great, and I love that it comes with refills!</li>
            <li> These curlers are wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;I have struggled for decades trying to make my eyelids conform to other eyelash curlers. The results have always left me wanting...the curlers were too deeply curved to ever get all my lashes, resulting in crimped, uneven lashes.&lt;br /&gt;The very first time I used these, I knew I would never have to search for a new eyelash curler.&lt;br /&gt;It is slightly less curved than other curlers (I have tried several), so it follows my lashline perfectly, curling every single lash perfectly, and...NO PINCHING! This is a whole new world of eyelash ecstasy for me.&lt;br /&gt;My eyes look so much larger and more awake...a big deal for my hooded eyes!&lt;br /&gt;I will never use a different eyelash curler, this one is PERFECT!</li>
            <li> pinches the sides of my eyelids</li>
            <li> Loved it recommend buyer.</li>
            <li> Great eyelash curler. Fit really well and doesn&#x27;t pinch. Curls my lashes nicely.</li>
