            <li>The color is Beautiful, just perfect,</li>
            <li>THE COLOR IS BEAUTIFUL AND STILL HAD THE STICKER.</li>
            <li>Creamsicle is a great color.</li>
            <li>Looks great when using a warmer toned look with corals and peaches.  </li>
            <li>I am more than happy!</li>
            <li>Maybe if I had a perfectly moisturized pout it would look better?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t imagine this looking good on anyone.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been searching for a good lip color to lighten them.</li>
            <li>Is gorgeous on me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how this colour could look good on anyone.</li>
            <li>It came on time it was good.</li>
            <li>Now on to my praise of the product, if you are looking for a daytime creamy looking lighter lip (which is the hottest trend in make up right now) this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Revlon Colorburst Lip Butter happens to be one of my favorite products!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I want to wear these trendy nude-ish lip colors</li>
            <li>Color is just what I wanted came packaged nicely</li>
            <li>To give a ombre nude look use a darker nude to light brown lip liner then apply the creamsicle lip butter over top, it give a gorgeous nude daytime lip!</li>
            <li>Seller is great to work with and responds quickly to questions.</li>
            <li>Product was received quickly; price was fair.  </li>
            <li>I love these Colorburst lip butters.</li>
            <li>well it wouldn&#x27;t flatter my light warm skin tone.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shade for my skin tone..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to buying more now</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I have found this makes a pretty good top coat.</li>
            <li>Color does not go on evenly and wipes off way too easily.  </li>
            <li>but it still comes out pretty nicely</li>
            <li>that I know how nice the pigment and moisture really are!</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY AS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE AND CAME PACKAGED NICELY.</li>
            <li>And those complaining about the color being to light, thats not a reason to give it one to two stars.</li>
            <li>and there it was available.  </li>
            <li>Was hoping for a peachy light color to complement my golden-based skin tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks bizarre on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft yet bright peach</li>
            <li>This lipstick is REALLY light.</li>
            <li>Perfect for natural daily makeup.</li>
            <li>I bought it anyway because the light orange shade is so pretty and unique.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s super creamy.</li>
            <li>The picture of sooooo pretty but this whole line of lip sticks are more of a buttery application.</li>
            <li>I just layer it over a deeper shade, and I get a nice sheer glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more on the natural tan side</li>
            <li>Keeps my lips silky, moisturized and has just the right amount of color application.</li>
            <li>2 down 18 more to go :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m fair skinned toned so if your are maybe a little dark this color won&#x27;t be good for you</li>
            <li>and thhis gives off a really pretty nude color..</li>
            <li>More moisturizing than regular lipstick.  </li>
            <li>So it is a very light pale peachy color that does not give a full coverge because it is a LIP BUTTER as the product states.</li>
            <li>It is a bit sheer but easy to layer.</li>
            <li>I offered it to a friend who is much fairer-skinned than</li>
            <li>The wear and quality of this color is much like the hype describes.</li>
            <li>Its a great natural color, and it doesn&#x27;t look ridiculous on me like</li>
            <li>but it is a sheer top coat not an actual lipstick.</li>
            <li>This is a whitish peach color that is so much lighter than my natural lip color.</li>
            <li>it makes my lips look as if it&#x27;s naturally a light pink color.</li>
            <li>I am just more disappointed that the color doesn&#x27;t show through it looks like such a beautiful coral.</li>
            <li>This is mostly due to the fact that my lips are naturally very red, so putting a light orange over that is going to look fugly.</li>
            <li>U have to first apply lipbalm before applying and not too much or too little or else</li>
            <li>The lipstick tint itself is pretty sheer (obviously its a lip butter)</li>
            <li>This lip butter is really great for those not looking for a real dramatic nude lip.</li>
            <li>With all this said, from other reviews and from pictures I found online from real users, it looks like this the other shades of this product look fabulous on a lot of other women...</li>
            <li>I own at least 5 other Lip Butters, and I highly recommend trying out the other shades if you&#x27;re a fan of the formula.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little disappointed because the color didn&#x27;t come off as much of a coral-orange color as I was hoping, but I love it anyway!.</li>

            <li> Very subtle light orange color.  </li>

            <li> a nude pink color does.</li>

            <li> it is very thick and when you&#x27;re older its not appealing in the cracks of your lips.</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t look as odd on me.  </li>
            <li> Had used previously , was discontinued.</li>
            <li> It is a cream based colored (which is a white base) lip butter, exactly what it says it is.</li>

            <li> I (sadly) have dull, dark lips</li>
            <li> The color is called CREAM-sicle meaning it has a WHITE base.</li>
            <li> As a MUA I am astounded at people who think a color is bad because they cant swipe it on and it is not magically what they ASSUMED it would be.</li>
            <li> When worn alone, this does look weird on me.</li>
            <li> Sad that Revlon discontinued this one.</li>
            <li> This lipstick has a creamy base, and almost seems to hydrate my lips.</li>

            <li> this stuff just makes them look horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love these Colorburst lip butters. Keeps my lips silky, moisturized and has just the right amount of color application. For those complaining that the color is to sheer, um hello, its a lip butter! And those complaining about the color being to light, thats not a reason to give it one to two stars. The color is called CREAM-sicle meaning it has a WHITE base. As a MUA I am astounded at people who think a color is bad because they cant swipe it on and it is not magically what they ASSUMED it would be. It is a cream based colored (which is a white base) lip butter, exactly what it says it is. So it is a very light pale peachy color that does not give a full coverge because it is a LIP BUTTER as the product states. Now on to my praise of the product, if you are looking for a daytime creamy looking lighter lip (which is the hottest trend in make up right now) this is perfect. To give a ombre nude look use a darker nude to light brown lip liner then apply the creamsicle lip butter over top, it give a gorgeous nude daytime lip!</li>
            <li> Revlon Colorburst Lip Butter happens to be one of my favorite products!  When I couldn&#x27;t find it in inventory anywhere locally, I checked Amazon....and there it was available.  Product was received quickly; price was fair.  I am more than happy!</li>
            <li> Lipstick was obviously opened and used</li>
            <li> Creamsicle is a great color. I am blonde and medium complexion with darker lips. This lipstick has a creamy base, and almost seems to hydrate my lips. Seller is great to work with and responds quickly to questions.</li>
            <li> I purchased this knowing darn well it wouldn&#x27;t flatter my light warm skin tone. I bought it anyway because the light orange shade is so pretty and unique. When worn alone, this does look weird on me. This is mostly due to the fact that my lips are naturally very red, so putting a light orange over that is going to look fugly. HOWEVER, I have found this makes a pretty good top coat. I just layer it over a deeper shade, and I get a nice sheer glow. I think if you experiment you&#x27;ll eventually find a way to wear this color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t feel I should subtract stars just because the shade doesn&#x27;t work that well on me. It&#x27;s a gorgeous color. Plus, it&#x27;s super creamy. I own at least 5 other Lip Butters, and I highly recommend trying out the other shades if you&#x27;re a fan of the formula.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me - I want to wear these trendy nude-ish lip colors but they never work out.  This one was no exception!  The color comes out looking like pale streaks on my lips and clings to every little piece of dry skin. My  lips are horribly chapped from winter and post-pregnancy hormones and this stuff just makes them look horrible.  It won&#x27;t even stick to any part of my lips where the dead skin has recently come off, so basically it just makes a streaky white ring around the outside of my lips and goops up on the chapped parts.  Ick!!! I&#x27;ve tried putting it on before balm, after balm, with gloss...it just doesn&#x27;t work.  Maybe if I had a perfectly moisturized pout it would look better?  Either way I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone with a lighter yellowish skin tone like mine. Perhaps if I had a tan it wouldn&#x27;t look as odd on me.  With all this said, from other reviews and from pictures I found online from real users, it looks like this the other shades of this product look fabulous on a lot of other women...so don&#x27;t let my review scare you unless you have dry lips and a skin tone like mine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shade for my skin tone.. I&#x27;m more on the natural tan side and thhis gives off a really pretty nude color.. I love it! I&#x27;m starting my collection of these lip butters. 2 down 18 more to go :)</li>
            <li> This lip butter is really great for those not looking for a real dramatic nude lip. The lipstick tint itself is pretty sheer (obviously its a lip butter) but it still comes out pretty nicely and you can probably try building it up if you want to.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for a peachy light color to complement my golden-based skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Oh no, not what I got. This is a whitish peach color that is so much lighter than my natural lip color. Looks bizarre on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So  I offered it to a friend who is much fairer-skinned than myself.&lt;br /&gt;Still a no. Looked oddly white on her too.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine this looking good on anyone.</li>
            <li> I (sadly) have dull, dark lips so I&#x27;ve been searching for a good lip color to lighten them. This color does just that- it makes my lips look as if it&#x27;s naturally a light pink color. At first I was a little disappointed because the color didn&#x27;t come off as much of a coral-orange color as I was hoping, but I love it anyway!. Its a great natural color, and it doesn&#x27;t look ridiculous on me like a nude pink color does. It is a bit sheer but easy to layer. The wear and quality of this color is much like the hype describes.</li>
            <li> The picture of sooooo pretty but this whole line of lip sticks are more of a buttery application. It does say it in the head line but it is a sheer top coat not an actual lipstick. I am just more disappointed that the color doesn&#x27;t show through it looks like such a beautiful coral.</li>
            <li> Had used previously , was discontinued.</li>
            <li> Ilove the way this feels on my lips. It&#x27;s hydrating and the color goes on evenly. I&#x27;m looking forward to buying more now that I know how nice the pigment and moisture really are! And the color! Is gorgeous on me. It&#x27;s a soft yet bright peach</li>
            <li> Color is just what I wanted came packaged nicely will he shopping again soon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fair skinned toned so if your are maybe a little dark this color won&#x27;t be good for you</li>
            <li> This lipstick is REALLY light. not the shade of the lipstick but the visual effect of the lipstick. U have to first apply lipbalm before applying and not too much or too little or else this lipstick will cake up .</li>
            <li> Perfect for natural daily makeup. Sad that Revlon discontinued this one.</li>
            <li> The color is Beautiful, just perfect,</li>
            <li> hideous color.  Seeps into every crevice even mildly dry lips will look horrendously chapped.  Formula feels overly greasy and sticky on the lips.  Color does not go on evenly and wipes off way too easily.  Would not recommend.  I don&#x27;t see how this colour could look good on anyone.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS EXACTLY AS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE AND CAME PACKAGED NICELY. THE COLOR IS BEAUTIFUL AND STILL HAD THE STICKER.</li>
            <li> It came on time it was good.</li>
            <li> Very subtle light orange color.  Looks great when using a warmer toned look with corals and peaches.  More moisturizing than regular lipstick.  Requires reapplication because it is not long-lasting, but helps protect my lips when I don&#x27;t just want to use a balm.</li>
            <li> I watched a youtube video where the woman around my age (51) applied this to &amp;#34;finish off her look&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Well it is very thick and when you&#x27;re older its not appealing in the cracks of your lips. no color at all when on lips.. Dont waste your money</li>
