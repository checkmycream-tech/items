            <li>The best clipper ever works very well</li>
            <li>After using the designer&#x27;s for for about five minutes, I noticed it would tug on hair very easily.  </li>
            <li>I always enjoyed going to the barber to get a nice shape up and everything.</li>
            <li>The designer is still going strong!</li>
            <li>The delivering service was very accurate.</li>
            <li>The instructions should have more details.</li>
            <li>I have had these for about 6 months and love these clippers, they work well.</li>
            <li>Much better then rechargeable cutter.</li>
            <li>He said his clippers are better than mine.  </li>
            <li>the holds the top body cover to the motor housing.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t find anything better for the price.</li>
            <li>worth the money and good to have both hair and neck trimmer.</li>

            <li>Love Wahl products.</li>
            <li>they are effective and precise if your a barber and your looking to upgrade buy these clippers</li>
            <li>I would get the Andis T-liners they are much much better.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I don&#x27;t use this for my hair...</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>this clippers are amazing, specially the peanut.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and gives a nice clean edge.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a really hair guy and this is by far the best trimmer/manscape tool I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>So, I ordered this, Wahl All Star Combo set, which includes the, &amp;#34;Peanut&amp;#34; fine trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Its light weight and not noisy.</li>
            <li>It seems that they are for advanced users.</li>
            <li>Great product I definitely recommend this kit.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>so I use the Peanut to keep my face looking civilized</li>
            <li>so far so good</li>
            <li>Wow this is the perfec clipper, Im very pleased with this product, plus</li>
            <li>I received it in time, thanks much for so good service</li>
            <li>These clippers work pretty good for the price, just make sure you clean the regularly and use clipper oil because there are a lot of crevices the hair can get stuck in.</li>
            <li>, no need to look for more, this is the real deal...</li>
            <li>Excellent value quality is more than I expected and it is very quiet!!!  </li>
            <li>Ten minutes with a #4 clipper attachment and a quick touch up with the \\&quot;Peanut\\&quot; trimmer at the ears and neck line, and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>Great product, the blades are extremely sharp.</li>
            <li>Third Peanut one I had, keep going back to it because its so great!</li>
            <li>they trim my family&#x27;s thick hair flawlessly and can not beat the price anywhere, worth the wait for the online order.</li>
            <li>me a new replacement cover, free of charge!  </li>
            <li>The little peanut works great to.</li>
            <li>She said it works great and after a few uses it does.  </li>
            <li>Peanut is a waste of time but everything else is great.</li>
            <li>is good, was not what I expected</li>
            <li>Get it trust me its a combo pack, totally worth it and</li>
            <li>combo deal is really worth it if you use both products.</li>
            <li>If you can get past that there are great for a beginners.</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li>We are pretty tight with money and need to feel like we had good bang for our buck.  </li>
            <li>but the trimmers are super super loud.</li>
            <li>as many haircuts as I do on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make this a better deal would have been a carrying case.</li>
            <li>I cut hair on a daily basis and I love them.  </li>
            <li>This is commercial grade equipment that is both affordable and works so wonderful that any amateur can use them.</li>
            <li>Does not get hot.  </li>
            <li>Cuts like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>Item delivered fast, was as described!</li>
            <li>I normally do not leave reviews for many products - but I felt compelled to come here and leave a quick and absolutely positive note for the Wahl All Star Combo Clipper/Trimmer.</li>
            <li>im hoping my wife sees this clipper on my wish list, so i can own a new \\&quot;designer\\&quot; for another ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>absolutely loves this product and truth be told he uses the &amp;#34;peanut&amp;#34; more so than the larger clippers</li>
            <li>My wife used the last one regularly and it lasted exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li>I am ultimately a super clumsy guy (just ask my wife) and I was dreading having to shave my own head.</li>
            <li>a nice little 2-punch combo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Designers cut really well once zero</li>
            <li>and I saved so much money on haircuts it has payed for its self</li>
            <li>The Wahl all star combo clipper/trimmer kit is an excellent clipper for a person cutting hair at home.  </li>
            <li>It is light and does not require one to be too technical to use it.</li>
            <li>and they are very quite and work well</li>
            <li>The price was also better then some other products.</li>
            <li>Works well and a nice bonus to have the small peanut clippers as well.</li>
            <li>The larger clipper, not so much, but I am overall satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>i highly recomend this clipper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my barber to recommend a do-it-yourself kit and he highly recommended I go with this package.</li>
            <li>Husband absolutely loved the small trimmers for his beard &amp; the big ones glide nicely through his thick hair.</li>
            <li>Everything was new in the package and the clippers work well.</li>
            <li>She was in dire need of a new set of clippers.</li>
            <li>the only problem i have experienced is that the power cord has frayed, just behind the clipper.</li>
            <li>The trimmers are very loud but do the job.  </li>
            <li>that going to the barber every time to keep my sides shorter than my top became an unreasonable, repetitive and time consuming task.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted several years and probably could have been fixed if I had known how to do it.</li>
            <li>because they are trying to get rid of the old design.</li>
            <li>They are loud and they don&#x27;t cut to even peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>bought them again to replace mine which I&#x27;ve used for like 3 years professionally</li>
            <li>the clipper had a burst and completely stopped working .</li>
            <li>I had an old Wahl Clipper and wanted the updated version.  </li>
            <li>the peanut dam nearly shaves your head bald</li>
            <li>Heavy Duty and very powerful.  </li>
            <li>Hands down they work better than any other set of clippers I have purchased.</li>
            <li>The first two broke due to water damage, not because of something</li>
            <li>Imagine our surprise to find it for near half the cost of the first one we purchased.</li>
            <li>We used this set for over 8 years until the old one finally started giving out.</li>
            <li>The big clippers feel like a professional tool.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty, powerful and affordable set of clippers.  </li>
            <li>Good afternoon friends was very happy with the combo of the two machines, but using the small machine was a failure, the little machine is bad has nothing of force does not work,</li>
            <li>It seems to be well made and not at all flimsy and the smaller &amp;#34;Peanut&amp;#34; is small enough and light enough to take when traveling.</li>
            <li>I was so embarased, when he was used by first time, the peanut stop and left him with a half of his face undone.</li>

            <li> Wow this is the perfec clipper, Im very pleased with this product, plus</li>
            <li> I received it in time, thanks much for so good service</li>
            <li> These clippers work pretty good for the price, just make sure you clean the regularly and use clipper oil because there are a lot of crevices the hair can get stuck in.</li>

            <li> We are pretty tight with money and need to feel like we had good bang for our buck.  </li>
            <li> but the trimmers are super super loud.</li>
            <li> as many haircuts as I do on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make this a better deal would have been a carrying case.</li>
            <li> I cut hair on a daily basis and I love them.  </li>
            <li> This is commercial grade equipment that is both affordable and works so wonderful that any amateur can use them.</li>
            <li> Does not get hot.  </li>
            <li> Cuts like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li> Item delivered fast, was as described!</li>
            <li> I normally do not leave reviews for many products - but I felt compelled to come here and leave a quick and absolutely positive note for the Wahl All Star Combo Clipper/Trimmer.</li>
            <li> im hoping my wife sees this clipper on my wish list, so i can own a new \\&quot;designer\\&quot; for another ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> absolutely loves this product and truth be told he uses the &amp;#34;peanut&amp;#34; more so than the larger clippers</li>
            <li> My wife used the last one regularly and it lasted exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li> I am ultimately a super clumsy guy (just ask my wife) and I was dreading having to shave my own head.</li>
            <li> a nice little 2-punch combo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Designers cut really well once zero</li>
            <li> and I saved so much money on haircuts it has payed for its self</li>
            <li> The Wahl all star combo clipper/trimmer kit is an excellent clipper for a person cutting hair at home.  </li>
            <li> It is light and does not require one to be too technical to use it.</li>
            <li> and they are very quite and work well</li>
            <li> The price was also better then some other products.</li>
            <li> Works well and a nice bonus to have the small peanut clippers as well.</li>
            <li> The larger clipper, not so much, but I am overall satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> i highly recomend this clipper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my barber to recommend a do-it-yourself kit and he highly recommended I go with this package.</li>
            <li> Husband absolutely loved the small trimmers for his beard &amp; the big ones glide nicely through his thick hair.</li>
            <li> Everything was new in the package and the clippers work well.</li>
            <li> She was in dire need of a new set of clippers.</li>
            <li> the only problem i have experienced is that the power cord has frayed, just behind the clipper.</li>
            <li> The trimmers are very loud but do the job.  </li>
            <li> that going to the barber every time to keep my sides shorter than my top became an unreasonable, repetitive and time consuming task.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted several years and probably could have been fixed if I had known how to do it.</li>
            <li> because they are trying to get rid of the old design.</li>
            <li> They are loud and they don&#x27;t cut to even peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> bought them again to replace mine which I&#x27;ve used for like 3 years professionally</li>
            <li> the clipper had a burst and completely stopped working .</li>
            <li> I had an old Wahl Clipper and wanted the updated version.  </li>
            <li> the peanut dam nearly shaves your head bald</li>
            <li> Heavy Duty and very powerful.  </li>
            <li> Hands down they work better than any other set of clippers I have purchased.</li>
            <li> The first two broke due to water damage, not because of something</li>
            <li> Imagine our surprise to find it for near half the cost of the first one we purchased.</li>
            <li> We used this set for over 8 years until the old one finally started giving out.</li>
            <li> The big clippers feel like a professional tool.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty, powerful and affordable set of clippers.  </li>
            <li> Good afternoon friends was very happy with the combo of the two machines, but using the small machine was a failure, the little machine is bad has nothing of force does not work,</li>
            <li> It seems to be well made and not at all flimsy and the smaller &amp;#34;Peanut&amp;#34; is small enough and light enough to take when traveling.</li>
            <li> I was so embarased, when he was used by first time, the peanut stop and left him with a half of his face undone.</li>
            <li> I mean it humms loud but not irritating or distracting.</li>
            <li> The hair clipper is beefier then my previous clipper, and the &amp;#34;Peanut&amp;#34; is fantastic at small, very close quarter clipping, and very close to the skin hair cutting, for designing, beard trimming, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason we replaced it is because both units eventually just weren&#x27;t sharp enough to keep going.  </li>
            <li> There excuse was \\&quot;we moved\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I am curious to see how they work after about a year because that seems to be the life expectancy of the kits that you buy from the big box stores</li>
            <li> ITs the shipping, took long time to get</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t dropped it will las for long time</li>
            <li> to the broken part of my original clippers, I called Wahl customer support, told them about the problem, how, over the years, vibration had worn down the plastic housing where the single screw mount holds everything together, and here&#x27;s what Wahl did...</li>
            <li> What actually broke on the previous unit was the plastic screw mount</li>
            <li> About thirty seconds after the peanut was plugged in a little puff of smoke came out and died shortly.  </li>
            <li> Pity the machines do not work</li>
            <li> The alignment of the clippers were not straight.</li>
            <li> You can get a Norelco trimmer for like ten bucks less and its garbage!</li>
            <li> For the price I saved about 50% if I had bought it from other sites and about 75% if I would have bought them separately.</li>
            <li> The peanut wasn&#x27;t sharp either.</li>
            <li> I really expected them to last at least over a year though.</li>
            <li> ive been cutting my hair (or what&#x27;s left, i cut with no blade guard, as short as possible)</li>
            <li> The only complaint i have is, the blade had to be realigned when i got them</li>
            <li> Ordered this set after the previous Wahl clipper I owned broke down.  </li>
            <li> little to no maintenance.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with cheaper models.</li>
            <li> I use it to trim my beard every few days.</li>
            <li> My hair recently got to that point where it was so thin</li>
            <li> I never received these because USPS is lazy; however I bought them in a beauty supply store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Wahl Peanut for at least twenty years and couldn&#x27;t cut hair without it.  </li>
            <li> My first pair of Wahl&#x27;s that I hated.</li>
            <li> until i found this clipper, i owned three or four different clippers, as they would crap out after 6 months!</li>
            <li> but I was unable to find them any where but on here</li>
            <li> She is happily cutting hair.</li>
            <li> and I was disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great with my boys hair. Just as good as I was expecting. The little peanut works great to. Would buy again</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT WITH A GREAT PRICE, RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE WHO WANTS A QUALITY PRODUCT ON A BUDGET.</li>
            <li> Everything was new in the package and the clippers work well. Looks just like it is advertised. No disappointments with this product.</li>
            <li> These clippers work pretty good for the price, just make sure you clean the regularly and use clipper oil because there are a lot of crevices the hair can get stuck in. Good power.</li>
            <li> These clippers are the quality I was looking for at a fair price. However bigvalueinc charged me horrendously for shipping and then it took them weeks to get them to me.  There excuse was \\&quot;we moved\\&quot;. Anyway clippers are great.</li>
            <li> Great set for a Cosmetologist. Peanut is the best!</li>
            <li> These are great been using them for over a year now. Hands down they work better than any other set of clippers I have purchased.</li>
            <li> i highly recomend this clipper. ive been cutting my hair (or what&#x27;s left, i cut with no blade guard, as short as possible) about once a week for over 15 years and i have had the \\&quot;designer\\&quot; for about ten of them. ten years! until i found this clipper, i owned three or four different clippers, as they would crap out after 6 months! the only maintenance i have performed over the years is oiling (pre-use), brushing out the hair post-use and a one-time cleaning with blade cleaner. the only problem i have experienced is that the power cord has frayed, just behind the clipper. im hoping my wife sees this clipper on my wish list, so i can own a new \\&quot;designer\\&quot; for another ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;likes: looks, sounds, feels and performs like a commercial grade clipper. little to no maintenance. even and consistant cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dislikes: none</li>
            <li> I bougth one as a gift for my husband. I was so embarased, when he was used by first time, the peanut stop and left him with a half of his face undone. Is a robery! I feel cheated! Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> This set is great. Works well and a nice bonus to have the small peanut clippers as well. Everything you need in one pack.</li>
            <li> I Do hair for a living n needed a good set of clippers n trimmers because my trimmers stopped working on me. Great deal for both, have always been pleased w Wahls w as many haircuts as I do on a daily basis. They&#x27;re great n would def recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Been working with this brand dor a while, nice combo!</li>
            <li> After using the designer&#x27;s for for about five minutes, I noticed it would tug on hair very easily.  About thirty seconds after the peanut was plugged in a little puff of smoke came out and died shortly.  They made a newer version of the peanut for a reason.  This is just something they through together because they are trying to get rid of the old design.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with cheaper models. Works great.</li>
            <li> Everything that you need to groom yourself...</li>
            <li> I use the clippers in between haircuts like touch ups as they call it. Its light weight and not noisy. I mean it humms loud but not irritating or distracting. The instructions should have more details. It seems that they are for advanced users. For the price I saved about 50% if I had bought it from other sites and about 75% if I would have bought them separately.</li>
            <li> I have had these for about 6 months and love these clippers, they work well. The only complaint i have is, the blade had to be realigned when i got them</li>
            <li> Good product!If need to I would buy it again! Much better then rechargeable cutter. The price was also better then some other products.</li>
            <li> You can not beat this price. Great product I definitely recommend this kit. If you buy these two machines separately your wasting money.</li>
            <li> I just start using it and it is perfect!!!!!!! The delivering service was very accurate. Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li> Good afternoon friends was very happy with the combo of the two machines, but using the small machine was a failure, the little machine is bad has nothing of force does not work, the wait with great eagerness until received and used.&lt;br /&gt;I have not received any response. Pity the machines do not work</li>
            <li> Third Peanut one I had, keep going back to it because its so great! The first two broke due to water damage, not because of something bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great trimmer. You can get a Norelco trimmer for like ten bucks less and its garbage!</li>
            <li> a nice little 2-punch combo. + Detailers &amp; Rapid fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Designers cut really well once zero-gapped.&lt;br /&gt;Peanut is good for nape &amp; kids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Wahl Peanut for at least twenty years and couldn&#x27;t cut hair without it.  It&#x27;s easy to use and gives a nice clean edge.  I got this set for my son (20) so he would stop borrowing mine.  He said his clippers are better than mine.  I have the Oster clippers.</li>
            <li> Ahhhhh amazing. Love these clippers!</li>
            <li> This is the second one I bought. The first one lasted several years and probably could have been fixed if I had known how to do it.</li>
            <li> Ordered this set after the previous Wahl clipper I owned broke down.  What actually broke on the previous unit was the plastic screw mount the holds the top body cover to the motor housing.  So, I ordered this, Wahl All Star Combo set, which includes the, &amp;#34;Peanut&amp;#34; fine trimmer.  The hair clipper is beefier then my previous clipper, and the &amp;#34;Peanut&amp;#34; is fantastic at small, very close quarter clipping, and very close to the skin hair cutting, for designing, beard trimming, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the broken part of my original clippers, I called Wahl customer support, told them about the problem, how, over the years, vibration had worn down the plastic housing where the single screw mount holds everything together, and here&#x27;s what Wahl did...&lt;br /&gt;Sent me a new replacement cover, free of charge!  Now that&#x27;s a great company!</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL CLIPPERS, REASONABLE PRICE, GREAT PERFORMANCE.</li>
            <li> i have been looking everywhere for a combo set like this one but I was unable to find them any where but on here</li>
            <li> This is well priced and is a good product. It seems to be well made and not at all flimsy and the smaller &amp;#34;Peanut&amp;#34; is small enough and light enough to take when traveling.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty, powerful and affordable set of clippers.  Ten minutes with a #4 clipper attachment and a quick touch up with the \\&quot;Peanut\\&quot; trimmer at the ears and neck line, and I&#x27;m good to go.  I loved my hair stylist, but I&#x27;m now saving $25 + tip a month on haircuts.</li>
            <li> this clippers are amazing, specially the peanut. awesome</li>
            <li> works great! The only thing that would make this a better deal would have been a carrying case.</li>
            <li> My wife uses them all the time.  This was the best deal anywhere and all the equipment works great.  You won&#x27;t find anything better for the price.</li>
            <li> east to use at home and on body hair. worth the money and good to have both hair and neck trimmer. great deal on Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with these they seem to be good quality  I have no complaints about them I am curious to see how they work after about a year because that seems to be the life expectancy of the kits that you buy from the big box stores</li>
            <li> Good quality. I use it to trim my beard every few days. I oil it at every use. We also use it for family haircuts. Good, sturdy construction. Valuable for any family.</li>
            <li> These were trash from the start. My first pair of Wahl&#x27;s that I hated. I never received these because USPS is lazy; however I bought them in a beauty supply store and I was disappointed. They are loud and they don&#x27;t cut to even peach fuzz. The peanut wasn&#x27;t sharp either.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered these.  I cut hair on a daily basis and I love them.  The trimmers are very loud but do the job.  For occasional hair cuts they are great!  They are also way cheaper than Sally Beauty Supply!</li>
            <li> great set at a great price. bought them again to replace mine which I&#x27;ve used for like 3 years professionally I just dropped them too many times, but I used them a lot before I had to replace them.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fianc&amp;eacute; who has to keep his hair cut every two days, as he is losing his hair :(&lt;br /&gt;He absolutely loves this product and truth be told he uses the &amp;#34;peanut&amp;#34; more so than the larger clippers bc he doesn&#x27;t use guards.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these that we have bought.  My wife used the last one regularly and it lasted exceptionally well.  The only reason we replaced it is because both units eventually just weren&#x27;t sharp enough to keep going.  We are pretty tight with money and need to feel like we had good bang for our buck.  This met that result!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is quality equipment.  Feel confident purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Love these clippers . I cut my own hair ever week and I saved so much money on haircuts it has payed for its self and then some</li>
            <li> It is good for the price.</li>
            <li> I normally do not leave reviews for many products - but I felt compelled to come here and leave a quick and absolutely positive note for the Wahl All Star Combo Clipper/Trimmer. My hair recently got to that point where it was so thin that going to the barber every time to keep my sides shorter than my top became an unreasonable, repetitive and time consuming task. Believe it or not, when you&#x27;re balding, there is actually additional upkeep that is required than not in order to continue looking sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my barber to recommend a do-it-yourself kit and he highly recommended I go with this package. I use the Designer to shave my own head with no blade guard. I use the Peanut to keep my beard nice, tidy and shaped up. I haven&#x27;t been nic&#x27;d once. This is commercial grade equipment that is both affordable and works so wonderful that any amateur can use them. I am ultimately a super clumsy guy (just ask my wife) and I was dreading having to shave my own head. I always enjoyed going to the barber to get a nice shape up and everything. This changed everything for me and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> The peanut is great, and works well for my hair.  The larger clipper, not so much, but I am overall satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Wahl Peanut for ages.  I do all of my own hair clipping and beard trimming myself.  The Peanut goes without saying, one of the best trimmers I have ever used.  The Wahl clipper is truly a great added bonus.  Heavy Duty and very powerful.  I trim my hair in 1/2 the time now and now I just use the Peanut for my beard.  Great combo.  Love Wahl products.</li>
            <li> I work at a men&#x27;s salon..so my tools are my life. These clippers and trimmers are phenomenal!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly ! Since I have this Clipper I don&#x27;t bother going to the barber shop anymore ! Great Value !!!!</li>
            <li> We do our own haircuts in my household. We used this set for over 8 years until the old one finally started giving out. Imagine our surprise to find it for near half the cost of the first one we purchased. The clippers were used the day the arrived, and have been working perfect just as the set before.</li>
            <li> Best set I&#x27;ve used. Husband absolutely loved the small trimmers for his beard &amp; the big ones glide nicely through his thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have it doing good job. .</li>
            <li> These work great!!! My husband has taken over the &amp;#34;peanut&amp;#34; for trimming is facial hair.</li>
            <li> Both clippers are great I don&#x27;t have a problem with either of them they are effective and precise if your a barber and your looking to upgrade buy these clippers</li>
            <li> When plugged in and turned on smoke started coming out of the clipper within 5 minutes the clipper had a burst and completely stopped working . The product haven&#x60;t even been used once.</li>
            <li> The clippers are excellent the trimmer is not so great.  I would get the Andis T-liners they are much much better.  http://www.amazon.com/Andis-Professional-T-Outliner-Personal-Trimmer/dp/B000143C0K/ref&#x3D;sr_1_12?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1357189794&amp;sr&#x3D;8-12&amp;keywords&#x3D;hair+trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peanuts just didnt cut it, no pun intended</li>
            <li> Awesome hair trimmer set, no need to look for more, this is the real deal...</li>
            <li> The designer is still going strong! The peanut died after about 10 months use. I work in a salon and do 10-20 clipper cuts a day, 5 days a week, so they paid for themselves. I really expected them to last at least over a year though. I will probably buy another pair and see how it goes. Both the designer and peanut work great though!</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Works well.  Built to last.  Does not get hot.  Cuts like a hot knife through butter.  This was recommended by my friend who cuts hair.  She said it works great and after a few uses it does.  Also, the trimmer works wonders on beard/facial maintenance.</li>
            <li> Item delivered fast, was as described!</li>
            <li> I had an old Wahl Clipper and wanted the updated version.  I love these clippers, they&#x27;re the best for the at home haircuts I give my family.</li>
            <li> The Wahl all star combo clipper/trimmer kit is an excellent clipper for a person cutting hair at home.  It comes with a number of guards which you can use for men or ladies haircuts.  The trimmer can be used to edge your haircut or to trim your beard.  Cleaning tools are in the container.  Don&#x27;t forget to purchase oil to keep your Wahl products in good working order.  It is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Peanut is a waste of time but everything else is great.</li>
            <li> great quality work perfect I use mine about 20 hair cuts a day never have a problem these are great</li>
            <li> I bought the Wahl clipper set for my Cosmetologist. She was in dire need of a new set of clippers. She is happily cutting hair.</li>
            <li> they trim my family&#x27;s thick hair flawlessly and can not beat the price anywhere, worth the wait for the online order.</li>
            <li> Great product, the blades are extremely sharp. The big clippers feel like a professional tool. I don&#x27;t like shaving so I use the Peanut to keep my face looking civilized, it trims my beard very short, like a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> Clippers work great, trimmers are the best!</li>
            <li> I like its finish. It is light and does not require one to be too technical to use it. My friends think I have a  great barber</li>
            <li> Okay, so I don&#x27;t use this for my hair...But these clippers work great at trimming my body hair. I&#x27;m a really hair guy and this is by far the best trimmer/manscape tool I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Wow this is the perfec clipper, Im very pleased with this product, plus I received it in time, thanks much for so good service</li>

            <li> great product  in beauty school and they are very quite and work well</li>
            <li> so far so good but the trimmers are super super loud. If you can get past that there are great for a beginners.</li>
            <li> No complaints here! These i recomend to everyone i know. The wahl peanut is a no brainer as a trimmer/ liner .I&#x27; ve been using these for years!</li>
            <li> Get it trust me its a combo pack, totally worth it and the peanut dam nearly shaves your head bald</li>
            <li> Gave as Christmas gift and it has been running great! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> been a big fan of wahl peanut and designer. combo deal is really worth it if you use both products.</li>
            <li> The alignment of the clippers were not straight.</li>
            <li> Met expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Quality product</li>
            <li> Product was good .... ITs the shipping, took long time to get</li>
