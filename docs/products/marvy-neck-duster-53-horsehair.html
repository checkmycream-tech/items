            <li>Does a great job of brushing off hair and is comfortable against the skin</li>
            <li>I have used this duster and it REALLY does do a Real good job.</li>
            <li>Nice but needs some use to soften.</li>
            <li>Has a nice feel to it.</li>
            <li>Nice brush.. Cleans the hair off the neck and chest area quite well ...</li>
            <li>In my book leaving my 2 stars is charitable in this circumstance...</li>

            <li>The brush is well made and nice to handle.  </li>
            <li>Perfect to apply talc, just like the old time barbers.</li>
            <li>This is the best that I can find so far from amazon</li>
            <li>good quality, quick delivery, and</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Feels good in the hand and on the neck when wiping away freshly cut hair.</li>
            <li>This brush is more like</li>
            <li>It does not build up static cling like the synthetic bristles.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask for.</li>
            <li>Love this and would buy again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no expert though the consistency of the fibers has a greater similarity to plastic way more than hair.</li>
            <li>Time will tell how well it holds up, but for now I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my hair stylist wife to use at home, where she does many, many haircuts for friends and family.  </li>
            <li>The wood finish is outstanding, and the overall quality is excellent.</li>
            <li>I use  Pinaud Clubman Talco which has a refreshing scent (reminds me when I was a child and used to get a hair cut).</li>
            <li>Neck duster is soooo much more comfortable than a shaving brush for removing cut hair.</li>
            <li>This along with a talc removed trimmed hair from the neck easily and with no itching or irritation to the neck.</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,but I hope to increase the brush size.</li>
            <li>but I shook them off and it is working out fine for me.</li>
            <li>The duster fine for what I need it for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine duster.  </li>
            <li>It should get the job done just fine</li>
            <li>Good brush very soft</li>
            <li>Ah the horsehair falls off, and are very soft its maybe not the best neck duster but better than other ones amazon has thats for sure.</li>
            <li>This is a nice neck duster for anyone who is looking for grooming accessories that are more old fashioned looking.  </li>
            <li>been using this for 2 years now and its still working great, the threads are still intact and overall still looks like</li>
            <li>This was very useful to get the itchy hair pieces out of their face and kept their patience under control while I finished the haircut.</li>
            <li>The duster is light and the duster hair is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Great duster, holds powder pretty good,and definitely gets the hair off his neck.</li>
            <li>Buy some talc to get the full affect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay brush, the bristles don&#x27;t really fall off</li>
            <li>Now she can do men&#x27;s cuts in true style.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely less scratchy than what Great Clips uses.</li>
            <li>Bristles are not soft but it&#x27;s okay to most clients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is a great little brush,  </li>
            <li>but with this it feels like a fresh hair of a fairy is stroking your skin with every brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice lacquered wooden handle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, it&#x27;s not as soft as you would expect horse hair to be</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too big and fits in her bag nicely.</li>
            <li>Peels the varnish right off.</li>
            <li>It is just the right size and stiffness of the bristles.</li>
            <li>right into the shop</li>
            <li>Very smart buy.</li>
            <li>Total length is 7\\&quot; with 3 5/8\\&quot; bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update..I posted my own photos to show what it really looks like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as pictured.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it appears to be well made and exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>and I love the wooden handle.</li>
            <li>I just received this about three days ago and in examining the NEW brush I find that it is a quality one that I will find useful.</li>
            <li>Finally a way to easily whisk away the prickles of hair trimmings.</li>
            <li>Nice handle and bristles are tightly attached to handle.</li>
            <li>She loves it, and told me that this brush is very high quality.  </li>
            <li>Real wood handle with Horsehair bristles.  </li>
            <li>Very functional--easily gets the hair off.  </li>
            <li>Austrian made and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Greaty brush better than expected</li>
            <li>The wood handle and the bristles appear to be very well made and put together.</li>
            <li>Was a little prickly right out if the box, but seems good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>horse hair feels looks exactly like clear plastic strands.</li>
            <li>It works very well for them, as it is very useful getting loose hair off neck, etc.</li>
            <li>It has a classic style to it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hair stylist and I absolutely love this little guy.</li>
            <li>The picture they use is a crappy one, the brush looks better than shown and the handle is round but in the picture it looks square.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Most of the duster that is used to me before has this feeling that a newly grown beard is poking through your skin.</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles and does the job it is intended to do.</li>
            <li>and I was so surprised!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend, the wood handle gives a classy and professional feel to my home barbershop.</li>
            <li>Just like you&#x27;d see at your local barber and very well made</li>
            <li>It is soft and works well.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because I thought that it was soft for the skin</li>
            <li>I cut my 8 year old son&#x27;s hair at home and needed something to brush the hair away from his face and neck.</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s not horse hair, at least I&#x27;m 95% sure that it isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t enough to this to make it really work....</li>
            <li>professional quality&lt;br /&gt;went</li>
            <li>No gimmicks; just a well made brush with soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>I use it to remove cut hair when I cut my 4 year old grandson&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Tested it on myself and others, doesn&#x27;t feel rough on the skin, feels just right.</li>
            <li>I would say that this is normal since it is real horsehair and should be expected this will happen.</li>
            <li>Not much to say except it does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do, and does it well.</li>
            <li>These can feel a little rough and some might feel the hairs are a bit long and bend too easily but by either using a quicker, broader sweep or holding the bristles half way up, there by stiffening them up, you get everything you need to effectively brush loose hairs away.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve only used it once thus far; no hairs have come out yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to convince my husband that something this soft can actually brush the hair off his neck, but I can see it doing just that.</li>
            <li>It has soft bristles and I like how it works when brushing cut hair off my neck and upper back.</li>
            <li>At first there were some excess bristles but after a few uses no issues at all.</li>
            <li>It really grabs those little hairs that stick to the skin.</li>

            <li> These can feel a little rough and some might feel the hairs are a bit long and bend too easily but by either using a quicker, broader sweep or holding the bristles half way up, there by stiffening them up, you get everything you need to effectively brush loose hairs away.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only used it once thus far; no hairs have come out yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to convince my husband that something this soft can actually brush the hair off his neck, but I can see it doing just that.</li>
            <li> It has soft bristles and I like how it works when brushing cut hair off my neck and upper back.</li>
            <li> At first there were some excess bristles but after a few uses no issues at all.</li>
            <li> It really grabs those little hairs that stick to the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it definitely works, but probably not going to last long.</li>
            <li> -- it is a well made product likely to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Dip the hair only in barbicide to disinfect them blow dry with the hair contained.</li>
            <li> Also comb regularly to keep the bristles loose.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s brisltes are clear white in colour (like the William Marvy #445 flat brush), and it is ROUND in shape, NOT oval - as depicted in the picture!</li>
            <li> Well built, long bristles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles are not a soft as some of the synthetics out there, but it&#x27;s horsehair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been using for a long time.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of getting haircuts from my father long ago.  </li>
            <li> Shook the brush to see if it had any loose hairs.</li>
            <li> After receiving it it did have two or three loose hairs in it</li>
            <li> When the bristles are still wet shake dry and affix a zip tie at the base of the bristles, tighten it but not enough to crease the hair and pull 2/3 of the way to the top and allow to dry for 48 hours.</li>
            <li> it is not very dense at all....</li>
            <li> , I need it for my hair cut, but is very rough.</li>
            <li> I use it when cutting hair for my 3 year old and 1 year old boys.  </li>
            <li> yes a few loose hairs</li>
            <li> i feel like the ends of the hairs feel a little rough but</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s probably a little rough for the face, but not too</li>
            <li> Bought this because my son complained about the generic duster that came with the clippers.</li>
            <li> I previously had a brush with synthetic bristles, that attracted hair like a magnet.  </li>
            <li> The strands are almost translucent where as hair typically should not be, so you might understand why I lean towards this assumption.</li>
            <li> It scratches a little</li>
            <li> every ticklish little stroke, you will find comfort and would like to use it over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li> Could be a little firmer</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice but keeps talc from getting all over everything.</li>
            <li> I shave my head once a week and this brush keeps the little hairs from sticking to my skin (neck area).</li>
            <li> Heavy duty brush.  </li>
            <li> No more little shavings tickling the cranium area (cranarea).</li>
            <li> I had seen the one fairly bad review on the neck duster and was hesitant to buy it at first.</li>

            <li> Durable and doesnt feel hard on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No issues with hair loss, well at least not with the duster.</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s just poorly treated.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s just very disappointing false advertising which is shady business.</li>
            <li> She had bought a home hair clipper set, and began cutting her husband and sons&#x27; hair at home.  </li>
            <li> I use this product to brush off excess hair when shaving or cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a must have for cutting hair at home.</li>
            <li> They used to get frustrated with the itchy hair pieces that fell on their face and neck which made them squirm a lot.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed and do not use it at all.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I cut my husband&#x27;s hair at home and this is extremely handy for cleaning him and the equipment post-haircut!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work the way I like it to after I shaved my head.</li>
            <li> I use two of these in my shop rotating disinfecting with spray between clients. I use them out of the box for awhile and when the talc and disinfectant builds up I use the same method reccomended for cleaning shave (instructions on badgerandblade.com)  brushes. When cleaning do not get the handle in water, it will expand and crack. When the bristles are still wet shake dry and affix a zip tie at the base of the bristles, tighten it but not enough to crease the hair and pull 2/3 of the way to the top and allow to dry for 48 hours. Also comb regularly to keep the bristles loose. If any hairs refuse to behave pull them out.</li>
            <li> This brush seems did not do the job that I was hoping it would.  I was disappointed and do not use it at all.</li>
            <li> Has a short polished wood handle which feels quite durable and sturdy. Shook the brush to see if it had any loose hairs. Lost 3, that&#x27;s it. Handles great and removes hair with ease. Tested it on myself and others, doesn&#x27;t feel rough on the skin, feels just right. 5 stars because it met or exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I had seen the one fairly bad review on the neck duster and was hesitant to buy it at first. After receiving it it did have two or three loose hairs in it but I shook them off and it is working out fine for me. If I need another one I will not hesitate to buy another one of these. Of course I am just a home barber though.</li>
            <li> Bristles are not soft but it&#x27;s okay to most clients.&lt;br /&gt;The horse hair feels looks exactly like clear plastic strands. I&#x27;m not sure if that is suppose to be horse hair.&lt;br /&gt;For mines, the strands does come off one by one and it gets wilted and bent in all different directions over time. I just trim them off when I see some sticking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it definitely works, but probably not going to last long. I&#x27;m currently looking for a different one as we speak.</li>
            <li> A great addition to our in-home haircut kit. Just like you&#x27;d see at your local barber and very well made</li>
            <li> I had read review after review on horsehair brushes...  Read about the bristles falling out ... on and on...  This as it turns out is a great little brush,  now I don&#x27;t use this in a commercial shop.  I only use it to  cut my kids and their friends hair but it&#x27;s doing a great job and NOT loosing any Horsehair..  I LIKEY,  The # 53 is the bomb....  can I say that?</li>
            <li> My girlfriend cuts my hair. I picked this up because we were using a crappy brush that came in a kit before. It scratches a little but it&#x27;s definitely less scratchy than what Great Clips uses. We&#x27;ve only used it once thus far; no hairs have come out yet.</li>
            <li> I have used this duster and it REALLY does do a Real good job.</li>
            <li> Life Changer!  No more little shavings tickling the cranium area (cranarea).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair stylist and I absolutely love this little guy. It really grabs those little hairs that stick to the skin. Works great. Very smart buy.</li>
            <li> This is a nice neck duster for anyone who is looking for grooming accessories that are more old fashioned looking.  It has a classic style to it.</li>
            <li> These can feel a little rough and some might feel the hairs are a bit long and bend too easily but by either using a quicker, broader sweep or holding the bristles half way up, there by stiffening them up, you get everything you need to effectively brush loose hairs away.</li>
            <li> Works great and a must have. DO NOT SOAK IN ship shape though. Peels the varnish right off. Dip the hair only in barbicide to disinfect them blow dry with the hair contained.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of brushing off hair and is comfortable against the skin</li>
            <li> Love it. Barbershop quality!</li>
            <li> Very nice duster. Well built, long bristles. Not much to say except it does exactly what it&#x27;s designed to do, and does it well.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty brush.  Real wood handle with Horsehair bristles.  Feels good in the hand and on the neck when wiping away freshly cut hair.</li>
            <li> Durable and doesnt feel hard on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the duster that is used to me before has this feeling that a newly grown beard is poking through your skin. I hate that, but with this it feels like a fresh hair of a fairy is stroking your skin with every brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With every ticklish little stroke, you will find comfort and would like to use it over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using this for 2 years now and its still working great, the threads are still intact and overall still looks like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great magical product indeed!</li>
            <li> just like the ones they use in the barber shops</li>
            <li> Just like my barber uses.  Buy some talc to get the full affect.</li>
            <li> Looked all over for this type of brush.  Finally found it on Amazon.  Great deal.  I use it to apply Pinaud Clubman talc after a shower.</li>
            <li> I just received this about three days ago and in examining the NEW brush I find that it is a quality one that I will find useful. The picture they use is a crappy one, the brush looks better than shown and the handle is round but in the picture it looks square. It is just the right size and stiffness of the bristles. There have been complaints about bristles coming out, yes I had this happen, but I beat the brush back and forth across my palm and about six came out but none since then. I would say that this is normal since it is real horsehair and should be expected this will happen. I would recommend this brush and would buy another one when it is needed. Any questions just ask. Total length is 7\\&quot; with 3 5/8\\&quot; bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update..I posted my own photos to show what it really looks like.</li>
            <li> Neck duster is soooo much more comfortable than a shaving brush for removing cut hair. No issues with hair loss, well at least not with the duster.</li>
            <li> I like the horsehair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds talc well, and gets the hair dusted  well after just a couple of shakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush, and as soon as I started shaking the brush - the bristles came out, one at a time. The brush doesn&#x27;t look like it does in the picture description: it&#x27;s brisltes are clear white in colour (like the William Marvy #445 flat brush), and it is ROUND in shape, NOT oval - as depicted in the picture! The only difference between this duster and the others is the short handle.     It does the job nevertheless...</li>
            <li> Very nice material, well made</li>
            <li> Could be a little firmer</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and family.  She had bought a home hair clipper set, and began cutting her husband and sons&#x27; hair at home.  I bought this to compliment their barbering equipment.  It works very well for them, as it is very useful getting loose hair off neck, etc.</li>
            <li> Very good brush i feel like the ends of the hairs feel a little rough but nothing that cant be handled. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I previously had a brush with synthetic bristles, that attracted hair like a magnet.  This brush is more like I remember barbers using. It is soft and works well.  It does not build up static cling like the synthetic bristles.  I consider it  a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a very good duster.  This along with a talc removed trimmed hair from the neck easily and with no itching or irritation to the neck. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very functional--easily gets the hair off.  Nice lacquered wooden handle.  Austrian made and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Use this duster for applying Talc. Works well. It takes a little practice but keeps talc from getting all over everything. Good duster for the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  Nice handle and bristles are tightly attached to handle.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I thought that it was soft for the skin, I need it for my hair cut, but is very rough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay brush, the bristles don&#x27;t really fall off but the hair gets stuck inside the brush. I don&#x27;t regret buying it though.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of going to the corner barber shop when growing up.  Perfect to apply talc, just like the old time barbers.</li>
            <li> I use this product to brush off excess hair when shaving or cutting my hair. At first there were some excess bristles but after a few uses no issues at all. I would highly recommend, the wood handle gives a classy and professional feel to my home barbershop.</li>
            <li> Greaty brush better than expected</li>
            <li> The duster fine for what I need it for. I cut my 8 year old son&#x27;s hair at home and needed something to brush the hair away from his face and neck. Works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably a little rough for the face, but not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen any issues with the bristles as others have pointed out.</li>
            <li> Ah the horsehair falls off, and are very soft its maybe not the best neck duster but better than other ones amazon has thats for sure.</li>
            <li> A beautiful brush for the job.</li>
            <li> If you are going to bother getting a neck duster (something of a luxury for the home hair cutter) you might as well spend the extra money to get this one.  I have no complaints at all with it -- it is a well made product likely to last a long time.  I would recommend AGAINST getting a plastic one with synthetic bristles, even if it includes a powder dispenser, something that sounds helpful, but actually isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> good quality, quick delivery, and just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Nice but needs some use to soften. Was a little prickly right out if the box, but seems good quality, especially for the price. Would recommend👍</li>
            <li> great for whisking of hair or whisking on talc.</li>
            <li> Great neck brush. Well made. No issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to convince my husband that something this soft can actually brush the hair off his neck, but I can see it doing just that. It&#x27;s well-made, the handle feels good in my hand, and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine duster.  It&#x27;s exactly as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are not a soft as some of the synthetics out there, but it&#x27;s horsehair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of a vintage style product, something you would see in your dad&#x27;s or grandparents things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s simple, functional, well made, and it works.  What more can you ask for.</li>
            <li> Been using for a long time. Bristles don&#x27;t fall out. Has a nice feel to it. Love this and would buy again. High quality.</li>
            <li> Nice brush.. Cleans the hair off the neck and chest area quite well ... Seems like it will last for some time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, it&#x27;s not as soft as you would expect horse hair to be because it&#x27;s not horse hair, at least I&#x27;m 95% sure that it isn&#x27;t or it&#x27;s just poorly treated. I&#x27;m no expert though the consistency of the fibers has a greater similarity to plastic way more than hair. The strands are almost translucent where as hair typically should not be, so you might understand why I lean towards this assumption. It should get the job done just fine but that&#x27;s just very disappointing false advertising which is shady business. In my book leaving my 2 stars is charitable in this circumstance...</li>
            <li> I shave my head once a week and this brush keeps the little hairs from sticking to my skin (neck area). Good quality. Buy it.</li>
            <li> The brush reminds me of when I was a boy and had my hair cut at a barber shop.  I have only used it one time but it appears to be well made and exactly what I wanted.  Time will tell how well it holds up, but for now I am pleased with the results.  Very soft bristles and does the job it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t enough to this to make it really work....it is not very dense at all....I am returning it for a refund.</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend who is a mobile hair stylist. She has never had a barber brush like this and I was so surprised! Now she can do men&#x27;s cuts in true style. It feels nice on the neck and gets the job done, unlike a lot of the cheaper ones. It&#x27;s not too big and fits in her bag nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hair stylist wife to use at home, where she does many, many haircuts for friends and family.  She loves it, and told me that this brush is very high quality.  The wood handle and the bristles appear to be very well made and put together.</li>
            <li> Just what I been looking for.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast service, so we are very happy with our purchase!</li>
            <li> The brush is well made and nice to handle.  It reminds me of getting haircuts from my father long ago.  Finally a way to easily whisk away the prickles of hair trimmings.</li>
            <li> This is the best that I can find so far from amazon and I bought two of these together with Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li> Good brush very soft I like the wood handle good grip yes a few loose hairs but I still like it</li>
            <li> Great neck duster....easy to use. Looks great too.</li>
            <li> Easy to use,but I hope to increase the brush size.</li>
            <li> I use it when cutting hair for my 3 year old and 1 year old boys.  This was very useful to get the itchy hair pieces out of their face and kept their patience under control while I finished the haircut. They used to get frustrated with the itchy hair pieces that fell on their face and neck which made them squirm a lot.</li>
            <li> Wonderful duster. Works perfectly and I love the wooden handle. It is a must have for cutting hair at home.</li>
            <li> good quality, came on time, no damages can&#x27;t wait to use it. It was bought in conjunction with a barber cape and some pinaud talc.Good deal.[[ASIN:B000VDAFAQ William Marvy No.53 Marvy Neck Duster]]</li>
            <li> It has soft bristles and I like how it works when brushing cut hair off my neck and upper back.</li>
            <li> I just use this on my child as I cut his hair, but it works as I need it too.  The bristles are good and don&#x27;t fall out.  Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nice.....goes well with the clippers..</li>
            <li> The wood finish is outstanding, and the overall quality is excellent. I expect this to last a couple of decades if not longer!</li>
            <li> Have never used anything else but these neck dusters!!!</li>
            <li> professional quality&lt;br /&gt;went right into the shop&lt;br /&gt;Solidly made so no worries of this product falling apart anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy</li>
            <li> This is an old-school neck duster, made up to old-school standards.  No gimmicks; just a well made brush with soft bristles.  You won&#x27;t regret getting this one.</li>
            <li> Very nice neck duster.  The duster is light and the duster hair is nice and soft. I use it to remove cut hair when I cut my 4 year old grandson&#x27;s hair.  When we are done I use  Pinaud Clubman Talco which has a refreshing scent (reminds me when I was a child and used to get a hair cut).</li>
            <li> Bought this because my son complained about the generic duster that came with the clippers. Great duster, holds powder pretty good,and definitely gets the hair off his neck.</li>
