            <li>Great product use it all the time</li>
            <li>I have had airbrush tanning with great results</li>
            <li>Great for either airbrushing or spray bottle application.</li>
            <li>It smells good and works amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so my plan was to use a solution for that nice tone.</li>

            <li>All my customers love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>no sticky feeling went on very smooth  </li>
            <li>I love it for summer</li>
            <li>my husband sprayed me last night and my tan looks great!</li>
            <li>I Love buying this product for my spray tan machine.</li>
            <li>i tried the color under this and this one is way better.</li>
            <li>however, it does seem to come off pretty easily, but the color is good.</li>
            <li>but it does have a strong odour.</li>
            <li>As expected, great product works</li>
            <li>Product is great, however the top was broken when it came in and some had leaked</li>
            <li>:) :) Not too dark just a nice solid brown color.</li>
            <li>Amazing product super dark color  </li>
            <li>If you are very fair then you might want to get the regular dark formula.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say with certainty that I looked orange, but I am certain the tan didn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li>I have purchased a few bottles of this solution, it was my favorite until Norvell came out with Venetian.</li>
            <li>Live in Nebraska and it is not for winter use.  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>This was my second bottle of Norvelle but my first double dark.  </li>

            <li> This was my second bottle of Norvelle but my first double dark.  </li>
            <li> Double Dark is very dark, on some skin types it could look un nateral, not orange, just super dark.</li>
            <li> The double dark does not go yellow</li>
            <li> It is not very dark at all, and the color really don&#x27;t last past two days.</li>
            <li> but like I said, they came out with Venetian and it has surpassed double dark in my opinion.</li>
            <li> notices that the DOUBLE DARK NORVELL that i just recently bought actually doesnt get me as dark as the DARK NORVELL.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> will go back to the DARK when I purchase again.</li>
            <li> The solution is enough to last at least six months and it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell until a out five hours into the process, which smells like any other tanning solution.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used lotions or gel, which smelled bad and left a slightly orange tinge.  </li>
            <li> Hard to get off your skin.</li>
            <li> My clients are obsessed with color!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Looks great for a couple of days and then starts fading.  Hard to get off your skin.</li>
            <li> Great product use it all the time</li>
            <li> was &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; NOT &amp;#34;double dark&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My clients are obsessed with color!</li>
            <li> This product arrived expired. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Like those of you who want to avoid the sun, but still want a glowing summer tan I researched tanning solutions. In the past I&#x27;ve used lotions or gel, which smelled bad and left a slightly orange tinge.  I have had airbrush tanning with great results so my plan was to use a solution for that nice tone. The solution is enough to last at least six months and it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell until a out five hours into the process, which smells like any other tanning solution. I used it twice and did not care for the color. I can&#x27;t say with certainty that I looked orange, but I am certain the tan didn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few bottles of this solution, it was my favorite until Norvell came out with Venetian. Double Dark is very dark, on some skin types it could look un nateral, not orange, just super dark.If you are very fair then you might want to get the regular dark formula. I love it for summer but like I said, they came out with Venetian and it has surpassed double dark in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Live in Nebraska and it is not for winter use.  I mix it up with the regular solution! These products are one of the&lt;br /&gt;best.</li>
            <li> This was my second bottle of Norvelle but my first double dark.  It is not very dark at all, and the color really don&#x27;t last past two days. I&#x27;m disappointed</li>
            <li> Product is great, however the top was broken when it came in and some had leaked</li>
            <li> All my customers love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> my husband sprayed me last night and my tan looks great! however, it does seem to come off pretty easily, but the color is good.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time last night. It was runny and left streaks. The instructions say to spray it 6 inches away from your skin, but I&#x27;d do 12 inches next time. The color is nice.</li>
            <li> I Love buying this product for my spray tan machine. It smells good and works amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I notices that the DOUBLE DARK NORVELL that i just recently bought actually doesnt get me as dark as the DARK NORVELL.&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to the DARK when I purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best!! i tried the color under this and this one is way better. :) :) Not too dark just a nice solid brown color.</li>
            <li> Amazing product super dark color  no sticky feeling went on very smooth  will deff buy again</li>
            <li> As expected, great product works well I have several shades. Great for either airbrushing or spray bottle application. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Norvell truly are best. The double dark does not go yellow but it does have a strong odour.</li>
