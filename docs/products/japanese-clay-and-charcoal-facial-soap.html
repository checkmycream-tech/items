    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am very impressed with this soap.</li>
            <li>I intend to purchase it again, and I may have found my perfect cleanser.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s best quality is</li>
            <li>but this vendor provided excellent shipping and service.</li>
            <li>If you want the best looking skin, this is what you need to use.</li>
            <li>But, the best result is, I no longer have the oily sheen to blot through-out</li>
            <li>A very good quality product...</li>
            <li>AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>I prefer a good bar of soap over liquid cleansers to wash my face with.</li>
            <li>I think it does a good job of cleaning the skin, but it probably won&#x27;t get rid of my acne.  </li>
            <li>I guess that is a good price for an imported charcoal soap.    </li>
            <li>Work good skin feels exfoliated and you can notice difference in a week</li>
            <li>and we are both very pleased with the soap, will put it on our perminant</li>
            <li>, I use the OCM and this has been a nice compliment.</li>
            <li>I like this one better.</li>
            <li>sure to keep the soap away from soggy conditions...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok ?</li>
            <li>If you have acne it will surface a lot more acne before it rids it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have endured the stuff coming out and feel my skin (and what&#x27;s been underneath) is better for it.</li>
            <li>: I didn&#x27;t edit my orignal with its many errors.</li>
            <li>but, I seems to be okay.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely, love this product.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a LONG time, so the value is excellent.</li>
            <li>It does the trick for a clean face!</li>
            <li>The combination has provided my skin: a more of an even tone [reducing redness], and smooth breathable skin.</li>
            <li>My face has never felt so clean (&amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean with no residue!)  </li>
            <li>After I use it my face feels smooth and exfoliated, even though there is no grit whatsoever in the soap or lather.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say my acne has improved, except this soap seems to slightly smooth and soothe my face.  </li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t fit on soup cases</li>
            <li>Gentle but effective.</li>
            <li>not vert comfortable to wash ur face......</li>
            <li>[they tend to work the best], with very little soap for a rich lather.  </li>
            <li>It creates a rich lather, rinses clean, and removes makeup, even mascara.</li>
            <li>This soap lathers well, smells like it should (clean &amp; charcoalie(new made up word)) and cleans like Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My face rinses off &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean.</li>
            <li>It really helps and does not cause more pimples.</li>
            <li>, good price for product should be double!</li>
            <li>I love the soft lather and of course the purifying charcoal and clay properties.  </li>
            <li>my boyfriend loves using it too (he has sensitive skin) and happy that it has cleared up his back and face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other cleansers sometimes, and was reminded real quick why I LOVE this bar.</li>
            <li>This tiny bar of soap is pretty mighty clean!  </li>
            <li>The scent is mild and natural and goes away pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>Skin gets a tad tight when its dry but perfect time for moisturizing!</li>
            <li>but i just opened the top edge, kept it in the package and rub the open edge all over my face for cleansing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>a small amount will work up a good lather for your face.</li>
            <li>impurities were drawn to the surface for quick removal (i&#x27;ll say it, &amp;#34;ew&amp;#34;) and skin was left smooth and soft with pores tightened.</li>
            <li>I have large pores that trap a lot of dirt and this soap takes care of that issue.</li>
            <li>Yes, I like this product, it cleans my face very well</li>
            <li>so I need to find another product the will really lessen the oil.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference after using it for months</li>
            <li>This stuff works, but be ready.  </li>
            <li>I noticed immediately that it cleans really well.</li>
            <li>This is unlike any soap I&#x27;ve tried before, a subtle, pleasant difference.  </li>
            <li>I like how my face feels smooth for a while after using this, without getting too dry.  </li>
            <li>My face is now getting more even toned and less &amp;#34;tired looking&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The overall cost savings and results are worth the investment for me.  </li>
            <li>my hasband love this soap and and it last for a very long time</li>
            <li>Nothing has helped and I&#x27;ve used so many products I could&#x27;ve opened a small store by now.</li>
            <li>I posted this review 1 month after using it daily and came back only to make sure this vendor was still selling it.</li>
            <li>I have mild breakouts of acne, and I alternate using this soap and my regular face wash, just to mix up my regimen.  </li>
            <li>pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and the way it cleans without stripping my skin of natural oils.</li>
            <li>I am 49 years old, but my face still has a tendency to break out.</li>
            <li>I thought &amp;#34;what an indulgence to spend this much for 1 bar of soap, but it hasn&#x27;t wasted away with an over foam of lather and the cleansing and softness and results have been SO worth it.</li>
            <li>Cleans without the usual dry and starched feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Light and very clean, got one for myself and one for my daughter</li>
            <li>When you use it your dead skin sheds off as early as first use.  </li>
            <li>I cut the bar in half and gave half to my younger brother, and he said he likes it, enough to use it everyday, which is good, because I paid 11 bucks for the soap.  </li>

            <li> Def going to be using this for a lon long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry me out either.</li>
            <li> It has also improved my dry legs, which eliminates the need to use lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I should use it everyday, but I seem to be clearest when I alternate products.      </li>

            <li> Oily in the T-Zone and dry in other areas, acne persistent into my late fifties, blackheads, whiteheads.</li>
            <li> but you can always cut in half and keep one by your sink at home.</li>
            <li> The soap was very irritating to my skin, it made my skin itch &amp; break out, it made my skin very dry, I have combination skin,and thought to give this soap a Try, I will not purchase again!</li>
            <li> I once tried a charcoal soap made in the states before, and it was slightly irritating, probably the fragrance or perhaps it was the type of charcoal.  </li>
            <li> I started to see the stuff embedded deep in my skin come to the surface and knew if I could get past the &#x27;worst&#x27; time I would be thankful I&#x27;d continued cleaning with this soap.</li>

After I use it my face feels smooth and exfoliated, even though there is no grit whatsoever in the soap or lather. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry or tight. I intend to purchase it again, and I may have found my perfect cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is unlike any soap I&#x27;ve tried before, a subtle, pleasant difference.  The scent is mild and natural and goes away pretty quickly.  I like how my face feels smooth for a while after using this, without getting too dry.  I have mild breakouts of acne, and I alternate using this soap and my regular face wash, just to mix up my regimen.  I can&#x27;t say my acne has improved, except this soap seems to slightly smooth and soothe my face.  I would say it&#x27;s best quality is it makes my skin feel smoother for a while.      I think it does a good job of cleaning the skin, but it probably won&#x27;t get rid of my acne.  Maybe I should use it everyday, but I seem to be clearest when I alternate products.      I cut the bar in half and gave half to my younger brother, and he said he likes it, enough to use it everyday, which is good, because I paid 11 bucks for the soap.  I guess that is a good price for an imported charcoal soap.    I once tried a charcoal soap made in the states before, and it was slightly irritating, probably the fragrance or perhaps it was the type of charcoal.  I paid around 6 bucks for that.  I like this one better.</li>
            <li> I got this soap a little bit skeptical about it, but after a few months of use I can say I&#x27;m happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;It does improve your skin but it won&#x27;t solve your eczema problems, it does alleviate them a lit bit though or won&#x27;t make it flare up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar is a little too long if you are planning in travel with it so it won&#x27;t fit on soup cases but you can always cut in half and keep one by your sink at home.</li>
            <li> Yes, I like this product, it cleans my face very well but my face is still oily so I need to find another product the will really lessen the oil.</li>
            <li> This tiny bar of soap is pretty mighty clean!  I love the soft lather and of course the purifying charcoal and clay properties.  I&#x27;ve used charcoal products in the past that def cleaned my pores but would leave me red or too dry.  This one lathers and rinses well without a film at all...my boyfriend loves using it too (he has sensitive skin) and happy that it has cleared up his back and face.  Def going to be using this for a lon long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to keep the soap away from soggy conditions...it tends to last longer on a draining soap tray that&#x27;s not in the line of the shower flow.  Lasted the two of us about a solid month!</li>
            <li> pleasantly surprised. this product works as described. it is a rectangular shape but i just opened the top edge, kept it in the package and rub the open edge all over my face for cleansing. impurities were drawn to the surface for quick removal (i&#x27;ll say it, &amp;#34;ew&amp;#34;) and skin was left smooth and soft with pores tightened. will be purchasing again. FWIW, I use the OCM and this has been a nice compliment.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap.  It&#x27;s chalky, even, and nourishing.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the way it cleans without stripping my skin of natural oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok ? I really haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference after using it for months , I will continue using but wouldn&#x27;t invest in it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, but be ready.  When you use it your dead skin sheds off as early as first use.  If you have acne it will surface a lot more acne before it rids it.  I use 100% organic coconut oil to moisturize the skin.  It really helps and does not cause more pimples.</li>
            <li> I love it. Gentle but effective.</li>
            <li> A very good quality product... a small amount will work up a good lather for your face. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> It does the trick for a clean face! I just wish it came in a liquid version. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with my skin. Oily in the T-Zone and dry in other areas, acne persistent into my late fifties, blackheads, whiteheads. My skin runs the gamut. Nothing has helped and I&#x27;ve used so many products I could&#x27;ve opened a small store by now. This soap lathers well, smells like it should (clean &amp; charcoalie(new made up word)) and cleans like Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried. I thought it&#x27;d be too drying. No, it left my face cleaner than anything, ANYTHING else and rinsed off just as well. I started to see the stuff embedded deep in my skin come to the surface and knew if I could get past the &#x27;worst&#x27; time I would be thankful I&#x27;d continued cleaning with this soap. I have endured the stuff coming out and feel my skin (and what&#x27;s been underneath) is better for it. I thought &amp;#34;what an indulgence to spend this much for 1 bar of soap, but it hasn&#x27;t wasted away with an over foam of lather and the cleansing and softness and results have been SO worth it. I posted this review 1 month after using it daily and came back only to make sure this vendor was still selling it. I&#x27;d buy it from another if she didn&#x27;t but this vendor provided excellent shipping and service. I&#x27;m going to check out her other products, maybe see if she has a charcoal toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated review: I didn&#x27;t edit my orignal with its many errors. I&#x27;m still using this bar daily, and it&#x27;s Sept. 2016. I&#x27;ve used other cleansers sometimes, and was reminded real quick why I LOVE this bar. It cleans and leaves my skin smoother than EVERYthing else. After all my former purchases of this &amp; that cleansers, etc I now feel I&#x27;ve saved money by buying this one bar.</li>
            <li> Cleans without the usual dry and starched feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Light and very clean, got one for myself and one for my daughter and we are both very pleased with the soap, will put it on our perminant must have list.</li>
            <li> The soap was very irritating to my skin, it made my skin itch &amp; break out, it made my skin very dry, I have combination skin,and thought to give this soap a Try, I will not purchase again! for my skin there was no benefits!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days but, I seems to be okay.  Will write another review once the bar is finished.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  My face has never felt so clean (&amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean with no residue!)  Skin gets a tad tight when its dry but perfect time for moisturizing! My face is now getting more even toned and less &amp;#34;tired looking&amp;#34;.  I am acne prone and have not had one issue. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> not vert comfortable to wash ur face......</li>
            <li> Been using this soap for my face for over a month now. I noticed immediately that it cleans really well. I have large pores that trap a lot of dirt and this soap takes care of that issue. It doesn&#x27;t dry me out either.</li>
            <li> Work good skin feels exfoliated and you can notice difference in a week, good price for product should be double!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 35 years!  If you want the best looking skin, this is what you need to use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely, love this product.  I am 44; suffering from acne and oily skin for years.  I have been using this product every morning, for two weeks.  I use microfiber wash clothes for my face [they tend to work the best], with very little soap for a rich lather.  My face rinses off &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean. In addition to the soap, I discovered a website listing how to use essential oils to control oily skin.  The combination has provided my skin: a more of an even tone [reducing redness], and smooth breathable skin. But, the best result is, I no longer have the oily sheen to blot through-out the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have eliminated my body soap and only use this product now. It has also improved my dry legs, which eliminates the need to use lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall cost savings and results are worth the investment for me.  I only wish, I discovered this soap sooner.</li>
            <li> I am 49 years old, but my face still has a tendency to break out. This soap was the trick.  It kills the oil, but does not over-dry my skin. The bar is long and thin, and rather hard to use - but I cut it in half, and it is much easier to hold.  It lasts a LONG time, so the value is excellent.</li>
            <li> my hasband love this soap and and it last for a very long time</li>
