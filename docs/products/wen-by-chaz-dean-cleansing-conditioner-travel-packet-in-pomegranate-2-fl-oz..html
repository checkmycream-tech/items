    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;Following directions is VERY important!!!</li>
            <li>Rinsing is also VERY IMPORTANT!!!</li>
            <li>You will walk away with cleaner hair that might be softer then before but not at all the perfect, beautiful hair they show on tv.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with product and seller!</li>
            <li>Leaves hair in great shape.</li>
            <li>These packets are great to get.</li>
            <li>Works great and my hair looks thicker.  </li>
            <li>This size is great for travel.</li>
            <li>And as for time wise in the shower-</li>
            <li>It smelled nice and did a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>I love how defined my curls are after using the Wen cleansing conditioner!</li>
            <li>I just received the Summer Mango Coconut (which smells amazing), so I am going to try that</li>
            <li>&#x27;s what I liked</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I am not the kind of person who skimps on hair</li>
            <li>; I didn&#x27;t pay attention, but it didn&#x27;t add any warm and fuzzies to the product.</li>
            <li>Plus, I wasn&#x27;t pleased when I discovered that, although I got a great discount price on the samples, the shipping fee was huge.</li>
            <li>This was a good way to try this product without making a huge dollar commitment, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>In the beginning hair was good, and straight after washing hair always felt good, but started getting more and more greasy after washes as usage continued.  </li>
            <li>though, it&#x27;s not a terrible product.</li>
            <li>Thickens up your hair makes it look healthy but thinner.</li>
            <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Wen for about 2 weeks now, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I figure as my hair gets in better condition (which it is already)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>, I think it is a better value than buying everything separate.</li>
            <li>I love how shiny and manageable my hair is after using this product.</li>
            <li>This product is just ok.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a quick cleaning and conditioning aid out there that kind of helps save time (although it says to leave it in awhile</li>
            <li>I liked it, but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>easily fits in a 3-1-1 bag for traveling by air.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did not purchase the full size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a college grad student with fine, color processed hair.</li>
            <li>I thought it smelled fine</li>
            <li>Since the trial packets are cheap and I don&#x27;t have to commit to a huge bottle of it</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this from a friend who works in a salon.</li>
            <li>It kind of felt like I was just rubbing conditioner all over my hair, which made me really worried that it would make my hair</li>
            <li>, I rinsed it all out and blow dried it, and my hair felt great!</li>
            <li>I use Kerastase, Enjoy, Biomega.</li>
            <li>and hopefully use the seasonal scents primarily.</li>
            <li>Smell wise, the Pomegranate is my favorite, and the Lavender is my 2nd.</li>
            <li>I would recommend still using a shampoo to clean your hair in between Wen washes if you have fine hair like I do.</li>
            <li>So far my favorite combo is using Lavender on most of my hair, and the pomegranate just on the ends (since I have the multi packs I can do this).</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>So far I love</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>If you have fine straight hair, and live in a humid climate, you might want to skip this.</li>
            <li>May need to use more for later hair balm.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works noticeably better on different hair than mine.</li>
            <li>I was glad I didn&#x27;t buy the big bottle because the sample did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>I use Wen shampoo on a regular basis and was so excited to find these travel sizes!</li>
            <li>Rinse really well first, and rinse really well after.</li>
            <li>My hair was somewhat softer but enough to make me buy a huge bottle of it?</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t save much time but</li>
            <li>really greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t use any styling products, just oil like Biosilk sometimes.</li>
            <li>both make my hair feel like it has too much product.</li>
            <li>I just rinsed really well and used a drop as a leave in, and my hair was still really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who complain about the price</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this because the Pomegranate didn&#x27;t work as well as the other kinds of Wen Cleansing Coniditioners.</li>
            <li>got out and let my hair dry naturally and waited for the magic to happen....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I bought several of the travel sized items to test out before shelling out for the normal (giant) size.</li>
            <li>It is better than purchasing the whole bottle when you&#x27;re not sure of the product.</li>
            <li>After watching the infomercial about this product I wanted to try it but was not ready to commit to the full price, so by the travel size instead.</li>
            <li>It made my hair really soft so far</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s the only thing I really spend $$</li>
            <li>My hair has gotten so soft and manageable, and even thicker looking.</li>
            <li>It looks like I got a professional blowout whenever I do my hair.</li>
            <li>I like that it did clean my hair even though it was a little dirty.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>Perhaps those with long hair might find a positive result using WEN.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical after reading all the mixed reviews, but so far so good!!!</li>
            <li>But- not that much different in texture or smoothness than my normal hair routine.</li>
            <li>I got very fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I would buy the full size or sample size again, dye to the price.</li>
            <li>But if the prices came down I might keep a bottle around for the super dry winter months.</li>

            <li> But if the prices came down I might keep a bottle around for the super dry winter months.</li>
            <li> This product definitely did not work for me--it just left my long, wavy hair greasy and looking unwashed.</li>
            <li> In the infomercials all the women have long hair, none have short hair.</li>
            <li> every other day as I have thin, fine, short hair.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and shiny and did not weight it down.</li>
            <li> I have medium-fine, shoulder length hair cut into long layers.</li>
            <li> My hair has been feeling rather dull &amp; damaged since my last straightening, and I was looking for something new to try.</li>
            <li> No better and no worse than other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Order arrived earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> hair felt soft and manageable but since this is so expensive (and you are supposed to use so much of it)</li>
            <li> Definately not worth the price; use when traveling for conveniency only.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling limp and somewhat waxy/greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I expected it to control the frizz and my curls</li>
            <li> This made my hair just lie on my head like a wet rug.</li>
            <li> Each packet has enough for two uses, less if you have longer hair!</li>
            <li> and I did not notice any difference in my hair, other than I felt like I needed to shampoo it again.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat thick, wavy- loose curly, color-treated hair that is just above my chest, and I have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> i just wet it down and restyle.  </li>
            <li> I broke down and bought a sample packet (2oz) to try since I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune if it wasn&#x27;t what it claimed.</li>
            <li> The instructions read that I was supposed to start with my scalp and work it down to my ends, so I did.</li>
            <li> I was worried that a cleansing conditioner would weigh my hair down, so I just bought this sample to try.</li>
            <li> But like my other reviews... WEN!</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s less steps verses shampooing and conditioning).</li>
            <li> I used half the packet.</li>
            <li> I always let my conditioner sit in my hair while I shave/wash, so it actually less time since I&#x27;m not also shampooing.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s crazy people will buy coffee out several times a week @ at least $2 a cup, but buying quality hair product is too much for them.</li>
            <li> The Fig is way too heavy, and the SAM is a little too heavy-</li>
            <li> : I used it two washes in a row and it was too heavy for consecutive washes.</li>
            <li> On a few instances I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;wash\\&quot; my hair-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming</li>
            <li> Fig is ok, SAM I think is awful.</li>
            <li> I also think that people who don&#x27;t like Wen either are using the wrong one, or aren&#x27;t following the directions.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff or hard.</li>
            <li> I was a little cautious upon trying this, because it doesn&#x27;t lather, which I had never experienced before in a shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive and you have to spend lots of minutes in the shower per instructions, so just not worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you are used to buying Suave or cheaper store brands, it might be a little startling, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Is it worth the insane price?</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the cleanser.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After watching the infomercial about this product I wanted to try it but was not ready to commit to the full price, so by the travel size instead. I am glad I did not purchase the full size. I was not impressed with the cleanser. I have short hair and I did not notice any difference in my hair, other than I felt like I needed to shampoo it again. Perhaps those with long hair might find a positive result using WEN. In the infomercials all the women have long hair, none have short hair. That says something???</li>
            <li> I have been seeing the infomercials on tv about this stuff and have been dying to try it. I broke down and bought a sample packet (2oz) to try since I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune if it wasn&#x27;t what it claimed. It made my hair really soft so far but that&#x27;s about it. My hair doesn&#x27;t look any different to me. Oh well. I guess I will keep looking...</li>
            <li> Order arrived earlier than expected! Very satisfied with product and seller!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college grad student with fine, color processed hair. I don&#x27;t have tons of money to spend on shampoo but have always wanted to try Wen since seeing it on the infomercials. Since the trial packets are cheap and I don&#x27;t have to commit to a huge bottle of it, I jumped at the chance to buy a trial packet. I thought it smelled fine and I split up the packet into 2 washes.&lt;br /&gt;I got out and let my hair dry naturally and waited for the magic to happen....but it didn&#x27;t. My hair was somewhat softer but enough to make me buy a huge bottle of it? No. Ohh the disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I liked: I like that there&#x27;s a quick cleaning and conditioning aid out there that kind of helps save time (although it says to leave it in awhile so it doesn&#x27;t save much time but still...there&#x27;s less steps verses shampooing and conditioning). I like the smell of it. It&#x27;s not overwhelming but it&#x27;s a nice scent. I like that it did clean my hair even though it was a little dirty.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I didn&#x27;t like about it: I used it two washes in a row and it was too heavy for consecutive washes. It left my hair feeling limp and somewhat waxy/greasy feeling. I would recommend still using a shampoo to clean your hair in between Wen washes if you have fine hair like I do. I also didn&#x27;t like that it was NOTHING like the infomercial made it look. You will not walk away with frizz-free, softer, shinier, healthier hair. You will walk away with cleaner hair that might be softer then before but not at all the perfect, beautiful hair they show on tv.&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, it&#x27;s not a terrible product. Is it worth the insane price? No. But if the prices came down I might keep a bottle around for the super dry winter months.</li>
            <li> product arrived just in time for my travels.  easily fits in a 3-1-1 bag for traveling by air.  This is a must have!!</li>
            <li> Thickens up your hair makes it look healthy but thinner.</li>
            <li> Travel size non-sudsing shampoo provided in sizes bug enough for 2-3 treatments.  Leaves hair in great shape. May need to use more for later hair balm.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this from a friend who works in a salon. I was a little cautious upon trying this, because it doesn&#x27;t lather, which I had never experienced before in a shampoo. The instructions read that I was supposed to start with my scalp and work it down to my ends, so I did. It kind of felt like I was just rubbing conditioner all over my hair, which made me really worried that it would make my hair really greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I rinsed it all out and blow dried it, and my hair felt great! But- not that much different in texture or smoothness than my normal hair routine. I&#x27;m not sure I would buy the full size or sample size again, dye to the price. But it&#x27;s definitely worth a try. Maybe it works noticeably better on different hair than mine.</li>

I used half the packet. It smelled nice and did a good job of cleaning. It made my hair soft and shiny and did not weight it down. But, it wasn&#x27;t a miracle worker. I liked it, but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price. If it was cheaper, then yes - I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I did not like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought the multi pack of these to try out the different Wen products before committing to a big bottle. I was a little skeptical after reading all the mixed reviews, but so far so good!!! I have somewhat thick, wavy- loose curly, color-treated hair that is just above my chest, and I have a lot of hair. I also get the Brazillian Straightening done once a year. My hair has been feeling rather dull &amp; damaged since my last straightening, and I was looking for something new to try. I am not the kind of person who skimps on hair products- I use salon quality shampoo, conditioner, &amp; leave in conditioner, plus bi-weekly deep conditioning treatments- I really don&#x27;t use any styling products, just oil like Biosilk sometimes. I probably spend $15-$30 a bottle depending on the brand (I switch up). I use Kerastase, Enjoy, Biomega. For me my hair is my thing so that&#x27;s the only thing I really spend $$ on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Wen for about 2 weeks now, and I love it. I have used Pomegranate, Lavender, Fig, and SAM. Smell wise, the Pomegranate is my favorite, and the Lavender is my 2nd. Fig is ok, SAM I think is awful. So far my favorite combo is using Lavender on most of my hair, and the pomegranate just on the ends (since I have the multi packs I can do this). I figure as my hair gets in better condition (which it is already) I will not have to use the Pomegranate. I also use the Lavender as a leave in. The Fig is way too heavy, and the SAM is a little too heavy- both make my hair feel like it has too much product. I just received the Summer Mango Coconut (which smells amazing), so I am going to try that and hopefully use the seasonal scents primarily. I am also ordering the Tea Tree to use maybe as a clarifying, and to just mix things up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following directions is VERY important!!! It took a couple days to figure out the amount I need, but now that I got it I love it (I don&#x27;t wash twice)! Rinsing is also VERY IMPORTANT!!! Rinse really well first, and rinse really well after. My hair has gotten so soft and manageable, and even thicker looking. It looks like I got a professional blowout whenever I do my hair. On a few instances I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;wash\\&quot; my hair- I just rinsed really well and used a drop as a leave in, and my hair was still really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who complain about the price, I think it is a better value than buying everything separate. Maybe if you are used to buying Suave or cheaper store brands, it might be a little startling, but you get what you pay for. I think it&#x27;s crazy people will buy coffee out several times a week @ at least $2 a cup, but buying quality hair product is too much for them. I also think that people who don&#x27;t like Wen either are using the wrong one, or aren&#x27;t following the directions. And as for time wise in the shower- I don&#x27;t see a difference. I always let my conditioner sit in my hair while I shave/wash, so it actually less time since I&#x27;m not also shampooing. So far I love Wen- we see in a moth or so what happens.</li>
            <li> These packets are great to get. I purchased this to try out the cleansing conditioner. It is better than purchasing the whole bottle when you&#x27;re not sure of the product. I am glad I purchased this because the Pomegranate didn&#x27;t work as well as the other kinds of Wen Cleansing Coniditioners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I bought several of the travel sized items to test out before shelling out for the normal (giant) size. This product definitely did not work for me--it just left my long, wavy hair greasy and looking unwashed.</li>
            <li> But like my other reviews... WEN! Buy it to try it, but beware of the smell. I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I use Wen shampoo on a regular basis and was so excited to find these travel sizes! Each packet has enough for two uses, less if you have longer hair! I don&#x27;t worry about the product getting all over my clothes or suitcase. If you like Wen but don&#x27;t want to bring your big bottle, try these packets.</li>
            <li> hair felt soft and manageable but since this is so expensive (and you are supposed to use so much of it) I&#x27;m still looking for a cheaper option</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I love how defined my curls are after using the Wen cleansing conditioner! It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling stiff or hard. I love how shiny and manageable my hair is after using this product.</li>
            <li> No better and no worse than other shampoos.  I got very fine, thin hair.  In the beginning hair was good, and straight after washing hair always felt good, but started getting more and more greasy after washes as usage continued.  This product is expensive and you have to spend lots of minutes in the shower per instructions, so just not worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> I was glad I didn&#x27;t buy the big bottle because the sample did nothing for my hair. I expected it to control the frizz and my curls but it didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This product is just ok.  Definately not worth the price; use when traveling for conveniency only. Doubt will order again.</li>
            <li> This was a good way to try this product without making a huge dollar commitment, and I&#x27;m glad I did. This made my hair just lie on my head like a wet rug. Plus, I wasn&#x27;t pleased when I discovered that, although I got a great discount price on the samples, the shipping fee was huge. My problem totally; I didn&#x27;t pay attention, but it didn&#x27;t add any warm and fuzzies to the product. I gave them away to my cousin to sell in her yard sale. If you have fine straight hair, and live in a humid climate, you might want to skip this.</li>
            <li> I had tried this once before and I didn&#x27;t like it but I thought I would give it another try.  I love it.  I use about 5 pumps (equal to) every other day as I have thin, fine, short hair.  The days in-between i just wet it down and restyle.  Works great and my hair looks thicker.  This size is great for travel.</li>
