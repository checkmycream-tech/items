            <li>THE BEST TO YOU AT SWEET SENSATION!</li>
            <li>If you are PATIENT and give Lumi*Essence a go, you will finally be a VERY happy person in your OWN skin. :)</li>
            <li>ALso, just the feel of having something organic going on to my skin- makes me feel good.</li>
            <li>I found Sweetsation here on amazon.com while looking for something that would be good for my face without all the chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Good night time moisturizer for the winter.</li>
            <li>It is great smelling and effective.</li>
            <li>I can even skip putting on foundation and know I still look good running my errands.</li>
            <li>It got really good reviews so</li>
            <li>I purchased this product on a whim; I had run out of my staple body lotion and felt it would be a good idea to try something else.</li>
            <li>I also loved the smell and the consistency of the products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and smells delightful (not chemical smelling at all).  </li>
            <li>The customer service is the best too -- definitely one of the best products/vendors I&#x27;ve ever bought from on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Has been, without exception, exceptional.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the tone and texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I began using this product a couple months ago and am very pleased with its results.</li>
            <li>I was first and foremost honored by the extremely beautiful and personable founder of the company, both a mom and a beauty expert, who provided me with great customer service and answered my questions and delivered my order through Amazon promptly.  </li>
            <li>this smells AWESOME- and does get absorbed well- leaves a nice glow-</li>
            <li>This skin brightening cream has a very light and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I really love this cream!</li>
            <li>I love this cream!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>love my skin now!</li>
            <li>Most days I use the SunSiBelle tinted sunscreen in lieu of makeup, as it evens out my skin (covers those sun spots!)</li>
            <li>But it would help if it smelled a bit more pleasant.</li>
            <li>and it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>and I have been suffering for 10 years, nothing helped though I tried out all kind of products (I have hormonal acne).</li>
            <li>Sample received for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>and i am really loving it-</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be really nice if they can come up with no scent?</li>
            <li>I am hesitant to tell some of the things she&#x27;s done because I don&#x27;t want people to take advantage of it, but she is the epitome of honest, accommodating customer service.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it contains organic ingredients and is actually good for my skin.  </li>
            <li>It does give a nice glow and there were days where I went without makeup.  </li>
            <li>And it smells nice too.</li>
            <li>Plus - it smells really nice.  </li>
            <li>The cream smells nice</li>
            <li>Nice samples come with..</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer and the light brown spots are even lighter from the combination of your amazing products!  </li>
            <li>They DO promote recycling, support many charitable organizations and have amazing customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has a light pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy and it has a pleasant light fragrance.</li>
            <li>Pleasant light fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I really love this line more than those!</li>
            <li>The Q&#x27;Luminere cucumber day cream smells delicious and is hydrating, soothing, and completely non oily.    </li>
            <li>I found this product on the Environmental Working Group website when I was looking for a skin lightener that was effective, yet safe to use.</li>
            <li>To this date I have not found anything that cures this dryness as effectively and safely as Sweetsation.  </li>
            <li>And I love the fact that there are skin care products that FEEL SO GOOD, SMELL SO GOOD, HELP MY SKIN, and are TOTALLY SAFE for me, and while I am pregnant - in case that happens again. :-)</li>
            <li>Product smells great, feels clean, goes on easily.</li>
            <li>I also use Their Organic Advanced Brightening and Line Smoothing Eye treatment and it is wonderful in eliminating under eye puffiness while brightening the eye area in a gentle treatment.  </li>
            <li>It has a great punch to the start as it tingles the first time I used it and settled thereafter.  </li>
            <li>Lumi*Essence fulfills the most important aspect of having great skin, an even, blemish free, skin tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could tell she intelligently designed each product with first and foremost the clients&#x27; safety concerns for their baby, while not compromising effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Feels very light when I apply it, but it keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend you follow the instructions for the most effective treatment.</li>
            <li>And what is more?</li>
            <li>so I often exposed to more sun than I should.  </li>
            <li>This product is my favorite of the Sweetsation line.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to do all that it does; gives a glow and healthy look within 10 minutes and the look stays with you.</li>
            <li>and they were cute then,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamier and a lot more moisturizing than I thought it&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li>I have been using Lumi*Essence for several months and am extremely impressed!  </li>
            <li>The scent is engaging and the product does what it promises to do!  </li>
            <li>My face takes on a healthy glow and my skin feels refreshed every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>I love all the products of Sweetsation.</li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite product from Sweetsation, and also one of my favorite skin creams ever.</li>
            <li>After many hours I came up with a winner . . .</li>
            <li>My hyperpigmentation spots, which used to be oh so visible, are lighter, and my face has more even tone.</li>
            <li>so i sure they all contribute -</li>
            <li>love   </li>
            <li>I love that it works so well with my skin...</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>You cannot find a better product at this price.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many of the Sweetsation products and I love them all.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many of their products and I love them all.   </li>
            <li>I recently got a sample of the tinted sunscreen and it&#x27;s wonderful!!!  </li>

            <li>I love them All</li>
            <li>I have tried it for about a month and will continue using it just because my face feels great thanks to it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this lotion to others and since this is also an organic which I like the most .</li>
            <li>It evened out my skin, prevented further sun damage, and smells great (kind of a rose smell).  </li>
            <li>I love this Lumi Essence.</li>
            <li>u will love it..</li>
            <li>so it would have more time to sink</li>
            <li>Bought more than 7 bottles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Lumi-Essence for about a year and my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I need to wait more than 2 months.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE RESULTS.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>A free sample struck again!</li>
            <li>which never makes a cream look appealing-</li>
            <li>, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t go away, for sure.</li>
            <li>have been using this nightly since, and my skin has continued to look better and better.</li>

            <li>Love  lotion</li>
            <li>This body lotion is one of many items we have ordered from Sweetsation</li>

            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so so pleased.</li>
            <li>Not one day magic</li>
            <li>It has a nice light fragrance which is great for me, because I am very sensitive to many fragrances out there.</li>
            <li>Fantastic moisturizer, very good absorption, smell very natural, like flowers and plants.</li>
            <li>for the first time in a while it felt good to look in the mirror.....</li>
            <li>I am not a girly girl, but I do enjoy knowing that I am using a healthy, safe product.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;to make our skin brighter and more smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic and contains so many natural, skin-loving ingredients, but what I love most is that this does the job!</li>
            <li>The whole line had great ratings - exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>One of the other things that impressed me with this product is the packaging.</li>
            <li>I Love the results of bright, clear and even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily, goes&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know that this product will easily maintain them.</li>
            <li>It has no greasy feel &amp; it absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>This product really is amazing, and I am so glad the owner developed it.</li>
            <li>It is also filled with great products such as Kojic Acid and Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>I use this lotion to my whole body all I can say it brightens my skin and feels soft and feels brilliant all the time.</li>
            <li>but they are light.  </li>
            <li>i have two light brown spots, melasma, on either side of my nose.</li>
            <li>Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment &amp; I*Light Organic Advanced Brightening &amp; Line Smoothing Eye Treatment.  </li>
            <li>So light and yet so moisturizing...</li>
            <li>You absolutely have to try Lumi*Essence; it will help every skin type, and every skin type will be thrilled.</li>
            <li>Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t rave enough about how great they are.  </li>
            <li>Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment with Kojic Acid, Arbutin &amp; Vitamin C, 2oz.]]</li>
            <li>Lumi*Essence advanced brightening repair treatment is a bit lighter of a lotion.    </li>
            <li>I have tried many such products, and this one is by far the best.   </li>
            <li>This is important because repeated exposure to sunlight or oxygen can turn kojic acid brown and make it ineffective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light moisturizer, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment with Kojic Acid, Arbutin &amp; Vitamin C, 2oz.]]</li>
            <li>The overall tone of my skin has improved greatly since using this product and I will be ordering again.  </li>
            <li>No greasiness to the products, and they really are healthy and safe with no chemicals and so forth in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even remember when I received it, but I was happy to find it and thought I would try it as I love their other products.</li>
            <li>A huge PLUS is also their fantastic customer service, always willing and able to answer any and all questions.  </li>
            <li>thought it would be good to start with the most natural and organic products first.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is rich but wont make your skin greasy</li>
            <li>I expected it to be more effective since it got raves reviews, but for me it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I will be buying another as soon as I depleted my first order. :)</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this product in my hand..</li>
            <li>but from the first pump, the scent was so overwhelming</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>Originally I purchased this for brown spots and eventhough I see no improvements in that area</li>
            <li>This product was worth it!  </li>
            <li>I use it only on my chest and shoulders where sun did its work over the years and difference is remarkable.</li>
            <li>There is a nice light natural scent to it.</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on smoothly on my skin, it smells good and my skin is actually softer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather be able to AFFORD such amazing skin care products than have the packaging so high-end that the price makes them unattainable for my budget.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin smooth and soft, I love the feeling!</li>
            <li>I have ordered many of their other products and have loved them all.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s right, it is!</li>
            <li>However, i dislike the scent, i expected it to smell like pineapples and papaya like in the picture lol, but then again it&#x27;s an organic product.</li>
            <li>First I scrub my body with hammam glove, which I love by the way and then use this lotion on freshly exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li>This product had this natural scent that is nice and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s true form)</li>
            <li>...the company treats you sweet as pie.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered a full size and hope it arrives before my sample runs</li>
            <li>but, this is a must have for anyone who has this need for their super important Skin...largest organ on/in the body and everything gets absorbed...</li>
            <li>I have been more conscious about synthetic creams being applied to my skin, since our skin easily absorbs what is applied on it.  </li>
            <li>I can definitely see more even tone on my face and the chest scars have become very light.</li>
            <li>I only have good things to say about this product,i have used the face and body lotion, for  over two month ,this is my second purchase of this product,,All I can say is it has made my facial skin flawless..</li>
            <li>Compared to other powerful products, it is very affordable, and I know that I&#x27;m putting happy, healthy ingredients on my face.</li>
            <li>I started using this product because I want to lighten some of the many sunspots I have, mainly the ones on my face.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy at all, which is a super bonus for me.</li>
            <li>Since my skin reacts to sun quite quickly, I need help to counter-attack all the damage</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a powerful brightener but is also gentle on the skin and safe to use during pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>After looking at the website and seeing that the products were designed so that even pregnant women could use them without causing harm to their babies, I decided to give it a try.   </li>
            <li>I only took 1 star away because the packaging could be more sleek and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed Lumi Essence Organic Repair treatment and highly recommend this product for its effectiveness in brightening.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light</li>
            <li>everytime I order a new product, I receive samples of others that I fall in love with.</li>
            <li>I love Sweetsation and their natural products!</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of different organic products and yet this line is truly fantastic!!</li>
            <li>I have tried many products from various companies in the past, but, this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Even though my initial observation was the softness of my skin, I can confidently say now my skin tone is gradually evening out!</li>
            <li>My face looks younger and skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>and I rarely need concealer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few weeks of using the a skin care products and my skin loving it, I ordered more Sweetsation products including the Lip Balm, Choco Butter, sunscreen, Eye Treatment, cellulitis treatment . . .</li>
            <li>but worth IMHO.</li>
            <li>and I love the brightness and natural glow</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and is quickly absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>But the costomer service Victoria was nice enough to replace it no hassle.</li>
            <li>but this was golden.</li>
            <li>I even had an opportunity to speak with the Company Representative who was very knowledgeable about skincare and offered her expertise on the other great products they sell.  </li>
            <li>This skin lightener smells like roses right when you put it on.</li>
            <li>it has all the right ingredients....</li>
            <li>It just feels right going on and truth be told ...</li>
            <li>I continued to put some on my finger, and right away it softened up</li>
            <li>I have pretty nice skin for my age, but I recently got some sun spots on my cheeks from a road trip...</li>
            <li>But the good news is that my normal color is coming back</li>
            <li>not good for your face if you have oily skin but great for any other part of your body, it smells great</li>
            <li>The sweetsation sunscreens are the best in this regard--they are concentrated and you don&#x27;t need much, rub in well especially if you use a moisturizer underneath, and any white-ness goes away after a few minutes or with light dabbing with a towel.  </li>
            <li>The people at Sweetsation are very smart indeed...</li>
            <li>This was a good product saw slight lighting, it clogs pores though leave pimples sometime on my face</li>
            <li>In that time I have moved to New Mexico which as you probably know is VERY SUNNY EVERY DAY!!!</li>
            <li>I love shopping on Amazon and was just so lucky to stumble upon this item a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly if you don not have dry skin, this is all you need to put on at night because if you put your regular moisturizer on top your skin will get oily.</li>
            <li>and I can say it is a lovely facial cream!</li>
            <li>i read many glowing reviews and decided to purchase the entire line -- face wash, toner, day and night cream, eye cream, brightening cream.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately, i&#x27;m not one of them.</li>
            <li>I am actually going to use this product as a permament moisterizer because even for that it works better than anything I have ever used.     </li>
            <li>I thought this would be more of a serum, but it&#x27;s actually a lotion.</li>
            <li>I use 25 SPF routinely in the morning; when I garden or play tennis, I put on higher SPF.</li>
            <li>More updates later. !</li>
            <li>After the first couple of days of using this product my skin began to look brighter immediately after application.  </li>
            <li>The product comes in a white oplague plastic pump bottle, which keeps sunlight or oxygen from touching the cream until it is dispensed.</li>
            <li>and this was the first product I got for it,</li>
            <li>It felt soft and looked health and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, we absolutely love it and feel it definitely is working</li>
            <li>extra goodies I called them to make sure they didn&#x27;t make a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Wait</li>
            <li>this company is really going places!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products and skin treatments, including Obagi and laser, to no avail.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been two more weeks since my last review, and I must say that this product has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for exactly one month now</li>
            <li>LumiEssence is a light cream that does not irritate my sensitive aging skin.  </li>
            <li>This is how I first tried</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have noticed the sun doing this to me...</li>
            <li>Well, I think their packaging is pretty, though not as upscale as the quality of the products warrants.</li>
            <li>Well, I finally ordered more LumiEssence and it arrived yesterday.</li>
            <li>I am on my second one already and hope to see more improvement.</li>
            <li>Arrived really fast!</li>
            <li>Just knowing the purity of the lotion should be enough, but it does everything it should do and more.  </li>
            <li>and I make sure to use sun screen every time I am outside now...</li>
            <li>I am not one to waste money, so the results had to be good.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and have some mild hyper-pigmentation on my face related to long term birth control use.  </li>
            <li>It is very creamy when first applied but then melts right into the skin</li>
            <li>But one day I didn&#x27;t bother to put the tinted sibelle or powder on, and I was pleased to notice that my skin looked better naked than it has in a LONG time!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get it originally because I am very fair and typically have such bad luck with tinted products, but this one is perfect!!!</li>
            <li>After using this product for more than a year (along with other products in the Sweetsation Therapy line), I am happy to report an overall evening and lightening of my entire face.  </li>
            <li>It was a natural and slow process for developing an even skin tone; in which I accept as it does not include some of the most harmful chemicals as some of you may be more familiar with.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite essence, I use it very evening, it made my skin look younger and brighter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i read some positive reviews about this</li>
            <li>and I used the whole bottle consistently twice a day.</li>
            <li>Will continue to purchase from this company as long as it is available!</li>
            <li>Thereby it does not provide overnight, quick and &#x27;immediate&#x27; or complete skin tone change, nor does it induces long-term skin damage.  </li>
            <li>Now if I get a pimple, it&#x27;s gone a day later and fades VERY quickly (2-3 days).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, like many other creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite product thus far, but it&#x27;s very hard to decide because I love them all!  </li>
            <li>They are pretty much the only rich, healing moisturizers that don&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
            <li>but no so much anymore.</li>
            <li>This was a product that really showed how much it worked.  </li>
            <li>I used this for some acne scars and skin discoloration on my arms and this product works fast</li>
            <li>This treatment really works and does what it say it will do.</li>
            <li>Thanks toLumi*Essence, the skin on my face is brighter.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The shippment was fast, product arrived sealed and very well packed</li>
            <li>and you dont need much.    </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too much to put all over your body.</li>
            <li>Within two weeks my skin started looking much brighter all the time without looking shiny.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more alarming for me is the wait because I kept telling myself this rash will subside and the product will work, and that I will have even skin and luminous</li>
            <li>but really I was fooling myself.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of LUMI ESSENCE ORGANIC ADVANCED BRIGHTENING REPAIR TREATMENT WITH KOJIC ACID, ARBUTIN AND VITAMIN C.</li>
            <li>I finished the whole bottle of this product and won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>thanks sweetsation therapy</li>
            <li>The acne and the scars are all gone thanks to Lumi Essence.</li>
            <li>This review is 100% real.</li>
            <li>It does not work that fast</li>
            <li>SO VERY</li>
            <li>I really think it helped lighten the pigmentation on my legs caused by KP.</li>
            <li>If you are in this for the long haul and not just seeking a magic bullet \\&quot;quick fix\\&quot;, I&#x27;d go with the entire line of Sweetsations Therapy skin care.  </li>
            <li>It got to the point where I began looking for a skin lightener, and I was lucky enough to try this first.</li>
            <li>Plus it lasts for a long time with the easy dispensing bottle it comes in.</li>
            <li>but when I used rich moisturizers, my skin will look fabulous for a few days...</li>
            <li>I now use it every other day and very sparingly (because well it isn&#x27;t cheap!)</li>
            <li>did, because she emailed back right away and was extremely helpful and honest.</li>
            <li>I never leave the house without applying Sun Si Belle Moisturizing Sunscreen and unlike many other sunscreens I have tried, this one does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Lumi Essence Advance Brightening Repair Treatment and must say that this product is great if you are looking for an all natural product to lighten those stubborn dark spots on face and (entire body).  </li>
            <li>I have tried many more expensive products that didn&#x27;t make any changes in my complexion, but this really did brighten my skin.  </li>
            <li>I DO NOT recommend this product, so be aware, if you are taking a chance on this product; request a refund before 30 days, do not waste time thinking it&#x27;ll work because it will not.</li>
            <li>THE SMELL OF THIS PRODUCT IS SO PRETTY AND SOFT</li>
            <li>I have tried so many \\&quot;skin brightening\\&quot; products (mainly used to lighten dark spots on my body and face</li>
            <li>If you are in the market for a new skincare regime, please give her products a try TODAY!  </li>
            <li>They were also extremely moisturizing and did not break me out, and absorbed into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>The skin was dry and lined, and no moisturizer (until now) could make it look remotely smooth.</li>
            <li>One of the main reasons is because of the customer service.</li>
            <li>I went to their website and instantly falling in love with their entire presentation</li>
            <li>:  if you are looking for natural, organic, chemical free products, definitely give it a try.  </li>
            <li>my super 60 skin gets it totally...</li>
            <li>I have always had hands that looked like they belonged to someone much older.</li>
            <li>If you have any questions, no matter how small they seem, or how large they seem, email the owner, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about her and the sweetsation line.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, absorbs quickly and stays on my skin all night long.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for purity and scent (</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for brightening.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a product to give brighter skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li>Also, because of the way the container works, there is no waste, every drop is used, unlike so many other products.  </li>
            <li>At least for me, this stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>As far as the lotion itself, it aborbs really well without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Remember no product provides INSTANT success.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much gone the all-natural route with my skincare routine and was looking for an organic lightening product that actually worked.  </li>
            <li>and makes it look fresh and younger, while also providing sun protection.</li>
            <li>Although I am not a vegan or even a vegetarian, I normally prefer to use all vegan products for beauty products (some Sweetsation products like Lumi*Essence contain caviar).</li>
            <li>One thing that I find that sets this apart from other brightening treatments is the softness that it gives your screen .I was amazed at how hydrated and soft my skin felt and knowing that this product uses natural ingreidents is a safe comfort  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dark circles, so I can&#x27;t say much about that, but its a Double Thumbs Up for me :).</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>And although I really like that LumiEssence makes my skin soft and radiant, it did not help clear up the sun spots.</li>
            <li>(I use a natural powder product by Coastal Classic Creations for an under eye concealer and powder with the Tinted SunSiBelle).  </li>
            <li>In the months that I&#x27;ve been using this treatment, I&#x27;ve noticed the diminishing of small freckles, coupled with a more even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I started using this for my acne scars and marks and after two months the marks faded almost completely!</li>
            <li>and I usually use Aqua Tica, which I also love.</li>
            <li>Sweetsation&#x27;s products are also biodegradable, natural, organic, and use minimal packaging, and they offer discounts and specials with their special recycling program as well.</li>
            <li>it costs less than buying and trying a lot of cheap products that don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>After 1 week of use my skin is already glowing, its soft, smooth and it lightened the dark patches on my legs in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>There was more of a defined transition visible on my skin from the dark areas to the lighter, and that is actually reduced.</li>
            <li>I know that Kojic Acid is good for lightening dark spots and it is much better than hydroquinone creme which is dangerous for skin.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B002ERSS6U Sun*Si&#x27;Belle Organic Triple Action Moisturizing Sunscreen SPF 30+, tinted with brightening action, 3.5oz]][[ASIN:B001U1YTDC Sun*Si&#x27;Belle+ SPF 50 Organic Triple Action Moisturizer, with Antioxidants, CoQ10 and Hyaluronic Acid.]][[ASIN:B004MJIL92 Very*Berry Organic Oxygen Masque &amp; Scrub with Antioxidants, Vitamin C &amp; Superberries - NEW]]</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer but didn&#x27;t moisturize any better than a less expensive product.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s only been a few weeks, I&#x27;m positive my skin can only get better from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lightening effect does not seem to be strong enough, I&#x27;ve seen other all natural products work faster at lightening my sunspots and acne marks.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients used are natural.</li>
            <li>I was drawn to this product because of its all natural organic ingredients and the price.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product close to six months ago as I wanted something natural to even my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The lumi essence has almost completely evened out that area.</li>
            <li>So, these are 100% mineral, non-nano sunscreens, completely natural, with no preservatives.  </li>
            <li>I read that kojic acid and alpha-arbutin are natural skin fading agents, so I wanted to give this product a try.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>I have used 2 tubs so far</li>
            <li>I am in my late sixties and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product early this year after reading all of glowing reviews.</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a latin 30 year old woman with sun spots in both cheeks and forhead.</li>
            <li>I always look for products with natural ingredients that are not harmful to my skin or health.</li>
            <li>oily skin, I was, prior to Lumi*Essence, very prone to hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin from pimples caused by an increase in melanin production).</li>
            <li>, if you have made it this far in my lengthy review, I also want to mention something about their packaging.</li>
            <li>and I like knowing that all the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s too early to tell.</li>
            <li>It has no harsh chemicals like 99% of skin care products on the market these days.</li>
            <li>I ordered LumiEssence because of the reviews, and the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I wore a sunscreen every time I went outside, and I also minimize my time outside right now while I am trying to get this hyperpigmentation under control.  </li>
            <li>Then, a NEW pimple appeared in a NEW area, almost daily.</li>
            <li>and I noticed the lovely yet subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li>I must have spent hundreds of hours both pregnancies scouring Sephora and a few other websites, including ones specializing in pregnancy skin care, for safe products I can use while pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Reducing Discoloration:  As I said earlier, I was diligent about applying this cream 2x/day, and I made sure to put a little extra in the areas where I have hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li>I can say that Sweetsation not only offers very natural and organic benefits, but the biggest selling point to me was that it has NO Hydroquinone.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why that is so important to me</li>
            <li>At first when I recieve this product I was a bit upset because the pump did not work or maybe the container was empty.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long it will take to see a major change, but for now I&#x27;m really liking this cream.</li>
            <li>Before using Lumi Essence, I had developed some adult acne that left me with some scars.</li>
            <li>Finally finding a product line that works, slowly but surely, to fade my truly severe skin condition is a godsend.</li>
            <li>A little bit of this product goes a long way, making the expense cheaper than most over the counter, generic products.</li>
            <li>Its the only product that works for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am someone with very sensitive, reactive skin (and possibly rosacea) but also acne.  </li>
            <li>He even changed his morning routine (major for this rather&lt;br /&gt;rigid, efficient guy)</li>
            <li>I have no regrets whatsoever!</li>
            <li>I was using two other pregnancy lines for my first pregnancy when I discovered Sweetsation Therapy.  </li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin and upon first applying this cream my skin got a bit red and irritated, however, it&#x27;s probably due to the AHA&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Seriously way better products you can find locally and your grocery store than wasting your money on these.</li>
            <li>I used them for a little while, then my dermatologist put me on a prescription regimen for rosacea that actually seemed to irritate my skin more, so I recently went back to the Sweetsation products... and my skin is starting to look luminous again.    </li>
            <li>And my skin in general looks \\&quot;brighter\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This product is the complete opposite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted a moisturizer with pearl powder, but couldn&#x27;t find anything natural enough to satisfy me.</li>
            <li>It has lighten up old acne marks and even helped in preventing future breakouts(with the use of sunblock).  </li>
            <li>Now after barely 2 months of use my skin is unrecognizable.</li>
            <li>it is natural i will recommend this product to any one because i have noticed a massive improvement</li>
            <li>but since im not really prone to pimples it goes away fast</li>
            <li>Barely started to use this for a week</li>
            <li>I looked in the mirror a few hours after I applied it to see if the fresh look went away, and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I wish I had ordered this earlier when I was frantically searching for a product without harsh ingredients that would give me a soft, healthy, buttery glow without stripping my black skin.</li>
            <li>if you go to their website:  [...], you can order a little sample kit of many of their popular products.   </li>
            <li>and then I break out with a whole other type of acne...</li>
            <li>I wanted to like it so much that I convinced myself to try it again and that the rash was due to something else.</li>
            <li>i had pigmentation problems due to too much sun exposure..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to actually use a product that doesn&#x27;t sting or make my skin feel weirdly tingly when I apply it.  </li>
            <li>A bit of sun exposure that used to be a nice sun glow, now just makes my skin look old and damaged, I am unhappy to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>i just recently purchased the very berry scrub based on other reviews,i will see how that goes,but for now I will keep purchasing and using the lumi essence face cream.</li>
            <li>Also, wear sunscreen and give it at least 2 weeks to 1 month for some results and another 2 months for full results.</li>
            <li>My first order I ordered a few products before I discovered the Intropack, and she allowed me to cancel my order and change it.   </li>
            <li>very well (non-greasy) with a slight tingle, so you know it&#x27;s working.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive, fairly dry skin</li>
            <li>I little bit, maybe pea size can do almost your whole face.</li>
            <li>Not only that, the fact that these products are organic and not full of bad chemcials really makes you feel like you&#x27;re doing something good for your skin and body.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> , all smell delightful, not too perfume-y.  </li>
            <li> The Vitamin C in the product also keeps me skin perfectly even.  </li>
            <li> i do not doubt that these are wonderful products that work well for a lot of people...</li>
            <li> Keep up the great work you do... thank you!!</li>

            <li> THE BEST TO YOU AT SWEET SENSATION!</li>
            <li> If you are PATIENT and give Lumi*Essence a go, you will finally be a VERY happy person in your OWN skin. :)</li>
            <li> ALso, just the feel of having something organic going on to my skin- makes me feel good.</li>
            <li> I found Sweetsation here on amazon.com while looking for something that would be good for my face without all the chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Good night time moisturizer for the winter.</li>
            <li> It is great smelling and effective.</li>
            <li> I can even skip putting on foundation and know I still look good running my errands.</li>
            <li> It got really good reviews so</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on a whim; I had run out of my staple body lotion and felt it would be a good idea to try something else.</li>
            <li> I also loved the smell and the consistency of the products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and smells delightful (not chemical smelling at all).  </li>
            <li> The customer service is the best too -- definitely one of the best products/vendors I&#x27;ve ever bought from on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Has been, without exception, exceptional.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the tone and texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I began using this product a couple months ago and am very pleased with its results.</li>
            <li> I was first and foremost honored by the extremely beautiful and personable founder of the company, both a mom and a beauty expert, who provided me with great customer service and answered my questions and delivered my order through Amazon promptly.  </li>
            <li> this smells AWESOME- and does get absorbed well- leaves a nice glow-</li>
            <li> This skin brightening cream has a very light and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I really love this cream!</li>
            <li> I love this cream!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> love my skin now!</li>
            <li> Most days I use the SunSiBelle tinted sunscreen in lieu of makeup, as it evens out my skin (covers those sun spots!)</li>
            <li> But it would help if it smelled a bit more pleasant.</li>
            <li> and it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> and I have been suffering for 10 years, nothing helped though I tried out all kind of products (I have hormonal acne).</li>
            <li> Sample received for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> and i am really loving it-</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be really nice if they can come up with no scent?</li>
            <li> I am hesitant to tell some of the things she&#x27;s done because I don&#x27;t want people to take advantage of it, but she is the epitome of honest, accommodating customer service.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it contains organic ingredients and is actually good for my skin.  </li>
            <li> It does give a nice glow and there were days where I went without makeup.  </li>
            <li> And it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Plus - it smells really nice.  </li>
            <li> The cream smells nice</li>
            <li> Nice samples come with..</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and the light brown spots are even lighter from the combination of your amazing products!  </li>
            <li> They DO promote recycling, support many charitable organizations and have amazing customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has a light pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy and it has a pleasant light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Pleasant light fragrance.</li>
            <li> and I really love this line more than those!</li>
            <li> The Q&#x27;Luminere cucumber day cream smells delicious and is hydrating, soothing, and completely non oily.    </li>
            <li> I found this product on the Environmental Working Group website when I was looking for a skin lightener that was effective, yet safe to use.</li>
            <li> To this date I have not found anything that cures this dryness as effectively and safely as Sweetsation.  </li>
            <li> And I love the fact that there are skin care products that FEEL SO GOOD, SMELL SO GOOD, HELP MY SKIN, and are TOTALLY SAFE for me, and while I am pregnant - in case that happens again. :-)</li>
            <li> Product smells great, feels clean, goes on easily.</li>
            <li> I also use Their Organic Advanced Brightening and Line Smoothing Eye treatment and it is wonderful in eliminating under eye puffiness while brightening the eye area in a gentle treatment.  </li>
            <li> It has a great punch to the start as it tingles the first time I used it and settled thereafter.  </li>
            <li> Lumi*Essence fulfills the most important aspect of having great skin, an even, blemish free, skin tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could tell she intelligently designed each product with first and foremost the clients&#x27; safety concerns for their baby, while not compromising effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Feels very light when I apply it, but it keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> strongly recommend you follow the instructions for the most effective treatment.</li>
            <li> And what is more?</li>
            <li> so I often exposed to more sun than I should.  </li>
            <li> This product is my favorite of the Sweetsation line.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to do all that it does; gives a glow and healthy look within 10 minutes and the look stays with you.</li>
            <li> and they were cute then,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamier and a lot more moisturizing than I thought it&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> I have been using Lumi*Essence for several months and am extremely impressed!  </li>
            <li> The scent is engaging and the product does what it promises to do!  </li>
            <li> My face takes on a healthy glow and my skin feels refreshed every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> I love all the products of Sweetsation.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite product from Sweetsation, and also one of my favorite skin creams ever.</li>
            <li> After many hours I came up with a winner . . .</li>
            <li> My hyperpigmentation spots, which used to be oh so visible, are lighter, and my face has more even tone.</li>
            <li> so i sure they all contribute -</li>
            <li> love   </li>
            <li> I love that it works so well with my skin...</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> You cannot find a better product at this price.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many of the Sweetsation products and I love them all.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many of their products and I love them all.   </li>
            <li> I recently got a sample of the tinted sunscreen and it&#x27;s wonderful!!!  </li>

            <li> It is a okay moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love them All</li>
            <li> I have tried it for about a month and will continue using it just because my face feels great thanks to it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this lotion to others and since this is also an organic which I like the most .</li>
            <li> It evened out my skin, prevented further sun damage, and smells great (kind of a rose smell).  </li>
            <li> I love this Lumi Essence.</li>
            <li> u will love it..</li>
            <li> so it would have more time to sink</li>
            <li> Bought more than 7 bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lumi-Essence for about a year and my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I need to wait more than 2 months.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE RESULTS.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> A free sample struck again!</li>
            <li> which never makes a cream look appealing-</li>
            <li> , I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t go away, for sure.</li>
            <li> have been using this nightly since, and my skin has continued to look better and better.</li>
            <li> Gotta love that!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also felt safe and did not stress that I was feeding my baby toxins through my skin.  </li>
            <li> I also love the Aqua*tica Night Cream as well.  </li>
            <li> Love  lotion</li>
            <li> This body lotion is one of many items we have ordered from Sweetsation</li>
            <li> and we LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so so pleased.</li>
            <li> Not one day magic</li>
            <li> It has a nice light fragrance which is great for me, because I am very sensitive to many fragrances out there.</li>
            <li> Fantastic moisturizer, very good absorption, smell very natural, like flowers and plants.</li>
            <li> for the first time in a while it felt good to look in the mirror.....</li>
            <li> I am not a girly girl, but I do enjoy knowing that I am using a healthy, safe product.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;to make our skin brighter and more smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s organic and contains so many natural, skin-loving ingredients, but what I love most is that this does the job!</li>
            <li> The whole line had great ratings - exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> One of the other things that impressed me with this product is the packaging.</li>
            <li> I Love the results of bright, clear and even skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily, goes&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know that this product will easily maintain them.</li>
            <li> It has no greasy feel &amp; it absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> This product really is amazing, and I am so glad the owner developed it.</li>
            <li> It is also filled with great products such as Kojic Acid and Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> I use this lotion to my whole body all I can say it brightens my skin and feels soft and feels brilliant all the time.</li>
            <li> but they are light.  </li>
            <li> i have two light brown spots, melasma, on either side of my nose.</li>
            <li> Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment &amp; I*Light Organic Advanced Brightening &amp; Line Smoothing Eye Treatment.  </li>
            <li> So light and yet so moisturizing...</li>
            <li> You absolutely have to try Lumi*Essence; it will help every skin type, and every skin type will be thrilled.</li>
            <li> Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rave enough about how great they are.  </li>
            <li> Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment with Kojic Acid, Arbutin &amp; Vitamin C, 2oz.]]</li>
            <li> Lumi*Essence advanced brightening repair treatment is a bit lighter of a lotion.    </li>
            <li> I have tried many such products, and this one is by far the best.   </li>
            <li> This is important because repeated exposure to sunlight or oxygen can turn kojic acid brown and make it ineffective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light moisturizer, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment with Kojic Acid, Arbutin &amp; Vitamin C, 2oz.]]</li>
            <li> The overall tone of my skin has improved greatly since using this product and I will be ordering again.  </li>
            <li> No greasiness to the products, and they really are healthy and safe with no chemicals and so forth in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even remember when I received it, but I was happy to find it and thought I would try it as I love their other products.</li>
            <li> A huge PLUS is also their fantastic customer service, always willing and able to answer any and all questions.  </li>
            <li> thought it would be good to start with the most natural and organic products first.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is rich but wont make your skin greasy</li>
            <li> I expected it to be more effective since it got raves reviews, but for me it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I will be buying another as soon as I depleted my first order. :)</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product in my hand..</li>
            <li> but from the first pump, the scent was so overwhelming</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Originally I purchased this for brown spots and eventhough I see no improvements in that area</li>
            <li> This product was worth it!  </li>
            <li> I use it only on my chest and shoulders where sun did its work over the years and difference is remarkable.</li>
            <li> There is a nice light natural scent to it.</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on smoothly on my skin, it smells good and my skin is actually softer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather be able to AFFORD such amazing skin care products than have the packaging so high-end that the price makes them unattainable for my budget.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin smooth and soft, I love the feeling!</li>
            <li> I have ordered many of their other products and have loved them all.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s right, it is!</li>
            <li> However, i dislike the scent, i expected it to smell like pineapples and papaya like in the picture lol, but then again it&#x27;s an organic product.</li>
            <li> First I scrub my body with hammam glove, which I love by the way and then use this lotion on freshly exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li> This product had this natural scent that is nice and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s true form)</li>
            <li> ...the company treats you sweet as pie.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered a full size and hope it arrives before my sample runs</li>
            <li> but, this is a must have for anyone who has this need for their super important Skin...largest organ on/in the body and everything gets absorbed...</li>
            <li> I have been more conscious about synthetic creams being applied to my skin, since our skin easily absorbs what is applied on it.  </li>
            <li> I can definitely see more even tone on my face and the chest scars have become very light.</li>
            <li> I only have good things to say about this product,i have used the face and body lotion, for  over two month ,this is my second purchase of this product,,All I can say is it has made my facial skin flawless..</li>
            <li> Compared to other powerful products, it is very affordable, and I know that I&#x27;m putting happy, healthy ingredients on my face.</li>
            <li> I started using this product because I want to lighten some of the many sunspots I have, mainly the ones on my face.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy at all, which is a super bonus for me.</li>
            <li> Since my skin reacts to sun quite quickly, I need help to counter-attack all the damage</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a powerful brightener but is also gentle on the skin and safe to use during pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> After looking at the website and seeing that the products were designed so that even pregnant women could use them without causing harm to their babies, I decided to give it a try.   </li>
            <li> I only took 1 star away because the packaging could be more sleek and sophisticated.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed Lumi Essence Organic Repair treatment and highly recommend this product for its effectiveness in brightening.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty light</li>
            <li> everytime I order a new product, I receive samples of others that I fall in love with.</li>
            <li> I love Sweetsation and their natural products!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different organic products and yet this line is truly fantastic!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products from various companies in the past, but, this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Even though my initial observation was the softness of my skin, I can confidently say now my skin tone is gradually evening out!</li>
            <li> My face looks younger and skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> and I rarely need concealer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few weeks of using the a skin care products and my skin loving it, I ordered more Sweetsation products including the Lip Balm, Choco Butter, sunscreen, Eye Treatment, cellulitis treatment . . .</li>
            <li> but worth IMHO.</li>
            <li> and I love the brightness and natural glow</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and is quickly absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> But the costomer service Victoria was nice enough to replace it no hassle.</li>
            <li> but this was golden.</li>
            <li> I even had an opportunity to speak with the Company Representative who was very knowledgeable about skincare and offered her expertise on the other great products they sell.  </li>
            <li> This skin lightener smells like roses right when you put it on.</li>
            <li> it has all the right ingredients....</li>
            <li> It just feels right going on and truth be told ...</li>
            <li> I continued to put some on my finger, and right away it softened up</li>
            <li> I have pretty nice skin for my age, but I recently got some sun spots on my cheeks from a road trip...</li>
            <li> But the good news is that my normal color is coming back</li>
            <li> not good for your face if you have oily skin but great for any other part of your body, it smells great</li>
            <li> The sweetsation sunscreens are the best in this regard--they are concentrated and you don&#x27;t need much, rub in well especially if you use a moisturizer underneath, and any white-ness goes away after a few minutes or with light dabbing with a towel.  </li>
            <li> The people at Sweetsation are very smart indeed...</li>
            <li> This was a good product saw slight lighting, it clogs pores though leave pimples sometime on my face</li>
            <li> In that time I have moved to New Mexico which as you probably know is VERY SUNNY EVERY DAY!!!</li>
            <li> I love shopping on Amazon and was just so lucky to stumble upon this item a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly if you don not have dry skin, this is all you need to put on at night because if you put your regular moisturizer on top your skin will get oily.</li>
            <li> and I can say it is a lovely facial cream!</li>
            <li> i read many glowing reviews and decided to purchase the entire line -- face wash, toner, day and night cream, eye cream, brightening cream.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, i&#x27;m not one of them.</li>
            <li> I am actually going to use this product as a permament moisterizer because even for that it works better than anything I have ever used.     </li>
            <li> I thought this would be more of a serum, but it&#x27;s actually a lotion.</li>
            <li> I use 25 SPF routinely in the morning; when I garden or play tennis, I put on higher SPF.</li>
            <li> More updates later. !</li>
            <li> After the first couple of days of using this product my skin began to look brighter immediately after application.  </li>
            <li> The product comes in a white oplague plastic pump bottle, which keeps sunlight or oxygen from touching the cream until it is dispensed.</li>
            <li> and this was the first product I got for it,</li>
            <li> It felt soft and looked health and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, we absolutely love it and feel it definitely is working</li>
            <li> extra goodies I called them to make sure they didn&#x27;t make a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Wait</li>
            <li> this company is really going places!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products and skin treatments, including Obagi and laser, to no avail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been two more weeks since my last review, and I must say that this product has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for exactly one month now</li>
            <li> LumiEssence is a light cream that does not irritate my sensitive aging skin.  </li>
            <li> This is how I first tried</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have noticed the sun doing this to me...</li>
            <li> Well, I think their packaging is pretty, though not as upscale as the quality of the products warrants.</li>
            <li> Well, I finally ordered more LumiEssence and it arrived yesterday.</li>
            <li> I am on my second one already and hope to see more improvement.</li>
            <li> Arrived really fast!</li>
            <li> Just knowing the purity of the lotion should be enough, but it does everything it should do and more.  </li>
            <li> and I make sure to use sun screen every time I am outside now...</li>
            <li> I am not one to waste money, so the results had to be good.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin and have some mild hyper-pigmentation on my face related to long term birth control use.  </li>
            <li> It is very creamy when first applied but then melts right into the skin</li>
            <li> But one day I didn&#x27;t bother to put the tinted sibelle or powder on, and I was pleased to notice that my skin looked better naked than it has in a LONG time!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get it originally because I am very fair and typically have such bad luck with tinted products, but this one is perfect!!!</li>
            <li> After using this product for more than a year (along with other products in the Sweetsation Therapy line), I am happy to report an overall evening and lightening of my entire face.  </li>
            <li> It was a natural and slow process for developing an even skin tone; in which I accept as it does not include some of the most harmful chemicals as some of you may be more familiar with.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite essence, I use it very evening, it made my skin look younger and brighter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i read some positive reviews about this</li>
            <li> and I used the whole bottle consistently twice a day.</li>
            <li> Will continue to purchase from this company as long as it is available!</li>
            <li> Thereby it does not provide overnight, quick and &#x27;immediate&#x27; or complete skin tone change, nor does it induces long-term skin damage.  </li>
            <li> Now if I get a pimple, it&#x27;s gone a day later and fades VERY quickly (2-3 days).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, like many other creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite product thus far, but it&#x27;s very hard to decide because I love them all!  </li>
            <li> They are pretty much the only rich, healing moisturizers that don&#x27;t make me break out.  </li>
            <li> but no so much anymore.</li>
            <li> This was a product that really showed how much it worked.  </li>
            <li> I used this for some acne scars and skin discoloration on my arms and this product works fast</li>
            <li> This treatment really works and does what it say it will do.</li>
            <li> Thanks toLumi*Essence, the skin on my face is brighter.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The shippment was fast, product arrived sealed and very well packed</li>
            <li> and you dont need much.    </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too much to put all over your body.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks my skin started looking much brighter all the time without looking shiny.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more alarming for me is the wait because I kept telling myself this rash will subside and the product will work, and that I will have even skin and luminous</li>
            <li> but really I was fooling myself.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of LUMI ESSENCE ORGANIC ADVANCED BRIGHTENING REPAIR TREATMENT WITH KOJIC ACID, ARBUTIN AND VITAMIN C.</li>
            <li> I finished the whole bottle of this product and won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> thanks sweetsation therapy</li>
            <li> The acne and the scars are all gone thanks to Lumi Essence.</li>
            <li> This review is 100% real.</li>
            <li> It does not work that fast</li>
            <li> SO VERY</li>
            <li> I really think it helped lighten the pigmentation on my legs caused by KP.</li>
            <li> If you are in this for the long haul and not just seeking a magic bullet \\&quot;quick fix\\&quot;, I&#x27;d go with the entire line of Sweetsations Therapy skin care.  </li>
            <li> It got to the point where I began looking for a skin lightener, and I was lucky enough to try this first.</li>
            <li> Plus it lasts for a long time with the easy dispensing bottle it comes in.</li>
            <li> but when I used rich moisturizers, my skin will look fabulous for a few days...</li>
            <li> I now use it every other day and very sparingly (because well it isn&#x27;t cheap!)</li>
            <li> did, because she emailed back right away and was extremely helpful and honest.</li>
            <li> I never leave the house without applying Sun Si Belle Moisturizing Sunscreen and unlike many other sunscreens I have tried, this one does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Lumi Essence Advance Brightening Repair Treatment and must say that this product is great if you are looking for an all natural product to lighten those stubborn dark spots on face and (entire body).  </li>
            <li> I have tried many more expensive products that didn&#x27;t make any changes in my complexion, but this really did brighten my skin.  </li>
            <li> I DO NOT recommend this product, so be aware, if you are taking a chance on this product; request a refund before 30 days, do not waste time thinking it&#x27;ll work because it will not.</li>
            <li> THE SMELL OF THIS PRODUCT IS SO PRETTY AND SOFT</li>
            <li> I have tried so many \\&quot;skin brightening\\&quot; products (mainly used to lighten dark spots on my body and face</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a new skincare regime, please give her products a try TODAY!  </li>
            <li> They were also extremely moisturizing and did not break me out, and absorbed into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> The skin was dry and lined, and no moisturizer (until now) could make it look remotely smooth.</li>
            <li> One of the main reasons is because of the customer service.</li>
            <li> I went to their website and instantly falling in love with their entire presentation</li>
            <li> :  if you are looking for natural, organic, chemical free products, definitely give it a try.  </li>
            <li> my super 60 skin gets it totally...</li>
            <li> I have always had hands that looked like they belonged to someone much older.</li>
            <li> If you have any questions, no matter how small they seem, or how large they seem, email the owner, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about her and the sweetsation line.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, absorbs quickly and stays on my skin all night long.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for purity and scent (</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone looking for brightening.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a product to give brighter skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li> Also, because of the way the container works, there is no waste, every drop is used, unlike so many other products.  </li>
            <li> At least for me, this stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> As far as the lotion itself, it aborbs really well without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Remember no product provides INSTANT success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much gone the all-natural route with my skincare routine and was looking for an organic lightening product that actually worked.  </li>
            <li> and makes it look fresh and younger, while also providing sun protection.</li>
            <li> Although I am not a vegan or even a vegetarian, I normally prefer to use all vegan products for beauty products (some Sweetsation products like Lumi*Essence contain caviar).</li>
            <li> One thing that I find that sets this apart from other brightening treatments is the softness that it gives your screen .I was amazed at how hydrated and soft my skin felt and knowing that this product uses natural ingreidents is a safe comfort  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles, so I can&#x27;t say much about that, but its a Double Thumbs Up for me :).</li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> And although I really like that LumiEssence makes my skin soft and radiant, it did not help clear up the sun spots.</li>
            <li> (I use a natural powder product by Coastal Classic Creations for an under eye concealer and powder with the Tinted SunSiBelle).  </li>
            <li> In the months that I&#x27;ve been using this treatment, I&#x27;ve noticed the diminishing of small freckles, coupled with a more even skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I started using this for my acne scars and marks and after two months the marks faded almost completely!</li>
            <li> and I usually use Aqua Tica, which I also love.</li>
            <li> Sweetsation&#x27;s products are also biodegradable, natural, organic, and use minimal packaging, and they offer discounts and specials with their special recycling program as well.</li>
            <li> it costs less than buying and trying a lot of cheap products that don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> After 1 week of use my skin is already glowing, its soft, smooth and it lightened the dark patches on my legs in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> There was more of a defined transition visible on my skin from the dark areas to the lighter, and that is actually reduced.</li>
            <li> I know that Kojic Acid is good for lightening dark spots and it is much better than hydroquinone creme which is dangerous for skin.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002ERSS6U Sun*Si&#x27;Belle Organic Triple Action Moisturizing Sunscreen SPF 30+, tinted with brightening action, 3.5oz]][[ASIN:B001U1YTDC Sun*Si&#x27;Belle+ SPF 50 Organic Triple Action Moisturizer, with Antioxidants, CoQ10 and Hyaluronic Acid.]][[ASIN:B004MJIL92 Very*Berry Organic Oxygen Masque &amp; Scrub with Antioxidants, Vitamin C &amp; Superberries - NEW]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer but didn&#x27;t moisturize any better than a less expensive product.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s only been a few weeks, I&#x27;m positive my skin can only get better from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lightening effect does not seem to be strong enough, I&#x27;ve seen other all natural products work faster at lightening my sunspots and acne marks.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients used are natural.</li>
            <li> I was drawn to this product because of its all natural organic ingredients and the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product close to six months ago as I wanted something natural to even my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The lumi essence has almost completely evened out that area.</li>
            <li> So, these are 100% mineral, non-nano sunscreens, completely natural, with no preservatives.  </li>
            <li> I read that kojic acid and alpha-arbutin are natural skin fading agents, so I wanted to give this product a try.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> I have used 2 tubs so far</li>
            <li> I am in my late sixties and my skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product early this year after reading all of glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> WOW...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a latin 30 year old woman with sun spots in both cheeks and forhead.</li>
            <li> I always look for products with natural ingredients that are not harmful to my skin or health.</li>
            <li> oily skin, I was, prior to Lumi*Essence, very prone to hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin from pimples caused by an increase in melanin production).</li>
            <li> , if you have made it this far in my lengthy review, I also want to mention something about their packaging.</li>
            <li> and I like knowing that all the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too early to tell.</li>
            <li> It has no harsh chemicals like 99% of skin care products on the market these days.</li>
            <li> I ordered LumiEssence because of the reviews, and the natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I wore a sunscreen every time I went outside, and I also minimize my time outside right now while I am trying to get this hyperpigmentation under control.  </li>
            <li> Then, a NEW pimple appeared in a NEW area, almost daily.</li>
            <li> and I noticed the lovely yet subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> I must have spent hundreds of hours both pregnancies scouring Sephora and a few other websites, including ones specializing in pregnancy skin care, for safe products I can use while pregnant.  </li>
            <li> Reducing Discoloration:  As I said earlier, I was diligent about applying this cream 2x/day, and I made sure to put a little extra in the areas where I have hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li> I can say that Sweetsation not only offers very natural and organic benefits, but the biggest selling point to me was that it has NO Hydroquinone.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why that is so important to me</li>
            <li> At first when I recieve this product I was a bit upset because the pump did not work or maybe the container was empty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will take to see a major change, but for now I&#x27;m really liking this cream.</li>
            <li> Before using Lumi Essence, I had developed some adult acne that left me with some scars.</li>
            <li> Finally finding a product line that works, slowly but surely, to fade my truly severe skin condition is a godsend.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this product goes a long way, making the expense cheaper than most over the counter, generic products.</li>
            <li> Its the only product that works for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am someone with very sensitive, reactive skin (and possibly rosacea) but also acne.  </li>
            <li> He even changed his morning routine (major for this rather&lt;br /&gt;rigid, efficient guy)</li>
            <li> I have no regrets whatsoever!</li>
            <li> I was using two other pregnancy lines for my first pregnancy when I discovered Sweetsation Therapy.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and upon first applying this cream my skin got a bit red and irritated, however, it&#x27;s probably due to the AHA&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Seriously way better products you can find locally and your grocery store than wasting your money on these.</li>
            <li> I used them for a little while, then my dermatologist put me on a prescription regimen for rosacea that actually seemed to irritate my skin more, so I recently went back to the Sweetsation products... and my skin is starting to look luminous again.    </li>
            <li> And my skin in general looks \\&quot;brighter\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This product is the complete opposite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted a moisturizer with pearl powder, but couldn&#x27;t find anything natural enough to satisfy me.</li>
            <li> It has lighten up old acne marks and even helped in preventing future breakouts(with the use of sunblock).  </li>
            <li> Now after barely 2 months of use my skin is unrecognizable.</li>
            <li> it is natural i will recommend this product to any one because i have noticed a massive improvement</li>
            <li> but since im not really prone to pimples it goes away fast</li>
            <li> Barely started to use this for a week</li>
            <li> I looked in the mirror a few hours after I applied it to see if the fresh look went away, and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I wish I had ordered this earlier when I was frantically searching for a product without harsh ingredients that would give me a soft, healthy, buttery glow without stripping my black skin.</li>
            <li> if you go to their website:  [...], you can order a little sample kit of many of their popular products.   </li>
            <li> and then I break out with a whole other type of acne...</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it so much that I convinced myself to try it again and that the rash was due to something else.</li>
            <li> i had pigmentation problems due to too much sun exposure..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to actually use a product that doesn&#x27;t sting or make my skin feel weirdly tingly when I apply it.  </li>
            <li> A bit of sun exposure that used to be a nice sun glow, now just makes my skin look old and damaged, I am unhappy to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> i just recently purchased the very berry scrub based on other reviews,i will see how that goes,but for now I will keep purchasing and using the lumi essence face cream.</li>
            <li> Also, wear sunscreen and give it at least 2 weeks to 1 month for some results and another 2 months for full results.</li>
            <li> My first order I ordered a few products before I discovered the Intropack, and she allowed me to cancel my order and change it.   </li>
            <li> very well (non-greasy) with a slight tingle, so you know it&#x27;s working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive, fairly dry skin</li>
            <li> I little bit, maybe pea size can do almost your whole face.</li>
            <li> Not only that, the fact that these products are organic and not full of bad chemcials really makes you feel like you&#x27;re doing something good for your skin and body.  </li>
            <li> I have read other reviews that criticize their packaging for not looking professional enough or something like that.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a natural lightening cream for a dark pigmentation above my upper lips.  </li>
            <li> So now, my red spots and blemishes are fading, my uneven tone is smoothing out, my dry sensitive thirty-something skin is hydrated, soft and glowing</li>
            <li> I have less new spots as well.</li>
            <li> I also use their Very*Berry masque/scrub three times a week and their Choco*Smooch Face/Lip Balm, of which I bought several small ones for my daughter to carry in her book bag, she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> There are a few main reasons why I like sweetsation line; the cost is actually cheaper than any other product as a little really does go along way.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product my freckles have not darkened which is usually what happens after sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> so I went ahead and ordered it even though I usually don&#x27;t spend so much on face creams.  </li>
            <li> The products are so concentrated that even the samples last a long time</li>
            <li> Not too worried about that as long as it does the job which it definitely does.</li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> I went to EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetic Database website and spent hours searching through pages and pages of different products, reading tons of information on ingredients, concerns, warnings.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this lotion is all natural and does not contain mineral oil and parabens.it is expensive but after what it did for my skin, its really worth it.</li>
            <li> The base is the perfect consistency, too:  neither too runny ( &#x3D; too much grainy, scratches) or too thick and pasty (too thick for the scrub part to do anything)    </li>
            <li> plus I am used to my other Sweetsation facial moisturizers being white</li>
            <li> This is hard to believe, but I am being totally real.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because the product really does work, minus 1 star because of the costly price, after a few pumps of using this stuff the container feels almost empty.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for a long time and nothing re-darkened.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will work if you are trying to lighten your skin considerably, but if you have uneven skin tone and marks this might work.  </li>
            <li> I Believed in this product for so long</li>
            <li> 5 oz goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I first put my finger in, it felt a little stiff.</li>
            <li> In general these type of sunscreens (because of the specific aforementioned properties) are a little difficult to rub in, often leave a white cast, and are pretty oily.  </li>
            <li> And one other thing that I really like is that the shipping charges are reasonable--what it would actually cost, not some ridiculous, flat rate that that they make a profit off of.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, my skin is plagued with cystic acne, that i&#x27;ve gotten under control (hopefully) with antibiotics and various other topicals.</li>
            <li> So, when I use acne-type products, my skin tends to be red and irritated looking--and I have those little red, rash like acne stuff...</li>
            <li> After a little over 6 weeks of use I give this product 5 stars for its brightening effect, but only 1 star for its a ability to reduce discoloration (three star overall rating).  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long, but it took about a week to see a difference.  </li>
            <li> I think my face was just dry</li>
            <li> However, during pregnancy, I stress about my baby&#x27;s safety, and also deal with a chronically painfully dry face.</li>
            <li> Every single product is packed with vitamins and antioxidants.</li>
            <li> my upper cheeks have dark spots, like mergedfreckles.</li>
            <li> Even though I use 30+ sunscreen religiously, I had started to get some dark spotting on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> My skin has been darkening there for the past year, perhaps from sun exposure, and/or probably from natural hormonal aging (I am 37, but I have heard that it could be from testosterone levels that raise with age).  </li>
            <li> I seem to have difficult to lighten skin and this is the first product that is actually working.</li>
            <li> I have used it on a few dark spots daily and have notice a big difference.</li>
            <li> The next morning I had a few dry patches on my face, but after a day or two my skin adjusted.</li>
            <li> my 50&#x27;s and my skin has always looked dry and rubbery due to sun damage.</li>
            <li> hadn&#x27;t been using this for a while as I ran out and for some crazy reason, just didn&#x27;t bother to order any more for a few months.</li>
            <li> Not very fond of this product.  </li>
            <li> I expected to help my skin looks brightening.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I was a little worried when I opened it that I may have let it sit around for too long, and it had been laying on its side, so all of the product was over to one side</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for close to 4years now, and i will not use any other products for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Lumi*Essence use along with other products in Sweetsations&#x27; line (toner, eye area treatment, moisturizer/sunscreen) have brightened my skin and kept the areas from getting any darker.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the fence over whether I&#x27;ll be buying this product again due to the price.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t shop any other line of products and this review is not being biased because of this.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I had used both over the counter and doctor prescribed treatments, that did nothing for the darkening of my skin around my ankles due to a drug reaction.  </li>
            <li> As you guys can see, I had an endless battle with hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued by severe melasma on my chin, both cheeks, bridge of nose, and forehead due to oral contraceptive use over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> This product, used in conjunction with other skin brightening products in the Sweetsation line including C*Perfect Skin Organic Foaming Face Cleanser, Very*Berry Organic Oxygen Masque &amp; Scrub, and C*Bella Organic Brightening Toner is making a difference.</li>
            <li> , after only using this for a few days, I already noticed a lightening of those spots!</li>
            <li> I CAN&#x27;T EVEN BELIEVE IT, but after using it last night, this morning and this evening (a few hours ago) I ALREADY SEE A REDUCTION IN THE DARKNESS!</li>
            <li> I have now been using this religiously morning and night, with 30+ sunblock on my upper lip, for almost 5 months, and I am sad to say that not only has it not worked at all, but it has gotten darker.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients were either alarming, or the pregnancy-friendly products lost effectiveness or did not adequately moisturize my skin.  </li>
            <li> They are still there, but they aren&#x27;t as dark.</li>
            <li> Even my facial girl told me how \\&quot;happy\\&quot; my skin is looking lately.   </li>
            <li> My dark spots have diminished.</li>
            <li> was hoping it would work on my dark spots</li>
            <li> It is a bit of a slow process, it has been about 3 months, but I AM actually seeing results.</li>
            <li> I wish they would cut the price down $10 or so.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with a few other products from this company.  </li>
            <li> My hands look less lined and softer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness of the products with regard to anti-aging, because I haven&#x27;t been using them consistently/for long enough.  </li>
            <li> I still use a lighter, more soothing moisturizer doing bad breakouts but the rest of the time I use this product and my skin tone is visibly improving!</li>
            <li> I may buy another bottle and use it just once a day to keep the brightening going, as I think my skin may be even a little brighter than I want.    </li>
            <li> i know it takes awhile, but i was atleast expecting my skin tone to even up after a few weeks, but that hasn&#x27;t happened either.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking to help those trouble spots.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday and the spots from acne are fading gradually.</li>
            <li> I use it every night all year round.</li>
            <li> Faithfully used it am and pm everyday, yet nothing happens.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS BECAUSE OF UNEVEN SKIN TONE AND TO LIFT MY COMPLEXION.</li>
            <li> evening a few weeks ago I was cleaning out a cosmetic bag and found this sample.</li>
            <li> But the packages work well, and the pumps ensure that almost no product is wasted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 20s, but I&#x27;m still battling acne and as a result have very uneven skin tone and dark spots.</li>
            <li> Application of small amounts of Lumi*Essence to my neck and throat keep the skin supple and less \\&quot;crepe-y\\&quot; after a weight loss of about 25 lbs.</li>
            <li> After using the first purchase, I can see an improvement, (was so bad, I was applying leg makeup during the summer</li>
            <li> But they are softer looking, less hard edged, and lighter.</li>
            <li> I felt uncomfortable initially asking her a questions a few months ago about one of her products ( I emailed from her website) and I am gladI</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I really wanted to like this product because of the all natural ingredients but my skin hated it!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a failure which I previously refused to acknowledge.</li>
            <li> I really can not come up with anything bad to say.</li>
            <li> over the past eight months.  </li>
            <li> This may work for you, but it did nothing for me but add a pointless ritual to my day.</li>
            <li> There were other products that range well over $100 that promise to do the same thing, but they contain fillers that are bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way and that&#x27;s why I am taking my time to write this review to spare you.</li>
            <li> I have not had that since I was in my late twenties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every time I would get a pimple, I knew that it would take at least 3 weeks before the redness and discoloration vanished.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t put sunscreen on late in the day when the sun was setting, and that seems to have been what got my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I hate products that overpower you with scent and then leave much to be desired in terms of quality.  </li>
            <li> I mean i do a lot of things in conjunction- juicing a bit,</li>
            <li> With continued improvement, maybe no more makeup for the summer!</li>
            <li> The plastic containers don&#x27;t seem as expensive as some other products.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 10 different lightening creams and have been disappointed with all of them, no matter the price or reputation.</li>
            <li> She stands behind all of her products.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really frustrating.  </li>
            <li> but alas it didn&#x27;t do anything at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s brighter and those ugly melasma dark smudge marks on my cheeks are virtually gone.  </li>
            <li> It turns bad after few months.  </li>
            <li> Its a bit expensive-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of expensive (and non-organic) products from Dior, Peter Thomas Roth, etc...</li>
            <li> I was looking for organic skin products which didn&#x27;t contain any toxic, harmful or cancer causing chemicals including artificial colors, artificial fragrance, etc.</li>
            <li> Sweetsation does NOT USE artificial colors, fragrance, propylene glycol, formaldehyde, oxybenzone phthalates, parabens or sulfates.</li>
            <li> On me felt very heavy, which for me that gets oily skin felt awful.</li>
            <li> I understand the tenacity of melasma and know that a quick-fix is an almost certainly impossible.</li>
            <li> My skin was sun damaged and badly tanned.</li>
            <li> It got so bad</li>
            <li> in addition, i am in the midst of one of the worst breakouts of my life, which started two weeks or so after switching to sweetsation therapy.</li>
            <li> I broke out in a terrible contact dermatitis that took weeks to heal.</li>
            <li> It was horrible!</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for close to 4years now, and i will not use any other products for my skin.  It corrects my severe hyper-pigmentation problems that i have had for over a decade.  I Love the results of bright, clear and even skin tone.  And what is more? The ingredients used are natural.</li>
            <li> I have been using Lumi*Essence for several months.  It is very creamy when first applied but then melts right into the skin so there&#x27;s no greasy residue.  While I have well-entrenched areas of hyperpigmentation around my eyes and upper cheeks, Lumi*Essence use along with other products in Sweetsations&#x27; line (toner, eye area treatment, moisturizer/sunscreen) have brightened my skin and kept the areas from getting any darker.  No redness or irritation, no reaction to any ingredients in any of the Sweetsations line, all smell delightful, not too perfume-y.  Highly recommended for purity and scent (pleasant but not overpowering).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update May 2, 2013:  After using this product for more than a year (along with other products in the Sweetsation Therapy line), I am happy to report an overall evening and lightening of my entire face.  As part of an overall healthier lifestyle and improved self-care regimen, Lumi-Essence has proven invaluable.  If you are in this for the long haul and not just seeking a magic bullet \\&quot;quick fix\\&quot;, I&#x27;d go with the entire line of Sweetsations Therapy skin care.  I am very pleased with the tone and texture of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Addendum 6/7/2013:  Use as directed continues to replenish and renew the texture of my skin.  Application of small amounts of Lumi*Essence to my neck and throat keep the skin supple and less \\&quot;crepe-y\\&quot; after a weight loss of about 25 lbs. over the past eight months.  Nothing else I&#x27;ve used has the noticeable effect of Sweetsation Therapy&#x27;s skin care line.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for months and I can say it is a lovely facial cream! I have acne and I have been suffering for 10 years, nothing helped though I tried out all kind of products (I have hormonal acne). So I have scars on my face, they never fade away. But this cream does wonders! I had to use it for 2 months and then I saw the difference already! The cream itself is rich but wont make your skin greasy (I wouldnt use it then). I love Sweetsation and their natural products!</li>
            <li> This product works for men too. My face looks younger and skin feels amazing. I started using it 3 months ago and now it&#x27;s part of my daily ritual. I recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I was given the Lumi Essence Organic Brightening repair as a gift earlier this year but did not start using it till the summer.  I live in Florida so I often exposed to more sun than I should.  I am a red head and have freckles but they are light.  Thanks to this product my freckles have not darkened which is usually what happens after sun exposure.  The Vitamin C in the product also keeps me skin perfectly even.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for brightening.  I don&#x27;t have dark circles, so I can&#x27;t say much about that, but its a Double Thumbs Up for me :).</li>
            <li> i have two light brown spots, melasma, on either side of my nose. while searching for products with kojic acid to lighten the spots, i came across the sweetsation line. i read many glowing reviews and decided to purchase the entire line -- face wash, toner, day and night cream, eye cream, brightening cream. i have been using the line consistantly for over a month now and the spots haven&#x27;t lightened up...i know it takes awhile, but i was atleast expecting my skin tone to even up after a few weeks, but that hasn&#x27;t happened either. in addition, i am in the midst of one of the worst breakouts of my life, which started two weeks or so after switching to sweetsation therapy. i do not doubt that these are wonderful products that work well for a lot of people...but unfortunately, i&#x27;m not one of them.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the great reviews. I&#x27;ve used this about a week and I can already see a difference in my skin tone, my acne scars are lighter, and my complexion looks brighter overall. I have somewhat sensitive skin and upon first applying this cream my skin got a bit red and irritated, however, it&#x27;s probably due to the AHA&#x27;s. The next morning I had a few dry patches on my face, but after a day or two my skin adjusted. 4 stars because the product really does work, minus 1 star because of the costly price, after a few pumps of using this stuff the container feels almost empty. I wish they would cut the price down $10 or so. I&#x27;m still on the fence over whether I&#x27;ll be buying this product again due to the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 20s, but I&#x27;m still battling acne and as a result have very uneven skin tone and dark spots. It got to the point where I began looking for a skin lightener, and I was lucky enough to try this first. I love that it&#x27;s organic and contains so many natural, skin-loving ingredients, but what I love most is that this does the job! I still use a lighter, more soothing moisturizer doing bad breakouts but the rest of the time I use this product and my skin tone is visibly improving! Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite of the Sweetsation line. I really can not come up with anything bad to say. In fact, I am making this part of my permanent face care collection. I am not a girly girl, but I do enjoy knowing that I am using a healthy, safe product. A little bit of this product goes a long way, making the expense cheaper than most over the counter, generic products. There is a nice light natural scent to it. I can not tolerate anything with fragrance or chemical smell. This product had this natural scent that is nice and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. After applying, my face glows, almost immedietly. After about 5-10 minutes of application my face literetly has a healthier, different look to it.    I started using this product because I want to lighten some of the many sunspots I have, mainly the ones on my face. I didn&#x27;t expect it to do all that it does; gives a glow and healthy look within 10 minutes and the look stays with you. I looked in the mirror a few hours after I applied it to see if the fresh look went away, and it didn&#x27;t. It is not greasy at all, which is a super bonus for me. I can&#x27;t stand having to go back and wipe off greasy products, and with this I don&#x27;t have to do that ever. I little bit, maybe pea size can do almost your whole face. I am actually going to use this product as a permament moisterizer because even for that it works better than anything I have ever used.     I only use sweetsation products and will not bother even trying anything else. There are a few main reasons why I like sweetsation line; the cost is actually cheaper than any other product as a little really does go along way. No greasiness to the products, and they really are healthy and safe with no chemicals and so forth in the ingredients. One of the main reasons is because of the customer service. The owner is very kind, as I said. I felt uncomfortable initially asking her a questions a few months ago about one of her products ( I emailed from her website) and I am gladI did, because she emailed back right away and was extremely helpful and honest. I won&#x27;t shop any other line of products and this review is not being biased because of this. This product really is amazing, and I am so glad the owner developed it. If you have any questions, no matter how small they seem, or how large they seem, email the owner, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about her and the sweetsation line.</li>
            <li> Sweetsation, you did it again!! Two amazing additions to your wonderful family of lotions and potions...Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment &amp; I*Light Organic Advanced Brightening &amp; Line Smoothing Eye Treatment.  I have been using both treatments for over 2 weeks now and absolutely love them!!  I have used a lot of different organic products and yet this line is truly fantastic!! So light and yet so moisturizing... it absorbs into your skin as soon as applied. My skin feels softer and the light brown spots are even lighter from the combination of your amazing products!  Every single product is packed with vitamins and antioxidants. Keep up the great work you do... thank you!!</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes that it would help lighten my freckles. I have had freckles as a kid and they were cute then, but no so much anymore. Now they look like sun damage and age spots! I was drawn to this product because of its all natural organic ingredients and the price.There were other products that range well over $100 that promise to do the same thing, but they contain fillers that are bad for your skin. I thought this would be more of a serum, but it&#x27;s actually a lotion. It&#x27;s creamier and a lot more moisturizing than I thought it&#x27;d be. Honestly if you don not have dry skin, this is all you need to put on at night because if you put your regular moisturizer on top your skin will get oily. It has lightened my freckles just a tad. They are still there, but they aren&#x27;t as dark. I expected it to be more effective since it got raves reviews, but for me it&#x27;s ok. It has helped to even out my overall skin tone. The skin around my mouth always had a darker yellowish tint compared to my lighter cheeks. I have olive skin and now it&#x27;s all uniform. I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again because I am looking for a serum, not a lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with a few other products from this company.  This was a product that really showed how much it worked.  Like another reviewer said it does brighten your skin a lot and not in a shiny way.  I was really impressed by the way it did.  Not only that, the fact that these products are organic and not full of bad chemcials really makes you feel like you&#x27;re doing something good for your skin and body.  I have brown spots on my shoulders that faded with this product.  I was skeptical at first but if you give the product time and follow the directions you will see just how well it works.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking to help those trouble spots.  Plus it smells really good!</li>
            <li> Fantastic moisturizer, very good absorption, smell very natural, like flowers and plants. It lasts 3 months, and i use it every day.Its the only product that works for my very sensitive skin.I will definitely buy it again !</li>
            <li> I have been using Lumi*Essence for several months and am extremely impressed!  I&#x27;m quite picky when it comes to skin care products, but this one exceeded my expectations!  From the moment I opened the bottle, the smell was mesmermising, yet delicate.....which drew me in immediately.  I hate products that overpower you with scent and then leave much to be desired in terms of quality.  This product is the complete opposite.  The scent is engaging and the product does what it promises to do!  In the months that I&#x27;ve been using this treatment, I&#x27;ve noticed the diminishing of small freckles, coupled with a more even skin tone.  My face takes on a healthy glow and my skin feels refreshed every time I use it.  I actually look forward to putting it on.  Lumi*Essence is subtlety, quality, and affordable luxury!  I really love this cream!</li>
            <li> I love all the products of Sweetsation. I am into organic cosmetics and Sweetsation has wonderful skincare lines. I use this Brightening Repair Treatment with Organic Day Creme with Cucumber and Co Q10 and Organic Botanical Night Creme. I have acne scars on my face and chest and wanted to lighten/even my skin tone. I know that Kojic Acid is good for lightening dark spots and it is much better than hydroquinone creme which is dangerous for skin. I use this everyday and the spots from acne are fading gradually. I can definitely see more even tone on my face and the chest scars have become very light. For winter time, I used this with the day creme and night creme, but since summer has come, I use this alone and it still moisturizes my skin. I will continue to use this product to lighten my spots!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product! I used this for some acne scars and skin discoloration on my arms and this product works fast, it wasn&#x27;t greasy at all and it smells amazing.  The customer service is the best too -- definitely one of the best products/vendors I&#x27;ve ever bought from on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This skin brightening cream has a very light and pleasant scent. I have used this for a few weeks now and really tell a difference in the color of my skin. This treatment really works and does what it say it will do. I have used it on a few dark spots daily and have notice a big difference. I would recommend this treatment. Sample received for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product close to six months ago as I wanted something natural to even my skin tone.  It has a great punch to the start as it tingles the first time I used it and settled thereafter.  It was a natural and slow process for developing an even skin tone; in which I accept as it does not include some of the most harmful chemicals as some of you may be more familiar with.  Thereby it does not provide overnight, quick and &#x27;immediate&#x27; or complete skin tone change, nor does it induces long-term skin damage.  Therefore, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite product from Sweetsation, and also one of my favorite skin creams ever. That&#x27;s saying a lot, because I&#x27;ve used a great deal of organic moisturizers over the years. Lumi*Essence has everything I could want - sea buckthorn, tamanu, helichrysum, pomegranate, goji, amino acids, caviar... and pearl powder! I&#x27;ve always wanted a moisturizer with pearl powder, but couldn&#x27;t find anything natural enough to satisfy me. Until Lumi*Essence. So now, my red spots and blemishes are fading, my uneven tone is smoothing out, my dry sensitive thirty-something skin is hydrated, soft and glowing and I rarely need concealer. You absolutely have to try Lumi*Essence; it will help every skin type, and every skin type will be thrilled.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sweetsation products for over 3 years. I was looking for organic skin products which didn&#x27;t contain any toxic, harmful or cancer causing chemicals including artificial colors, artificial fragrance, etc. I went to EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetic Database website and spent hours searching through pages and pages of different products, reading tons of information on ingredients, concerns, warnings. After many hours I came up with a winner . . . Sweetsation. And not just one product. The whole line had great ratings - exactly what I was looking for! Sweetsation does NOT USE artificial colors, fragrance, propylene glycol, formaldehyde, oxybenzone phthalates, parabens or sulfates. They DO promote recycling, support many charitable organizations and have amazing customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went to their website and instantly falling in love with their entire presentation, I ordered the basics - day cream, night cream and toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day my order arrived, I tested it all and I was hooked. The feel, the scent, the ease with which the products go on, even the packaging - is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of using the a skin care products and my skin loving it, I ordered more Sweetsation products including the Lip Balm, Choco Butter, sunscreen, Eye Treatment, cellulitis treatment . . . And now, it&#x27;s three years later. I found my skin care line and will never have to search again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so about Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend a lot of time outdoors, perhaps 3-6 hours a day and living in Southern California, that is a lot of sun exposure. I use 25 SPF routinely in the morning; when I garden or play tennis, I put on higher SPF. But even with all that precaution, my skin can get darker and is prone to hyper pigmentation spots. Since my skin reacts to sun quite quickly, I need help to counter-attack all the damage and Lumi*Essence does just that. I use it every night all year round. Thanks toLumi*Essence, the skin on my face is brighter. My hyperpigmentation spots, which used to be oh so visible, are lighter, and my face has more even tone. I have not had that since I was in my late twenties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Lumi*Essence (and Sweetsation&#x27;s Brightening &amp; Line Smoothing Eye Treatment which I also use), I&#x27;m constantly thought to be 10 years younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend Lumi*Essence to anyone who would like to brighten the appearance of their skin and lighten hyperpigmentation spots.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It has lighten up old acne marks and even helped in preventing future breakouts(with the use of sunblock).  I will be buying another as soon as I depleted my first order. :)</li>
            <li> Just started using this about a week ago- i will review it again at the end of two months- just so i can give it enough time to do its thing- But have to say- this smells AWESOME- and does get absorbed well- leaves a nice glow- Initially i felt my skin was a bit blotchy, but it has cleared up and i am really loving it- the application and the aroma. ALso, just the feel of having something organic going on to my skin- makes me feel good. Anyway, my skin is plagued with cystic acne, that i&#x27;ve gotten under control (hopefully) with antibiotics and various other topicals. So for now, i have hyper-pigmentation spots from the acne that im trying to get rid off- in addition to some discoloration around my lips / forehead. These are the areas that im hoping this product will help with. 3 stars for now, if it works the way it says it will, 5 stars it will get! Stay tuned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT- AUG 30, 2011- So i&#x27;ve upped my rating to 5 stars- i have definitely seen and improvement with my perioral hyperpigmentation- i feel like my pigmented acne scars have also faded some- overall my skin is clearer and just glowing. So i think there is something to this product. I mean i do a lot of things in conjunction- juicing a bit, exercise, AHAs so i sure they all contribute - but this is definitely helping my problem areas. Its a bit expensive- but worth IMHO. More updates later. !</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing!   The shippment was fast, product arrived sealed and very well packed (thank you!)   The smell of the product is delicious, love it! I just started using it but i will update soon.  It&#x27;s pretty light and you dont need much.    love   J.</li>
            <li> I love that it works so well with my skin... I have extremely sensitive skin but this product works wonders, it has made my skin lighter (back to it&#x27;s true form) I love it andn will continue to use this!!!</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I have been using it for almost a year. I use it every morning and I love the brightness and natural glow it gives my skin. I have blemish prone skin, and this does not make me break out or make me oily. I finally found a moisturizer that delivers, and keeps its promise every time!</li>
            <li> I found Sweetsation here on amazon.com while looking for something that would be good for my face without all the chemicals.  After reading the reviews, I decided to give them a try and bought several products... all I can say is \\&quot;I&#x27;m in LOVE\\&quot;.  I can&#x27;t rave enough about how great they are.  I started using the Lumi*Essence while one of my bff&#x27;s was away on a three week vacation, when she returned she looks at me and says \\&quot;OMG, your skin is glowing!\\&quot;  She&#x27;s right, it is! I use it every morning and follow it with their Sun*Si&#x27;Belle sunscreen, either the tinted SPF 30, or their SPF 50.  I also use their Very*Berry masque/scrub three times a week and their Choco*Smooch Face/Lip Balm, of which I bought several small ones for my daughter to carry in her book bag, she absolutely loves it.  A huge PLUS is also their fantastic customer service, always willing and able to answer any and all questions.  As I said... I can&#x27;t say enough about them... [[ASIN:B0045S0HXI Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment with Kojic Acid, Arbutin &amp; Vitamin C, 2oz.]] [[ASIN:B002ERSS6U Sun*Si&#x27;Belle Organic Triple Action Moisturizing Sunscreen SPF 30+, tinted with brightening action, 3.5oz]][[ASIN:B001U1YTDC Sun*Si&#x27;Belle+ SPF 50 Organic Triple Action Moisturizer, with Antioxidants, CoQ10 and Hyaluronic Acid.]][[ASIN:B004MJIL92 Very*Berry Organic Oxygen Masque &amp; Scrub with Antioxidants, Vitamin C &amp; Superberries - NEW]]</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product in my hand.. but from the first pump, the scent was so overwhelming I can&#x27;t really use it.&lt;br /&gt;It would be really nice if they can come up with no scent? It&#x27;s just too much to put all over your body.</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite product thus far, but it&#x27;s very hard to decide because I love them all!  This product feels great going on.  It&#x27;s not greasy and is quickly absorbed into the skin.  The smell is wonderful too.  It is also filled with great products such as Kojic Acid and Vitamin C.  You cannot find a better product at this price.  It&#x27;s a powerful brightener but is also gentle on the skin and safe to use during pregnancy.  The owner is wonderful too and will answer any questions that you might have.  She stands behind all of her products.  If you are in the market for a new skincare regime, please give her products a try TODAY!  This one is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I have ever used for acne scars and hyperpigmentation. Even though it&#x27;s a bit pricey and only 2 oz. it costs less than buying and trying a lot of cheap products that don&#x27;t work.  This has cleared up all of my scars. I have olive skin tone and my chin was darker than the rest of my face. The lumi essence has almost completely evened out that area. I bought this a year ago and used it for about 4 months every morning and night with olay sunscreen. I stopped using it for a long time and nothing re-darkened.  I still have some product left so I started using it again last week on my face and neck.  My skin already looks brighter!  I think this is a great product for sun damaged skin. I don&#x27;t think it will work if you are trying to lighten your skin considerably, but if you have uneven skin tone and marks this might work.  Also, wear sunscreen and give it at least 2 weeks to 1 month for some results and another 2 months for full results.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of the Sweetsation products and I love them all.  I am someone with very sensitive, reactive skin (and possibly rosacea) but also acne.  So, when I use acne-type products, my skin tends to be red and irritated looking--and I have those little red, rash like acne stuff...but when I used rich moisturizers, my skin will look fabulous for a few days... and then I break out with a whole other type of acne... it&#x27;s really frustrating.  I also have years and years of acne marks/scars.    Products:  I have tried many of their products and I love them all.   They are pretty much the only rich, healing moisturizers that don&#x27;t make me break out.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness of the products with regard to anti-aging, because I haven&#x27;t been using them consistently/for long enough.  I used them for a little while, then my dermatologist put me on a prescription regimen for rosacea that actually seemed to irritate my skin more, so I recently went back to the Sweetsation products... and my skin is starting to look luminous again.    I*Light eye cream, is creamy, rubs in well, and not oily.    The toners are non-drying, non-irritating, and, well, toning.      The Q&#x27;Luminere cucumber day cream smells delicious and is hydrating, soothing, and completely non oily.    Lumi*Essence advanced brightening repair treatment is a bit lighter of a lotion.    the Berry Mask/Scrub is the perfect scrub.  It is the perfect scrub.  The perfect amount of grainy-ness for exfoliation but without being scratchy or damaging.  The base is the perfect consistency, too:  neither too runny ( &#x3D; too much grainy, scratches) or too thick and pasty (too thick for the scrub part to do anything)    the sunscreens:    So, these are 100% mineral, non-nano sunscreens, completely natural, with no preservatives.  I have tried many such products, and this one is by far the best.   In general these type of sunscreens (because of the specific aforementioned properties) are a little difficult to rub in, often leave a white cast, and are pretty oily.  The sweetsation sunscreens are the best in this regard--they are concentrated and you don&#x27;t need much, rub in well especially if you use a moisturizer underneath, and any white-ness goes away after a few minutes or with light dabbing with a towel.  I recently got a sample of the tinted sunscreen and it&#x27;s wonderful!!!  I didn&#x27;t get it originally because I am very fair and typically have such bad luck with tinted products, but this one is perfect!!! no white-ness, no unnatural look.    Beauty Intropack:  if you go to their website:  [...], you can order a little sample kit of many of their popular products.   It&#x27;s a wonderful deal and you can try a bunch of things out.  The products are so concentrated that even the samples last a long time and it&#x27;s great to have them for travelling!!    Customer Service:  Has been, without exception, exceptional.  Probably the best of any company I&#x27;ve ever interacted with.  Emails and phone calls have been returned by the owner within a day, even on the weekend.    My first order I ordered a few products before I discovered the Intropack, and she allowed me to cancel my order and change it.   Customer satisfaction is their highest priority.   I am hesitant to tell some of the things she&#x27;s done because I don&#x27;t want people to take advantage of it, but she is the epitome of honest, accommodating customer service.  And one other thing that I really like is that the shipping charges are reasonable--what it would actually cost, not some ridiculous, flat rate that that they make a profit off of.  Not sure why that is so important to me but it is.    Bottom line:  if you are looking for natural, organic, chemical free products, definitely give it a try.  The Beauty intropack is a perfect way to do it.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this, and I am very happy with how this makes my skin look and feel. I use their CoQ10 day moisturizer with this. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of expensive (and non-organic) products from Dior, Peter Thomas Roth, etc...and I really love this line more than those! Compared to other powerful products, it is very affordable, and I know that I&#x27;m putting happy, healthy ingredients on my face.</li>
            <li> Ive used this product for several weeks now. The lightening effect does not seem to be strong enough, I&#x27;ve seen other all natural products work faster at lightening my sunspots and acne marks.  It is moisturizing but a bit too oily for the summer. Good night time moisturizer for the winter. I use an organic lightening serum under this moisturizer to help lighten my acne scars and sunspots.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for the purpose of reducing hyperpigmentation without using a product that contains hydroquinone.  I read that kojic acid and alpha-arbutin are natural skin fading agents, so I wanted to give this product a try.  I have fair skin and have some mild hyper-pigmentation on my face related to long term birth control use.  After a little over 6 weeks of use I give this product 5 stars for its brightening effect, but only 1 star for its a ability to reduce discoloration (three star overall rating).  Brightening: After the first couple of days of using this product my skin began to look brighter immediately after application.  Within two weeks my skin started looking much brighter all the time without looking shiny.  I was diligent about applying it 2x/day.  It also has a light pleasant scent.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a product to give brighter skin.  I may buy another bottle and use it just once a day to keep the brightening going, as I think my skin may be even a little brighter than I want.    Reducing Discoloration:  As I said earlier, I was diligent about applying this cream 2x/day, and I made sure to put a little extra in the areas where I have hyperpigmentation.  I can see no reduction in my hyperpigmentation at all.  I wore a sunscreen every time I went outside, and I also minimize my time outside right now while I am trying to get this hyperpigmentation under control.  I understand that kojic acid and alpha-arbutin are fading agents that help a lot of people, but this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I found this product on the Environmental Working Group website when I was looking for a skin lightener that was effective, yet safe to use. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being the safest, this product received a 2. After looking at the website and seeing that the products were designed so that even pregnant women could use them without causing harm to their babies, I decided to give it a try.   I am so glad I did! It contains organic ingredients and no parables, sulfates, or phthalates. It is great smelling and effective. This skin lightener smells like roses right when you put it on. It is a relaxing, soothing scent but is not overpowering. My brown spots have faded and my complexion looks more even. I can even skip putting on foundation and know I still look good running my errands. Even my facial girl told me how \\&quot;happy\\&quot; my skin is looking lately.   One of the other things that impressed me with this product is the packaging. The product comes in a white oplague plastic pump bottle, which keeps sunlight or oxygen from touching the cream until it is dispensed. This is important because repeated exposure to sunlight or oxygen can turn kojic acid brown and make it ineffective. I found this out after I bought a skin lightener from a different company and the product turned brown and quit working. With Sweetsation, that is not a concern, they have truly thought of everything! Great product, great packaging! Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 4 weeks with no lightening of sun spots as it claims to do.  When I am finished with the bottle will go back to twice weekly retinol which does work.</li>
            <li> i read some positive reviews about this so i desided to try it.....its been about a week i love it...i have sun damage and&lt;br /&gt;acne scars my face got lighter i still have the sun damage but it did get lighter....for the first time in a while it felt good to look in the mirror.....thank you for that......</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed Lumi Essence Organic Repair treatment and highly recommend this product for its effectiveness in brightening. I was using Skin Medica TNS cream which cost $250 but did not notice any difference. Great cream for a fair price. I am on my 2nd bottle. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  It smells nice and goes on smooth.  It definitely brightens up my skin.  I haven&#x27;t been using it very long, but it took about a week to see a difference.  I don&#x27;t know how long it will take to see a major change, but for now I&#x27;m really liking this cream.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, absorbs quickly and stays on my skin all night long. However, i dislike the scent, i expected it to smell like pineapples and papaya like in the picture lol, but then again it&#x27;s an organic product. But it would help if it smelled a bit more pleasant.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference in about a week after using this product. My friends have started using this product too. Will order more.</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to this product.  This product is truly God sent, im in  my 50&#x27;s and my skin has always looked dry and rubbery due to sun damage. After 1 week of use my skin is already glowing, its soft, smooth and it lightened the dark patches on my legs in 2 weeks. Now after barely 2 months of use my skin is unrecognizable. I get complements that my skin looks younger. I like the fact that this lotion is all natural and does not contain mineral oil and parabens.it is expensive but after what it did for my skin, its really worth it.</li>
            <li> not good for your face if you have oily skin but great for any other part of your body, it smells great and it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> I have used 2 tubs so far and I love it. I wish I had ordered this earlier when I was frantically searching for a product without harsh ingredients that would give me a soft, healthy, buttery glow without stripping my black skin. I must say I found the one. This is a great product for the price. Men and women ask me what I am using all the time. I only took 1 star away because the packaging could be more sleek and sophisticated. Not too worried about that as long as it does the job which it definitely does.</li>
            <li> I have tried many more expensive products that didn&#x27;t make any changes in my complexion, but this really did brighten my skin.  I no longer feel the need to use a foundation to even out my skin tone.  I am in my late sixties and my skin has never looked better.  I love the fact that it contains organic ingredients and is actually good for my skin.  I highly recommend this product.  Terri</li>
            <li> this cream is absolutely incredible and the fact the it is natural i will recommend this product to any one because i have noticed a massive improvement</li>
            <li> I used this product Lumi essence religiously as recommended for 30 days and this product did nothing but give me rashes all over my face and body. What&#x27;s more alarming for me is the wait because I kept telling myself this rash will subside and the product will work, and that I will have even skin and luminous but really I was fooling myself. I Believed in this product for so long but it&#x27;s a failure which I previously refused to acknowledge. I contacted amazon for a refund in turn amazon put me in contact with the Lumi company. Long story short they said no refund since it&#x27;s after 30 days. I DO NOT recommend this product, so be aware, if you are taking a chance on this product; request a refund before 30 days, do not waste time thinking it&#x27;ll work because it will not. I learned the hard way and that&#x27;s why I am taking my time to write this review to spare you. You doubt it then by all means try it for yourself it&#x27;s not just money you wasting but time, and dealing with &amp;#34;how you gonna get those rashes off your face delemma.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of LUMI ESSENCE ORGANIC ADVANCED BRIGHTENING REPAIR TREATMENT WITH KOJIC ACID, ARBUTIN AND VITAMIN C. I am not one to waste money, so the results had to be good.  Also, because of the way the container works, there is no waste, every drop is used, unlike so many other products.  I had used both over the counter and doctor prescribed treatments, that did nothing for the darkening of my skin around my ankles due to a drug reaction.  After using the first purchase, I can see an improvement, (was so bad, I was applying leg makeup during the summer so I could wear shorts). Because of the improvement I will use another month hopefully seeing more results.  Product smells great, feels clean, goes on easily. With continued improvement, maybe no more makeup for the summer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months now and my brown spots are still the same.  Originally I purchased this for brown spots and eventhough I see no improvements in that area, I will keep buying because my then visible crows feet and forehead expression lines, have diminished.  I think my face was just dry and this product works as a great moisturizer without leaving my face greasy.  It does give a nice glow and there were days where I went without makeup.  I gave it 3 stars because it did not help my brown spots.</li>
            <li> I bought this product early this year after reading all of glowing reviews. Faithfully used it am and pm everyday, yet nothing happens. My skin condition stays the same as before using this product. I gave it two stars since it has not irritated my skin. I finished the whole bottle of this product and won&#x27;t buy it again. If you are looking for skin brightening product, this is NOT the one. It is a okay moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Feels very light when I apply it, but it keeps my skin moisturized. It is not greasy and it has a pleasant light fragrance. Within a week of using the product, I could tell it brightened up my skin and evened out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Not very fond of this product.  On me felt very heavy, which for me that gets oily skin felt awful. Just not a product for me.</li>
            <li> WOW...This skin care product is Awesome...it has all the right ingredients....my super 60 skin gets it totally...It just feels right going on and truth be told ...I&#x27;m 60 goin on 32 because of finding these wonderful organic skin care products...I love them All but, this is a must have for anyone who has this need for their super important Skin...largest organ on/in the body and everything gets absorbed...GO ORGANIC...thanks sweetsation therapy</li>
            <li> I have used the product for three weeks now. Skin is abit drier but still no sign of lightening yet. Maybe I need something way stronger.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I really wanted to like this product because of the all natural ingredients but my skin hated it! I broke out in a terrible contact dermatitis that took weeks to heal. I wanted to like it so much that I convinced myself to try it again and that the rash was due to something else. 2nd try - same results.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a latin 30 year old woman with sun spots in both cheeks and forhead. I just started trying to get rid of them and this was the first product I got for it, thought it would be good to start with the most natural and organic products first. And although I really like that LumiEssence makes my skin soft and radiant, it did not help clear up the sun spots. I have tried it for about a month and will continue using it just because my face feels great thanks to it. I have started using it in combination with Nadinola skin discoloration fade cream that [[ASIN:B001F0QXPU L&#x27;Oreal Nadinola Skin Discoloration Fade Cream, Extra Strength Formula, 2.25-Ounce Tub (Pack of 3)]] I purchased a week ago. We&#x27;ll see what happens!</li>
            <li> I use this lotion to my whole body all I can say it brightens my skin and feels soft and feels brilliant all the time. I would recommend this lotion to others and since this is also an organic which I like the most .</li>
            <li> This was a good product saw slight lighting, it clogs pores though leave pimples sometime on my face but since im not really prone to pimples it goes away fast</li>
            <li> I bought this product after getting back from Mexico. My skin was sun damaged and badly tanned. I wanted to even out my complexion and help fade some of the tan on my face.  I have been more conscious about synthetic creams being applied to my skin, since our skin easily absorbs what is applied on it.  I didn&#x27;t want harmful toxins entering my bloodstream.  This sounded like the perfect product so I went ahead and ordered it even though I usually don&#x27;t spend so much on face creams.  This product was worth it!  It evened out my skin, prevented further sun damage, and smells great (kind of a rose smell).  One bottle lasted me 3 months. I didn&#x27;t need a separate moisturizer nor did it leave my face greasy.  I&#x27;m going to continue using this product as my daily face cream.</li>
            <li> I started using this for my acne scars and marks and after two months the marks faded almost completely! I have less new spots as well. It&#x27;s a light moisturizer, not greasy at all. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin smooth and soft, I love the feeling! It&#x27;s very gentle, doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, like many other creams I&#x27;ve tried. And it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I love this Lumi Essence. I have tried many products from various companies in the past, but, this is the best I&#x27;ve found. I always look for products with natural ingredients that are not harmful to my skin or health. It has a nice light fragrance which is great for me, because I am very sensitive to many fragrances out there. I have been using this product for over a year and my skin has improved. My dark spots have diminished. Before using Lumi Essence, I had developed some adult acne that left me with some scars. The acne and the scars are all gone thanks to Lumi Essence. I am now hooked on this company and it&#x27;s products. I have ordered many of their other products and have loved them all.</li>
            <li> this product is definitely amazing! i had pigmentation problems due to too much sun exposure.. my pigmentations lightened just after 2 weeks. try this! u will love it..</li>
            <li> Personal Info: 22, Male, White, and oily skin with olive complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With oily skin, I was, prior to Lumi*Essence, very prone to hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin from pimples caused by an increase in melanin production). It was horrible! Every time I would get a pimple, I knew that it would take at least 3 weeks before the redness and discoloration vanished. Then, a NEW pimple appeared in a NEW area, almost daily. As you guys can see, I had an endless battle with hyperpigmentation. It got so bad I did not want to leave my apartment or go to class. I was embarrassed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Lumi*Essence for a year now. I must say that it took about a month to see the beginnings of my hyperpigmentation vanish. This may be do to the severity of my skin. After about 6 months, my skin was AMAZING! It felt soft and looked health and smooth. My skin tone is so even, people will literally tell me I have FLAWLESS skin. This is hard to believe, but I am being totally real. ALL of the discoloration is gone. Now if I get a pimple, it&#x27;s gone a day later and fades VERY quickly (2-3 days). I must say that I also use \\&quot;Nature&#x27;s Cure Acne Treatment\\&quot; to control my pimples. Lumi*Essence fulfills the most important aspect of having great skin, an even, blemish free, skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my skin now! I just wish I would have found this product earlier. This review is 100% real. I am not a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; reviewer. I love shopping on Amazon and was just so lucky to stumble upon this item a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a final note... Remember no product provides INSTANT success. If you are PATIENT and give Lumi*Essence a go, you will finally be a VERY happy person in your OWN skin. :)</li>
            <li> We stumbled on this product on Amazon because we were searching for&lt;br /&gt;organic skin care.  My husband is so wedded to it he goes on and on&lt;br /&gt;about it. He even changed his morning routine (major for this rather&lt;br /&gt;rigid, efficient guy) so it would have more time to sink in.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, we absolutely love it and feel it definitely is working&lt;br /&gt;to make our skin brighter and more smooth.  It goes on easily, goes&lt;br /&gt;in very well (non-greasy) with a slight tingle, so you know it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;THEN...the company treats you sweet as pie.  This last time they sent so&lt;br /&gt;many extra goodies I called them to make sure they didn&#x27;t make a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Wait and see...this company is really going places!</li>
            <li> Bought more than 7 bottles. Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this. It got really good reviews so was hoping it would work on my dark spots but alas it didn&#x27;t do anything at all and I used the whole bottle consistently twice a day. It&#x27;s a nice moisturizer but didn&#x27;t moisturize any better than a less expensive product.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued by severe melasma on my chin, both cheeks, bridge of nose, and forehead due to oral contraceptive use over 10 years ago. I have tried many different products and skin treatments, including Obagi and laser, to no avail. I have been using Lumi&#x27;Essence for about 3 months now in yet another attempt to treat my melasma. This product, used in conjunction with other skin brightening products in the Sweetsation line including C*Perfect Skin Organic Foaming Face Cleanser, Very*Berry Organic Oxygen Masque &amp; Scrub, and C*Bella Organic Brightening Toner is making a difference. I understand the tenacity of melasma and know that a quick-fix is an almost certainly impossible. Finally finding a product line that works, slowly but surely, to fade my truly severe skin condition is a godsend. Plus, the ingredients are so good for me and, although not a mandatory requirement, they smell super-yummy!</li>
            <li> No didn&#x27;t  work for me!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on a whim; I had run out of my staple body lotion and felt it would be a good idea to try something else. I have no regrets whatsoever! The lotion goes on smoothly on my skin, it smells good and my skin is actually softer! Even though it&#x27;s only been a few weeks, I&#x27;m positive my skin can only get better from using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/25/12: Product Update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been two more weeks since my last review, and I must say that this product has exceeded my expectations. Even though my initial observation was the softness of my skin, I can confidently say now my skin tone is gradually evening out! The clincher is the change in the skin texture on my hands. I have always had hands that looked like they belonged to someone much older. The skin was dry and lined, and no moisturizer (until now) could make it look remotely smooth. Well, that&#x27;s not the case anymore. My hands look less lined and softer. I believe with continued use, they will actually begin to look like they belong to someone my age.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much gone the all-natural route with my skincare routine and was looking for an organic lightening product that actually worked.  This is that product.  I&#x27;ve been using Lumi-Essence for about a year and my skin looks so much better. It&#x27;s brighter and those ugly melasma dark smudge marks on my cheeks are virtually gone.  One thing:  it takes time so be patient.  It&#x27;s nice to actually use a product that doesn&#x27;t sting or make my skin feel weirdly tingly when I apply it.  Plus - it smells really nice.  Will continue to use this product forever!!!</li>
            <li> The cream smells nice but that&#x27;s about all. It has not given me the skin tone evening I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> this was a ripoff ! Save your money and go find something that will work. This was just a stink bomb too</li>
            <li> At first when I recieve this product I was a bit upset because the pump did not work or maybe the container was empty. But the costomer service Victoria was nice enough to replace it no hassle. I&#x27;ve been using this product for exactly one month now and i must say it does work. It does not work that fast but i can see the difference in my appearance. My family members even notice the difference in my face.&lt;br /&gt;a</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything but take your money.  It turns bad after few months.  Seriously way better products you can find locally and your grocery store than wasting your money on these.</li>
            <li> I expected to help my skin looks brightening.&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t see any differents after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it  almost 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I need to wait more than 2 months. I will update after 3 months</li>
            <li> I have been using Sweetsation products for several years now and will continue to do so because each product performs as advertised and is well-priced.  I chose Sweetsation LumiEssence Brightening Repair treatment because it contains Kojic acid, Arbutin, and vitamin C, the ingredients research indicates reduces age spots and sun discolorations and helps to brighten skin tone without being toxic.  LumiEssence is a light cream that does not irritate my sensitive aging skin.  I also use Their Organic Advanced Brightening and Line Smoothing Eye treatment and it is wonderful in eliminating under eye puffiness while brightening the eye area in a gentle treatment.  I never leave the house without applying Sun Si Belle Moisturizing Sunscreen and unlike many other sunscreens I have tried, this one does not irritate my skin.  The very best endorsement I can give for Sweetsation products is the fact I will be 65 in a week and everyone is amazed to hear I am over 45.  No kidding!</li>
            <li> I only have good things to say about this product,i have used the face and body lotion, for  over two month ,this is my second purchase of this product,,All I can say is it has made my facial skin flawless..i stop breaking out in acne and it lighten my skin tone about one shade..i just recently purchased the very berry scrub based on other reviews,i will see how that goes,but for now I will keep purchasing and using the lumi essence face cream.</li>
            <li> HI, I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR CREATING THIS PRODUCT, IT WORKS SO BEAUTIFULY WITH MY SKIN I LOVE THE RESULTS. THE REASON I GOT THIS PRODUCT WAS BECAUSE OF UNEVEN SKIN TONE AND TO LIFT MY COMPLEXION. IT HAS SURPASSED MY EXPECTATIONS SO VERY WELL THAT I AM NOW ON MY SECOND ORDER TO MAINTAIN MY SKIN NOW. THE SMELL OF THIS PRODUCT IS SO PRETTY AND SOFT I LOVE IT. THIS IS REALLY A WONDERFUL PRODUCT AND I AM SO THANKFUL FOR FINDING YOU. THE BEST TO YOU AT SWEET SENSATION! LUV SUZANNE.[[ASIN:B0045S0HXI Lumi*Essence Organic Advanced Brightening Repair Treatment with Kojic Acid, Arbutin &amp; Vitamin C, 2oz.]]</li>
            <li> A free sample struck again! The people at Sweetsation are very smart indeed...everytime I order a new product, I receive samples of others that I fall in love with. This is how I first tried LumiEssence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One evening a few weeks ago I was cleaning out a cosmetic bag and found this sample. I don&#x27;t even remember when I received it, but I was happy to find it and thought I would try it as I love their other products. I was a little worried when I opened it that I may have let it sit around for too long, and it had been laying on its side, so all of the product was over to one side which never makes a cream look appealing- plus I am used to my other Sweetsation facial moisturizers being white but this was golden. When I first put my finger in, it felt a little stiff. I continued to put some on my finger, and right away it softened up and I noticed the lovely yet subtle fragrance. So I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I love this stuff. And I love the fact that there are skin care products that FEEL SO GOOD, SMELL SO GOOD, HELP MY SKIN, and are TOTALLY SAFE for me, and while I am pregnant - in case that happens again. :-) But back to my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LumiEssence was the perfect consistency for me to use alone as a night cream before bed. I have really sensitive, fairly dry skin and I usually use Aqua Tica, which I also love. Because it was a sample, the container didn&#x27;t have any claims on it, so I didn&#x27;t realize it was supposed to brighten and lighten spots the way it does. I planned to go to their website and read about it, but I didn&#x27;t get around to that before I noticed a difference in my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am almost 43. I have pretty nice skin for my age, but I recently got some sun spots on my cheeks from a road trip...I didn&#x27;t put sunscreen on late in the day when the sun was setting, and that seems to have been what got my cheeks. This is the first time I have noticed the sun doing this to me...my upper cheeks have dark spots, like mergedfreckles. ACK! A bit of sun exposure that used to be a nice sun glow, now just makes my skin look old and damaged, I am unhappy to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after only using this for a few days, I already noticed a lightening of those spots! They didn&#x27;t go away, for sure. But they are softer looking, less hard edged, and lighter. And my skin in general looks \\&quot;brighter\\&quot;. Most days I use the SunSiBelle tinted sunscreen in lieu of makeup, as it evens out my skin (covers those sun spots!) and makes it look fresh and younger, while also providing sun protection. (I use a natural powder product by Coastal Classic Creations for an under eye concealer and powder with the Tinted SunSiBelle).  But one day I didn&#x27;t bother to put the tinted sibelle or powder on, and I was pleased to notice that my skin looked better naked than it has in a LONG time!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this nightly since, and my skin has continued to look better and better. I just ordered a full size and hope it arrives before my sample runs out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, if you have made it this far in my lengthy review, I also want to mention something about their packaging. I have read other reviews that criticize their packaging for not looking professional enough or something like that. Well, I think their packaging is pretty, though not as upscale as the quality of the products warrants. The plastic containers don&#x27;t seem as expensive as some other products. But the packages work well, and the pumps ensure that almost no product is wasted. I&#x27;d rather be able to AFFORD such amazing skin care products than have the packaging so high-end that the price makes them unattainable for my budget. Plus, they are made in the USA, and created by a Momma. Gotta love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE AUGUST 20, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t been using this for a while as I ran out and for some crazy reason, just didn&#x27;t bother to order any more for a few months. In that time I have moved to New Mexico which as you probably know is VERY SUNNY EVERY DAY!!! Even though I use 30+ sunscreen religiously, I had started to get some dark spotting on my cheeks and forehead. Well, I finally ordered more LumiEssence and it arrived yesterday. I CAN&#x27;T EVEN BELIEVE IT, but after using it last night, this morning and this evening (a few hours ago) I ALREADY SEE A REDUCTION IN THE DARKNESS! There was more of a defined transition visible on my skin from the dark areas to the lighter, and that is actually reduced. I can&#x27;t even believe it. I just had to make note here. At least for me, this stuff is AMAZING. Thank you, Sweetsation Therapy!</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 10 different lightening creams and have been disappointed with all of them, no matter the price or reputation. I seem to have difficult to lighten skin and this is the first product that is actually working. It is a bit of a slow process, it has been about 3 months, but I AM actually seeing results. It hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin in even the slightest way and I like knowing that all the ingredients are natural. Once I get the results I&#x27;m looking for I know that this product will easily maintain them. It has no greasy feel &amp; it absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> I must have spent hundreds of hours both pregnancies scouring Sephora and a few other websites, including ones specializing in pregnancy skin care, for safe products I can use while pregnant.  The ingredients were either alarming, or the pregnancy-friendly products lost effectiveness or did not adequately moisturize my skin.  I was using two other pregnancy lines for my first pregnancy when I discovered Sweetsation Therapy.  I was first and foremost honored by the extremely beautiful and personable founder of the company, both a mom and a beauty expert, who provided me with great customer service and answered my questions and delivered my order through Amazon promptly.  I could tell she intelligently designed each product with first and foremost the clients&#x27; safety concerns for their baby, while not compromising effectiveness. I also loved the smell and the consistency of the products. They were also extremely moisturizing and did not break me out, and absorbed into the skin quickly.  I also felt safe and did not stress that I was feeding my baby toxins through my skin.  Although I am not a vegan or even a vegetarian, I normally prefer to use all vegan products for beauty products (some Sweetsation products like Lumi*Essence contain caviar). However, during pregnancy, I stress about my baby&#x27;s safety, and also deal with a chronically painfully dry face. To this date I have not found anything that cures this dryness as effectively and safely as Sweetsation.  Lumi*Essence is a luxurious product. I also love the Aqua*tica Night Cream as well.  Sweetsation&#x27;s products are also biodegradable, natural, organic, and use minimal packaging, and they offer discounts and specials with their special recycling program as well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite essence, I use it very evening, it made my skin look younger and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;The effect is immediatly.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend you follow the instructions for the most effective treatment.</li>
            <li> Barely started to use this for a week and it&#x27;s too early to tell. I will update at a later time. As far as the lotion itself, it aborbs really well without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Sweetsation has proven to be a Great product for me to even out my skin-tone.  I have tried so many \\&quot;skin brightening\\&quot; products (mainly used to lighten dark spots on my body and face, this product has been the best I&#x27;ve tried. I can say that Sweetsation not only offers very natural and organic benefits, but the biggest selling point to me was that it has NO Hydroquinone.  It&#x27;s light and smells delightful (not chemical smelling at all).  I even had an opportunity to speak with the Company Representative who was very knowledgeable about skincare and offered her expertise on the other great products they sell.  I purchased the Lumi Essence Advance Brightening Repair Treatment and must say that this product is great if you are looking for an all natural product to lighten those stubborn dark spots on face and (entire body).  You will not be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> Awesome hypoalergenic product. Will brighten eye or aging spots guaranteed in my opinionof course. Pleasant light fragrance. Nice samples come with..</li>
            <li> I have finished the entire bottle and have seen no reduction in hyperpigmentation/brown spots.  Will not purchase again.  Instead I am trying Caudalie Vinoperfecting serum.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months and I have to say it does what it says. One thing that I find that sets this apart from other brightening treatments is the softness that it gives your screen .I was amazed at how hydrated and soft my skin felt and knowing that this product uses natural ingreidents is a safe comfort  because I know I&#x27;m  not harming my body. It smells great and works well.</li>
            <li> Love  lotion and it does what it promises. 5 oz goes a long way. I use it only on my chest and shoulders where sun did its work over the years and difference is remarkable. First I scrub my body with hammam glove, which I love by the way and then use this lotion on freshly exfoliated skin. My skin is a lot clearer and brighter than 2 month ago. Only challenge now is to preserve it going into the summer.</li>
            <li> I have pigmentation caused by these tiny bumps that I used to have at the back of my legs (i think it&#x27;s what they call keratosis pilaris). I stumbled upon this product in amazon and decided to give it a try despite being a bit pricey. I really think it helped lighten the pigmentation on my legs caused by KP. I am on my second one already and hope to see more improvement. Arrived really fast!</li>
            <li> This body lotion is one of many items we have ordered from Sweetsation and we LOVE IT.  Just knowing the purity of the lotion should be enough, but it does everything it should do and more.  The overall tone of my skin has improved greatly since using this product and I will be ordering again.  Thank you, Sweetsation, for your attention to purity - it is the thing that makes a lasting benefit, not just a cosmetic one.  :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this since July for my sun damaged arms and face. My arms and face looked like they belonged to an entirely different person...almost five shades darker than the rest of my body. But the good news is that my normal color is coming back and I&#x27;m so so pleased. Will definitely be recommending this to friends and family and will be buying one bottle once my current one is done. I now use it every other day and very sparingly (because well it isn&#x27;t cheap!) and I make sure to use sun screen every time I am outside now... You have to get used to the smell a bit but it isn&#x27;t terrible. Smells like herbs... Not one day magic but it does work!</li>
            <li> I began using this product a couple months ago and am very pleased with its results. It has no harsh chemicals like 99% of skin care products on the market these days. Plus it lasts for a long time with the easy dispensing bottle it comes in. Will continue to purchase from this company as long as it is available!</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a natural lightening cream for a dark pigmentation above my upper lips.  My skin has been darkening there for the past year, perhaps from sun exposure, and/or probably from natural hormonal aging (I am 37, but I have heard that it could be from testosterone levels that raise with age).  I ordered LumiEssence because of the reviews, and the natural ingredients.  I was going to return it within the 30 days if it didn&#x27;t show any signs of working, but when I emailed the company to request doing this, they said that 30 days isn&#x27;t enough, that you would need to use this for months to get results, with regular skin protection.  I have now been using this religiously morning and night, with 30+ sunblock on my upper lip, for almost 5 months, and I am sad to say that not only has it not worked at all, but it has gotten darker.  This may work for you, but it did nothing for me but add a pointless ritual to my day.</li>
