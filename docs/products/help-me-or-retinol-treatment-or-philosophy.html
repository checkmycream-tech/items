    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>

            <li>It is excellent and I will always buy it.</li>
            <li>One of the best Philosophy products.</li>
            <li>This stuff was great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed the greatest results regarding pore size.  </li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s the best one for her.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, it was the best thing I could&#x27;ve done!  </li>
            <li>Just perfectly moisturized, glowy skin!  </li>
            <li>and the body lotions (which leave you dewy, glowy, and smelling great)!  </li>
            <li>so it would probably not be best for oilier skins.  </li>
            <li>I am a Boots No 7 user with excellent results.  </li>

            <li>I LOVE HELP ME!</li>
            <li>Love this cream, works wonders on my skin!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I so hoped this would be an effective cream for me, but it just hasn&#x27;t been.  </li>
            <li>This is an effective product.</li>
            <li>And most people said it is good for the people between 25 to 30.</li>
            <li>really works and great price on amazon!!</li>
            <li>One friend, who is very concerned and knowledgable about her skin, was so impressed with the improvement in my skin that she asked me to get a tube for her.  </li>
            <li>I am really loving this night-time treatment.</li>
            <li>Me a whirl after reading the reviews, and made myself use it for five or six weeks before writing my own review.</li>
            <li>This product feels very nice going on and is comfortable to sleep in.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and will continue to use it and would recommend it to everyone, especially us Super Senior folks.....</li>
            <li>Philosophy&#x27;s \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; is by far the best retinol skin cream I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>I also liked this a lot better because the two combined was making my skin too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am in my early 50s, Philosophy products are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the original link from the website \\&quot;The Good Human\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I have to say I have fewer fine wrinkles, I don&#x27;t need foundation except for special events, I am told how great my skin looks by my cosmetologist.  </li>
            <li>The facial moisturizer is great (though smells funny after application), as are the body washes (which smell great and can multitask!)</li>
            <li>But any retinol product is proven to benefit aging skin, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So glad I can still find it.</li>
            <li>You can spot use it, but works best on entire face.  </li>
            <li>I got better results with the dermalogica overnight clearing gel.  </li>
            <li>For what I paid for the \\&quot;help me\\&quot;, I was expecting a lot more out of this product</li>
            <li>At my age, it don&#x27;t get better than that.  </li>
            <li>Also drinking more water helps too.  </li>
            <li>love love love lovel lve  </li>
            <li>Not any more now that I have found this cream :-)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more of an issue with Retin-A for me.</li>
            <li>I love this product and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li>It also makes my skin look more luminous.</li>
            <li>, I bought this more for acne but</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Just make sure you use a moisturizer like it instructs you to do.</li>
            <li>Probably one of the better retinol night creams out there.</li>
            <li>Love Philosophy products.</li>
            <li>I love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>From the moment I started using the \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot;, my skin has been getting better and better.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;ve finished my tube of \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; and began using prescription Retin-A</li>
            <li>It has a much better texture</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my husband loves.  </li>
            <li>It might work better for others</li>
            <li>, I would still bet this would help with more stubborn and severe forms).</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found that it works a bit better for me.</li>
            <li>I think she love it.</li>
            <li>My skin has been looking better.</li>
            <li>but I love the product for what it does.</li>
            <li>I want to try more of their products.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t recall whether or not I was satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>eating more vegetables?  </li>
            <li>exercising more?).  </li>
            <li>Love it-</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never had better looking skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know why it wasn&#x27;t working, so I decided to try it by itself without HIAJ on top.</li>
            <li>Perhaps do an experiment one night leaving out your HIAJ and see if you get better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>mirror-- with the sun on my face and about wrecked the car-- most of my wrinkles were GONE.</li>
            <li>It is softer, smoother, and more even.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>gentle on my skin (no break outs or irritation) yet very effective on my melasma.</li>
            <li>I wish I could see more of a difference with fine lines around my eyes, but I have seen some improvement.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products hoping they will help hydrate and work on fine lines....</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and it is totally worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this will be more useful to me as my skin starts to age more, but I&#x27;m 28 and people still mistake me for 18...</li>
            <li>This is a great product for even my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much I bought</li>
            <li>A great product that I completely recommend to anyone looking for a highly effective, yet gentle, retinol cream!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found using it every other day is best, or else my skin gets used to it and stops seeing results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like this is as effective, but I think if I had tried this one first I would have loved it just as much.</li>
            <li>My skin reacts easily to lotions and creams, either by rash or breaking out.  </li>
            <li>Very quickly afterward, my skin improved.</li>
            <li>I have debated about diving into the retinol pool, but \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; made the dive easy.</li>
            <li>my acne scars are clearing, my tone is more even, and i rarely ever break out any more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s a list of some pretty popular products, all of which require you to wonder what is BHT and why you should be avoiding it.</li>
            <li>My fine lines and pores still appear as they did before.  </li>
            <li>Lighten your skin and takes away fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s fine, but I do use moisturizer with sunscreen every morning too.</li>
            <li>I guess I will never know if it reduces fine lines or removes brown spots.  </li>
            <li>Super product!</li>
            <li>Skin feels bright, soft and when make up applied it glides on!  </li>
            <li>Just follow the instructions and see fantastic results.  </li>
            <li>i did this of course the night before an important event and had to go with a rash.</li>
            <li>started using this again at night, and in the morning my skin is soooo amazingly smooth...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;  Lubriderm Advanced Therapy Lotion Moisturizing Lotion</li>
            <li>It works much better than the Roc products, so the price difference is worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with product.</li>
            <li>Goes on clean and easy.</li>
            <li>It is relatively cheap for a retinol product compared to prescription creams like RetinA</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to know that it should be applied , then followed by a moisturizer, ESP at night if rapid results are anticipated.  </li>
            <li>Help me really does what it says and more.. not like most creams.</li>
            <li>This product replaced the now discontinued On a Clear Day retinol treatment, which I absolutely loved.</li>
            <li>A good alternative to On a Clear Day,</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product but after 3 weeks of using it at night I had more pimples than I had when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>I then decided to try the Philosophy clear days ahead system after hearing good things.  </li>
            <li>Always make sure to use w/ a moisturizer right after application</li>
            <li>It has significantly reduced the appearance of my pores and my skin is so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Skin Is In&amp;#34; for combination skin kit (which is unfortunately no longer available) and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Retin A.....I know, probably not as effective, but I look less reptilian, so I&#x27;m good with it.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Originally I&#x27;d purchased Philosophy&#x27;s \\&quot;On</li>
            <li>I also love that it was MUCH cheaper on Amazon than at Sephora!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am pretty satisfied with this for the $ I paid.</li>
            <li>During that time, my skin got significantly clearer/brighter without any retinol-induced irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used other retinol products and none makes my skin look as good!  </li>
            <li>(twenty years of fun!)</li>
            <li>I love retinol , seems to be something that really works for fine lines and wrinkles .</li>
            <li>In addition, it minimizes the appearance of pores, helps keep my mild acne at bay and keeps my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>It speeds cellular turnover and honestly works as well as Retin-A worked for me as a teen but is more gentle to skin and feels more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>sure you use with a lotion as it&#x27;s very drying on the skin  </li>
            <li>i have used better i am not noticing much of a difference and its been over 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s gentle for a retinol product.</li>
            <li>Great retinol product that works without the extreme irritation of prescription retin</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference when it comes to fading scarring or anything, but that would probably take more time to clear up.  </li>
            <li>I like consistency-lightweight and absorbs quick, with no residue on the skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is more clear, smooth, and younger-looking.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh on my skin which is great because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I had ordered this and decided to try it before filling my script.</li>
            <li>If I try to skip a month, it&#x27;s back.&lt;br /&gt;There are other serums that I like to use better when I&#x27;m not worrying about the acne, but this has been the BEST thing for the acne and probably the #1 product that I could not live without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>dont try this for the first time before something important.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel 100% comfortable putting a cream on my face without knowing exactly what is in there...</li>
            <li>/&gt;That certainly makes BHT look even more appetizing to have in our food and in our cosmetics!</li>
            <li>As long as you follow the directions: only at night, remember to use sunscreen in the day, you should have great results too!</li>
            <li>After the first 2 weeks I noticed a significant difference in the brown spots on my face.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m using this, I have noticed that my skin is more &amp;#34;moist&amp;#34; &amp; shiney than it was before, which I don&#x27;t love because Obagi helped dry it up to begin with.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for reducing age spots and smoothing out little wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>No crazy peeling like I had with prescription</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to using really powerful stuff, so if you have sensitive skin or have never used a retinol before, then you will probably love it.</li>
            <li>but I did notice that I loved the way it made my skin feel: soft, smooth, and definitely youthful.</li>
            <li>The first night I used it my skin felt very smooth and soft by morning.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if actually does anything, but it feels so clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>As such, it is primarily used to prevent fats in foods from becoming rancid -</li>
            <li>A Clear Day\\&quot;, which is their retinol cream for acne-prone skin, thinking it would be better for me, as I have sensitive skin that tends to break out easily.  </li>
            <li>Philosophy products are of high quality and I feel that comfortable applying them to my skin.</li>
            <li>Although price is less, I would rather spend more to have a better effect.</li>
            <li>I barely even wear makeup any more.</li>
            <li>Apply this at night before bedtime and you will wake up with new skin!!!  </li>
            <li>Like this product very much.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 6 months and really see a difference!</li>
            <li>So I wasn&#x27;t able to use this for several months.</li>
            <li>I used it consistently for weeks according to the instructions, even using it twice a day when once a day wasn&#x27;t helping.  </li>
            <li>I found that I needed to use it fairly consistently, but did see results.  </li>
            <li>I had tons of white heads on my cheeks that I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid of and this did the trick.  </li>
            <li>Sure sounds like BHT is something that should definitely be in our food, right?&lt;br /&gt;Dangers of BHT</li>
            <li>I will finish this since it was so expensive and hope for the best.  </li>
            <li>most likely will try something stronger</li>
            <li>So we need to order more as I&#x27;m not giving what&#x27;s left</li>
            <li>A friend gave me my first tube of this</li>
            <li>Plus, the product WORKS and works really well, which I think makes it worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought that that meant it was working, but after 4 months, is has done nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>This cream works great without any irritation (at least for me).  </li>
            <li>This was my first time using retinol</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it was working until people started asking me what I was doing differently to my skin (i.e. drinking more water?</li>
            <li>Saw changes within the first 3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been almost 4 weeks since I started using this: my first time using a retinol product.</li>
            <li>Thanks Philosophy!</li>
            <li>More even, smaller pores, and helps with dryness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue using it and more than likely buy it again!</li>
            <li>Where was this when I was in high school?!!</li>
            <li>highly recommend shows improvement quickly</li>
            <li>So what kind of products, other than our food (it is FDA approved for use in food), can BHT be found in?&lt;br /&gt;Products Containing BHT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Help Me for a little over a week and have been very pleased with the fading of lines and discoloration on my face and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive/combination/dry/acne-prone skin, and I was looking for a miracle after experiencing my first intense breakout in years.</li>
            <li>while pricey, it will last you a good long time.</li>
            <li>I had a large age spot on my face which has disppeared after using Help Me every night.</li>
            <li>it will last a very long time, happy so far with the results.</li>
            <li>Used on my forehead and around the eyes and fine lines have definitely improved.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines are diminishing and my pores are smaller.  </li>
            <li>Before you buy a product, I highly suggest you check out lists like the one I referenced to see exactly what you are buying.</li>
            <li>recently had a child, and when preggo, retinol products are a huge no-no.</li>
            <li>Read great reviews about this, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>I really like this retinol night treatment.  </li>
            <li>I went with Philosophy because of their reputation and how gentle this product is supposed to be.</li>
            <li>If you have had cystic acne and know the pain associated with it, you know how much of a miracle it is to have it gone.</li>
            <li>It has curbed the breakouts again, and it has made the pigmentation fade so much faster too.</li>
            <li>But, the real eye-opener for me was the exfoliation.</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t really feel any smoother either.  </li>
            <li>After a couple months of using this product, my face is sooo much smoother.  </li>
            <li>-This product is basically a &#x27;gentle&#x27; chemical peel that sloughs off the outermost layer of your skin  Results:  </li>
            <li>No matter how much lotion</li>
            <li>Not irritating.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and tend to get breakouts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s much heavier and thicker</li>
            <li>and this stuff really does work for me.</li>
            <li>much either which is why I&#x27;m marking as just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really want to go to a dermatologist (no insurance), so I thought I&#x27;d try this.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to show up at law school with Myra still hanging about.</li>
            <li>I needed something reasonably priced that would help my skin and Help Me Retinol Night Treatment was the one for me.</li>
            <li>and I like to spend some money on my face, but not too much...  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin that is prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li>But, I was told this is a much milder concentration and releases the Retin A slowly, so it&#x27;s not as irritating.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped in a very timely manner and very affordable .</li>
            <li>I use this in combination with Purity Made Simple, Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash and oil free Hope in a Jar.</li>
            <li>It really does help in all the areas that I wanted to see results.</li>
            <li>I am very faithful about using it every night.  </li>
            <li>I THINK my adult breakouts are better, but I also cut out sugar at the same time I started this...</li>
            <li>Without it, the lines in my forehead become more pronounced and my face looks more tired.</li>
            <li>I will stop using it three days prior to waxing because my skin was more sensitive and the waxing burned my skin in the mustache and chin areas.  </li>
            <li>So many other night treatments are heavy feeling, this goes on smooth and light.</li>
            <li>While it might not be a high enough dosage for some, it is gentle enough to use every night and not cause ill-effects, so you kind of have to weigh your options with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used other products that seem to exfoliate or provide more skin regeneration.</li>
            <li>However, the first few days of use I was dissapointed because I was not seeing many results.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this in November to clear my skin and alleviate the acne-induced discolorations/texture issues, and, for two months, I used a pea-size amount on my face every night.  </li>
            <li>(the RX cream is quite thick and heavy), is gentle on your skin, but still delivers awesome results.  </li>
            <li>you will absolutely want to use sunscreen during the day, though; retinol can make you more sensitive to the sun so be careful!</li>
            <li>After about 2 weeks of use, I did notice that my skin looked more radiant and less oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent far more money on products that did nothing but irritate my face.  </li>
            <li>This is surely milder (minimal redness and burning), but it does the trick as far a pimple prevention, if you use it every day.</li>
            <li>firmness to the jawline also for the older crowd.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this does the job and is a decent price point.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Loreal Hip High Intensity Pigments</li>
            <li>but Id highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Just used this for a little over a month but friends and doc says I look so healthy.</li>
            <li>So I think the \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; is totally the better way to go, especially if you&#x27;re sensitive or oily and looking for something gentler that will still deliver noticeable results!</li>
            <li>-You can definitely see an improvement in your overall skin tone with this product - it makes sense that your skin looks better because it chemically removes the outer layer which of course a newer, fresher layer of skin will be less pigmented than old skin and look more \\&quot;vibrant\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>really helps keep my skin clear and glowing.</li>
            <li>I use just a dab at night, on clean, dry skin.</li>
            <li>would absolutely recommend this as a retinol treatment because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I thought maybe the formula might be too gentle for any results, but so far I do see a smoothing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but a few at age 32.  </li>
            <li>I use this a few nights a week (without adding a moisturizer on top -I</li>
            <li>In the past I have used Philosophy products and was always pleased - not so much with this product.</li>
            <li>i still had a few around my top lip but those are now also fading.</li>
            <li>This product helps with breakouts as well as lines such as those laugh lines around the mouth.</li>
            <li>What I was doing was washing with Purity at night, applying a thin layer of Help Me, and applying a good layer of Hope</li>
            <li>Definitely not as good as the more expensive creams or prescription creams, but it&#x27;s a very good &amp;#34;affordable&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It did not even my skin tone, make my pores appear smaller, or reduce the fine lines that are starting to appear on my forehead.</li>
            <li>I did have a few more cystic lumps break out in the first week or so, but I could tell overall that my skin was improving: smoother, cleaner, reduced scarring</li>
            <li>A friend recommended this to me, as I was looking for a new anti-aging night cream.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to live without it...</li>
            <li>I noticed a glow with my skin but the fact that I had new pimples every day didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>new cream?</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any burning or discomfort when applying it either (some retinol creams can burn or sting upon application, especially if you have sensitive or freshly waxed/shaved skin or something)</li>
            <li>- it really helps with acne (though I only have occasional mild acne</li>
            <li>You have to give it at least a month to be able to really judge if it has worked or not.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>-I would not recommend using this product in combination with self-tanners, especially when you first start using HelpMe.  </li>
            <li>and it was only a bit irritated for about 3 days after first using.</li>
            <li>yes I say melted because while I was noticing all the other benefits this cream gave me like smaller pores and more radiant skin</li>
            <li>If I have an early morning gym session I don&#x27;t even need to wash my face or use tinted moisturizer!</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;e read that retinol is very unstable in general, so I wouldn&#x27;t apply it with anything else.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a pretty big difference in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had pretty moderate acne since I was 12 years old</li>
            <li>I noticed results right away, within the first few days, and I&#x27;ll never be without this product again.  </li>
            <li>, this lotion is enough to handle mild to moderate dryness) and have not had any redness, irritation, peeling, breakouts-</li>
            <li>Out of desperation I recently went to a dermatologist who was quick to prescribe me a $400 cream with several side effects (my insurance would have made it $40)</li>
            <li>It is not too strong or harsh on my face and believe me I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I have fine lines, large pores, occasional acne and uneven skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li>The Skin Deep site rates BHT as having a \\&quot;high hazard to high hazard depending on product usage\\&quot; and says it has been shown to be linked to cancer, developmental toxicity, allergies, neurotoxicity, endocrine disruption, biochemical or cellular level changes.</li>
            <li>Was previously opened and not in original box.</li>
            <li>Although slightly pricy this product is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>and was using a prescription-level retinol that only really worked at certain times of the month, when my stress levels were low, when the moon was aligned with Venus, etc.</li>
            <li>But, it has seemed to clear up some roughness on my chin that exfoliators haven&#x27;t cleared up.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d definitely recommend using it VERY sparingly until your skin adjusts.</li>
            <li>I really like all the retinol products and think they help with my skin especially the adult acne breakouts that I have once in a while.</li>
            <li>My skin looks clear and brighter since I began using this product.</li>
            <li>Does wonders  for ones skin and works well for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>only 26, so I don&#x27;t have any lines or wrinkles to really give an opinion on the anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li>no dead skin feel at all.</li>
            <li>As far as working on lines I don&#x27;t know yet, but retinol is known for that job and probably I&#x27;ll see it overtime.</li>
            <li>Aveeno Baby Natural Protection</li>
            <li>CVS Beauty Bars Sensitive Skin&lt;br</li>
            <li>Who wants to use a product or eat a food that has ingredients also used in jet fuels and embalming fluid?</li>
            <li>This has led to creating lines in my face at a young age.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with adult acne for years.</li>
            <li>It made my skin soft and clear.  </li>
            <li>and I have already noticed a marked improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>another!it has transformed my acne prone, oily, almost-thirty year old skin.</li>
            <li>The RX cream is stronger so if you use it too frequently, you will peel and get irritated.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still waiting for them to heal completely.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and improves the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I now believe this is because, according to what I&#x27;ve read,  Alpha Hydroxy Acids deactivate retinol, and as far as I know HIAJ contains AHAs.</li>
            <li>At 29 years old, my skin went south.  </li>
            <li>A Clear Day\\&quot; actually contains MORE moisturizing ingredients than \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; does (one of them being hyaluronic acid) which makes no sense, as it&#x27;s for acne prone skin (which you&#x27;d think would need LESS moisturization)!  </li>
            <li>I woke up the next morning with crystal clear, glowing skin!!!</li>
            <li>If I feel a massive pimple about to emerge on my face, I simply dab some of this on and it clears it right up.</li>
            <li>As much as I hate not washing my face in the AM, my skin looks amazing if I just leave it as it is, applying only a high SPF on top for the day.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of applying every night when I first purchased this product because I wasn&#x27;t having any dry skin problems or irritation - well after about a week</li>
            <li>I had a small brown aging spot on my cheeck that is gone now, fine lines have disappeared and my neck tone is firmer.  </li>
            <li>I struggled for so long, and I have finally found a retinol product worth its weight in gold.  </li>
            <li>No odd smells.</li>
            <li>I wish I had know the magic equation (at least &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; for me) of clearing my moderate, cystic adult acne sooner: create a regimen of salicylic, glycolic and retinol products (and get rid of the benzoyl peroxide 2.5%)!</li>
            <li>Use a high factor sunscreen when using this product (rain, shine, inside, outside).</li>
            <li>use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying a soothing night cream to help calm my skin down.  </li>
            <li>felt compelled to write an update as I feel, recently, that I&#x27;ve seen new benefits.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t prescription strength while I knew, but I didn&#x27;t really see any results, good or bad.  </li>
            <li>When I use up the tube I have, I plan to move on to a prescription-strength cream (Retin-A) that my doc prescribed for me, so I most likely won&#x27;t repurchase the \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot;, at least not for a while.  </li>
            <li>This product truly helps with the hard to erase fine lines (forehead, 11 lines, and under eye lines).</li>
            <li>I would recommend anyone suffering from acne to give it a try, although I know it isn&#x27;t likely to work for other people, it did for me, so I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>great for those who still suffer from acne and bad skin well into after their 20s.</li>
            <li>my skin isn&#x27;t as soft he next day.  </li>
            <li>off using this product only a few times a week - gradually increasing usage if you see no bad side effects  </li>
            <li>My skin became very sore and dry after the second</li>
            <li>The product does minimize fine lines in the eye area and the amount you use is small, so the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li>my skin all of the sudden was VERY dry and VERY PEELY.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to get this product, I need retinol plus the other ingredients like C and peptides</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day on my face (my T section is always really oily than other part of my face).</li>
            <li>It does not dry my face out or cause redness.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m young, so i don&#x27;t have much in the way of fine lines, but i have noticed that the crease lines in my foreheard are looking a little smoother-nothing dramatic though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(yes, the tube lasts a long time, as you don&#x27;t need much at once) on a dark area on my face, but I haven&#x27;t seen anything major.  </li>
            <li>I am in my late 20&#x27;s and even though this product is on the expensive side, I will keep purchasing it (and my other daily Philosophy products) because I think that good skin care is worth the investment.</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin and, other than the initial peeling, i&#x27;ve had no issues with the product.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> It is excellent and I will always buy it.</li>

            <li> Just perfectly moisturized, glowy skin!  </li>
            <li> and the body lotions (which leave you dewy, glowy, and smelling great)!  </li>
            <li> so it would probably not be best for oilier skins.  </li>

            <li> Love this cream, works wonders on my skin!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I so hoped this would be an effective cream for me, but it just hasn&#x27;t been.  </li>
            <li> This is an effective product.</li>
            <li> And most people said it is good for the people between 25 to 30.</li>
            <li> really works and great price on amazon!!</li>
            <li> One friend, who is very concerned and knowledgable about her skin, was so impressed with the improvement in my skin that she asked me to get a tube for her.  </li>
            <li> I am really loving this night-time treatment.</li>
            <li> Me a whirl after reading the reviews, and made myself use it for five or six weeks before writing my own review.</li>
            <li> This product feels very nice going on and is comfortable to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and will continue to use it and would recommend it to everyone, especially us Super Senior folks.....</li>
            <li> Philosophy&#x27;s \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; is by far the best retinol skin cream I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I also liked this a lot better because the two combined was making my skin too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am in my early 50s, Philosophy products are wonderful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the original link from the website \\&quot;The Good Human\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I have to say I have fewer fine wrinkles, I don&#x27;t need foundation except for special events, I am told how great my skin looks by my cosmetologist.  </li>
            <li> The facial moisturizer is great (though smells funny after application), as are the body washes (which smell great and can multitask!)</li>
            <li> But any retinol product is proven to benefit aging skin, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> So glad I can still find it.</li>
            <li> You can spot use it, but works best on entire face.  </li>
            <li> I got better results with the dermalogica overnight clearing gel.  </li>
            <li> For what I paid for the \\&quot;help me\\&quot;, I was expecting a lot more out of this product</li>
            <li> At my age, it don&#x27;t get better than that.  </li>
            <li> Also drinking more water helps too.  </li>
            <li> love love love lovel lve  </li>
            <li> Not any more now that I have found this cream :-)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more of an issue with Retin-A for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> It also makes my skin look more luminous.</li>
            <li> , I bought this more for acne but</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> Just make sure you use a moisturizer like it instructs you to do.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the better retinol night creams out there.</li>
            <li> Love Philosophy products.</li>
            <li> I love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> From the moment I started using the \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot;, my skin has been getting better and better.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;ve finished my tube of \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; and began using prescription Retin-A</li>
            <li> It has a much better texture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my husband loves.  </li>
            <li> It might work better for others</li>
            <li> , I would still bet this would help with more stubborn and severe forms).</li>
            <li> Love love love.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that it works a bit better for me.</li>
            <li> I think she love it.</li>
            <li> My skin has been looking better.</li>
            <li> but I love the product for what it does.</li>
            <li> I want to try more of their products.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t recall whether or not I was satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> eating more vegetables?  </li>
            <li> exercising more?).  </li>
            <li> Love it-</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had better looking skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know why it wasn&#x27;t working, so I decided to try it by itself without HIAJ on top.</li>
            <li> Perhaps do an experiment one night leaving out your HIAJ and see if you get better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> mirror-- with the sun on my face and about wrecked the car-- most of my wrinkles were GONE.</li>
            <li> It is softer, smoother, and more even.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> gentle on my skin (no break outs or irritation) yet very effective on my melasma.</li>
            <li> I wish I could see more of a difference with fine lines around my eyes, but I have seen some improvement.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products hoping they will help hydrate and work on fine lines....</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and it is totally worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this will be more useful to me as my skin starts to age more, but I&#x27;m 28 and people still mistake me for 18...</li>
            <li> This is a great product for even my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I loved it so much I bought</li>
            <li> A great product that I completely recommend to anyone looking for a highly effective, yet gentle, retinol cream!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found using it every other day is best, or else my skin gets used to it and stops seeing results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this is as effective, but I think if I had tried this one first I would have loved it just as much.</li>
            <li> My skin reacts easily to lotions and creams, either by rash or breaking out.  </li>
            <li> Very quickly afterward, my skin improved.</li>
            <li> I have debated about diving into the retinol pool, but \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; made the dive easy.</li>
            <li> my acne scars are clearing, my tone is more even, and i rarely ever break out any more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s a list of some pretty popular products, all of which require you to wonder what is BHT and why you should be avoiding it.</li>
            <li> My fine lines and pores still appear as they did before.  </li>
            <li> Lighten your skin and takes away fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s fine, but I do use moisturizer with sunscreen every morning too.</li>
            <li> I guess I will never know if it reduces fine lines or removes brown spots.  </li>
            <li> Super product!</li>
            <li> Skin feels bright, soft and when make up applied it glides on!  </li>
            <li> Just follow the instructions and see fantastic results.  </li>
            <li> i did this of course the night before an important event and had to go with a rash.</li>
            <li> started using this again at night, and in the morning my skin is soooo amazingly smooth...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  Lubriderm Advanced Therapy Lotion Moisturizing Lotion</li>
            <li> It works much better than the Roc products, so the price difference is worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with product.</li>
            <li> Goes on clean and easy.</li>
            <li> It is relatively cheap for a retinol product compared to prescription creams like RetinA</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to know that it should be applied , then followed by a moisturizer, ESP at night if rapid results are anticipated.  </li>
            <li> Help me really does what it says and more.. not like most creams.</li>
            <li> This product replaced the now discontinued On a Clear Day retinol treatment, which I absolutely loved.</li>
            <li> A good alternative to On a Clear Day,</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product but after 3 weeks of using it at night I had more pimples than I had when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> I then decided to try the Philosophy clear days ahead system after hearing good things.  </li>
            <li> Always make sure to use w/ a moisturizer right after application</li>
            <li> It has significantly reduced the appearance of my pores and my skin is so smooth.  </li>
            <li> Skin Is In&amp;#34; for combination skin kit (which is unfortunately no longer available) and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Retin A.....I know, probably not as effective, but I look less reptilian, so I&#x27;m good with it.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Originally I&#x27;d purchased Philosophy&#x27;s \\&quot;On</li>
            <li> I also love that it was MUCH cheaper on Amazon than at Sephora!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am pretty satisfied with this for the $ I paid.</li>
            <li> During that time, my skin got significantly clearer/brighter without any retinol-induced irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other retinol products and none makes my skin look as good!  </li>
            <li> (twenty years of fun!)</li>
            <li> I love retinol , seems to be something that really works for fine lines and wrinkles .</li>
            <li> In addition, it minimizes the appearance of pores, helps keep my mild acne at bay and keeps my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> It speeds cellular turnover and honestly works as well as Retin-A worked for me as a teen but is more gentle to skin and feels more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> sure you use with a lotion as it&#x27;s very drying on the skin  </li>
            <li> i have used better i am not noticing much of a difference and its been over 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s gentle for a retinol product.</li>
            <li> Great retinol product that works without the extreme irritation of prescription retin</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference when it comes to fading scarring or anything, but that would probably take more time to clear up.  </li>
            <li> I like consistency-lightweight and absorbs quick, with no residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is more clear, smooth, and younger-looking.</li>
            <li> It is not harsh on my skin which is great because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I had ordered this and decided to try it before filling my script.</li>
            <li> If I try to skip a month, it&#x27;s back.&lt;br /&gt;There are other serums that I like to use better when I&#x27;m not worrying about the acne, but this has been the BEST thing for the acne and probably the #1 product that I could not live without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> dont try this for the first time before something important.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel 100% comfortable putting a cream on my face without knowing exactly what is in there...</li>
            <li> /&gt;That certainly makes BHT look even more appetizing to have in our food and in our cosmetics!</li>
            <li> As long as you follow the directions: only at night, remember to use sunscreen in the day, you should have great results too!</li>
            <li> After the first 2 weeks I noticed a significant difference in the brown spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m using this, I have noticed that my skin is more &amp;#34;moist&amp;#34; &amp; shiney than it was before, which I don&#x27;t love because Obagi helped dry it up to begin with.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for reducing age spots and smoothing out little wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> No crazy peeling like I had with prescription</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using really powerful stuff, so if you have sensitive skin or have never used a retinol before, then you will probably love it.</li>
            <li> but I did notice that I loved the way it made my skin feel: soft, smooth, and definitely youthful.</li>
            <li> The first night I used it my skin felt very smooth and soft by morning.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if actually does anything, but it feels so clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> As such, it is primarily used to prevent fats in foods from becoming rancid -</li>
            <li> A Clear Day\\&quot;, which is their retinol cream for acne-prone skin, thinking it would be better for me, as I have sensitive skin that tends to break out easily.  </li>
            <li> Philosophy products are of high quality and I feel that comfortable applying them to my skin.</li>
            <li> Although price is less, I would rather spend more to have a better effect.</li>
            <li> I barely even wear makeup any more.</li>
            <li> Apply this at night before bedtime and you will wake up with new skin!!!  </li>
            <li> Like this product very much.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 6 months and really see a difference!</li>
            <li> So I wasn&#x27;t able to use this for several months.</li>
            <li> I used it consistently for weeks according to the instructions, even using it twice a day when once a day wasn&#x27;t helping.  </li>
            <li> I found that I needed to use it fairly consistently, but did see results.  </li>
            <li> I had tons of white heads on my cheeks that I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid of and this did the trick.  </li>
            <li> Sure sounds like BHT is something that should definitely be in our food, right?&lt;br /&gt;Dangers of BHT</li>
            <li> I will finish this since it was so expensive and hope for the best.  </li>
            <li> most likely will try something stronger</li>
            <li> So we need to order more as I&#x27;m not giving what&#x27;s left</li>
            <li> A friend gave me my first tube of this</li>
            <li> Plus, the product WORKS and works really well, which I think makes it worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought that that meant it was working, but after 4 months, is has done nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> This cream works great without any irritation (at least for me).  </li>
            <li> This was my first time using retinol</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was working until people started asking me what I was doing differently to my skin (i.e. drinking more water?</li>
            <li> Saw changes within the first 3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost 4 weeks since I started using this: my first time using a retinol product.</li>
            <li> Thanks Philosophy!</li>
            <li> More even, smaller pores, and helps with dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue using it and more than likely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Where was this when I was in high school?!!</li>
            <li> highly recommend shows improvement quickly</li>
            <li> So what kind of products, other than our food (it is FDA approved for use in food), can BHT be found in?&lt;br /&gt;Products Containing BHT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Help Me for a little over a week and have been very pleased with the fading of lines and discoloration on my face and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive/combination/dry/acne-prone skin, and I was looking for a miracle after experiencing my first intense breakout in years.</li>
            <li> while pricey, it will last you a good long time.</li>
            <li> I had a large age spot on my face which has disppeared after using Help Me every night.</li>
            <li> it will last a very long time, happy so far with the results.</li>
            <li> Used on my forehead and around the eyes and fine lines have definitely improved.  </li>
            <li> My fine lines are diminishing and my pores are smaller.  </li>
            <li> Before you buy a product, I highly suggest you check out lists like the one I referenced to see exactly what you are buying.</li>
            <li> recently had a child, and when preggo, retinol products are a huge no-no.</li>
            <li> Read great reviews about this, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> I really like this retinol night treatment.  </li>
            <li> I went with Philosophy because of their reputation and how gentle this product is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> If you have had cystic acne and know the pain associated with it, you know how much of a miracle it is to have it gone.</li>
            <li> It has curbed the breakouts again, and it has made the pigmentation fade so much faster too.</li>
            <li> But, the real eye-opener for me was the exfoliation.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t really feel any smoother either.  </li>
            <li> After a couple months of using this product, my face is sooo much smoother.  </li>
            <li> -This product is basically a &#x27;gentle&#x27; chemical peel that sloughs off the outermost layer of your skin  Results:  </li>
            <li> No matter how much lotion</li>
            <li> Not irritating.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and tend to get breakouts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s much heavier and thicker</li>
            <li> and this stuff really does work for me.</li>
            <li> much either which is why I&#x27;m marking as just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really want to go to a dermatologist (no insurance), so I thought I&#x27;d try this.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to show up at law school with Myra still hanging about.</li>
            <li> I needed something reasonably priced that would help my skin and Help Me Retinol Night Treatment was the one for me.</li>
            <li> and I like to spend some money on my face, but not too much...  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin that is prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> But, I was told this is a much milder concentration and releases the Retin A slowly, so it&#x27;s not as irritating.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped in a very timely manner and very affordable .</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with Purity Made Simple, Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash and oil free Hope in a Jar.</li>
            <li> It really does help in all the areas that I wanted to see results.</li>
            <li> I am very faithful about using it every night.  </li>
            <li> I THINK my adult breakouts are better, but I also cut out sugar at the same time I started this...</li>
            <li> Without it, the lines in my forehead become more pronounced and my face looks more tired.</li>
            <li> I will stop using it three days prior to waxing because my skin was more sensitive and the waxing burned my skin in the mustache and chin areas.  </li>
            <li> So many other night treatments are heavy feeling, this goes on smooth and light.</li>
            <li> While it might not be a high enough dosage for some, it is gentle enough to use every night and not cause ill-effects, so you kind of have to weigh your options with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other products that seem to exfoliate or provide more skin regeneration.</li>
            <li> However, the first few days of use I was dissapointed because I was not seeing many results.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this in November to clear my skin and alleviate the acne-induced discolorations/texture issues, and, for two months, I used a pea-size amount on my face every night.  </li>
            <li> (the RX cream is quite thick and heavy), is gentle on your skin, but still delivers awesome results.  </li>
            <li> you will absolutely want to use sunscreen during the day, though; retinol can make you more sensitive to the sun so be careful!</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks of use, I did notice that my skin looked more radiant and less oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent far more money on products that did nothing but irritate my face.  </li>
            <li> This is surely milder (minimal redness and burning), but it does the trick as far a pimple prevention, if you use it every day.</li>
            <li> firmness to the jawline also for the older crowd.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this does the job and is a decent price point.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Loreal Hip High Intensity Pigments</li>
            <li> but Id highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just used this for a little over a month but friends and doc says I look so healthy.</li>
            <li> So I think the \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; is totally the better way to go, especially if you&#x27;re sensitive or oily and looking for something gentler that will still deliver noticeable results!</li>
            <li> -You can definitely see an improvement in your overall skin tone with this product - it makes sense that your skin looks better because it chemically removes the outer layer which of course a newer, fresher layer of skin will be less pigmented than old skin and look more \\&quot;vibrant\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> really helps keep my skin clear and glowing.</li>
            <li> I use just a dab at night, on clean, dry skin.</li>
            <li> would absolutely recommend this as a retinol treatment because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I thought maybe the formula might be too gentle for any results, but so far I do see a smoothing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but a few at age 32.  </li>
            <li> I use this a few nights a week (without adding a moisturizer on top -I</li>
            <li> In the past I have used Philosophy products and was always pleased - not so much with this product.</li>
            <li> i still had a few around my top lip but those are now also fading.</li>
            <li> This product helps with breakouts as well as lines such as those laugh lines around the mouth.</li>
            <li> What I was doing was washing with Purity at night, applying a thin layer of Help Me, and applying a good layer of Hope</li>
            <li> Definitely not as good as the more expensive creams or prescription creams, but it&#x27;s a very good &amp;#34;affordable&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It did not even my skin tone, make my pores appear smaller, or reduce the fine lines that are starting to appear on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I did have a few more cystic lumps break out in the first week or so, but I could tell overall that my skin was improving: smoother, cleaner, reduced scarring</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to me, as I was looking for a new anti-aging night cream.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to live without it...</li>
            <li> I noticed a glow with my skin but the fact that I had new pimples every day didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> new cream?</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any burning or discomfort when applying it either (some retinol creams can burn or sting upon application, especially if you have sensitive or freshly waxed/shaved skin or something)</li>
            <li> - it really helps with acne (though I only have occasional mild acne</li>
            <li> You have to give it at least a month to be able to really judge if it has worked or not.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> -I would not recommend using this product in combination with self-tanners, especially when you first start using HelpMe.  </li>
            <li> and it was only a bit irritated for about 3 days after first using.</li>
            <li> yes I say melted because while I was noticing all the other benefits this cream gave me like smaller pores and more radiant skin</li>
            <li> If I have an early morning gym session I don&#x27;t even need to wash my face or use tinted moisturizer!</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;e read that retinol is very unstable in general, so I wouldn&#x27;t apply it with anything else.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a pretty big difference in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had pretty moderate acne since I was 12 years old</li>
            <li> I noticed results right away, within the first few days, and I&#x27;ll never be without this product again.  </li>
            <li> , this lotion is enough to handle mild to moderate dryness) and have not had any redness, irritation, peeling, breakouts-</li>
            <li> Out of desperation I recently went to a dermatologist who was quick to prescribe me a $400 cream with several side effects (my insurance would have made it $40)</li>
            <li> It is not too strong or harsh on my face and believe me I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I have fine lines, large pores, occasional acne and uneven skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li> The Skin Deep site rates BHT as having a \\&quot;high hazard to high hazard depending on product usage\\&quot; and says it has been shown to be linked to cancer, developmental toxicity, allergies, neurotoxicity, endocrine disruption, biochemical or cellular level changes.</li>
            <li> Was previously opened and not in original box.</li>
            <li> Although slightly pricy this product is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> and was using a prescription-level retinol that only really worked at certain times of the month, when my stress levels were low, when the moon was aligned with Venus, etc.</li>
            <li> But, it has seemed to clear up some roughness on my chin that exfoliators haven&#x27;t cleared up.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d definitely recommend using it VERY sparingly until your skin adjusts.</li>
            <li> I really like all the retinol products and think they help with my skin especially the adult acne breakouts that I have once in a while.</li>
            <li> My skin looks clear and brighter since I began using this product.</li>
            <li> Does wonders  for ones skin and works well for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> only 26, so I don&#x27;t have any lines or wrinkles to really give an opinion on the anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li> no dead skin feel at all.</li>
            <li> As far as working on lines I don&#x27;t know yet, but retinol is known for that job and probably I&#x27;ll see it overtime.</li>
            <li> Aveeno Baby Natural Protection</li>
            <li> CVS Beauty Bars Sensitive Skin&lt;br</li>
            <li> Who wants to use a product or eat a food that has ingredients also used in jet fuels and embalming fluid?</li>
            <li> This has led to creating lines in my face at a young age.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with adult acne for years.</li>
            <li> It made my skin soft and clear.  </li>
            <li> and I have already noticed a marked improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> another!it has transformed my acne prone, oily, almost-thirty year old skin.</li>
            <li> The RX cream is stronger so if you use it too frequently, you will peel and get irritated.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still waiting for them to heal completely.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and improves the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I now believe this is because, according to what I&#x27;ve read,  Alpha Hydroxy Acids deactivate retinol, and as far as I know HIAJ contains AHAs.</li>
            <li> At 29 years old, my skin went south.  </li>
            <li> A Clear Day\\&quot; actually contains MORE moisturizing ingredients than \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; does (one of them being hyaluronic acid) which makes no sense, as it&#x27;s for acne prone skin (which you&#x27;d think would need LESS moisturization)!  </li>
            <li> I woke up the next morning with crystal clear, glowing skin!!!</li>
            <li> If I feel a massive pimple about to emerge on my face, I simply dab some of this on and it clears it right up.</li>
            <li> As much as I hate not washing my face in the AM, my skin looks amazing if I just leave it as it is, applying only a high SPF on top for the day.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of applying every night when I first purchased this product because I wasn&#x27;t having any dry skin problems or irritation - well after about a week</li>
            <li> I had a small brown aging spot on my cheeck that is gone now, fine lines have disappeared and my neck tone is firmer.  </li>
            <li> I struggled for so long, and I have finally found a retinol product worth its weight in gold.  </li>
            <li> No odd smells.</li>
            <li> I wish I had know the magic equation (at least &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; for me) of clearing my moderate, cystic adult acne sooner: create a regimen of salicylic, glycolic and retinol products (and get rid of the benzoyl peroxide 2.5%)!</li>
            <li> Use a high factor sunscreen when using this product (rain, shine, inside, outside).</li>
            <li> use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying a soothing night cream to help calm my skin down.  </li>
            <li> felt compelled to write an update as I feel, recently, that I&#x27;ve seen new benefits.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t prescription strength while I knew, but I didn&#x27;t really see any results, good or bad.  </li>
            <li> When I use up the tube I have, I plan to move on to a prescription-strength cream (Retin-A) that my doc prescribed for me, so I most likely won&#x27;t repurchase the \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot;, at least not for a while.  </li>
            <li> This product truly helps with the hard to erase fine lines (forehead, 11 lines, and under eye lines).</li>
            <li> I would recommend anyone suffering from acne to give it a try, although I know it isn&#x27;t likely to work for other people, it did for me, so I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> great for those who still suffer from acne and bad skin well into after their 20s.</li>
            <li> my skin isn&#x27;t as soft he next day.  </li>
            <li> off using this product only a few times a week - gradually increasing usage if you see no bad side effects  </li>
            <li> My skin became very sore and dry after the second</li>
            <li> The product does minimize fine lines in the eye area and the amount you use is small, so the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> my skin all of the sudden was VERY dry and VERY PEELY.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to get this product, I need retinol plus the other ingredients like C and peptides</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day on my face (my T section is always really oily than other part of my face).</li>
            <li> It does not dry my face out or cause redness.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m young, so i don&#x27;t have much in the way of fine lines, but i have noticed that the crease lines in my foreheard are looking a little smoother-nothing dramatic though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (yes, the tube lasts a long time, as you don&#x27;t need much at once) on a dark area on my face, but I haven&#x27;t seen anything major.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and even though this product is on the expensive side, I will keep purchasing it (and my other daily Philosophy products) because I think that good skin care is worth the investment.</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin and, other than the initial peeling, i&#x27;ve had no issues with the product.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I would suggest every other day.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but this has never made me peel like other retinols.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many retinol creams, I usually use obagi&#x27;s tretonion cream but couldn&#x27;t get to my usual spa to get it so decided to try this item, I have been using it nightly for almost a month, I have oily acnetic skin and have a medium skin tone, this retinol cream has helped clear my skin, it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin like other retinols in the market, I have noticed a difference with my skin.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m on my second tube) and the dark spot on my forehead has almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> Butylated Hydroxytoluene, or BHT, is an anti-oxidant which reacts with oxygen free radicals to slow down the autoxidation rate of ingredients in a product that can cause changes in the taste or color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearing 70 years old, typically experts only review results for 40</li>
            <li> The real test was during my PMS, when I usually break out - however, those tricky hormonal times have come and gone with no breakout whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I am not sure it real deal.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it on my face and the back of my hands for two months, which is how long the tube lasted.  </li>
            <li> I did not have redness or any flaking (but I had been using a glycolic acid peel for a few months previous to starting this product so my skin is pretty sturdy).</li>
            <li> Warnings:  -USE SPARINGLY at first - even if you don&#x27;t see any negative side effects the first night you use it and your face doesn&#x27;t feel dry, STILL start out using this slowly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And that will do it for my long winded review.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money for me</li>
            <li> Has helped me with the circles and wrinkles around my eyes...lasts for a long time...</li>
            <li> And these results are continuing, as long as I apply it by itself.</li>
            <li> After about a month and a half of daily use, I had to stop due to insistent patches of extreme dryness/flakiness around my mouth and chin and a major pimple that migrated to different locations on my face but refused to disappear.  </li>
            <li> I am posting this article here for other people who feel the same way I do and for others not aware of the potential problems with \\&quot;BHT\\&quot;  skin care lines.</li>
            <li> Yes, but they are not the deep, painful ones and there are not as many.</li>
            <li> - doesn&#x27;t even dry it</li>
            <li> because I have dry</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like the prescription strength</li>
            <li> , hasn&#x27;t caused a single break out</li>
            <li> as a 35yr old I also have some small wrinkles, I saw no difference in wrinkles at all.</li>
            <li> Giant zits near my mouth, worse during PMS, present all the rest of the time.</li>
            <li> A little goes long way, and this tube is going to last me forever.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but a little does go a long way, so depending on how often you use it, it could last you for a while.  </li>
            <li> After about a month, I realized that my skin was dull and not as clear as it had been.  </li>
            <li> I have had acne for years and still frequently break out in my late 20s now.</li>
            <li> Because of the moisturizer mixed in it isn&#x27;t quite as harsh on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I never really noticed before.</li>
            <li> Just be careful, gradually increase application and don&#x27;t use in combination with self tanner</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different ones, in all price ranges)!  </li>
            <li> but those I had tried dried my skin and made it red and flaky.</li>
            <li> You will notice an improvement in just a few days after starting to use it.</li>
            <li> that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t see results, plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> it helped dry up the refinery &amp; toned down the breakouts.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way, so</li>
            <li> ive been taking benedryl and other allergy meds to keep me from scratching.</li>
            <li> Price:  -Around $45 on Amazon and other retailers/</li>
            <li> -Can get cheaper if you get it in a package skin care set with other Philosophy products  How to use:  </li>
            <li> I gave this a one star rating due to the BHT chemical in this</li>
            <li> Use this every night after cleansing ... apply a small amount and mix with facial moisturizer to avoid any irritation.  </li>
            <li> are some other tips.</li>
            <li> I reviewed other people&#x27;s reviews and decided to give a try.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really vouch for its line-reduction qualities as I didn&#x27;t really have any to start with (one of the trade-offs of oily skin: stupid breakouts, but no wrinkles)</li>
            <li> post-partum skin wasn&#x27;t &#x27;dry&#x27;, but I&#x27;d get a build up of dead skin (you know how you can just feel it?)</li>
            <li> I had to purchase it again because after I stopped using it for a few weeks, my skin became dry and scaly again.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It usually takes about 6 to 8 weeks for a product like this to show signs of effectiveness and I haven&#x27;t been using it for that long.</li>
            <li> I have used this religiously for the past few weeks, and I don&#x27;t see any difference.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, you don&#x27;t get a whole lot</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in your late twenties/early thirties and are still struggling with breakouts, I cannot recommend this stuff enough.</li>
            <li> I hope it was not counterfeit like my other product I purchased!</li>
            <li> back.&lt;br /&gt;You apply this AFTER your moisturizer at night or may cause slight redness when in sun.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get results and it costs less than this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> Less lines and less breakouts as well.</li>
            <li> Due to the effect of peeling skin, even when you use in combination with a lotion this can create very uneven skin texture as some of the &#x27;tanned&#x27; skin will peel off before other parts  Recommend to a friend?  </li>
            <li> I could only use it every other night without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> It  may have softened them a little</li>
            <li> Granted, I think it&#x27;s a little too pricey.</li>
            <li> a. A little dryness but still tolerated well</li>
            <li> This was not too harsh .</li>
            <li> I go a few nights without using it, I see a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few months now</li>
            <li> It did seem to make your skin seem fresher for myself (50+) and DD (21) also found it helped give a balance to her uneven oily/dryer areas.&lt;br /&gt;Adds</li>
            <li> All I have to compare this to is the prescription strength retinol cream from a few years ago, but I have to say it&#x27;s made a difference in my skin without drying it out for days like the prescription did.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> My cystic acne disappeared and the dark scaring caused by the past few years of severe acne are gone.  </li>
            <li> I once had is just plain GONE.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even occur to me that it was this product until there were a few nights that I was too lazy to put it on</li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of scrunching my face - when in conversation, outside in the sun, or when deep in thought.</li>
            <li> I use this every night followed by nightamins by Origins and always wake up to refreshed glowing skin, no matter how little sleep I get!</li>
            <li> a small amount  -Start</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it did anything.</li>
            <li> this additive, used in all the above products, has a scary MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet)</li>
            <li> Not sure what I am suppose to be seeing</li>
            <li> I have some scarring, I&#x27;m not sure it has lightened them yet.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Finally got off the pill at around 23 or 24, and then my whole face went insane.</li>
            <li> i used this for the first time this week and have a really bad rash yesterday that is even worse today.  </li>
            <li> As a general rule though, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with Philosophy products!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since resumed sugar &amp; my skin did get a little worse, but not as funky as it was before.</li>
            <li> A Clear Day\\&quot; made a horrible mess of my skin, I was broken out, oily, and gross.  </li>
            <li> However, if I am unhappy with the results the Retin-A gives me or if it disagrees with my skin, I will absolutely go back to using the \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; instead!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would have clear skin again without expensive dermatologist intervention, but this product proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> This cream seems to be undoing some of my past neglect!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product, however, it broke me out horribly.</li>
            <li> and you will see subtle changes over time.</li>
            <li> Seriously a miracle product.</li>
            <li> This makes make-up application very difficult and uneven, plus it can be a little embarrassing  </li>
            <li> really bad, and even though I used the microdelivery exfoliation wash religiously every morning, it wasn&#x27;t even making a dent in the dead-skin layer, no matter how long/hard</li>
            <li> I returned that cream and exchanged it for the \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; (even though a part of me was thinking I should try a different product line altogether, due to my awful experience).  </li>
            <li> so I purchase this product and lo and behold the bump slowly melted away!</li>
            <li> i cant believe it&#x27;s just gotten worse with time.  </li>
            <li> Non irritating, did it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li> I have not seen a dramatic difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It does make my face a little oily but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I had used prescription Retin A in the past and it dried out my skin terribly.  </li>
            <li> Do not use without the moisturizer as a base, it may prove too harsh.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive, so just take a risk.  </li>
            <li> I am serious!!</li>
            <li> was just peeling off like crazy,</li>
            <li> so weird!).</li>
            <li> But boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> You led me wrong on this one, Dr. Oz!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 26 and HAD bad cystic acne), and she had asked me if I was using a retinol product, and I told her no.</li>
            <li> BHT is bad news, and there are plenty of ways to avoid consuming it.</li>
            <li> again disappointed in another product......................  </li>
            <li> If I wash, it sometimes looks as if I washed all the benefits off. :(</li>
            <li> my skin looks horrible!  </li>
            <li> as if I had a gotten a terrible sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I used it for about 3 weeks and all I got were the worst pimples I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it beyond a week because of how horrible the breakout was.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A friend recommended this to me, as I was looking for a new anti-aging night cream.  I have never used a retinol product before but immediately saw and felt results.  Used on my forehead and around the eyes and fine lines have definitely improved.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great.  Because of the moisturizer mixed in it isn&#x27;t quite as harsh on your skin.  Really works. I use it every night.</li>
            <li> I think the world of this product. Does wonders  for ones skin and works well for people with sensitive skin. I am hooked on it.</li>
            <li> I really like this retinol night treatment.  Just follow the instructions and see fantastic results.  It has become part of my daily regime and I will always use it.  It doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate.  Use it before bed time and see youthful results in the morning.</li>
            <li> I like Philosophy&#x27;s products because they always try to improve their products all the time</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 6 months and really see a difference! My skin is smoother, pores smaller, and brighter skin. I use it every night! If you have sensitive skin, I would suggest every other day.</li>
            <li> I love retinol , seems to be something that really works for fine lines and wrinkles . This was not too harsh .</li>
            <li> i used this for the first time this week and have a really bad rash yesterday that is even worse today.  i also bought the bliss mask.  so, im still debating whether or not it is the help me or the bliss mask.  my skin looks horrible!  i did this of course the night before an important event and had to go with a rash. dont try this for the first time before something important.  ive been taking benedryl and other allergy meds to keep me from scratching. may have to make a trip to the dermatologist&#x27;s office now.  i cant believe it&#x27;s just gotten worse with time.  ughhhh!</li>
            <li> Now, I must admit my use of this is a bit unconventional. I happened to see my Doc one day about my acne issues (I&#x27;m 26 and HAD bad cystic acne), and she had asked me if I was using a retinol product, and I told her no. And so I got to thinking and looking into them. I went with Philosophy because of their reputation and how gentle this product is supposed to be. Anyhow, I got it home and (I don&#x27;t remember when it started), but my cystic acne break outs started to decrease, then started to disappear. It didn&#x27;t even occur to me that it was this product until there were a few nights that I was too lazy to put it on and I broke out the next day. This stuff is amazing. Now, do I still get breakouts? Yes, but they are not the deep, painful ones and there are not as many. If you have had cystic acne and know the pain associated with it, you know how much of a miracle it is to have it gone. I should also note that I am allergic to benzoyl peroxide - and this stuff does nothing adverse to my skin - doesn&#x27;t even dry it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I love the fact that I am also getting the anti aging benefits - two products in one! I would recommend anyone suffering from acne to give it a try, although I know it isn&#x27;t likely to work for other people, it did for me, so I think it&#x27;s definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only 26, so I don&#x27;t have any lines or wrinkles to really give an opinion on the anti-aging benefits. But any retinol product is proven to benefit aging skin, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s there. While it might not be a high enough dosage for some, it is gentle enough to use every night and not cause ill-effects, so you kind of have to weigh your options with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that will do it for my long winded review. While not all Philosophy products are hits - this one definitely is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/21/14:&lt;br /&gt;I felt compelled to write an update as I feel, recently, that I&#x27;ve seen new benefits. Let me explain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had a child, and when preggo, retinol products are a huge no-no. So I wasn&#x27;t able to use this for several months. I just started using it again, thinking maybe I wouldn&#x27;t need it (my boy gave me amazing skin! so weird!). But boy was I wrong! It has curbed the breakouts again, and it has made the pigmentation fade so much faster too. But, the real eye-opener for me was the exfoliation. I never knew how good this product was at exfoliating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My post-partum skin wasn&#x27;t &#x27;dry&#x27;, but I&#x27;d get a build up of dead skin (you know how you can just feel it?) really bad, and even though I used the microdelivery exfoliation wash religiously every morning, it wasn&#x27;t even making a dent in the dead-skin layer, no matter how long/hard I scrubbed.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this again at night, and in the morning my skin is soooo amazingly smooth...no dead skin feel at all. It&#x27;s like I did a peel. I&#x27;m amazed. I think it&#x27;s just one effect I never really noticed before. But now I can&#x27;t go a day without it because my skin feels flaky and gross if I do. I just wanted to mention it if someone is looking for some help with exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Was previously opened and not in original box. I didn&#x27;t know I was buying used.</li>
            <li> Items as listed. Prompt shipping. Love Philosophy!</li>
            <li> I so hoped this would be an effective cream for me, but it just hasn&#x27;t been.  I used it consistently for weeks according to the instructions, even using it twice a day when once a day wasn&#x27;t helping.  I just didn&#x27;t see results, plain and simple.  My fine lines and pores still appear as they did before.  My skin doesn&#x27;t really feel any smoother either.  May&#x27;be I need something stronger?</li>
            <li> I struggled for so long, and I have finally found a retinol product worth its weight in gold.  I have sensitive skin, but this has never made me peel like other retinols.  It has significantly reduced the appearance of my pores and my skin is so smooth.  Also, a little goes a long way, so while pricey, it will last you a good long time. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  I&#x27;ve spent far more money on products that did nothing but irritate my face.  This is the best ever!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. So glad I can still find it.</li>
            <li> Help me really does what it says and more.. not like most creams. It is excellent and I will always buy it.</li>
            <li> Just used this for a little over a month but friends and doc says I look so healthy. This is a great product that I plan on continuing to use. It is a good cream for a man.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for reducing age spots and smoothing out little wrinkles.  You can spot use it, but works best on entire face.  It is a little pricey, but a little goes a long way.  I found that I needed to use it fairly consistently, but did see results.  One of the best Philosophy products.</li>
            <li> My skin reacts easily to lotions and creams, either by rash or breaking out.  It was a pleasant surprise to find a product that did not irritate my skin and provided the retinol I was looking for in a product.  regards, Glenn&#x27;s wife</li>
            <li> It usually takes about 6 to 8 weeks for a product like this to show signs of effectiveness and I haven&#x27;t been using it for that long. But, it has seemed to clear up some roughness on my chin that exfoliators haven&#x27;t cleared up.</li>
            <li> This stuff was great!  Lighten your skin and takes away fine lines.  I look thus feel younger!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this religiously for the past few weeks, and I don&#x27;t see any difference.  I got better results with the dermalogica overnight clearing gel.  For what I paid for the \\&quot;help me\\&quot;, I was expecting a lot more out of this product</li>
            <li> I was sceptical, but it works. It really unclogged my pores, made them smaller and made blemishes disappear over a few nights. I like consistency-lightweight and absorbs quick, with no residue on the skin. It&#x27;s gentle yet effective. A little goes long way, and this tube is going to last me forever. No odd smells. As far as working on lines I don&#x27;t know yet, but retinol is known for that job and probably I&#x27;ll see it overtime. If you hesitate ask for a sample at the store, I did it before purchase, and I was amazed.</li>
            <li> Non irritating, did it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearing 70 years old, typically experts only review results for 40+, 50+, and some 60+.  For me, I purchased Phlosophy Retinol Night Treatment after it was recommended on the Dr Oz show for a much younger person than I.  After 4 weeks, I have to say I have fewer fine wrinkles, I don&#x27;t need foundation except for special events, I am told how great my skin looks by my cosmetologist.  At my age, it don&#x27;t get better than that.  Love this product and will continue to use it and would recommend it to everyone, especially us Super Senior folks.....</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quality and results of Philosophy&#x27;s Help Me Retinol Night Treatment. The product does minimize fine lines in the eye area and the amount you use is small, so the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is an effective product. There won&#x27;t be miracles but stick with it and you will see subtle changes over time. I think it has 1% retinol.</li>
            <li> After a couple months of using this product, my face is sooo much smoother.  I had tons of white heads on my cheeks that I&#x27;ve never been able to get rid of and this did the trick.  Also drinking more water helps too.  Overall great product.</li>
            <li> Price:  -Around $45 on Amazon and other retailers/online vendors - I have yet to see this product on sale anywhere  -Can get cheaper if you get it in a package skin care set with other Philosophy products  How to use:  -Apply at night  -Use a small amount  -Start off using this product only a few times a week - gradually increasing usage if you see no bad side effects  -Make sure you use with a lotion as it&#x27;s very drying on the skin  How it works:  -This product is basically a &#x27;gentle&#x27; chemical peel that sloughs off the outermost layer of your skin  Results:  -You can definitely see an improvement in your overall skin tone with this product - it makes sense that your skin looks better because it chemically removes the outer layer which of course a newer, fresher layer of skin will be less pigmented than old skin and look more \\&quot;vibrant\\&quot;  Warnings:  -USE SPARINGLY at first - even if you don&#x27;t see any negative side effects the first night you use it and your face doesn&#x27;t feel dry, STILL start out using this slowly.  I made the mistake of applying every night when I first purchased this product because I wasn&#x27;t having any dry skin problems or irritation - well after about a week my skin all of the sudden was VERY dry and VERY PEELY.  No matter how much lotion I applied my skin was just peeling off like crazy, as if I had a gotten a terrible sunburn.  This makes make-up application very difficult and uneven, plus it can be a little embarrassing  -I would not recommend using this product in combination with self-tanners, especially when you first start using HelpMe.  Due to the effect of peeling skin, even when you use in combination with a lotion this can create very uneven skin texture as some of the &#x27;tanned&#x27; skin will peel off before other parts  Recommend to a friend?  -For sure!  Just be careful, gradually increase application and don&#x27;t use in combination with self tanner</li>
            <li> highly recommend shows improvement quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it did anything. I THINK my adult breakouts are better, but I also cut out sugar at the same time I started this...SO who knows?! I&#x27;ve since resumed sugar &amp; my skin did get a little worse, but not as funky as it was before. Maybe it works some. I use Obagi&#x27;s Clenziderm products for oily skin as my every day wash &amp; prevention...it helped dry up the refinery &amp; toned down the breakouts. Now that I&#x27;m using this, I have noticed that my skin is more &amp;#34;moist&amp;#34; &amp; shiney than it was before, which I don&#x27;t love because Obagi helped dry it up to begin with. IDK about this product for my skin. It did not even my skin tone, make my pores appear smaller, or reduce the fine lines that are starting to appear on my forehead. We&#x27;ll see what happens when I run out.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money for me and I have used several retinol items before. I hope it was not counterfeit like my other product I purchased!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to get this product, I need retinol plus the other ingredients like C and peptides but I don&#x27;t want the chemicals either. I am referring to \\&quot;BHT\\&quot; which is the last ingredient in this product. I am posting this article here for other people who feel the same way I do and for others not aware of the potential problems with \\&quot;BHT\\&quot;  skin care lines. I gave this a one star rating due to the BHT chemical in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the original link from the website \\&quot;The Good Human\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September 24th, 2009&lt;br /&gt;What Is BHT And Why You Should Avoid It.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s time to discuss another toxic chemical in our food and skin care products, and this time we&#x27;re asking What is BHT? Butylated Hydroxytoluene, or BHT, is an anti-oxidant which reacts with oxygen free radicals to slow down the autoxidation rate of ingredients in a product that can cause changes in the taste or color. As such, it is primarily used to prevent fats in foods from becoming rancid - but it is also used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, jet fuels, rubber, petroleum products, electrical transformer oil, and embalming fluid. Sure sounds like BHT is something that should definitely be in our food, right?&lt;br /&gt;Dangers of BHT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out this additive, used in all the above products, has a scary MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) that says the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Do NOT let this chemical enter the environment.&lt;br /&gt;  Combustible.&lt;br /&gt;  Ingestion causes Abdominal pain. Confusion. Dizziness. Nausea. Vomiting.&lt;br /&gt;  The substance may have effects on the liver.&lt;br /&gt;  The substance is harmful to aquatic organisms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That certainly makes BHT look even more appetizing to have in our food and in our cosmetics! The Skin Deep site rates BHT as having a \\&quot;high hazard to high hazard depending on product usage\\&quot; and says it has been shown to be linked to cancer, developmental toxicity, allergies, neurotoxicity, endocrine disruption, biochemical or cellular level changes.So what kind of products, other than our food (it is FDA approved for use in food), can BHT be found in?&lt;br /&gt;Products Containing BHT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Aveeno Baby Natural Protection Mineral Block Face Stick&lt;br /&gt;  Neutrogena Body Oil&lt;br /&gt;  CVS Beauty Bars Sensitive Skin&lt;br /&gt;  Neutrogena Liquid Facial Cleanser Fragrance Free&lt;br /&gt;  Revlon ColorStay Bronzer for the Face&lt;br /&gt;  Loreal Hip High Intensity Pigments&lt;br /&gt;  OLAY Daily Facials Deep Cleansing Cloths&lt;br /&gt;  Lubriderm Advanced Therapy Lotion Moisturizing Lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a list of some pretty popular products, all of which require you to wonder what is BHT and why you should be avoiding it. Who wants to use a product or eat a food that has ingredients also used in jet fuels and embalming fluid? Before you buy a product, I highly suggest you check out lists like the one I referenced to see exactly what you are buying. BHT is bad news, and there are plenty of ways to avoid consuming it. Always do your homework before shopping!</li>
            <li> love love love lovel lve  use it nightly has made a big differnece would buy again if i had the monthe</li>
            <li> Not irritating. Helps prevent my acne and makes skin clearer.</li>
            <li> ...and it did!!! with in about two weeks my skin has cleared up. It&#x27;s the only thing I have found that works for me. I have very oily skin and tend to get breakouts. Not any more now that I have found this cream :-)</li>
            <li> ...and a fraction of the price. I used Retin-A for many years and was happy with it. This is surely milder (minimal redness and burning), but it does the trick as far a pimple prevention, if you use it every day. I put it on in the morning after my shower. It says nighttime usage, but that&#x27;s to prevent irritation. That&#x27;s more of an issue with Retin-A for me.</li>
            <li> Super product! If I feel a massive pimple about to emerge on my face, I simply dab some of this on and it clears it right up. Love this cream!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Help Me for about a month.  I noticed results right away, within the first few days, and I&#x27;ll never be without this product again.  It does what it claims to do. I&#x27;ve noticed the greatest results regarding pore size.  I have combination normal/oily skin, and I had enlarged pores in my T-zone.  Help Me has reduced their appearance.  I no longer use face primer before applying foundation, because my skin is smoother and the pores do not show like they did before.  I wish I could see more of a difference with fine lines around my eyes, but I have seen some improvement.  It can be drying, even if have oily skin, so you&#x27;ll need to apply a moisturizer after using it.  I use Hope in a Jar and have used these two products together every night.  My skin is more clear, smooth, and younger-looking.</li>
            <li> After the first 2 weeks I noticed a significant difference in the brown spots on my face. I love this product and recommend it to everyone.It is not too strong or harsh on my face and believe me I do have sensitive skin. It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> really helps keep my skin clear and glowing. I use this every night, and on the weekends I give my skin a break. It speeds cellular turnover and honestly works as well as Retin-A worked for me as a teen but is more gentle to skin and feels more moisturizing. You thankfully don&#x27;t get those sheets of skin peeling off your face like you might with Retin-A. Great stuff</li>
            <li> GREAT NON-GREASY PRODUCT. HAVEN&#x27;T NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN SKIN TEXTURE YET, BUT WILL CONTINUE TO USE&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT UNTIL ALL GONE.</li>
            <li> This product replaced the now discontinued On a Clear Day retinol treatment, which I absolutely loved. I don&#x27;t feel like this is as effective, but I think if I had tried this one first I would have loved it just as much. Clears up skin, prevents breakouts - my skin was noticeably softer and younger looking within a week. If you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d definitely recommend using it VERY sparingly until your skin adjusts. I have very fair skin and it was only a bit irritated for about 3 days after first using. Now it&#x27;s fine, but I do use moisturizer with sunscreen every morning too. A good alternative to On a Clear Day, but I&#x27;d still like to see that one come  back. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Been using for about  a month.  I have not seen a dramatic difference in my skin.  It does cause some redness at times.  My pore size has not changed at all.  I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but a few at age 32.  It  may have softened them a little but I cannot tell.  I will finish this since it was so expensive and hope for the best.  Probably will not purchase again!  You led me wrong on this one, Dr. Oz!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I had a bump on my nose forever that I tried squeezing, applying acne meds to it, facial scrubs, nothing worked. so I purchase this product and lo and behold the bump slowly melted away! yes I say melted because while I was noticing all the other benefits this cream gave me like smaller pores and more radiant skin I didn&#x27;t even notice the bump disappearing until it was almost gone. I have purchased this product from amazon and from Sephora( only because I wanted it the same day) but Id highly recommend it. It also works without aggravating your skin- there was no tingling, burning or peeling. go for it- you&#x27;ll love it&lt;br /&gt;Id also take this over the retinol pads. good luck with your purchase.</li>
            <li> This product truly helps with the hard to erase fine lines (forehead, 11 lines, and under eye lines). It&#x27;s also reasonably priced. It works much better than the Roc products, so the price difference is worth it in my opinion. It also makes my skin look more luminous. Use a high factor sunscreen when using this product (rain, shine, inside, outside). Also, don&#x27;t overdo it! I could only use it every other night without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products hoping they will help hydrate and work on fine lines....again disappointed in another product......................  hmm</li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of scrunching my face - when in conversation, outside in the sun, or when deep in thought. This has led to creating lines in my face at a young age. I began using this product years ago and would not go without again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I go a few nights without using it, I see a difference. Without it, the lines in my forehead become more pronounced and my face looks more tired. I use just a dab at night, on clean, dry skin. I then layer moisturizer over it (because I have dry skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this as a retinol treatment because I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate, while being very effective.</li>
            <li> i have used better i am not noticing much of a difference and its been over 2 weeks and i have been using it 2x a day and still not seeing a difference i will use up the rest and most likely will try something stronger</li>
            <li> gentle on my skin (no break outs or irritation) yet very effective on my melasma. I&#x27;ve been using it a few months now (I&#x27;m on my second tube) and the dark spot on my forehead has almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with adult acne for years. I have been using Proactiv+ and I was still getting stubborn breakouts and my pores were so clogged. I read about Help Me and added it to my regimen. Very quickly afterward, my skin improved. The real test was during my PMS, when I usually break out - however, those tricky hormonal times have come and gone with no breakout whatsoever. Seriously a miracle product. I&#x27;ve been using it with 3 drops of When Hope is Not Enough at night with the Proactiv+ exfoliating wash before and moisturizer afterward. I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li> I am happy with Philosophy Help Me Retinol Night treatment. It is not harsh on my skin which is great because I have sensitive skin. I only just starting the product I haven&#x27;t seen results yet, but time will tell. Overall, I am happy with product.</li>
            <li> Apply this at night before bedtime and you will wake up with new skin!!!  This stuff is amazing and it is totally worth the price.  Will always purchase this.  I am looking forward to younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It made my skin soft and clear.  I noticed it after using it for a couple of weeks, but I realized how well it was working when I ran out and tried a substitute!  I had to purchase it again because after I stopped using it for a few weeks, my skin became dry and scaly again.  I would definitely recommend this product for middle age skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product almost 2 years. I have very oily skin and this product improved my skin . I noticed my pores become smaller&lt;br /&gt;and my skin not as oily anymore. However ,when I received this product from the seller it came in different package.  I am not sure it real deal.  I am going to contact a Philosophy Rep and find out about this packaging deal.</li>
            <li> Has helped me with the circles and wrinkles around my eyes...lasts for a long time...recommend this product for 55+ skin...</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days and I have already noticed a marked improvement in my skin.  My fine lines are diminishing and my pores are smaller.  I have very sensitive skin and this has not caused any redness or irritation.</li>
            <li> This is for my wife but she won&#x27;t use anything else. She says it&#x27;s the best one for her.</li>
            <li> The first night I used it my skin felt very smooth and soft by morning.  I probably should not have used it again the next night however.  My skin became very sore and dry after the second use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying a soothing night cream to help calm my skin down.  I&#x27;ll probably still use this but not every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I bought this more for acne but as a 35yr old I also have some small wrinkles, I saw no difference in wrinkles at all.</li>
            <li> It did seem to make your skin seem fresher for myself (50+) and DD (21) also found it helped give a balance to her uneven oily/dryer areas.&lt;br /&gt;Adds firmness to the jawline also for the older crowd.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is the one asking where&#x27;d that tube go?  So we need to order more as I&#x27;m not giving what&#x27;s left back.&lt;br /&gt;You apply this AFTER your moisturizer at night or may cause slight redness when in sun. Do not use without the moisturizer as a base, it may prove too harsh.  Leaves no sticky feel.  Goes on clean and easy.</li>
            <li> Easily the best eye cream. I often put a dab under each eye i I happen to get up n the middle of the night I love it.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my skin except make it red.  No improvement with acne or scarring.</li>
            <li> This product is about as good as it gets for lightening age spots.  LOVE PhILOSOPHY!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while so I know it is a great product.  Will continue.  Love it!</li>
            <li> A friend gave me my first tube of this and I loved it so much I bought another!it has transformed my acne prone, oily, almost-thirty year old skin. I love it! Just make sure you use a moisturizer like it instructs you to do.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the better retinol night creams out there. Love Philosophy products.</li>
            <li> I love, love this product.  Just try it and you&#x27;ll see.  I don&#x27;t want to live without it... What a difference the way it makes my skin look.  I mix it with Obagi products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year (yes, the tube lasts a long time, as you don&#x27;t need much at once) on a dark area on my face, but I haven&#x27;t seen anything major.  I&#x27;m sure this will be more useful to me as my skin starts to age more, but I&#x27;m 28 and people still mistake me for 18...</li>
            <li> Philosophy&#x27;s \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; is by far the best retinol skin cream I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different ones, in all price ranges)!  Originally I&#x27;d purchased Philosophy&#x27;s \\&quot;On A Clear Day\\&quot;, which is their retinol cream for acne-prone skin, thinking it would be better for me, as I have sensitive skin that tends to break out easily.  For some reason though, \\&quot;On A Clear Day\\&quot; actually contains MORE moisturizing ingredients than \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; does (one of them being hyaluronic acid) which makes no sense, as it&#x27;s for acne prone skin (which you&#x27;d think would need LESS moisturization)!  Anyways, the \\&quot;On A Clear Day\\&quot; made a horrible mess of my skin, I was broken out, oily, and gross.  I returned that cream and exchanged it for the \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; (even though a part of me was thinking I should try a different product line altogether, due to my awful experience).  Let me tell you, it was the best thing I could&#x27;ve done!  From the moment I started using the \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot;, my skin has been getting better and better.  It cleared up the break out I had going on and the overall look and clarity of my skin has improved dramatically.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference when it comes to fading scarring or anything, but that would probably take more time to clear up.  I use this a few nights a week (without adding a moisturizer on top -I think that&#x27;s a bit overkill, this lotion is enough to handle mild to moderate dryness) and have not had any redness, irritation, peeling, breakouts- nothing!  Just perfectly moisturized, glowy skin!  I haven&#x27;t noticed any burning or discomfort when applying it either (some retinol creams can burn or sting upon application, especially if you have sensitive or freshly waxed/shaved skin or something) Unfortunately, you don&#x27;t get a whole lot and it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but a little does go a long way, so depending on how often you use it, it could last you for a while.  Plus, the product WORKS and works really well, which I think makes it worth the cost.  When I use up the tube I have, I plan to move on to a prescription-strength cream (Retin-A) that my doc prescribed for me, so I most likely won&#x27;t repurchase the \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot;, at least not for a while.  However, if I am unhappy with the results the Retin-A gives me or if it disagrees with my skin, I will absolutely go back to using the \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; instead!  A great product that I completely recommend to anyone looking for a highly effective, yet gentle, retinol cream!  As a general rule though, you really can&#x27;t go wrong with Philosophy products!  The facial moisturizer is great (though smells funny after application), as are the body washes (which smell great and can multitask!) and the body lotions (which leave you dewy, glowy, and smelling great)!  A great product from a great product line, 120% recommended!  EDIT 10/20/11-  Okay, so I&#x27;ve finished my tube of \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; and began using prescription Retin-A and I must say, I think I prefer the \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot;!  It has a much better texture (the RX cream is quite thick and heavy), is gentle on your skin, but still delivers awesome results.  The RX cream is stronger so if you use it too frequently, you will peel and get irritated.  Plus it&#x27;s much heavier and thicker so it would probably not be best for oilier skins.  So I think the \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; is totally the better way to go, especially if you&#x27;re sensitive or oily and looking for something gentler that will still deliver noticeable results!</li>
            <li> When I applied it, I felt a burning sensation, no rash though. At first I thought that that meant it was working, but after 4 months, is has done nothing for me.  I did however buy a snail gel eye serum (in the Netherlands, brand: de Tuinen) and this stuff really does work for me. And I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month!</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how much I love this! I am 26...almost 27 and I have fine lines, large pores, occasional acne and uneven skin tone and texture. I have heard that retinol is the miracle cure for all of the above but those I had tried dried my skin and made it red and flaky. This is perfection! I add a pea sized amount to my night cream regimen and I wake up with better skin! If I have an early morning gym session I don&#x27;t even need to wash my face or use tinted moisturizer! My skin looks its best right as I wake up which I&#x27;m sure my husband loves.  I have experienced no dryness or redness or side effects. I LOVE this product! I also love that it was MUCH cheaper on Amazon than at Sephora!</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks of use, I did notice that my skin looked more radiant and less oily. I really like all the retinol products and think they help with my skin especially the adult acne breakouts that I have once in a while. However, I wish the company would publish the amount of retinol in this product. It is relatively cheap for a retinol product compared to prescription creams like RetinA but I don&#x27;t feel 100% comfortable putting a cream on my face without knowing exactly what is in there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pretty satisfied with this for the $ I paid. I use a dime size every night and I still have ~30% of the product left after 2.5 months of use. I have switch to an Avene cream that also has retinol + vitamin C but I will continue using the leftover product for traveling.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t prescription strength while I knew, but I didn&#x27;t really see any results, good or bad.  It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like the prescription strength would but it also didn&#x27;t help out my acne much either which is why I&#x27;m marking as just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  It might work better for others but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried many retinol creams, I usually use obagi&#x27;s tretonion cream but couldn&#x27;t get to my usual spa to get it so decided to try this item, I have been using it nightly for almost a month, I have oily acnetic skin and have a medium skin tone, this retinol cream has helped clear my skin, it doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin like other retinols in the market, I have noticed a difference with my skin. My skin looks clear and brighter since I began using this product. I definetely recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for ~2 years now and it&#x27;s a staple in my night-time routine. My skin definitely doesn&#x27;t like it when I don&#x27;t use this product - it really helps with acne (though I only have occasional mild acne, I would still bet this would help with more stubborn and severe forms). My skin is smoother and brighter and firmer. Love love love. I hope philosophy never stops making this product. I would be lost without it.</li>
            <li> So I never had acne as a teenager. Was on the pill for irregularities from the start of puberty. Finally got off the pill at around 23 or 24, and then my whole face went insane. Giant zits near my mouth, worse during PMS, present all the rest of the time. I tried every type of regular acne thing I could think of - I didn&#x27;t think to connect the discontinuation of the pill with the rise of Myra (figured the zit was around for a couple of years and she deserved a name). Somehow or another I found out about hormonal cystic acne and about how retinol can help. I didn&#x27;t really want to go to a dermatologist (no insurance), so I thought I&#x27;d try this. I really didn&#x27;t want to show up at law school with Myra still hanging about. I used this every night, after washing my face and before putting on moisturizer. After about 6 weeks my skin started clearing up. Now I only use it during PMS to prevent Myra and her buddies from coming out to play. If I try to skip a month, it&#x27;s back.&lt;br /&gt;There are other serums that I like to use better when I&#x27;m not worrying about the acne, but this has been the BEST thing for the acne and probably the #1 product that I could not live without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve since switched to Philosophy&#x27;s Miracle Worker liquid solution. It is a stronger concentration than this and I&#x27;ve found that it works a bit better for me.</li>
            <li> I buy it for my friend who is 25. I think she love it. And most people said it is good for the people between 25 to 30.</li>
            <li> Although slightly pricy this product is worth every penny! Have used literally dozens of eye creams and this one had converted me!</li>
            <li> Granted, I think it&#x27;s a little too pricey. It is a great retinol product though. My skin has been looking better.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it works great.  You will notice an improvement in just a few days after starting to use it.</li>
            <li> If you already have access to Retin-A or Renova, skip this product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a wanna-be.&lt;br /&gt;I got the set of cleanser/retinol/moisturizer, and took it all back. This was the ONLY item in the box that didn&#x27;t have a nauseating smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try Anew Wrinkle Corrector instead, if you don&#x27;t have access to prescription topicals. You&#x27;ll get results and it costs less than this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I bought this at Sephora, sn authorized retailer of this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a dermatologist product but I love the product for what it does. I needed something reasonably priced that would help my skin and Help Me Retinol Night Treatment was the one for me. I want to try more of their products. They are really good.</li>
            <li> I use this product as well as a moisturizer by Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder.  It&#x27;s important to know that it should be applied , then followed by a moisturizer, ESP at night if rapid results are anticipated.  Must keep up the routine, and stay out of the sun.</li>
            <li> I have used other products that seem to exfoliate or provide more skin regeneration. Although price is less, I would rather spend more to have a better effect.</li>
            <li> This cream works great without any irritation (at least for me).  I work for a dermatologist and to those who had breakouts using the cream- that is to be expected.  It is basically &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; the acne to the surface of the skin.  You have to give it at least a month to be able to really judge if it has worked or not.  After a month or 6 weeks the acne should start to improve.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product but after 3 weeks of using it at night I had more pimples than I had when I was a teenager. I noticed a glow with my skin but the fact that I had new pimples every day didn&#x27;t help.  This was my first time using retinol and I can say it will be my last for a while. I will not be using this product again.</li>
            <li> Read great reviews about this, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks. No results yet. Hopefully it works.</li>
            <li> Have used this product off and on for a couple years - love it!  I am over 40 and I like to spend some money on my face, but not too much...  this does the job and is a decent price point.</li>
            <li> Use this every night after cleansing ... apply a small amount and mix with facial moisturizer to avoid any irritation.  Like this product very much.</li>
            <li> I have debated about diving into the retinol pool, but \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; made the dive easy. My skin looks terrific,and I have had almost no irritation. As long as you follow the directions: only at night, remember to use sunscreen in the day, you should have great results too!</li>
            <li> I am a Boots No 7 user with excellent results.  In the past I have used Philosophy products and was always pleased - not so much with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year now. I had a large age spot on my face which has disppeared after using Help Me every night. I am serious!! I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me.  I have very oily skin that is prone to breakouts.  I had found a skincare regimen that works to keep the breakouts under control, but I wanted something to help with the oil and that had anti-aging benefits.  I had used prescription Retin A in the past and it dried out my skin terribly.  But, I was told this is a much milder concentration and releases the Retin A slowly, so it&#x27;s not as irritating.  I used it for about 3 weeks and all I got were the worst pimples I&#x27;ve ever had.  Two months later and I&#x27;m still waiting for them to heal completely.  Now I need to find a product to reduce the red marks left from the pimples caused by using this product.</li>
            <li> Great retinol product that works without the extreme irritation of prescription retin a. A little dryness but still tolerated well</li>
            <li> Cream has done nothing at all, so it was a waist of my money. And I will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Skin feels bright, soft and when make up applied it glides on!  Love that it&#x27;s gentle for a retinol product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive/combination/dry/acne-prone skin, and I was looking for a miracle after experiencing my first intense breakout in years. I first purchased this in November to clear my skin and alleviate the acne-induced discolorations/texture issues, and, for two months, I used a pea-size amount on my face every night.  During that time, my skin got significantly clearer/brighter without any retinol-induced irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In January, I experimented with a prescription tretinoin cream with unsuccessful results.  After about a month and a half of daily use, I had to stop due to insistent patches of extreme dryness/flakiness around my mouth and chin and a major pimple that migrated to different locations on my face but refused to disappear.  I eventually returned to Help Me and all my issues disappeared.  About a month ago, I got complacent and stopped applying this.  After about a month, I realized that my skin was dull and not as clear as it had been.  I applied Help Me, and my skin immediately improved overnight.  I&#x27;m never straying from this again.</li>
            <li> I started this cream 7 weeks ago, and i am currently  going through a massive skin purge. Its all part of the process, so i guess its doing its job. I have had no redness or peeling. Sunspots have also lightened up. the tube looks luke it will last a very long time, happy so far with the results.</li>
            <li> I use it in the evenings and does not irritate my skin. It&#x27;s been just a couple of weeks and my skin geels smoother.</li>
            <li> I use this every night followed by nightamins by Origins and always wake up to refreshed glowing skin, no matter how little sleep I get! I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for even my sensitive skin. It&#x27;s rejuvenating my skin overnight and I wake of with a refreshed face.</li>
            <li> I have used other retinol products and none makes my skin look as good!  Less lines and less breakouts as well.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and improves the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I am suppose to be seeing but my skin looks the same!</li>
            <li> I have been using Help Me for a little over a week and have been very pleased with the fading of lines and discoloration on my face and around my eyes. I am ordering another tube for my travel bag now.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give the product 5 stars because I only used the product once, and frankly, it was a while ago and I can&#x27;t recall whether or not I was satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Another great product from Philosophy! It was shipped in a very timely manner and very affordable . I would recommend to anyone who is trying to fight against the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I have had acne for years and still frequently break out in my late 20s now. I use this and their microderdelivery and I feel it has helped decrease breakouts. I have some scarring, I&#x27;m not sure it has lightened them yet. I&#x27;ve been using this for over 2 months. It does not dry my face out or cause redness.</li>
            <li> Use this every night.  Can tell when I forget....my skin isn&#x27;t as soft he next day.  No crazy peeling like I had with prescription Retin A.....I know, probably not as effective, but I look less reptilian, so I&#x27;m good with it.</li>
            <li> I started using this product six months ago.  I didn&#x27;t realize it was working until people started asking me what I was doing differently to my skin (i.e. drinking more water? new cream? eating more vegetables?  exercising more?).  It took me a while to connect the dots.  When looking at my skin in pictures six months ago compared to now, there is a noticeable difference in evenness, reduction in eye wrinkles and softness.  I had never used a retinol product before this.  This stuff actually works, you just have to give it time.  The change will not happen overnight.</li>
            <li> Works well.  I put it on every night before bedtime under my moisturizer.  I always look well-rested, even when I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if actually does anything, but it feels so clean and refreshing. So many other night treatments are heavy feeling, this goes on smooth and light.</li>
            <li> Definitely not as good as the more expensive creams or prescription creams, but it&#x27;s a very good &amp;#34;affordable&amp;#34; option. I&#x27;m used to using really powerful stuff, so if you have sensitive skin or have never used a retinol before, then you will probably love it.</li>
            <li> I think this is the only night cream that made a visible difference in the morning! Love it- really works and great price on amazon!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Saw changes within the first 3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin got this as part of the &amp;#34;Great Skin Is In&amp;#34; for combination skin kit (which is unfortunately no longer available) and fell in love with it. It is the only product I have found that actually helps get rid of the blackheads on my nose! In addition, it minimizes the appearance of pores, helps keep my mild acne at bay and keeps my skin smooth. I use this in combination with Purity Made Simple, Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash and oil free Hope in a Jar. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 3 years now and I&#x27;ve never had better looking skin. After using it for a month or so I saw my mom who I hadn&#x27;t seen in months and she made a comment about how great my skin looked without me even telling her I switched my skin care routine. I am in my late 20&#x27;s and even though this product is on the expensive side, I will keep purchasing it (and my other daily Philosophy products) because I think that good skin care is worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost 4 weeks since I started using this: my first time using a retinol product. I wish I had know the magic equation (at least &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; for me) of clearing my moderate, cystic adult acne sooner: create a regimen of salicylic, glycolic and retinol products (and get rid of the benzoyl peroxide 2.5%)! Out of desperation I recently went to a dermatologist who was quick to prescribe me a $400 cream with several side effects (my insurance would have made it $40) but he didn&#x27;t even ask if I had already tried a basic retinol OTC cream yet. Luckily, I had ordered this and decided to try it before filling my script. I&#x27;m so happy with the results! I did have a few more cystic lumps break out in the first week or so, but I could tell overall that my skin was improving: smoother, cleaner, reduced scarring, acne is smaller or non at all. I did not have redness or any flaking (but I had been using a glycolic acid peel for a few months previous to starting this product so my skin is pretty sturdy). Great product.</li>
            <li> This product feels very nice going on and is comfortable to sleep in.  It is not greasy.  I have not had any break outs, and my skin is jumpy with creams.  I thought maybe the formula might be too gentle for any results, but so far I do see a smoothing.  I come from the generation of no sun screen, so my skin has plenty to say for my age.  This cream seems to be undoing some of my past neglect!</li>
            <li> This product will do everything it claims to. However, the first few days of use I was dissapointed because I was not seeing many results. What I was doing was washing with Purity at night, applying a thin layer of Help Me, and applying a good layer of Hope In A Jar to prevent dryness. I didn&#x27;t know why it wasn&#x27;t working, so I decided to try it by itself without HIAJ on top. Just the retinol alone. This was not a problem because it did not cause any dryness for me at all anyway. I also liked this a lot better because the two combined was making my skin too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well... I woke up the next morning with crystal clear, glowing skin!!! And these results are continuing, as long as I apply it by itself. I now believe this is because, according to what I&#x27;ve read,  Alpha Hydroxy Acids deactivate retinol, and as far as I know HIAJ contains AHAs. In fact, I&#x27;e read that retinol is very unstable in general, so I wouldn&#x27;t apply it with anything else. If anyone else has had similar experiences using these two products together, please let me know. Perhaps do an experiment one night leaving out your HIAJ and see if you get better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some other tips. I&#x27;ve found using it every other day is best, or else my skin gets used to it and stops seeing results. I&#x27;ve also found that if I skip washing my face on the mornings after I apply it, the retinol keeps working and my skin looks great. If I wash, it sometimes looks as if I washed all the benefits off. :( As much as I hate not washing my face in the AM, my skin looks amazing if I just leave it as it is, applying only a high SPF on top for the day.</li>
            <li> used it for about 10 days and was looking in my car mirror-- with the sun on my face and about wrecked the car-- most of my wrinkles were GONE. i still had a few around my top lip but those are now also fading. i&#x27;m sold. i will use the forever!!!!</li>
            <li> Help Me is amazing!  I have been using it on my face and the back of my hands for two months, which is how long the tube lasted.  My friends tell me I look great.  One friend, who is very concerned and knowledgable about her skin, was so impressed with the improvement in my skin that she asked me to get a tube for her.  I noticed that my skin is cleaner, especially on my nose.  I will stop using it three days prior to waxing because my skin was more sensitive and the waxing burned my skin in the mustache and chin areas.  Would I recommend this product?  You bet I would.  I LOVE HELP ME!</li>
            <li> I am in my early 50s, Philosophy products are wonderful.  I haved been using the Help Me Retinol Treatment at night for about a year now.  It really does help in all the areas that I wanted to see results. I had a small brown aging spot on my cheeck that is gone now, fine lines have disappeared and my neck tone is firmer.  I am very faithful about using it every night.  Philosophy products are of high quality and I feel that comfortable applying them to my skin.</li>
            <li> It works! I reviewed other people&#x27;s reviews and decided to give a try. It did not disappoint me. It does make my face a little oily but not too bad. I use it twice a day on my face (my T section is always really oily than other part of my face). Thanks Philosophy!</li>
            <li> After only two weeks of using this product my skin is brighter, feels smoother and brown spots have lightened. It is drying so use under a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if it is helping me or not.</li>
            <li> At 29 years old, my skin went south.  I started to get acne that put my preteen acne to shame. I tried everything and each product failed or just made me break out more.  I then decided to try the Philosophy clear days ahead system after hearing good things.  It worked wonders on my nose, forehead and cheeks, however my chin was still suffering from severe acne and cystic acne.  This Retinol product is my life saver.  After dedicated use, I now can look in the mirror without one break out.  My cystic acne disappeared and the dark scaring caused by the past few years of severe acne are gone.  My pores are smaller and it smoothed the texture of my skin.  I recommend just trying it if you are having issues with breakouts.  It&#x27;s not too expensive, so just take a risk.  I didn&#x27;t think I would have clear skin again without expensive dermatologist intervention, but this product proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> All I have to compare this to is the prescription strength retinol cream from a few years ago, but I have to say it&#x27;s made a difference in my skin without drying it out for days like the prescription did. I put it on at night, and exfoliate/moisturize in the morning and I&#x27;m practically glowing all day.</li>
            <li> Love it and feel wonderful! I no longer look my age, I look considerably younger, thank you philosophy! I am a consumer for life!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m on my second tube, and i definitely notice a difference in my skin. my acne scars are clearing, my tone is more even, and i rarely ever break out any more. i&#x27;m young, so i don&#x27;t have much in the way of fine lines, but i have noticed that the crease lines in my foreheard are looking a little smoother-nothing dramatic though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i first began using this product, i applied it ever 2 days instead of every night because i was getting a small amount of peeling. but now i use it every night. i have very sensitive skin and, other than the initial peeling, i&#x27;ve had no issues with the product. you will absolutely want to use sunscreen during the day, though; retinol can make you more sensitive to the sun so be careful!</li>
            <li> I am really loving this night-time treatment. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. My skin is softer, smoother and at night it&#x27;s being hydrated and rejunanated! I like it because it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, hasn&#x27;t caused a single break out and I&#x27;m noticing an overall difference in my skin tone. More even, smaller pores, and helps with dryness. I&#x27;ll continue using it and more than likely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I am 31 and just starting an anti aging regimen.  I have been using this product for three weeks now and I have noticed a pretty big difference in the texture of my skin.  It is softer, smoother, and more even.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any redness or dryness.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable. I&#x27;ve had pretty moderate acne since I was 12 years old (twenty years of fun!) and was using a prescription-level retinol that only really worked at certain times of the month, when my stress levels were low, when the moon was aligned with Venus, etc. So I decided to give Philosophy&#x27;s Help Me a whirl after reading the reviews, and made myself use it for five or six weeks before writing my own review. So it&#x27;s official: Any acne I once had is just plain GONE. I barely even wear makeup any more. There is simply no point. I can&#x27;t really vouch for its line-reduction qualities as I didn&#x27;t really have any to start with (one of the trade-offs of oily skin: stupid breakouts, but no wrinkles) but I did notice that I loved the way it made my skin feel: soft, smooth, and definitely youthful. If you&#x27;re in your late twenties/early thirties and are still struggling with breakouts, I cannot recommend this stuff enough. It is miraculous.</li>
            <li> great for those who still suffer from acne and bad skin well into after their 20s. This product helps with breakouts as well as lines such as those laugh lines around the mouth. Always make sure to use w/ a moisturizer right after application has it seems to help the product along. And of course follow instructions on the sunscreen as well too when out during daylight after washing off.</li>
            <li> Love this cream, works wonders on my skin! Helps reduce my breakouts. Where was this when I was in high school?!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product, however, it broke me out horribly. I couldn&#x27;t use it beyond a week because of how horrible the breakout was.  I guess I will never know if it reduces fine lines or removes brown spots.  What a waste.</li>
    </ol>
