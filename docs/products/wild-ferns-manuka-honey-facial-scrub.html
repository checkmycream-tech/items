            <li>They are the best I have ever used</li>
            <li>It has grainy sort of exfoliating granules so it will give your face a real good scrubbing!</li>
            <li>I have senstive skin and the grit in the scrub is just the perfect amount.  </li>
            <li>My skin has not looked this good since I was 18!  </li>
            <li>Seems to do the job, has a delightful fragrance, and honey has a great history of being good for the skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>The product smells great and feels great.</li>
            <li>The scrub is great.</li>
            <li>and I believe this would make a great bridal, wedding, or push gift (after baby) because it is luxurious and rivals spa brands.  </li>
            <li>I smells great &amp; is working wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li>I would say this is good for all skin types (mine has changed throughout the years</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>, now I can use it more often!</li>
            <li>It smells great and rinses away easily.  </li>
            <li>It also rinses away easily and smells great.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it&#x27;s as honey</li>
            <li>Perhaps, Manuka most of all.</li>
            <li>and I must say I love the way it feels.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love that it helps to keep my skin from breaking out.</li>
            <li>If ladies in biblical times used honey and were made beautiful from it, we cab benefit from its healing properties and natural enzymes too.</li>
            <li>I have rather accepted that nothing will ever make my skin free of clogs, but this one has been a lot better than most</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t use it the day before your wedding or for something important like that.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>While it does have some grit to it, its not as much as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best facial exfoliating scrubs that I have ever used, I am hooked on the Wild Ferns Manuka line - such quality items that are great for the skin</li>
            <li>I like the rich, sticky honey consistency.  </li>
            <li>It works great on dry hands.</li>
            <li>It smells divine, has just the right intensity (I do not have sensitive skin), and my skin feels cleaner with this scrub than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin, and believe me, I&#x27;ve been cleaning my face for many, many years.</li>
            <li>This has become my new favorite face scrub.  </li>
            <li>Love Wild Fern Manuka Honey products!</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find out I could get it through Amazon, a lot cheaper than a ticket to New Zealand, although I would go back in a flash.  </li>
            <li>It is made with real honey and plenty of it because it has a nice sweet, floral smell and you will see its listed pretty high on the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>Yes, this is totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li>You will have soft skin for sure and your makeup and moisturizer will just glide on.  </li>
            <li>This manuka honey product is wonderful and non irritating.</li>
            <li>This is a nice soft exfoliant for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Forget all those high end products, many of which I have bought-used and thrown away-this facial scrub from Wild Ferns is fantastic!</li>
            <li>At first I was concerned by the size of the scrub grains.</li>
            <li>After using it the first time, I realized I had nothing to worry about.</li>
            <li>Someone who has a lot of open pustules or cysts may not find any scrub product helpful, but I think almost anyone else with cranky skin would love it.</li>
            <li>Manuka honey is very medicinal and this scrub leaves my face feeling clean and my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>and I tried pretty much everything</li>
            <li>only the scrub is dont fine</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I first bought this product on a trip to New Zealand in 2011</li>
            <li>(my skin was oily postpartum) and my normal skin has returned!  </li>
            <li>I have been troubled by clogged pores and breakouts for more than 40 years and have tried more than my share of products that claim to take care of this.</li>
            <li>The grains are large, but with gentle pressure, they do not dig me up or make me red.   </li>
            <li>I may break out, but I am 55 and very sensitive</li>
            <li>I have been using it pretty much daily</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few days now &amp; I can see a huge difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin type is a combination of dryness &amp; oiliness, so far my skin feels balanced.</li>
            <li>but so far I feel like there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and go natural with quality.  </li>
            <li>While purchasing the Wild Ferns Manuka Honey eye cream and night face cream I decided to purchase this as well and make it my night regimen.  </li>
            <li>While I was visiting New Zealand last year, I discovered Manuka Honey skin products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the facial scrub along with Wild Ferns moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Honey is a natural humectant which means that it will draw moisture to itself but not necessarily moisturize.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 tubes of the wild ferns manuka honey facial scrub.</li>
            <li>The next morning I have major breakouts.</li>

            <li> This has become my new favorite face scrub.  It smells divine, has just the right intensity (I do not have sensitive skin), and my skin feels cleaner with this scrub than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin, and believe me, I&#x27;ve been cleaning my face for many, many years.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it&#x27;s as honey and i dont dangerous my skin, only i love it. only the scrub is dont fine</li>
            <li> I wanted to use a facial scrub because I have rosacea and I thought it would help. The tiny scrubbing beads cleared my face gradually as I use it just at night. I like the silkiness of the honey on my face after I rinse it off.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few days now &amp; I can see a huge difference on my skin. My skin type is a combination of dryness &amp; oiliness, so far my skin feels balanced. I&#x27;ve been using the facial scrub along with Wild Ferns moisturizer. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I like how my skin feels after I use this product. Very smooth and clean. The next morning I have major breakouts. I am not sure it this is supposed to happen b/c it is pulling all of the junk out of my pores or not. I have never had this with an exfoliation product before. Just make sure you don&#x27;t use it the day before your wedding or for something important like that.</li>
            <li> This product can be a bit harsh on the face if you scrub too hard, but if you&#x27;re gentle, it works well. It works great on dry hands.</li>
            <li> Love Wild Fern Manuka Honey products! Great scrub!</li>

I know its only been two days but so far I feel like there&#x27;s a difference. The scrub is great. It&#x27;s not too rough. I don&#x27;t like the smell of it so much but its just for a few minutes while you have it on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s fighting acne.</li>
            <li> While I was visiting New Zealand last year, I discovered Manuka Honey skin products. They are the best I have ever used and they are inexpensive. I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Have ordered several times. I love that it helps to keep my skin from breaking out. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product on a trip to New Zealand in 2011 and I love it!

It is made with real honey and plenty of it because it has a nice sweet, floral smell and you will see its listed pretty high on the ingredient list. It has grainy sort of exfoliating granules so it will give your face a real good scrubbing! I like the rich, sticky honey consistency.  I would say this is good for all skin types (mine has changed throughout the years so I have had it all, and I have used skincare products from 7 different countries world wide so I&#x27;d say I am just a tad bit of a skincare junkie) but especially oily skin.  Honey is a natural humectant which means that it will draw moisture to itself but not necessarily moisturize.  I used this everyday and I used a generous helping of it on each area of my face and gave it a thorough scrubbing on a dry face (note: not all people can do this it just so happens that my skin can handle it) for about a minute or two and then added just a but of water to lubricate my skin before rinsing it off.  The honey did dry up the oil that I had (my skin was oily postpartum) and my normal skin has returned!  You will have soft skin for sure and your makeup and moisturizer will just glide on.  If you do not have oily skin, just once a week is enough.  I would buy this again in a heartbeat and I believe this would make a great bridal, wedding, or push gift (after baby) because it is luxurious and rivals spa brands.  Do yourself a favor and go natural with quality.  If ladies in biblical times used honey and were made beautiful from it, we cab benefit from its healing properties and natural enzymes too.</li>
            <li> While purchasing the Wild Ferns Manuka Honey eye cream and night face cream I decided to purchase this as well and make it my night regimen.  I have been using this product, in conjunction with the others, for just over a week.  My skin has not looked this good since I was 18!  I have radiance back and my tone is even.  I have senstive skin and the grit in the scrub is just the perfect amount.  It also rinses away easily and smells great.  Forget all those high end products, many of which I have bought-used and thrown away-this facial scrub from Wild Ferns is fantastic!</li>
