    <ol>
            <li> hate it hate it, lol too much brassiness, too much hair in your face, going to try to give it away to some one.</li>
            <li> Obviously not a high quality wig, but this one is really nice cut and the color makes it more realistic. i always get compliments when i wear it. can&#x27;t beat it for the price!!</li>
            <li> The colors on this wig are terrible - it looks so fake, I can&#x27;t believe other reviewers actually like it. It doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture. It is like having stripes on the top and sides of your hair - very unrealistic. So glad it was cheap because it was a complete waste of money. Wish they would have better pictures so you could really see what the colors are like. The picture makes it look like it has nice highlights - definitely not what you will get.</li>
            <li> The colors on this wig are very contrasting &amp; fun &amp; its super soft &amp; full. But when you lean forward you become cousin it! Really annoying &amp; not natural. I tried to cut bangs but theres SO much hair in the front it ridiculous &amp; they want too stick straight out.</li>
            <li> Very fake looking , front seam shows, color is not true to pic, i purchased separtely bangs and tried to add and used a wide headband that at least made it wearable.,</li>
            <li> I do like the look of the wig, it fits well and looks pretty natural on, except for the fact that right down the center of the wig you can see the seam where they sewed the hair in. I&#x27;ve tried pulling it back and other ways of hiding it but all to no avail as it still shows. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love the cut .  Color is  bit harsher than photo shows.  Would have loved wig in a medium brown without all the streaking..</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig to cover the ugly effects of chemo an have had so many compliments on it that I think ill wear it even when my hair grows back! It looks and feels real, and so easy to take care of.</li>
            <li> The highlights are too much. If you put a hat on it, it could work.  Wish I could change it</li>
            <li> Gift for student and other wig I am sending ro thw some women cancer patients with hoping to cheer someone&#x27;s live.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made. Does not show what the wig really looks like on the advertisements. It was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Its a chunky color pattern not belneded at all. Its HUGE . the front is WAY WAY to low and looks terrible. big waste of money</li>
            <li> Absolutely not what I thought it would be like. It is a costume wig at best! Very disappointed!!!! It should be advertised differently!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased two products from this company.  The short bob &amp; this brown straight wig.  This is a tad better product but still poor quality.  Avoid making purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig for my daughter who has suffered with alapecia since she was in the second grade. She absolutely loves the look of this wig and now she is not so self conscious about her condition.</li>
            <li> I love the style, look and affordability of wig. I plan to purchase more. Goes well with any browns. The quality was better than I expected. Overall, great purchase, and I recommend wig to anyone who wants style on a budget.</li>
            <li> This wig looks and feels great.  I have received many compliments on it.  Being still young and having tho wear a wigs this is a definitely one I wear often.</li>
            <li> The colors highlights are too bright almost don&#x27;t look real, other than that the style is pretty. Part also looks fake</li>
            <li> I think you should make natural caps with real looking areas for parts. The bangs and cut are not good and have to be recut. Otherwise the color and texture on this is is good.</li>
            <li> vary odd color this is wig is like a callieo clore just as a cat would look.. this is it.. too of a jump from head to wig.. NOT LACE FRONT&amp;#62;..</li>
            <li> Nice quality snythetic hair.  Colors are beautiful.  My only complaint is the style hangs too far in my face.  I am going to try to get a beautiician to cut some bangs on it and shorten the length all over a bit.  It came 11 days prior to the final date it said it may be received.</li>
            <li> not what they had pictured, about 5 different shades, to thick, not natural looking. does not stay on head, come to realize don&#x27;t purchase a wig, unless you can see it and try it on in a store!</li>
            <li> I hate to disagree with the other two reviews, but this wig is awful. It said \\&quot;lace front\\&quot;. It is not a real lace front wig. It has brown lace sewn into the cap, but the part (which is practically non-existent) is just a white line sewn into the wig. And if you are worried about the color, do. It is callico. The front is three different colors. Very disappointed, but I guess you get what you pay for. It&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> This wig is made very well it is mad just as good as some of my $300 wigs . The only complaint is the highlights on top are way brighter than I thought they would be . And it took 4weeks to arrive the wig is full and the haired smooth</li>
            <li> This wig was perfect and ready to wear straight out of the package. It is super soft and looks and feels like real hair. The only negative things I have to say are that the highlights are a little brighter than I thought but definetly look great. And the shipping took forever (about four weeks).</li>
