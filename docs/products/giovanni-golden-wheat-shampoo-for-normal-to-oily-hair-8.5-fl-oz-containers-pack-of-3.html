            <li>The bottle lasts a while, and the price is great for the quality.  </li>

            <li>the Tea Tree one is my favorite, and this one is very good also.  </li>
            <li>I try something else and nothing works as good as this.</li>
            <li>I tried all kinds of hair products from Aveda to products from target that didn&#x27;t have good ingredients and they all didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>I almost always order Giovanni shampoos and conditioners from Amazon, as they are a good product and good value in bulk.</li>

            <li>This stuff feels great, smells good, is sulfate free and has made my hair healthier and longer.</li>

            <li>I am really amazed at how well it works -- I haven&#x27;t been so happy with a shampoo in years.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shiny too :)</li>
            <li>I love Giovanni shampoos and conditioners -</li>
            <li>This shampoo is lovely to use and I like the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Environmental Working Group rates it a 2 - love that.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>After using it for about a month, I am officially in love.</li>
            <li>I love it and it is one of my staples.</li>
            <li>The ingredient list also looks very friendly.</li>
            <li>Really happy with this particular version of the shampoo though.</li>
            <li>It is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I was originally reluctant at trying this because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would also help with my dandruff</li>
            <li>I go through a bottle very quickly even without washing my hair every day.</li>
            <li>Very good very strong shampoo that rinses clean &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave residues in my hair to drip down into my contact lenses throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I tried many, this works amazing, completely removes dirt and grease.</li>
            <li>But if an all-natural and chemical-free product is important to you, you may wish to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>But if an all-natural and chemical-free product is important to you, you may wish to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I like the sulfate free element</li>
            <li>No matter what shampoo I use (with sulfates or sulfate free), I have to shampoo twice.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!!!  </li>
            <li>Just after first use I could see good shine and very manageable hair.</li>
            <li>Think I found my new go to safe shampoo!</li>
            <li>My hair is as clean as SLS shampoos leave my hair, but it does not leave my hair with that</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling clean and shiny without buildup.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo does give a refresh feeling to your hair and it feels clean.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for more natural, health and eco-conscious beauty products, try theirs; They&#x27;ve (as yet) been the most reliable brand I&#x27;ve found in hair care.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I highly reccomend it to anyone with oily hair!</li>
            <li>you want something that will really clean your hair and scalp, this shampoo is worth a shot.</li>
            <li>It is difficult to find shampoo for oily hair and this stuff is great and it smells good.</li>
            <li>I also came across a nice lathering sulfate free shampoo at Aveda (Rosemary Mint), but I&#x27;ve not tried it enough times to give it a review.  </li>
            <li>For myself, I&#x27;ve been able to test all of their shampoos (except the Root 66, so far) and I like them all!</li>
            <li>It has a lovely minty scent that doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It foams up easily and have a decent scent to it.</li>
            <li>It seems healthy for my hair, which is long and fine.</li>
            <li>switching to more natural and gentle products, the so-called acne cleared up like a charm.  </li>
            <li>With the Golden Wheat shampoo, my hair feels so soft and light.  </li>
            <li>I have a very very oily scalp.  </li>
            <li>have yet to find out whether I&#x27;ll be using this as a daily shampoo, or more of a clarifying shampoo to use once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for a natural, vegan, SLS free shampoo for my oily hair for over a year, without any luck.</li>
            <li>If its not lathering the first time, shampoo again to pick up the rest of the oil - and the second time I have better lather.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, clean and without buildup.</li>
            <li>I would say this one is middle ground between the Tea Tree, which is really clarifying/cleansing, and the 50/50, which is more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>We have found no other shampoo that can get hair this squeaky clean with no residue.  </li>
            <li>I was also having dandruff issues and tried the Giovanni dandruff shampoo and while it helped some it didn&#x27;t solve the problem at large.</li>
            <li>This one is just a little less stripping, which is good if you&#x27;re washing more often.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find good quality semi-affordable organic shampoo.</li>
            <li>But the one thing I have really struggled with is finding a shampoo that works with my hair/scalp.  </li>
            <li>Sodium lauryl glucose does sound very similar to sodium lauryl sulfate...</li>
            <li>It is not irritating my skin, and my hair loves it.  </li>
            <li>Sodium lauryl glucose does sound very similar to sodium lauryl sulfate...    </li>
            <li>It is not irritating my skin, and my hair loves it.  </li>
            <li>I have very kinky hair</li>
            <li>I really like how my hair looks and feel.</li>
            <li>I really like how it smells.</li>
            <li>His hair is very oily and this seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is very watery and comes out fast.  </li>
            <li>Than, while wandering the shampoo aisle at Whole Foods, I cam across this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of organic/natural shampoos hoping to find something that would work for my long, fine, and very oily hair.  </li>
            <li>I have an oily scalp, and long, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t really prevent your hair from getting oily, which is normal</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it cleanses even better, and allows me to wait just a little longer before washing.</li>
            <li>Cleans well, doesn&#x27;t strip hair, leaves it very shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>Golden Wheat shampoo actually clears up all the excess oil my scalp produces.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say that it is a completely all-natural product (though it doesn&#x27;t exactly claim to be).  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say that it is a completely all-natural product (though it doesn&#x27;t exactly claim to be).  </li>
            <li>Worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li>I use Matrix Biolage Normalizing Shampoo (to balance normal to oily hair - it has sulfates - and I shampoo twice with this as well).</li>
            <li>I know that part of my problem is the water where I live and the shampoo helps mitigate that and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
            <li>The natural and organic brands without SLS have been hell weeding through to find something that works, and I finally found it with this Golden Wheat shampoo.  </li>
            <li>but after my first wash with this shampoo, it has left my hair feeling very soft and not stripped off all the moisture.</li>
            <li>I have oily hair and always had problems where I would wash my hair with shampoo and then halfway through the day, it would get oily, wouldn&#x27;t feel good, and also felt messy and less manageable.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Giovanni product line and no disappointments this far.</li>
            <li>They never make my sensitive nose react to the fragrance.</li>
            <li>(I like to let the natural oils from my scalp moisturize and protect my hair.)</li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good since I was using expensive, chemical-laden hair products.</li>
            <li>And one major bonus to their products, in my opinion, is that they ALWAYS smell like natural botanicals, not like chemicals.</li>
            <li>They must test these products out to excess, because every single one I&#x27;ve tried works, and works really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll really clean your hair, but doesn&#x27;t go overboard.</li>
            <li>(I did use an occasional ACV rinse to keep my hair soft, though.)</li>
            <li>A lot of the natural shampoos have a difficult time competing with SLS products in terms of getting rid of oil and really making your hair and scalp feel clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands (well known and otherwise/ cheaper and more expensive) and always come back to Giovanni for performance, and the assurance that if I use one of their products, I&#x27;ll at LEAST really like it, if not be in love with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very concentrated compared to other shampoos, but I still need to wash twice.  </li>
            <li>My significant other uses this shampoo everyday and loves it.  </li>
            <li>And on top of that, it also helped with my minor issues with dandruff which I think the oil was making worse.</li>
            <li>The only con is the price, definitely on the high end compared to other shampoos out there.</li>
            <li>It cleans my hair very well, doesn&#x27;t over dry it or cause dandruff, and leaves absolutely no build-up, even after a month&#x27;s use!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great smelling. Can&#x27;t be used daily as drying to your hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great.Just after first use I could see good shine and very manageable hair. I did not require  any conditioner too. Great product, organic and easy on wallet !</li>
            <li> Very good very strong shampoo that rinses clean &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave residues in my hair to drip down into my contact lenses throughout the day. Have already reordered. It&#x27;s hard to find good quality semi-affordable organic shampoo.</li>
            <li> I developed a sensitivity to some common ingredient in mainstream hair products.  I haven&#x27;t figured out which ingredient it is, but whatever it was gave me acne on my face, back, and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After switching to more natural and gentle products, the so-called acne cleared up like a charm.  But the one thing I have really struggled with is finding a shampoo that works with my hair/scalp.  I have a very very oily scalp.  The natural and organic brands without SLS have been hell weeding through to find something that works, and I finally found it with this Golden Wheat shampoo.  Other SLS-free brands just could not properly clean my scalp, and would leave me with nasty greasy patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Golden Wheat shampoo actually clears up all the excess oil my scalp produces.  I am really amazed at how well it works -- I haven&#x27;t been so happy with a shampoo in years.  My hair is as clean as SLS shampoos leave my hair, but it does not leave my hair with that stripped, squeaky-clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that something in the ingredients is also doing something to combat our horrible hard water.  This property is on well water, and ever since we moved here I have struggled with the hard water trying to turn my hair into straw.  With the Golden Wheat shampoo, my hair feels so soft and light.  I am just so amazed at the improvement I&#x27;ve seen with just 2 washes.  My hair is waist-length, and while I love it long, I have had such a horrible time with it between the hard water and trying to find a shampoo that would properly clean it, that I had been getting so frustrated that I was close to chopping it all off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to find out whether I&#x27;ll be using this as a daily shampoo, or more of a clarifying shampoo to use once or twice a week.  I&#x27;ll be experimenting a bit to see what my hair likes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is mild...smells slightly minty and botanical.  Does not smell perfumy or over-whelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, all that said...while this shampoo *is* sulfates-free, part of their \\&quot;Eco Chic\\&quot; product line, and contains organic oils...I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say that it is a completely all-natural product (though it doesn&#x27;t exactly claim to be).  The list of ingredients is a bit intimidating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Aqua (purified water) Aloe Barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, Sodium Cocoamphoacetate, Lauryl Glucoside, Sodium cocoyl glutamate, sodium lauryl glucose, carboxylate, decyl, pantehna, tocopheryl, acetate, polyguatenium7, potassium sorbate, citric acid, polysorbate 20, phenoxyethanol, Rosamarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, urtica dipca (nettle) extract, thymus vulgris (thyme) exttract, chamomilla recuita (malricaria) extract, salvia sclarea (clary) leaf extract, Lavandula angusifolia extract, achillea millefolium (yarrow) extract. equiseturn avense (jorsetail) extract, mentha viridis (spearmint) leaf oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of these things I have not clue as to what they could be.  Sodium lauryl glucose does sound very similar to sodium lauryl sulfate...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point I am personally past the point of caring about that too much.  It is not irritating my skin, and my hair loves it.  So for now I will over-look all the ingredients that look chemically.  But if an all-natural and chemical-free product is important to you, you may wish to look elsewhere.Eco Chic\\&quot; product line, and contains organic oils...I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say that it is a completely all-natural product (though it doesn&#x27;t exactly claim to be).

            <li> I have used this shampoo for years.  I have tried a number of organic/natural shampoos hoping to find something that would work for my long, fine, and very oily hair.  Nothing works as well as this for removing oils from the scalp without drying the ends of my hair.  I hope they never change or discontinue this product.  It has a lovely minty scent that doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s very concentrated compared to other shampoos, but I still need to wash twice.  The bottle lasts a while, and the price is great for the quality.  Highly recommend it!!!!  Leaves my hair shiny too :)</li>
            <li> I have very kinky hair but after my first wash with this shampoo, it has left my hair feeling very soft and not stripped off all the moisture. The ingredient list also looks very friendly. I have been using the Giovanni product line and no disappointments this far. This wheat shampoo too is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo.  Leaves my hair feeling clean and shiny without buildup.  Worth the extra cost.  Smells amazing!  Aromatherapy for your shower experience.</li>
            <li> I love Giovanni shampoos and conditioners - the Tea Tree one is my favorite, and this one is very good also.  Cleans well, doesn&#x27;t strip hair, leaves it very shiny and soft.  Rinses well.  Wish they made a companion conditioner - then I&#x27;d give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few months now and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed by it. I really like how my hair looks and feel. I am not planning on switching to other brand any time soon. Another reason why I like it is because although the quality is great, it&#x27;s vegan.</li>
            <li> My significant other uses this shampoo everyday and loves it.  We have found no other shampoo that can get hair this squeaky clean with no residue.  The only con is the price, definitely on the high end compared to other shampoos out there.</li>
            <li> Bought this without trying it, based on reviews and that the ingredients are not harmful. It is pretty good. Washes my hair and my children&#x27;s hair well. Think I found my new go to safe shampoo!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is lovely to use and I like the way it smells. It leaves my hair soft, clean and without buildup. It seems healthy for my hair, which is long and fine. I&#x27;m happy I found it.</li>
            <li> I really like how it smells. I also have trouble with oil in my hair and my hair is showing improvement with use. I know that part of my problem is the water where I live and the shampoo helps mitigate that and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. It lathers so nicely, smells nice and leaves my hair very clean. I notice that my hair isn&#x27;t as oily at the end of the day when I use this. Environmental Working Group rates it a 2 - love that.</li>
            <li> Bought this shampoo for my son. His hair is very oily and this seems to do the trick. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  I have an oily scalp, and long, fine hair.  My hair is prone to breakage and I highlight my hair with different shades of blond.  This product does not damage my hair, it does not strip the color and it helps with the oily scalp.  The shampoo is very watery and comes out fast.  I go through a bottle very quickly even without washing my hair every day.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find shampoo for oily hair and this stuff is great and it smells good. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for several years. I try something else and nothing works as good as this. Every time I try something else I regret it. This is wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a natural, vegan, SLS free shampoo for my oily hair for over a year, without any luck. Than, while wandering the shampoo aisle at Whole Foods, I cam across this shampoo. It looked like a high quality company, it wasn&#x27;t too expensive, and was formulated for oily hair, so I decided to give it a go. After using it for about a month, I am officially in love. It cleans my hair very well, doesn&#x27;t over dry it or cause dandruff, and leaves absolutely no build-up, even after a month&#x27;s use! (I did use an occasional ACV rinse to keep my hair soft, though.) My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good since I was using expensive, chemical-laden hair products. I will continue to buy, and I do recommend this product!</li>
            <li> wonderful shampoo for teens. Cleans oily hair without over drying it. However, do not use if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels great, smells good, is sulfate free and has made my hair healthier and longer. I love it and it is one of my staples.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does give a refresh feeling to your hair and it feels clean. It foams up easily and have a decent scent to it. However, it doesn&#x27;t really prevent your hair from getting oily, which is normal, I don&#x27;t think there is any shampoo can actually stop oily hairs just all marketing strategy.</li>
            <li> Giovanni shampoos, conditioners, and even styling products are amazing. If you&#x27;re looking for more natural, health and eco-conscious beauty products, try theirs; They&#x27;ve (as yet) been the most reliable brand I&#x27;ve found in hair care. I&#x27;ve used other brands (well known and otherwise/ cheaper and more expensive) and always come back to Giovanni for performance, and the assurance that if I use one of their products, I&#x27;ll at LEAST really like it, if not be in love with it. They must test these products out to excess, because every single one I&#x27;ve tried works, and works really well. And one major bonus to their products, in my opinion, is that they ALWAYS smell like natural botanicals, not like chemicals. They never make my sensitive nose react to the fragrance. The scents are never really strong, but they&#x27;re there, and they&#x27;re pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something that will really clean your hair and scalp, this shampoo is worth a shot. If you tend to be a little on the oily side, or like me, believe that you should let your hair get a little oily before you wash it, this shampoo may be the one for you. A lot of the natural shampoos have a difficult time competing with SLS products in terms of getting rid of oil and really making your hair and scalp feel clean. That&#x27;s harder to do when you aren&#x27;t using sulfates. This shampoo, however, does a great job. It&#x27;ll really clean your hair, but doesn&#x27;t go overboard. Not to mention the shine you&#x27;ll have. It looks like I used a shine serum when I didn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I prefer the Tea Tree shampoo they make. That one is number one for me in terms of cleansing. In my opinion, it cleanses even better, and allows me to wait just a little longer before washing. (I like to let the natural oils from my scalp moisturize and protect my hair.) This one is just a little less stripping, which is good if you&#x27;re washing more often. I would say this one is middle ground between the Tea Tree, which is really clarifying/cleansing, and the 50/50, which is more moisturizing. If you haven&#x27;t tried their products, give them a shot. For myself, I&#x27;ve been able to test all of their shampoos (except the Root 66, so far) and I like them all!</li>
            <li> This product is simply AWESOME! I have oily hair and always had problems where I would wash my hair with shampoo and then halfway through the day, it would get oily, wouldn&#x27;t feel good, and also felt messy and less manageable. I tried all kinds of hair products from Aveda to products from target that didn&#x27;t have good ingredients and they all didn&#x27;t help. I was also having dandruff issues and tried the Giovanni dandruff shampoo and while it helped some it didn&#x27;t solve the problem at large. I was originally reluctant at trying this because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would also help with my dandruff and I was tired of tirelessly spending money on hair products that weren&#x27;t working. Finally though, after all the products I tried, this one worked. And it worked perfectly! It removed the oil from my hair very well (after a few washes) and gave me all day relief from oily hair. And on top of that, it also helped with my minor issues with dandruff which I think the oil was making worse. My scalp feels great after using this stuff and it really got to the root of my problem! I love this product and I highly reccomend it to anyone with oily hair!</li>
            <li> I almost always order Giovanni shampoos and conditioners from Amazon, as they are a good product and good value in bulk. But this arrived with one of the shampoo bottles having half emptied itself all over all the other contents in the box. Now I&#x27;m always weary of ordering liquids. Really happy with this particular version of the shampoo though.</li>
            <li> I tried many, this works amazing, completely removes dirt and grease.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great.  I like the sulfate free element and it cleans and lathers nicely.  I have oily hair and shampoo every third day.  No matter what shampoo I use (with sulfates or sulfate free), I have to shampoo twice.  My hairdresser said the shampoo should froth when your hair is cleaned.  If its not lathering the first time, shampoo again to pick up the rest of the oil - and the second time I have better lather.  I also came across a nice lathering sulfate free shampoo at Aveda (Rosemary Mint), but I&#x27;ve not tried it enough times to give it a review.  With Giovanni shampoo I&#x27;ve needed a clarifying shampoo once in a while - that can also depend on my hormones because the clarifying need fluctuates.  I use Matrix Biolage Normalizing Shampoo (to balance normal to oily hair - it has sulfates - and I shampoo twice with this as well).</li>
