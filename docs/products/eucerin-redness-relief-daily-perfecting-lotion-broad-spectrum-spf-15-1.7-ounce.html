    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The results are flawless.  </li>
            <li>I put this on under a powder foundation, and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>but for best results you have to take the advice of what others are saying.  </li>
            <li>It did an excellent job concealing redness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like foundation where you can keep applying layers until everything looks perfect.</li>
            <li>I do have a very fair complexion, so maybe I&#x27;m just not used to seeing myself without the redness!  </li>
            <li>It also feels a bit dry--not nearly as wonderful as their night creme--</li>
            <li>so this product is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>The light-feeling moisturization this product provides is perfect for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to it being a sunscreen</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly.. wonderful product, but anything in their line seems to work well for me.</li>
            <li>This product provides excellent coverage for those suffering from Rosacea.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with my results.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t wear this alone, but it&#x27;s perfect when paired with a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the rosacea on my neck and chest.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>That worked best for me, anyway.</li>
            <li>I suffer from rosacea and this product is the best.</li>
            <li>For those with Rosacea this product is wonderful !</li>
            <li>a while when combining this with Calmin cleanser and Superfit Foundation my skin was perfect.</li>
            <li>The best product , I have found to relieve redness, also has SPF 15.</li>
            <li>As a man, I don&#x27;t want it to look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup, so was best used to &amp;#34;take</li>
            <li>The price is excellent, although the supplier charges tax (which we would have had to pay if purchased elsewhere).</li>
            <li>Very Happy with the Service</li>
            <li>lookd like they work the best together</li>

            <li>Good luck to all rosacea sufferers!</li>
            <li>good for rosacea!</li>
            <li>I have had very good results with this (not so good with the night cream).</li>
            <li>great product to try is Smashbox Photo</li>
            <li>Feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great day lotion if you are on accutane and need something that is non-comodegenic, non-irritating, and oil-free.</li>
            <li>Eucerin&#x27;s Redness Relief is great at allowing them to return outdoors after getting burned.  </li>
            <li>What a great product.</li>
            <li>: Don&#x27;t jump for joy when you see \\&quot;Redness Relief\\&quot; stamped on this bottle</li>
            <li>no miracles here...but a great product</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>This product is really a great product.  </li>
            <li>It does not do a great job reducing redness.</li>
            <li>Feels soothing and also has an SPF which is really great.  </li>
            <li>helps a great deal</li>
            <li>the pump is great too.</li>
            <li>The sellers were great too.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>All in all, great for day under makeup.</li>
            <li>This is a great face product.  </li>
            <li>It works great every time.  </li>
            <li>Works great to take the redness out.</li>
            <li>The difference is amazing, i&#x27;m so happy!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>This is also great under foundation.</li>
            <li>But it got great reviews, lots of people said it helped their redness.  </li>
            <li>(As a side note; the Garnier BB tinted moisterizer is great.</li>
            <li>Very nice product.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing!</li>
            <li>This is the best lotion that can be bought over the counter to reduce the appearance of redness, and I have tried many.</li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;re skin is impeccable and you don&#x27;t need any concealing beyond your redness, you may look like the Hulk with over application.</li>
            <li>I love it , it works great !</li>
            <li>Make sure to use this sparingly, and I also recommend to exfoliate the area before applying the lotion for best results.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite, and Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li>So, buy at your own risk but my advise, just stick with foundation!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I both have very fair skin, and very light skin can be prone to redness.</li>
            <li>The really good things about the product are that it works immediately, the bottle lasts quite a while and my skin doesn&#x27;t reject it.  </li>
            <li>The texture of the product is smooth and watery, bendable with the perfect amount of moisture for my AM routine.</li>
            <li>and I think does a good job of hiding a bit of redness all day.</li>
            <li>It also feels good.    </li>
            <li>I bought this with the night cream and moisturiser, those are both good</li>
            <li>It does a really good job of covering the redness, even on days I don&#x27;t wear foundation.</li>
            <li>I continue to look for a good moisturizer with spf(preferably 30 and over).</li>
            <li>I feel like my face does not look as good as with this on.</li>
            <li>But even makeup for fair skin never made me look quite like</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this product for the number of good reviews it has</li>
            <li>So then I have tan blotches on my fair skin tone.</li>
            <li>So I figured this redness relief would be a good option since I don&#x27;t wear makeup to cover up any blemishes or hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>Good product as always</li>
            <li>It will create a pasty whiteness until you get it rubbed in good</li>
            <li>Also has good spf</li>
            <li>it is a good hydrating and non-greasy moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This is a good lotion.</li>
            <li>He had gorgeous skin.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>I am very happy to have found this Eucerin product available through the  Amazon site.  </li>
            <li>The lotion did feel really good</li>
            <li>and I thought the smell was good.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy, it&#x27;s a perfect light moisturizer with the added benefit of hiding the ever-present redness of my skin.  </li>
            <li>So that is good.</li>
            <li>TO GOOD</li>
            <li>bought this because I figured the redness wash is wonderful and very soothing, so this would work great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for spot touch ups and men will be able to use this product as well.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>She is very pleased with this product and would</li>
            <li>but that isn&#x27;t very appealing as a guy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked great way better then</li>
            <li>The lotion is nice and silky, it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out, and it is really a good value for an all-in-one moisturizer, primer, and SPF lotion.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- Effectively moisturizes and provides good sun protection</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>You will love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>My favorite day cream I have ever used!</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic!  </li>
            <li>This lotion is not a cure or treatment for rosacea, but it sure helps cosmetically!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Though, admittedly I will keep using this product even if it does nothing to my skin underneath, it is amazing for under makeup or just by itself to cut redness.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The licorice extract, or whatever it is that reduces redness, is amazing.</li>
            <li>These products are amazing.  </li>
            <li>I do use their night cream as well which is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It relieved the warm sensation on my face.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to find something that helps instead of irritates.</li>
            <li>This is a nice non-irratating product.</li>
            <li>Just make sure not to slather it on, blend well, and you should be good to go.</li>
            <li>Just not quite as good as implied. :)</li>
            <li>They dont help the redness but they make the skin feel nice.    </li>
            <li>lotion kind of works.</li>
            <li>to say how effective this is.</li>
            <li>it is nice ,and I like it, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it .</li>
            <li>Does a good job at taking any of my redness away, and smells like sun tan oil-one of my favorite smells.</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>It is moderately effective but it has some negatives that you have to consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My redness is kind of blotchy, so I just dabbed it on the reddest spots.</li>
            <li>He is relieved that he can now continue getting the product that has proven so beneficial and effective for him.  </li>
            <li>They hurt like hell and if I cover them up with makeup of any kind they burn.</li>
            <li>Feels nice.</li>
            <li>It evens out my skin tone and gives everything a nice matte, porcelain finish.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and beautifully.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very easy to blend into your skin.</li>
            <li>Very good, very moist, but not Concealer</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it covers the redness perfectly, but I am very happy to have found a decent, oil-free lotion to mask my rosacea and give me a more natural look on no-foundation days.</li>
            <li>Nice lotion, like most Eucerin.</li>
            <li>but it goes on smoothly and feels good to the touch.</li>
            <li>I have a bit of rosacea and sensitive skin and this moisturizer is excellent.</li>
            <li>Best product I have found so far.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t absorb well, kind of sat on top of my skin</li>
            <li>Thanks for a good product!</li>
            <li>Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion SPF 15, 1.7 Ounce Bottle, this product gave me very good results, good thing I found it .</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like sunscreen, whish is not that attractive in my opinion.</li>
            <li>your know, almost too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Very light and no smell.</li>
            <li>(but doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen when its on your face), and it feels very light...</li>
            <li>I wish I could find one more suitable for my skin type that blends better.</li>
            <li>Very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It works great, Thanks</li>
            <li>It also works well under foundation if you want more coverage.</li>
            <li>I do love this product.  </li>
            <li>I like the Dermarest much better</li>
            <li>Better deal here than at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with the way it absorbs as well.</li>
            <li>I needed this for my Rosales and it seems like it is okay.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I think I noticed it, others I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li>It feels more like sunblock than lotion.</li>
            <li>Just be prepared to play with it a bit and after it absorbs into the skin it looks much better.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>however, I think its better used for people with fairer skin.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok and does provide some protection from the sun.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>#34;Oh my god, are you ok?  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s some things to love about this lotion and there&#x27;s some things to sigh over, here are my pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems more like a redness coverup formula.</li>
            <li>So, as a masking lotion, I would have hoped for better results.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Most people say they don&#x27;t notice it, but it&#x27;s something that bothers me.</li>
            <li>I had much, much better luck with Triderma MD rosacea repair cream.</li>
            <li>You can always apply more if needed.  </li>
            <li>Coverage will be just okay</li>
            <li>Im looking to maybe purchase more Eucerin products.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything better.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again because makeup does a better job of making me look \\&quot;normal.\\</li>
            <li>So, although I love it, I wish it protected my face for longer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>was advised to use a factor 50 sunblock and so have to use another product on top of the moisturiser.</li>
            <li>it also works okay with foundation.</li>
            <li>If you wear foundation or concealer every day, you might have better luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Be sure to rub it in, and you&#x27;ve got a miracle moisturizing regime.</li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>sure I have rosacea.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just telling what seems to have worked for me.  :-)</li>
            <li>Fabulous product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s strength is it&#x27;s weakness though, like many things.  </li>
            <li>also love that it&#x27;s a moisturizer and sunscreen as well.</li>
            <li>Have used this for many years.</li>
            <li>, I have never used the redness relief before and LOVE IT..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the results and I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something more permanent.</li>
            <li>Witch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product from ULTA originally, but see that Amazon has a much better price!  </li>
            <li>Glad to find this online.  </li>
            <li>It has no scent:)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and really does help reduce redness on the face.</li>
            <li>This lotion is perfect to normalize your red patches on face.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love you, Eucerin.</li>
            <li>am so pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I am a repeat customer and will continue using this product I love the results.</li>
            <li>I ended up with more redness than I had before it.</li>
            <li>could pay doublethe price for a more convenient lotion</li>
            <li>I have been using this moisturizer for years and love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite under-makeup sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>However, we had not been able to locate it anywhere, since not one pharmacy or retail stores carries it any longer within our area and surroundings.  </li>
            <li>It may work for some people, but I sure didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>After a couple weeks, the redness never got better</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Great product - thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products some that cost a lot more and none have worked this well.  </li>
            <li>I can control it most of the time</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>ok as that.</li>
            <li>I suggest taking off the top when it will no longer come out of the pump and \\&quot;dig\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>and I sincerely hope they don&#x27;t tweak the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was so thankful when I found it an amazon and for such a great price!</li>
            <li>more so I could have found it sooner.  </li>
            <li>It may be a good sunscreen, but I really have had exposure to see how effective that is.</li>
            <li>Quite frankly, it seems more like makeup than a skincare product.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>i bought it online because i cnt find it in stores any more.</li>
            <li>and it stained my cheeks permanently red and under my makeup this is flawless.</li>
            <li>I just wish it was more cream like and felt moisturizing, but I just put a moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li>I like the Clinique better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to make sure to just put a dot on my face.</li>
            <li>since I was a baby, but it went away for most of my childhood and resurfaced when I was 12/13 or so.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll just jump to the point real quick:</li>
            <li>I still need to figure out how to apply it convincingly</li>
            <li>I love the way it evens my skin tone and protects me from the sun.</li>
            <li>The product just sat on top of my skin providing no moisturizing affect and keeping</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work very well the first time I used it, but after that it was great!</li>
            <li>I tried this product based on pretty good reviews.</li>
            <li>This is a super nice product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how easily this works,  </li>
            <li>The cleanser is amazing; my skin feels so calm after washing;</li>
            <li>I have that trademark fair skin that redheads have, and it gets more and more sensitive as the years pass, so the idea of \\&quot;redness relief\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Also love that its fragrance free..</li>
            <li>but I have absolutely nothing good to say about it.</li>
            <li>I use a prescription cream morning and night, which I don&#x27;t think does much good until I don&#x27;t use it, then I really notice the redness.  </li>
            <li>I have a fair complexion and a very noticeable amount of redness</li>
            <li>and it really does do a good job moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a BAD moisturizer with SPF, in fact, it may be the best one in my cabinet, but it also doesn&#x27;t bring anything exciting or new to the table.</li>
            <li>If you or a loved one has rosacea, I STRONGLY and HIGHLY recommend this Eucerin product!  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t look perfect and remove every sign of redness and other imperfections, but it does help quite a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>TO BE TRUE!  </li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and stayed on well.</li>
            <li>I do appreciate the non-plastic bottle and easy to use pump dispenser.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, not perfum-y (important for sensitive skin that can react to perfumes with more redness).</li>
            <li>but I after a week, this is just as easy to do.  </li>
            <li>Our local stores don&#x27;t carry this anymore, so I&#x27;m happy to be able to get it online.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned with mild to moderate Rosacea &amp; gave it a try because it was fairly inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I am older (60s), fair, freckled so like this product.  </li>
            <li>Broad Spectrum SPF 15 great combo.</li>
            <li>I have a full review &amp; video on my blog if you&#x27;d like to hear more about my thoughts on this product:  </li>
            <li>(less is best)</li>
            <li>it was fine though redness was still somewhat visible</li>
            <li>IT is soothing, not too greasy, and goes on fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine line there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it does a good job moisturizing and would be suitable for daily use.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been using a combination of Crisco and petroleum jelly and it&#x27;s worked fine, but we&#x27;re talking Crisco and PB here</li>
            <li>I believe it more than masks the redness - it does in fact have a mild impact on the underlying causes of the redness.        </li>
            <li>Luckily, Walgreens takes refunds on cosmetic products, so I was able to return it.</li>
            <li>stuff and a little powder did an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yeah - my title is accurate.  </li>
            <li>It does not feel heavy or greasy and is perfect for moisturizing under my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I have used this marvelous product for many years and panic completely when I cannot find it in my local drugstore.</li>
            <li>lightly powder w/ a translucent face powder 5)</li>
            <li>lightly mist my face with water and let set again.</li>
            <li>how lightly I applied it.</li>
            <li>I got free samples from my dermatologist and I have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li>I found this product making my face tone appear lighter, this is great , I don&#x27;t need to apply BB cream anymore and still look like I was fully rested last night.</li>
            <li>This lotion is non-irritating, light, non-oily, etc.</li>
            <li>Within a week I could see a noticeable improvement, and after three weeks my face is smooth and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and makes my skin feel silky.</li>
            <li>this does and even better job at decreasing the redness and leaves a more matte-like appearance; more natural looking.</li>
            <li>this product plus the night cream combined with two IPL laser treatments made my skin golden and healthy again.</li>
            <li>You can imagine how happy I was to find the Eucerin Soothing Cleanser - at last I could feel like my skin being cleaned without burning or irritation!</li>
            <li>know everyone&#x27; skin situation is different, so these products may or may not work for you, but they have been great for me.</li>
            <li>It provides light, all-day moisture and UV protection while reducing visible redness and blotchiness, for an even-toned complexion.</li>
            <li>The lotion moisturizes well, goes on smooth, and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I hope this product is available forever.</li>
            <li>Eucerin Redness Relief does a fantastic job of dulling/neutralizing my redness on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Light feeling and does the trick.  </li>
            <li>Great product, helped my skin heal from working outside.</li>
            <li>The doctor who did the procedure provided free product which was some name brand and</li>
            <li>Use it lightly as a calming concealer in the day.</li>
            <li>Then, I lightly apply it to the areas around my nose and mouth.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t cheap out and try a bunch of brands like this..</li>
            <li>Next time I will buy clinque; although it costs more I liked it much better.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great for my red face</li>
            <li>and I have finally found a great combo that works for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has the consistency and smell of sunscreen, and it is a light grass-green color.</li>
            <li>Being fair skinned, I hoped that this might alleviate some problems when they aroused.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed a significant reduction in redness</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m amazed at how fast and well this worked for me! :-)))</li>
            <li>I wish there was a higher SPF in this product, but I feel better by mixing it with the Aveeno SPF 30.</li>
            <li>I have minor rosacea localized to my nose, and this product does a great job of covering up the redness and evening out the skin tone.</li>
            <li>It has significantly reduced redness in my face.  </li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Or maybe I was too excited that it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had several people comment that my face looks better and that they&#x27;re impressed with my appearance (i lost like 30 lbs recently so that helps, too).</li>
            <li>(i&#x27;d really appreciate any advice for that!), but it&#x27;s worked leagues better than anything else</li>
            <li>this stuff works, I use with the cleanser and night cream and skin is much better, I gave 4 stars because I wish it had higher SPF</li>
            <li>- I mix with my usual moisturizer for best results.</li>
            <li>This lotion does pretty good job on covering redness to some degree, it protects my skin from sun and, the most important thing, it does not irritate my skin, as so many other lotions I tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line..if you enjoy looking like a pale version of \\&quot;The Incredible Hulk\\&quot; then go ahead &amp; give the Eucerin a try..</li>
            <li>I do see anything special about it at all.</li>
            <li>This is a lightweight lotion that applies easily, has a mild scent, and would be useful for women or men.</li>
            <li>Love eucerin products but this one, not so much.</li>
            <li>I gave it a full month trial.</li>
            <li>It was kind to my skin, leaving it soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a naturally dark skinned male and was a bit apprehensive about trying this product since most people seem to have fair skin that have the redness problem and have given good reviews for this product.</li>
            <li>Overall I think its a good product</li>
            <li>I have extremely fair skin and red undertones that I would like to minimize.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved Eucerin products but this just simply does not work at all for me.</li>
            <li>I have used many products over the years-most don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>I have used all of the redness relief products and this one has really helped me feel better about showing my face.</li>
            <li>and it really helps to neutralize the redness and helps my makeup cover better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is absolutely one of my favorite skincare/cosmetic products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years and am so delighted to get it on Amazon, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li>It can make your skin oily, but after a number of weeks, my skin was able to adjust or use oil absorbing paper/sheets.</li>
            <li>so thought I&#x27;d try it out full size.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for several months, and I discovered that my face looked good if I didn&#x27;t use sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years to reduce redness and it works fairly well.  </li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t get them to cool</li>
            <li>I have perpetually red skin and my complexion is fair</li>
            <li>It also seemed to sweat off easily, and would gather in the wrinkle lines on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because if I didn&#x27;t mind the green tint, I would have been happy with the feel of this product.</li>
            <li>Only then you realize its great positive qualities</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, and you don&#x27;t need much!  </li>
            <li>After several weeks of daily use I am very pleased with this product and hope that I continue to have good luck with it.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li>The product smells great and goes on smoothly, without leaving any green tinted streaks.</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t put more then a tiny dab on too, otherwise you&#x27;ll look like the hulk (unless thats the look you&#x27;re going for).</li>
            <li>I can then then apply my mineral powder foundation as the Eucerin Perfecting Lotion absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I have rosacea, just mild redness</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m lucky</li>
            <li>It helps the redness more if I use a couple squirts instead of just one and rub it in good that way your face won&#x27;t look green.</li>
            <li>Gentle, good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And it comes out of the pump bottle quickly....</li>
            <li>I have a mild case of rosecea and this products works for me.</li>
            <li>I need either foundation and/ or a redness reducing powder to adequately cover my redness</li>
            <li>My rosacae is mild according to the doctor.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was the Eucerin or the combination of Eucerin and Epsom salts, but one or both of them helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li>The spf is really mild though.</li>
            <li>This lightweight lotion absorbs quickly into my skin, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy, contains SPF 15 and hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li>it blends quickly into your skin and cancels out redness without making you look like Shrek or the Wicked</li>
            <li>I am much more confident and overall</li>
            <li>/&gt;It absorbs quickly, has an SPF</li>
            <li>I quickly applied my home remedy and the irritation vanished.</li>
            <li>This lotion does reduce the look of redness, but it needs to be blended in quickly because it gets thicker as it sits.</li>
            <li>Going back to Clinique, much more money, but works much better.</li>
            <li>I also liked that there was no real perfum added, so it is good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But the best way is to do it one area at a time, starting with somewhat moistened (&amp; clean) skin; not bone dry skin.</li>
            <li>If you get the light or medium color added it will cover up the redness also pretty well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was okay, but I think the daily moisterizer and night cream are far superior.</li>
            <li>On top of helping with the scaring it has kept new blemishes from popping up.  </li>
            <li>I have reddish skin, and can flush bright red after eating hot food or drink or alcohol.  </li>
            <li>but I saw this product for half the cost which was attractive.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very creamy and easy to blend.</li>
            <li>pretty good, but not hydrated enough</li>
            <li>It is a pretty good facial sunscreen I guess.</li>
            <li>I have definitely seen a difference in the redness of my face (for the better!)</li>
            <li>The first one to make any noticeable difference!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having much better results and NO green color!</li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy this product as much as I have.</li>
            <li>Light and rubs in fast</li>
            <li>this green tinted moisturizer is great.</li>
            <li>The SPF is nice, but unless your face is red everywhere, you are going to need a separate SPF product.</li>
            <li>, it actually helps the redness itself and gives a nice glow to your skin in the morning.</li>
            <li>On good days, the lotion is completely effective, on bad days it&#x27;s not as effective.  </li>
            <li>As far as I can tell the lotion is ok.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because the smell is medicinal-which I don&#x27;t care for, but the results are worth the smell.</li>
            <li>I also love the Eucerin Q10 cream—it has never made me breakout with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So this lotion has a distinct smell of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t determed yet if this will be the case, but it seems ok thus far.</li>
            <li>This product is pricey but worth every cent.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>My face is definitely more clear since I&#x27;ve been using it, but here&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Once it was absorbed into my skin, I could see the difference immediately.  </li>
            <li>I believe this product is worth a try.</li>
            <li>I do love the gel cleanser for sensitive skin, and the night cream too.</li>
            <li>I expected way more better results form this cream .</li>
            <li>This products evens out the red skin tones and allows the application of &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; make-up to be effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even worth one star.</li>
            <li>Very milky clean fresh feeling after using.</li>
            <li>Goes on clean and light, no heavy perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically a coverup and moisturizer, goes on easily and quickly and blends well for a natural looking, normal-colored skin.</li>
            <li>and I am good to go without any other makeup.</li>
            <li>I like that it evens my skin tone, specially on days when my skin is more red.</li>
            <li>Mixing it works just right for me.</li>
            <li>is right.  </li>
            <li>tried product and noticed the odor right away.</li>
            <li>glass bottle with a pump that dispenses just the right amount.  </li>
            <li>and I end up sweating this right off.</li>
            <li>Gave it a four right now</li>
            <li>Right after the shower is when I apply this.  </li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m suffering with hives on my face resulting from a bug bite.  </li>
            <li>I like the design of the glass bottle, and the dispenser spits out just the right amount.  </li>
            <li>In my early 40s, I developed a very mild case of rosacea that&#x27;s aggravated by ingredients in most anti-aging serums, lotions and creams.</li>
            <li>I do appreciate that it has sunscreen in it -- great for daily use -- but is it really fair to say that the sunscreen essentially accounts for its \\&quot;redness-relieving\\&quot; quality (since the marketing here is carefully worded)?</li>
            <li>I have light skin and red shows up easily  </li>
            <li>I tried it on several friends, and it works best on slightly darker skin tones .  </li>
            <li>Being a natural redhead I found this product to work perfectly with my natural pink tint.</li>
            <li>After over 1 month use, I have found, however, it&#x27;s more effective as a surface color correction under makeup because of the green tint, but not so much as a real treatment over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product was recommended by my Dermatologist and it&#x27;s a good one for anyone who has redness of the face they would like to tone down.</li>
            <li>You apply it lightly to the red areas, rubbing it lightly in, in my case to my cheeks and nose and then apply foundation and powder.</li>
            <li>Such a great product &amp; inexpensive to help conceal facial redness.</li>
            <li>It made a great base for my makeup and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>Super fast company that shipped it here too.</li>
            <li>The lotion is a good cover up , but it doesn&#x27;t relief the redness as much like i expected it too.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer looked very promising, as both a cover and a treatment.</li>
            <li>It is very effective, and especially helps when he occasionally gets a flare-up.  </li>
            <li>but but if you have super dry skin that should be ok.  </li>
            <li>He has very dry, very red skin on his face - the first time he put this on, it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>positive is that it does provide sunscreen and that seems effective with limited use.</li>
            <li>Not as effective as I expected.</li>
            <li>This product even at first use neutralized any uneveness my skin had.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically a love it or leave it mechanism that will be well/ill received based on your personal taste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my makeup looks better and stays on longer in comparison to my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I found this product to be similar to many tinted primers that are on the market today.  </li>
            <li>I love it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>read about this stuff, and I tried it for the first time today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>greenish tint in the moisturizer is a bit off-putting at first, but you do need to use it sparingly</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t emphasize enough how much I love all of Eucerin&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>Need something more for red blotches.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this first as it caught my curiosity.</li>
            <li>Now, instead of fighting just the facial redness, I am fighting the redness and many blemishes that appeared as a result of using this product.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more of a marketing ploy than an actual product designed to reduce redness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it consistently for four weeks on a couple of reddish skin patches, not sunburn.  </li>
            <li>First, let me say that the product does do what it claims it does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since Christmas (it&#x27;s February now), and it&#x27;s not making my overall redness any better.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to wear makeup, and that is sadly not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I feel OK about going out in public.  </li>
            <li>Then I very generously slathered on the lotion (too much to be absorbed), and waited about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several weeks and am quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>This product felt calming at first use - and along with the cleanser and night cream it solved my embarrassing redness.</li>
            <li>The SPF is just an added bonus ;)</li>
            <li>This lotion really works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dealt with swollen, red cheeks for many years now.</li>
            <li>I found this out the first day I used it.  </li>
            <li>i have been using this product for exactly one week now</li>
            <li>/&gt;Decent stuff, but not my favorite product and will only keep for emergencies if needed for cover up if I have a flare up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this lotion alone, over another moisturizer with a higher spf, and also under foundation.  </li>
            <li>I blush a lot and this lotion really helps minimize all my redness!</li>
            <li>Seemed to help at first</li>
            <li>First of all, it is not moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Euerin</li>
            <li>I think the Clinique wasn&#x27;t as bright green as this product.  </li>
            <li>First you have to learn how to use it and get used to it.</li>
            <li>in that it causes severe facial redness, but it&#x27;s a much more consistent redness</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s something you should be aware of.&lt;br</li>
            <li>apply a bit of it on affected areas and then apply makeup for a smooth clear appearance.</li>
            <li>This does have some good qualities, but the green tint is not for me.</li>
            <li>At any rate, it&#x27;s not very expensive and is worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a product like this to solve your redness problems.</li>
            <li>It would be ok, except it doesn&#x27;t go on quite as smooth as normal face lotion and since my skin is kinda dry, i tend to have to mix some of my face lotion in with it which then decreases the amount of redness it can cover.</li>
            <li>this helps the scales and the redness making my skin condition more comfortable and less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to finally find something to reduce redness.  </li>
            <li>unless I used so little as to be ineffective for masking red, the lotion did show and didn&#x27;t look very good.  </li>
            <li>Under a broad coverage foundation, it looks fine.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s allot more expensive but it lasts a long time &amp; works wonderful.</li>
            <li>It helps tremendously with redness and does not cause acne like other creams I&#x27;ve tried. :)</li>
            <li>My wife had been using Aveeno Calming to manage her mild Rosacea but wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li>After using it 2 weeks my skin is less red, but my rosacea flares up and gets better on its own, so I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s the product.</li>
            <li>But for early stage rosacea where symptoms are basically warm discomfort and red complexion - it works.</li>
            <li>It might work very well for people whose skin is dryer than mine or has more redness, but I don&#x27;t want to have to use one lotion for the red parts of my skin and another for the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>most of my redness is gone thanks to my argan facial oil, so i dont think i&#x27;ll use this product again though.</li>
            <li>This cream goes on light green (which you have to rub in or let absorb), which I LOVE because it balances the redness of my face</li>
            <li>This product will make you look pale if you do more than lightly spot treat.</li>
            <li>The only time it isn&#x27;t helpful is on hot humid days when it sweats off easily</li>
            <li>I ended up on many occasions spending more time outside than expected and getting my face burnt.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for the redness, which is really the point of using it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does a nice job of toning it down, and like another reviewer commented, this would work well under your foundation.  </li>
            <li>are reducing redness and easy to apply, with no greasy residue left on skin.&lt;br /&gt;Guys</li>
            <li>It is in fact a heck of a lot more comfortable to wear than the pancake makeup I usually have to use which feels like I&#x27;m smearing lard on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have really dry skin use another moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li>: If you have large pores or acne scars, this product will VISIBLY CLOG your pores -</li>
            <li>/&gt;*AVOID USING LARGE AMOUNTS</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because if your skin wasn&#x27;t acne prone, I would certainly use it.</li>
            <li>I have the type with both redness in certain areas and also bumps.</li>
            <li>i use one pump to cover up just certain areas of redness on the face or two to reduce redness everywhere.</li>
            <li>and I have large pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never put this on in a large area again.</li>
            <li>Most of the time it looks pretty obvious in the right lighting because I&#x27;m still not sure how to make it look convincing.</li>
            <li>and i got very fair skin and work in a hot factory, just judging by this past week i have noticed not been as red and even haven&#x27;t felt as much of the sensitivity that i normal would feel while i&#x27;m working, i would recommend this product</li>
            <li>I swear that I could fill a soup bowl with skin lotion, stick my elbows in it, and the bowl would be sucked dry in a matter of minutes! :-)</li>
            <li>The product is fine, it does have some greenish tint to it, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything to alieve those tiny capillaries.  </li>
            <li>The main ingredient is pretty interesting(licorice), read about it, might explain the lighter skin...</li>
            <li>, i have to make sure i exfoliate enough because the color of this lotion will settle on dry patches, but it does leave a nice complexion instead of the red undertones and doesnt leave my combo skin greasy or parched in places.</li>
            <li>if anything it may make the skin look a little paler on its own</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to putting a nice little glob on my fingertips then smoothing it all over my face.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on higher priced tone correctors, you will not need them!</li>
            <li>This lotion is very dry and didn&#x27;t cover up nor do any good to the slightly red area around my nose.</li>
            <li>I add a little to the daily spf 30 moisterizer by Eucerin with great results.</li>
            <li>The lotion is a light green that applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>The green pigment is great for covering red skin.</li>
            <li>It really does cover any redness you have across cheeks, nose or chin area.  </li>
            <li>It is very soothing.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t very redness relieving though.</li>
            <li>so it is not so noticeable, but it really does help</li>
            <li>, one area at a time and don&#x27;t try to do your whole face at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You look like you&#x27;re ready to pass out!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>This produce is the bomb for rosacia and redness, covers and improves skin appearance, very soothing and healing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t really \\&quot;reduce\\&quot; redness, just masks it</li>
            <li>I tried eucerine because it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This product really helps to lessen the redness and keeps the dryness in check.</li>
            <li>Of something you really can&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product and the price</li>
            <li>It feels like putting sunscreen on your face, which doesn&#x27;t much surprise me, since it does contain SPF 15.</li>
            <li>After trying the Eucerin Redness Relief face wash, I was very eager to try this product.  </li>
            <li>It soaks into your skin in a reasonable amt of time and sometimes I&#x27;ll just use this when I don&#x27;t feel like putting on all of my makeup</li>
            <li>Thanks Eucerin</li>
            <li>I really like that this product has sunscreen</li>
            <li>Also, it isn&#x27;t very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>After letting it cool, I gently washed my face with a wet, cool washcloth.  </li>
            <li>Instead of rubbing it in, I patted it, which helped cover the redness very well.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much at ALL.  </li>
            <li>One day, I went biking for an hour, and I came home expecting to see very flushed cheeks.</li>
            <li>It spreads so much because the skin can&#x27;t absorb any of it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>When I have a flare up, I use this cream and it helps so much.</li>
            <li>However, in my experience it doesn&#x27;t really make much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>I find I have to put on my normal face lotion first, and then put on this after.</li>
            <li>cause don&#x27;t know if it really helps the problem.</li>
            <li>Absolutely works, I call this product my miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 5 days now and my cheeks are much lighter and smoother.</li>
            <li>, my face feels nourished and really hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>It really worked.</li>
            <li>The pump bottle is well made but do be careful as the pump is more projectile than not.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really just masking the redness.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After this I went straight to Ulta and tried Mario Badescu&#x27;s anti-redness package.  </li>
            <li>So I just moisturized when absolutely needed.  </li>
            <li>I really bought into the \\&quot;redness relief\\&quot; promise and just figured I couldn&#x27;t solve it.</li>
            <li>It just takes a thin layer over my face and neck to greatly reduce the appearance of the redness.  </li>
            <li>If you put too much on it does look greenish until it is absorbed, but under foundation this isn&#x27;t a problem since the green counters the redness and helps give the foundation a more even color.  </li>
            <li>And I really like that I can wear it alone or with whatever else</li>
            <li>but sometimes they just heat up so much</li>
            <li>I have now tried Aveeno Postitively Radiant lotion that I really like.</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t really cover the redness either.</li>
            <li>Though, I don&#x27;t think it is doing a whole lot for my rosacea.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen much redness relief.</li>
            <li>blusher(that is a real thing haha)</li>
            <li>I find I don&#x27;t have to use as much cover up.</li>
            <li>This product comes out too much at one time.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;relieve\\&quot; the redness so much as mask</li>
            <li>Very peculiar Lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the night cream in the same line and it makes my face all smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really improved my confidence knowing that I don&#x27;t look like a sunburnt lobster every time I go out in</li>
            <li>in the end, I do REALLY like this product and what it&#x27;s done for my face.</li>
            <li>on my face at times it is very drying.</li>
            <li>So very dissappointed.  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>It works well but needs to be mixed with regular moisturizer, any kind.  </li>
            <li>The lotion has a green undertone that can be quite effective at minimizing redness if used under a foundation.  </li>
            <li>My skin tends to be red and sensitive from product overuse and too many glycol peelings....</li>
            <li>This has a green tint to it, but not all that effective in covering redness.</li>
            <li>Since Superfit was discontinued it hasn&#x27;t been quite so good, but at least I know which product is causing the problem.</li>
            <li>It is not perfect, but it is the best so far.</li>
            <li>I naturally have pale, porcelain skin, so this works great for me at restoring my skin closer to its natural color.</li>
            <li>Many don;t like its rather dry texture and green colouring, but this has been the first moisturiser I&#x27;ve ever been able to tolerate.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>However, I gave it four stars because it&#x27;s better than any other product I have used.</li>
            <li>facial redness has been reduced significantly.</li>
            <li>you suffer from redness or have a lot red tones in your skin, then this product is worth trying!</li>
            <li>I still enjoy other Eucerin products, this guy just wasn&#x27;t right for my skin type.</li>
            <li>When I put my makeup on over it, it looked fine to start, but throughout the day it would start to cake and look strange.  </li>
            <li>Probably fine for a climate other than hot humid South Florida, but does not let my skin breath</li>
            <li>I discontinued using the night creame, but continue to use the lotion as it does a good job making my skin look significantly less red by masking it.  </li>
            <li>The very first time I put the light green lotion on my cheeks, I had an instantaneous result.</li>
            <li>I can not stress enough how much I dislike this product &amp; I tried many ways of using it, finally gave up &amp; threw it out.</li>
            <li>So overall, not a bad experience.</li>
            <li>I have very fair, sensitive dry skin that is VERY cool-toned, which brings a lot of pink into my skin especially on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>But, mixed with equal parts tinted moisturizer (like Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moist with SPF 30), the Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion does a great job of neutralizing some of the redness.</li>
            <li>You can always try a travel size sold on many sites at half</li>
            <li>I think you need quite a dry oil free moisturiser for Rosacea.</li>
            <li>anytime I knew I was going to be outside, but disliking the way most facial sunscreens felt, greasy and oily, I wouldn&#x27;t use them as often as I should.</li>
            <li>look like I have a decent sunburn.  </li>
            <li>I was recently prescribed MetroCream by my dermatologist for some mild rosacea which gives me redness across my nose and cheeks.  </li>
            <li>If I use it daily, my skin the next day appears more even-toned.</li>
            <li>think it did a decent job of neutralizing the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am using the night cream as an AM &amp; PM treatment and I really recommend it instead and just using a green tinted primer on top for make up purposes.</li>
            <li>I have very red cheeks, sometimes with bumps, but mostly just red flare-ups from weather, heat, spicy food or alcohol.</li>
            <li>The green tint is helpful in covering the redness, and then I put my regular foundation over it and it looks good.</li>
            <li>I quickly washed the lotion off and the area was so irritated and when I looked in the mirror the lines were screaming fire engine red</li>
            <li>Much better than the Clinique product I used to use (which was also much more expensive, mind you).</li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s soft and you don&#x27;t need to use too much to cover the whole face.</li>
            <li>I love Eucerin products in general, so would recommend this brand  to anyone with red, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have struggled with acne and oily skin since I was a teenager, but now that I&#x27;m older, I tend to have clear skin except for breakouts at certain times of the month, which coincide with my menstrual cycle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the redness relief range for roscea.</li>
            <li>/&gt;FYI, I have been using the companion product, Eucerin Soothing Cleanser, for about 7 weeks and would highly recommend it for redness relief.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone who needs a bit</li>
            <li>I lose that beautiful tan and am left with a pale, red-toned facial skin color.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job of covering up the red by using a green color base, but don&#x27;t expect a perfect red-free complexion.</li>
            <li>After two days my skin is looking a little better (or maybe placebo effect?</li>
            <li>This is a lighter moisturizer, so if you&#x27;re looking for something heavy to gloop on your face at night, this likely won&#x27;t fit, but I do see there is a nighttime moisturizer available in this product line.</li>
            <li>It really helps with my sensitive face.</li>
            <li>I mix it with my normal face cream</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer, it makes my skin soft without being greasy and the green tint really evens out your skin.</li>
            <li>It does a good job covering red face, but if your face is very red, it will make it pink.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of tinted mineral spf creams and even mineral make-up with sunscreen that I prefer to use because I only have to put on one product that covers the red with a more natural color.</li>
            <li>On several sites regarding skin care for Rosacea prone skin, I read that this product is useful for calming the skin.  </li>
            <li>Helpful only to a minor degree although better than nothing.</li>
            <li>The green does counteract the redness somewhat, making it look more tan colored.</li>
            <li>can see how this product might have good intentions for those who suffer from redness, but the chemical sunscreens used in the product made my situation worse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lotion is nice though and not too thick.</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t always completely cover up the redness, it helps to tone it down so that when I put on makeup, I can better cover the redness.  </li>
            <li>Better off using plain ole yellow concealer (not green) to cover your red before applying makeup...haven&#x27;t found anything to top that yet.</li>
            <li>never want to look more pale than I have to just to mask the redness.  </li>
            <li>I have a mild case of roscacea, coupled with periodic eczema and overall sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and with one use my skin felt soft and no longer was red and irritated.</li>
            <li>I LOVE their face wash and night cream, though, and my skin is overly sensitive, so I can&#x27;t give it less than a 3 star.</li>
            <li>I pump it right on the back of my hand.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I found I can get it at Amazon, but you don&#x27;t often have to buy it because it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>After trying many, many products to control the KP on my young son&#x27;s face, I was hoping this would help clear the redness and bumps, but unfortunately, it did not work for him.</li>
            <li>considering using a good, very light self tanner to see if that helps make the redness less noticeable (by making my normal skin tone not quite so pale - less contrast).</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on smooth, but I&#x27;ve noticed that it isn&#x27;t compatible with other lotions</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on like any other type of light lotion, but it has a greenish tint to it.  </li>
            <li>I will always buy this product, unless something else new appears.</li>
            <li>I am seasonal and live in FL and MN.  </li>
            <li>Try new face products on days you don&#x27;t plan on leaving the house.  </li>
            <li>Just mentioning to save you time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosacea is a relatively new development in my life.  </li>
            <li>This is a product I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>Almost nothing triggers it now, and even if it does, the redness is nowhere near as extreme as it was, and it disappears very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazingly efficient, as it spreads thinly and one doesn&#x27;t need to use much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; my sensitive  skin generally cannot tolerate any SPF higher than that.  </li>
            <li>If you have super dry skin, moisturize before using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did; the Eucerin product isn&#x27;t really a moisturizer, at least for my 66-year-old skin, so using both is the answer.  </li>
            <li>but, alas, I will continue to use this product because it does SUCH a great job.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and when the weather is changing so does my skin.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for anyone at any age with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like this actually does very much.</li>
            <li>The summer time can be brutal on the skin, and fair skinned people like my wife and son get burned very easily in this Texas heat.  </li>
            <li>In my case I have very sensitive facial skin, especially on my forehead, and finally realized I must be allergic to ingredients in many lotions, creams and sunscreens - even had a severe reaction to Metrogel when I tried it for a couple days.</li>
            <li>For me, however, it&#x27;s exactly what I needed to get my confidence back.</li>
            <li>I have used it several times and the first thing I look for is the grease level.</li>
            <li>It definitely covers up the problem a bit when you first apply it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have rosacea, but I do turn red often: when I&#x27;m stressed, when I&#x27;m embarrassed, when I&#x27;ve been in the sun, when I&#x27;m hot, etc.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last night.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am pretty dissatisfied that it doesn&#x27;t lessen the redness, but I give Eucerin an A for trying and hope they continue trying to improve their products.</li>
            <li>After my ghostbuster first day, I experimented with smaller amounts and how I apply it to my face.  </li>
            <li>Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion not only has the SPF 15 factored into its formula (sunscreen is crucial for rosacea patients), but my husband is pleased that it is non greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product daily for years and it has never failed me.  </li>
            <li>bought this for sensitive skin and it is just a normal lotion.</li>
            <li>Not sure which is better.  </li>
            <li>This is because parts of my face are more dry than others and the dry areas will grab onto the Eucerin cream and make it look, well, ...</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product, but not a good alternative to a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t realized how strongly tinted green</li>
            <li>Overall, good product, but just use it in small amounts on problem areas only if you don&#x27;t want to look like Kermit the Frog.</li>
            <li>I tried the Eucerin, and it might be okay for those with just a ruddy complexion, but it still did not cover enough of my redness to keep it hidden.  </li>
            <li>My skin tone appears more even and less red when I use it, and that is the purpose of the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s goes on easily, stays put and washes off with plain soap and water.</li>
            <li>Right now I am fighting dry itch flaky elbows.</li>
            <li>This lotion is fine as SPF protection, but I already had a few of those.</li>
            <li>would say this is better for red and DRY skin, although it doesn&#x27;t necessarily</li>
            <li>My deep flushing  still continues - after four years of use, I believe that it helps to a certain degree.  </li>
            <li>I found it useful to blend this lotion with my other daily moisturizer that has a higher SPF.</li>
            <li>The only thing is I wish it was just a little more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I do add a little of my Organic facial moisturizer on top of the Eucerin.  </li>
            <li>and I had to rub my face so hard to get it to go on, my face was more irritated than before I used it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember my face being this clear ...</li>
            <li>That isn&#x27;t clear to me from the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Granted, I have relatively early stage rosacea -</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>After cleaning my face very well 2) I will apply a *sheer layer of this product 3)</li>
            <li>I have 2-3 medium size scars and simply pat the excess out gently w/ my finger, before doing the</li>
            <li>Since I have been using Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion, I have noticed a real change in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have some old battle scars to heal up...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference the next day though or the day after while I maintained use of</li>
            <li>leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li>So far, it seems to be reducing the redness I have with rosacea.</li>
            <li>far as the greenish tint that offsets the appearance of redness, it works to an extent.  </li>
            <li>It goes on a light green but blends in with your skin.  </li>
            <li>It never fully blends in with your skin, and I&#x27;m a VERY light-skinned Mexican comparible to East Asians.</li>
            <li>, my face starts to become itchy and sensitive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a godsend for those of us with unsolvable sensitive</li>
            <li>mix this with Oil of Olay Sensitive Skin SPF 30.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really how red my skin had gotten until I applied this and saw how even and radiant my skin on my face looked!  </li>
            <li>The green tint is not visible on my skin once I smooth the lotion in, and it visibly diminishes the redness.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and stays moisturized throughout the day, even up to bedtime without a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>it calms my skin, keeps it soft</li>
            <li>It really does mask any redness, but I found that all redness is gone by simply using the redness relief night</li>
            <li>and so my skin has become sensitive and started flushing.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Leaves my shin feeling soft and it has a glowing look after applying it.</li>
            <li>Completely removes redness.</li>
            <li>The only product that I haven&#x27;t used as much is this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within 5 days my skin was noticeably smoother, much less red, more even-toned and not totally dry as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok just the color is a little strange.  </li>
            <li>You only need to use a very little amount, I have tried using a lot to cover up my rosacea better</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this as your only sunscreen if you plan to be outside for a long period of time, but for those of use who can burn when only outside for a limited amount of time and don&#x27;t want to remember to use a separate sunscreen, this works great as a daily sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Obviously I have to put some blush on, but that&#x27;s not any more than usual.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re pretty much smearing mint green all over your face.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it appears to have caused a mild breakout across my face (not horribly since I only used it twice)</li>
            <li>Initially I became interested after I read a personal recommendation on a Squidoo Lens</li>
            <li>For the last ten years all I have seen in the mirror or in pictures of myself is RED RED and more RED.  </li>
            <li>First off, it is a very dry moisturizer....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it and only product we found that truly does it.</li>
            <li>I am a light, black skinned female.</li>
            <li>It made the dry skin green and more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>but, hey it is worth trying, especially if your face isn&#x27;t dry from medicine..</li>
            <li>Only use aliiitle bit - otherwise the green will be too strong and you might look like a frog</li>
            <li>I am very eager to see how it works out in the long run.</li>
            <li>What I saw was lightly blushed cheeks, which means that Eucerin did its job to lessen the usual redness.</li>
            <li>Very Pasty , not natural, doesn&#x27;t do a thing for redness</li>
            <li>does come out like a light mint green, kind of weird</li>
            <li>The reduction in redness is pretty minimal.</li>
            <li>I am almost back to normal.  </li>
            <li>The greenish tint helps make my red skin look normal.  </li>
            <li>I have convinced him to start treating his nose for rosacea and it is starting to return to normal</li>
            <li>But also they have found yellow is better than green at making red go away.</li>
            <li>My pores just look full of green gunk.</li>
            <li>very light, it is green, to combat the red but really tones it down..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using the range about 5/6 months and, as I wear make-up most days, it&#x27;s hard to know what to do to alleviate the itch.</li>
            <li>few more important notes:  if you have rosacea and your eyes are itchy or dry or if it is hard to see out of them sometimes wearing your glasses or not, you may have</li>
            <li>I just live with my slightly red cheeks, and consider it built in blush for now.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recently prescribed Mirvaso, a new prescription cream which relieves redness (sort of) by shrinking blood vessels temporarily.</li>
            <li>I felt like a new person showing up to work without a red</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive skin like me, don&#x27;t even get it any where near your eyes unless you want runny, red, bloodshot eyes (&amp;</li>
            <li>/&gt;After several weeks of daily use, I do see a reduction in the amount of redness in my cheeks, which is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Eucerin Redness Relief Daily is only product that really works well with my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;ALSO, rosacea can cause the bulbous red nose that older people can get (Think classic fisherman&#x27;s red nose), even if the rest of their skin is not red.  </li>
            <li>I have red skin from rosacea and this really helps cover the red.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of masking redness but can leave a white residue and can be difficult to rub in.</li>
            <li>I have mild rosacea type 2 with redness, some bumps, a few visible capillaries and severe dryness/flakiness, Did not like this one.</li>
            <li>However, it does make me look a little more pale than normal</li>
            <li>This product is more of a weak sunscreen than a redness cover for rosa era which is what it was touted to be.</li>
            <li>I walked into work the other day after applying this for the first time and my boss looked at me in horror.  </li>
            <li>started this routine in May 2013, and two months later, nearly all the redness is GONE!  </li>
            <li>but it seems to work about the same when I only use a little, possibly even better.</li>
            <li>I only wish Eucerin had a tinted, sensitive skin, spf moisterizer!</li>
            <li>so it wouldn&#x27;t make me look super pale or bead up when I put my make-up on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super moisturizing and its kind of a small bottle</li>
            <li>Another reviewer mentioned that you can&#x27;t really use it with any facial hair, which is frustrating because my facial hair grows at an annoyingly fast rate (I like being clean shaven anyway</li>
            <li>calm being the only word I can think of to describe the sensation, or maybe lack of the sensation, I get with other products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this lotion would probably be useful for someone with redness on their whole face, and someone who is not very fair skinned, or someone who wears concealer and foundation on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Was very streaky and felt very dry.</li>
            <li>However, on a serious note I offer that this product has helped me with my predicament, and its effects last for most of the day.</li>
            <li>Unlike the Physician&#x27;s Formula powder, you really have to have a particular &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; for the green to cancel out.</li>
            <li>There is no need for a huge amount because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My husband pointed out that it look a teeny bit green at first, but my usual powder evens the tone out just fine.</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers; this stuff can leave a residue on your face, making you look more odd than you would with red skin.</li>
            <li>It may prevent a sunburn, which could prevent a red face, but otherwise, it&#x27;s goal is to mask the skin with a green-tinted moisturizer that goes on clear.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is, if it provided any redness relief at all, it was barely noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to my Aveno calming lotion: it has no green tint, and does wonders for decreasing redness and dryness.</li>
            <li>My mother loves this - she has sensitive skin and only purchases this brand.</li>
            <li>So far, I can see a difference in the texture and tone of my skin while at the same time look like my wearing nothing at all!  </li>
            <li>Apparently, the thickness of the lotion will not allow it to blend into hair follicles.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not much of a moisturizer, doesn&#x27;t soak into my face very well</li>
            <li>It is kind of expensive but works somewhat.</li>
            <li>, keep in mind that 98% of the people who you walk past on the street aren&#x27;t going to notice or care that your face looks kind of green</li>
            <li>After a month of using it, there is a difference in this lotion from other face products - you have to be smart about how you apply</li>
            <li>I found this lotion to be more sticky than my previous moisturizer and the green color does nothing to counteract the &amp;#34;redness&amp;#34; problem.</li>
            <li>A light, delicate lotion with a subtle, light scent that is barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Works well but had to experiment with it quite a few times to get the right amount</li>
            <li>My face is no less red than before.  </li>
            <li>So - if you feel like going home early - just put this stuff on in large amounts and you will look like the Walking Dead.  </li>
            <li>We have purchased this product a couple times before and have really notice the difference it makes compared to other competing products.</li>
            <li>Very soothing on the roscea parts of my face which can get extremely itchy.</li>
            <li>Much thicker than other redness lotions I have used.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any other product that works really at all.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t have an issue with this (and prefer physical sunscreens) but because this product is also tinted green, you REALLY have to rub it</li>
            <li>Is it there to convince us that this is a serious concoction, or does it smell because an important healing ingredient happens to smell.  </li>
            <li>no I don&#x27;t stick it in my eye balls, just couldn&#x27;t get it anywhere near them making this product even more useless).</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for people with redness but not dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried at least 15 different products for my face, including several expensive prescription medication, and none of them really alleviated the redness and just made me feel more hopeless about improving my appearance.</li>
            <li>The green tint is too strong for my admittedly very pale skin tone and is actually visible unless I apply this very sparingly.</li>
            <li>A little greasy for daytime, especially if you are wearing makeup—I would suggest getting a concealer or green concealer and mixing a little into some liquid foundation or into your own moisturizer to cancel out redness instead of just using this particular moisturizer.</li>
            <li>But he also had a bit of dry skin, and the lotion there gave him a light greenish, Frankenstein&#x27;s monster tone, not particularly desirable at times other than Halloween.  </li>
            <li>The Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion Broad Spectrum SPF 15 is just what I needed.</li>
            <li>As a lotion that actually reduces the redness, not just the appearance of redness, it seemed to work on a small, moderately light red area, but not on a darker, larger one.</li>
            <li>Light green lotion,looks a little whiter than before but still be natural.</li>
            <li>and there was mention in other reviews of a previous kind that wasnt tinted green which I wouldve also tried</li>
            <li>First of all, it doesn&#x27;t absorb, leaving a coat of green residue.  </li>
            <li>First of all, the product is green and feels like caked-on makeup.  </li>
            <li>I used it everyday when I first got it, but every time I used, people would ask me if I was feeling well.</li>
            <li>First it&#x27;s green in color.</li>
            <li>Has really calmed my rosacea down.  </li>
            <li>It really helps with the roseca and clams the redness down..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it because a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my skin has always been so sensitive that most lotions and other treatments cause worse skin problems than the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that in order to hide my redness, I needed to apply an excessive amount, which didn&#x27;t work under any primer or liquid foundation---it just came right off.</li>
            <li>I needed a product that would not only instantly calm my redness, but work overtime to help with the sensitivity and excessive dryness.  </li>
            <li>To solve this problem, I generally apply this lotion only to my problem areas (cheeks and nose), and then use a separate Cetaphil SPF-15 facial lotion for the rest of my face (forehead, jaw, chin, etc.).  </li>
            <li>In addition, it left my skin feeling far oilier than I like, and I had a minor blackhead breakout on the 5th and 6th days I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get eczema on my fave and am normally really self-conscious about the rash and general ruddy, uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this lotion won&#x27;t be useful, except for the small red bumps on my face, which it seems to cover with no irritation -it</li>
            <li>When I put less on, I am a little less green, but because my skin is dry from it not being a good moisturizer, there are light green flakes that appear.</li>
            <li>My cheeks and forehead skin are less red and much softer.</li>
            <li>I like the light texture of this daily lotion and the green tint helps \\&quot;cool\\&quot; down any redness going on.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 months and have a lot left so while the price is a little much</li>
            <li>First, know that a little of this stuff goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li>It is bluish/green which sound crazy but does a great job as a foundation for covering little broken blood vessels and redness.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works, but the reason I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars is that it&#x27;s not soothing and the green &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; is a little much.  </li>
            <li>I applied very little, a small amount, &amp; then tried more &amp; no type of application worked.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews, good and bad, then decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>I also gently use it in the delicate corners of my eyes near the nose which makes it act like a concealer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also going to investigate the potential connection between my rosacea and SIBO (small intestine bacteria overgowth) and/or heliocopter pilori, the bacteria responsible for ulcers, which we apparently all carry on our skin.  </li>

            <li> The results are flawless.  </li>
            <li> I put this on under a powder foundation, and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> but for best results you have to take the advice of what others are saying.  </li>
            <li> It did an excellent job concealing redness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like foundation where you can keep applying layers until everything looks perfect.</li>
            <li> I do have a very fair complexion, so maybe I&#x27;m just not used to seeing myself without the redness!  </li>
            <li> It also feels a bit dry--not nearly as wonderful as their night creme--</li>
            <li> so this product is perfect for me.</li>

            <li> It is amazing!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion that can be bought over the counter to reduce the appearance of redness, and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re skin is impeccable and you don&#x27;t need any concealing beyond your redness, you may look like the Hulk with over application.</li>
            <li> I love it , it works great !</li>
            <li> Make sure to use this sparingly, and I also recommend to exfoliate the area before applying the lotion for best results.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite, and Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> So, buy at your own risk but my advise, just stick with foundation!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I both have very fair skin, and very light skin can be prone to redness.</li>
            <li> The really good things about the product are that it works immediately, the bottle lasts quite a while and my skin doesn&#x27;t reject it.  </li>
            <li> The texture of the product is smooth and watery, bendable with the perfect amount of moisture for my AM routine.</li>
            <li> and I think does a good job of hiding a bit of redness all day.</li>
            <li> It also feels good.    </li>
            <li> I bought this with the night cream and moisturiser, those are both good</li>
            <li> It does a really good job of covering the redness, even on days I don&#x27;t wear foundation.</li>
            <li> I continue to look for a good moisturizer with spf(preferably 30 and over).</li>
            <li> I feel like my face does not look as good as with this on.</li>
            <li> But even makeup for fair skin never made me look quite like</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product for the number of good reviews it has</li>
            <li> So then I have tan blotches on my fair skin tone.</li>
            <li> So I figured this redness relief would be a good option since I don&#x27;t wear makeup to cover up any blemishes or hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> Good product as always</li>
            <li> It will create a pasty whiteness until you get it rubbed in good</li>
            <li> Also has good spf</li>
            <li> it is a good hydrating and non-greasy moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion.</li>
            <li> He had gorgeous skin.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to have found this Eucerin product available through the  Amazon site.  </li>
            <li> The lotion did feel really good</li>
            <li> and I thought the smell was good.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy, it&#x27;s a perfect light moisturizer with the added benefit of hiding the ever-present redness of my skin.  </li>
            <li> So that is good.</li>
            <li> TO GOOD</li>
            <li> bought this because I figured the redness wash is wonderful and very soothing, so this would work great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for spot touch ups and men will be able to use this product as well.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> She is very pleased with this product and would</li>
            <li> but that isn&#x27;t very appealing as a guy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worked great way better then</li>
            <li> The lotion is nice and silky, it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out, and it is really a good value for an all-in-one moisturizer, primer, and SPF lotion.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- Effectively moisturizes and provides good sun protection</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> You will love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> My favorite day cream I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic!  </li>
            <li> This lotion is not a cure or treatment for rosacea, but it sure helps cosmetically!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> Though, admittedly I will keep using this product even if it does nothing to my skin underneath, it is amazing for under makeup or just by itself to cut redness.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The licorice extract, or whatever it is that reduces redness, is amazing.</li>
            <li> These products are amazing.  </li>
            <li> I do use their night cream as well which is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It relieved the warm sensation on my face.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to find something that helps instead of irritates.</li>
            <li> This is a nice non-irratating product.</li>
            <li> Just make sure not to slather it on, blend well, and you should be good to go.</li>
            <li> Just not quite as good as implied. :)</li>
            <li> They dont help the redness but they make the skin feel nice.    </li>
            <li> lotion kind of works.</li>
            <li> to say how effective this is.</li>
            <li> it is nice ,and I like it, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it .</li>
            <li> Does a good job at taking any of my redness away, and smells like sun tan oil-one of my favorite smells.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> It is moderately effective but it has some negatives that you have to consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My redness is kind of blotchy, so I just dabbed it on the reddest spots.</li>
            <li> He is relieved that he can now continue getting the product that has proven so beneficial and effective for him.  </li>
            <li> They hurt like hell and if I cover them up with makeup of any kind they burn.</li>
            <li> Feels nice.</li>
            <li> It evens out my skin tone and gives everything a nice matte, porcelain finish.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and beautifully.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very easy to blend into your skin.</li>
            <li> Very good, very moist, but not Concealer</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it covers the redness perfectly, but I am very happy to have found a decent, oil-free lotion to mask my rosacea and give me a more natural look on no-foundation days.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, like most Eucerin.</li>
            <li> but it goes on smoothly and feels good to the touch.</li>
            <li> I have a bit of rosacea and sensitive skin and this moisturizer is excellent.</li>
            <li> Best product I have found so far.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t absorb well, kind of sat on top of my skin</li>
            <li> Thanks for a good product!</li>
            <li> Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion SPF 15, 1.7 Ounce Bottle, this product gave me very good results, good thing I found it .</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like sunscreen, whish is not that attractive in my opinion.</li>
            <li> your know, almost too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Very light and no smell.</li>
            <li> (but doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen when its on your face), and it feels very light...</li>
            <li> I wish I could find one more suitable for my skin type that blends better.</li>
            <li> Very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It works great, Thanks</li>
            <li> It also works well under foundation if you want more coverage.</li>
            <li> I do love this product.  </li>
            <li> I like the Dermarest much better</li>
            <li> Better deal here than at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pleased with the way it absorbs as well.</li>
            <li> I needed this for my Rosales and it seems like it is okay.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I think I noticed it, others I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li> It feels more like sunblock than lotion.</li>
            <li> Just be prepared to play with it a bit and after it absorbs into the skin it looks much better.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> however, I think its better used for people with fairer skin.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok and does provide some protection from the sun.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> #34;Oh my god, are you ok?  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s some things to love about this lotion and there&#x27;s some things to sigh over, here are my pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems more like a redness coverup formula.</li>
            <li> So, as a masking lotion, I would have hoped for better results.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Most people say they don&#x27;t notice it, but it&#x27;s something that bothers me.</li>
            <li> I had much, much better luck with Triderma MD rosacea repair cream.</li>
            <li> You can always apply more if needed.  </li>
            <li> Coverage will be just okay</li>
            <li> Im looking to maybe purchase more Eucerin products.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything better.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again because makeup does a better job of making me look \\&quot;normal.\\</li>
            <li> So, although I love it, I wish it protected my face for longer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> was advised to use a factor 50 sunblock and so have to use another product on top of the moisturiser.</li>
            <li> it also works okay with foundation.</li>
            <li> If you wear foundation or concealer every day, you might have better luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Be sure to rub it in, and you&#x27;ve got a miracle moisturizing regime.</li>
            <li> This product is okay.</li>
            <li> sure I have rosacea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just telling what seems to have worked for me.  :-)</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s strength is it&#x27;s weakness though, like many things.  </li>
            <li> also love that it&#x27;s a moisturizer and sunscreen as well.</li>
            <li> Have used this for many years.</li>
            <li> , I have never used the redness relief before and LOVE IT..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the results and I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something more permanent.</li>
            <li> Witch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product from ULTA originally, but see that Amazon has a much better price!  </li>
            <li> Glad to find this online.  </li>
            <li> It has no scent:)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and really does help reduce redness on the face.</li>
            <li> This lotion is perfect to normalize your red patches on face.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I love you, Eucerin.</li>
            <li> am so pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat customer and will continue using this product I love the results.</li>
            <li> I ended up with more redness than I had before it.</li>
            <li> could pay doublethe price for a more convenient lotion</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for years and love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite under-makeup sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> However, we had not been able to locate it anywhere, since not one pharmacy or retail stores carries it any longer within our area and surroundings.  </li>
            <li> It may work for some people, but I sure didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> After a couple weeks, the redness never got better</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Great product - thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products some that cost a lot more and none have worked this well.  </li>
            <li> I can control it most of the time</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> ok as that.</li>
            <li> I suggest taking off the top when it will no longer come out of the pump and \\&quot;dig\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> and I sincerely hope they don&#x27;t tweak the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was so thankful when I found it an amazon and for such a great price!</li>
            <li> more so I could have found it sooner.  </li>
            <li> It may be a good sunscreen, but I really have had exposure to see how effective that is.</li>
            <li> Quite frankly, it seems more like makeup than a skincare product.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> i bought it online because i cnt find it in stores any more.</li>
            <li> and it stained my cheeks permanently red and under my makeup this is flawless.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was more cream like and felt moisturizing, but I just put a moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> I like the Clinique better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to make sure to just put a dot on my face.</li>
            <li> since I was a baby, but it went away for most of my childhood and resurfaced when I was 12/13 or so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll just jump to the point real quick:</li>
            <li> I still need to figure out how to apply it convincingly</li>
            <li> I love the way it evens my skin tone and protects me from the sun.</li>
            <li> The product just sat on top of my skin providing no moisturizing affect and keeping</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work very well the first time I used it, but after that it was great!</li>
            <li> I tried this product based on pretty good reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a super nice product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how easily this works,  </li>
            <li> The cleanser is amazing; my skin feels so calm after washing;</li>
            <li> I have that trademark fair skin that redheads have, and it gets more and more sensitive as the years pass, so the idea of \\&quot;redness relief\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Also love that its fragrance free..</li>
            <li> but I have absolutely nothing good to say about it.</li>
            <li> I use a prescription cream morning and night, which I don&#x27;t think does much good until I don&#x27;t use it, then I really notice the redness.  </li>
            <li> I have a fair complexion and a very noticeable amount of redness</li>
            <li> and it really does do a good job moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a BAD moisturizer with SPF, in fact, it may be the best one in my cabinet, but it also doesn&#x27;t bring anything exciting or new to the table.</li>
            <li> If you or a loved one has rosacea, I STRONGLY and HIGHLY recommend this Eucerin product!  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t look perfect and remove every sign of redness and other imperfections, but it does help quite a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> TO BE TRUE!  </li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and stayed on well.</li>
            <li> I do appreciate the non-plastic bottle and easy to use pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell, not perfum-y (important for sensitive skin that can react to perfumes with more redness).</li>
            <li> but I after a week, this is just as easy to do.  </li>
            <li> Our local stores don&#x27;t carry this anymore, so I&#x27;m happy to be able to get it online.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned with mild to moderate Rosacea &amp; gave it a try because it was fairly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I am older (60s), fair, freckled so like this product.  </li>
            <li> Broad Spectrum SPF 15 great combo.</li>
            <li> I have a full review &amp; video on my blog if you&#x27;d like to hear more about my thoughts on this product:  </li>
            <li> (less is best)</li>
            <li> it was fine though redness was still somewhat visible</li>
            <li> IT is soothing, not too greasy, and goes on fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine line there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it does a good job moisturizing and would be suitable for daily use.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using a combination of Crisco and petroleum jelly and it&#x27;s worked fine, but we&#x27;re talking Crisco and PB here</li>
            <li> I believe it more than masks the redness - it does in fact have a mild impact on the underlying causes of the redness.        </li>
            <li> Luckily, Walgreens takes refunds on cosmetic products, so I was able to return it.</li>
            <li> stuff and a little powder did an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yeah - my title is accurate.  </li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy or greasy and is perfect for moisturizing under my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have used this marvelous product for many years and panic completely when I cannot find it in my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> lightly powder w/ a translucent face powder 5)</li>
            <li> lightly mist my face with water and let set again.</li>
            <li> how lightly I applied it.</li>
            <li> I got free samples from my dermatologist and I have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li> I found this product making my face tone appear lighter, this is great , I don&#x27;t need to apply BB cream anymore and still look like I was fully rested last night.</li>
            <li> This lotion is non-irritating, light, non-oily, etc.</li>
            <li> Within a week I could see a noticeable improvement, and after three weeks my face is smooth and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and makes my skin feel silky.</li>
            <li> this does and even better job at decreasing the redness and leaves a more matte-like appearance; more natural looking.</li>
            <li> this product plus the night cream combined with two IPL laser treatments made my skin golden and healthy again.</li>
            <li> You can imagine how happy I was to find the Eucerin Soothing Cleanser - at last I could feel like my skin being cleaned without burning or irritation!</li>
            <li> know everyone&#x27; skin situation is different, so these products may or may not work for you, but they have been great for me.</li>
            <li> It provides light, all-day moisture and UV protection while reducing visible redness and blotchiness, for an even-toned complexion.</li>
            <li> The lotion moisturizes well, goes on smooth, and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I hope this product is available forever.</li>
            <li> Eucerin Redness Relief does a fantastic job of dulling/neutralizing my redness on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Light feeling and does the trick.  </li>
            <li> Great product, helped my skin heal from working outside.</li>
            <li> The doctor who did the procedure provided free product which was some name brand and</li>
            <li> Use it lightly as a calming concealer in the day.</li>
            <li> Then, I lightly apply it to the areas around my nose and mouth.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t cheap out and try a bunch of brands like this..</li>
            <li> Next time I will buy clinque; although it costs more I liked it much better.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great for my red face</li>
            <li> and I have finally found a great combo that works for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has the consistency and smell of sunscreen, and it is a light grass-green color.</li>
            <li> Being fair skinned, I hoped that this might alleviate some problems when they aroused.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a significant reduction in redness</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m amazed at how fast and well this worked for me! :-)))</li>
            <li> I wish there was a higher SPF in this product, but I feel better by mixing it with the Aveeno SPF 30.</li>
            <li> I have minor rosacea localized to my nose, and this product does a great job of covering up the redness and evening out the skin tone.</li>
            <li> It has significantly reduced redness in my face.  </li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Or maybe I was too excited that it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had several people comment that my face looks better and that they&#x27;re impressed with my appearance (i lost like 30 lbs recently so that helps, too).</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;d really appreciate any advice for that!), but it&#x27;s worked leagues better than anything else</li>
            <li> this stuff works, I use with the cleanser and night cream and skin is much better, I gave 4 stars because I wish it had higher SPF</li>
            <li> - I mix with my usual moisturizer for best results.</li>
            <li> This lotion does pretty good job on covering redness to some degree, it protects my skin from sun and, the most important thing, it does not irritate my skin, as so many other lotions I tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line..if you enjoy looking like a pale version of \\&quot;The Incredible Hulk\\&quot; then go ahead &amp; give the Eucerin a try..</li>
            <li> I do see anything special about it at all.</li>
            <li> This is a lightweight lotion that applies easily, has a mild scent, and would be useful for women or men.</li>
            <li> Love eucerin products but this one, not so much.</li>
            <li> I gave it a full month trial.</li>
            <li> It was kind to my skin, leaving it soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a naturally dark skinned male and was a bit apprehensive about trying this product since most people seem to have fair skin that have the redness problem and have given good reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> Overall I think its a good product</li>
            <li> I have extremely fair skin and red undertones that I would like to minimize.  </li>
            <li> I have always loved Eucerin products but this just simply does not work at all for me.</li>
            <li> I have used many products over the years-most don&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> I have used all of the redness relief products and this one has really helped me feel better about showing my face.</li>
            <li> and it really helps to neutralize the redness and helps my makeup cover better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is absolutely one of my favorite skincare/cosmetic products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and am so delighted to get it on Amazon, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li> It can make your skin oily, but after a number of weeks, my skin was able to adjust or use oil absorbing paper/sheets.</li>
            <li> so thought I&#x27;d try it out full size.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months, and I discovered that my face looked good if I didn&#x27;t use sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years to reduce redness and it works fairly well.  </li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t get them to cool</li>
            <li> I have perpetually red skin and my complexion is fair</li>
            <li> It also seemed to sweat off easily, and would gather in the wrinkle lines on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because if I didn&#x27;t mind the green tint, I would have been happy with the feel of this product.</li>
            <li> Only then you realize its great positive qualities</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, and you don&#x27;t need much!  </li>
            <li> After several weeks of daily use I am very pleased with this product and hope that I continue to have good luck with it.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> The product smells great and goes on smoothly, without leaving any green tinted streaks.</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t put more then a tiny dab on too, otherwise you&#x27;ll look like the hulk (unless thats the look you&#x27;re going for).</li>
            <li> I can then then apply my mineral powder foundation as the Eucerin Perfecting Lotion absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have rosacea, just mild redness</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m lucky</li>
            <li> It helps the redness more if I use a couple squirts instead of just one and rub it in good that way your face won&#x27;t look green.</li>
            <li> Gentle, good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> And it comes out of the pump bottle quickly....</li>
            <li> I have a mild case of rosecea and this products works for me.</li>
            <li> I need either foundation and/ or a redness reducing powder to adequately cover my redness</li>
            <li> My rosacae is mild according to the doctor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the Eucerin or the combination of Eucerin and Epsom salts, but one or both of them helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li> The spf is really mild though.</li>
            <li> This lightweight lotion absorbs quickly into my skin, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy, contains SPF 15 and hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li> it blends quickly into your skin and cancels out redness without making you look like Shrek or the Wicked</li>
            <li> I am much more confident and overall</li>
            <li> /&gt;It absorbs quickly, has an SPF</li>
            <li> I quickly applied my home remedy and the irritation vanished.</li>
            <li> This lotion does reduce the look of redness, but it needs to be blended in quickly because it gets thicker as it sits.</li>
            <li> Going back to Clinique, much more money, but works much better.</li>
            <li> I also liked that there was no real perfum added, so it is good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But the best way is to do it one area at a time, starting with somewhat moistened (&amp; clean) skin; not bone dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you get the light or medium color added it will cover up the redness also pretty well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was okay, but I think the daily moisterizer and night cream are far superior.</li>
            <li> On top of helping with the scaring it has kept new blemishes from popping up.  </li>
            <li> I have reddish skin, and can flush bright red after eating hot food or drink or alcohol.  </li>
            <li> but I saw this product for half the cost which was attractive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very creamy and easy to blend.</li>
            <li> pretty good, but not hydrated enough</li>
            <li> It is a pretty good facial sunscreen I guess.</li>
            <li> I have definitely seen a difference in the redness of my face (for the better!)</li>
            <li> The first one to make any noticeable difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having much better results and NO green color!</li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy this product as much as I have.</li>
            <li> Light and rubs in fast</li>
            <li> this green tinted moisturizer is great.</li>
            <li> The SPF is nice, but unless your face is red everywhere, you are going to need a separate SPF product.</li>
            <li> , it actually helps the redness itself and gives a nice glow to your skin in the morning.</li>
            <li> On good days, the lotion is completely effective, on bad days it&#x27;s not as effective.  </li>
            <li> As far as I can tell the lotion is ok.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because the smell is medicinal-which I don&#x27;t care for, but the results are worth the smell.</li>
            <li> I also love the Eucerin Q10 cream—it has never made me breakout with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So this lotion has a distinct smell of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t determed yet if this will be the case, but it seems ok thus far.</li>
            <li> This product is pricey but worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> My face is definitely more clear since I&#x27;ve been using it, but here&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Once it was absorbed into my skin, I could see the difference immediately.  </li>
            <li> I believe this product is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I do love the gel cleanser for sensitive skin, and the night cream too.</li>
            <li> I expected way more better results form this cream .</li>
            <li> This products evens out the red skin tones and allows the application of &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; make-up to be effective.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even worth one star.</li>
            <li> Very milky clean fresh feeling after using.</li>
            <li> Goes on clean and light, no heavy perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically a coverup and moisturizer, goes on easily and quickly and blends well for a natural looking, normal-colored skin.</li>
            <li> and I am good to go without any other makeup.</li>
            <li> I like that it evens my skin tone, specially on days when my skin is more red.</li>
            <li> Mixing it works just right for me.</li>
            <li> is right.  </li>
            <li> tried product and noticed the odor right away.</li>
            <li> glass bottle with a pump that dispenses just the right amount.  </li>
            <li> and I end up sweating this right off.</li>
            <li> Gave it a four right now</li>
            <li> Right after the shower is when I apply this.  </li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m suffering with hives on my face resulting from a bug bite.  </li>
            <li> I like the design of the glass bottle, and the dispenser spits out just the right amount.  </li>
            <li> In my early 40s, I developed a very mild case of rosacea that&#x27;s aggravated by ingredients in most anti-aging serums, lotions and creams.</li>
            <li> I do appreciate that it has sunscreen in it -- great for daily use -- but is it really fair to say that the sunscreen essentially accounts for its \\&quot;redness-relieving\\&quot; quality (since the marketing here is carefully worded)?</li>
            <li> I have light skin and red shows up easily  </li>
            <li> I tried it on several friends, and it works best on slightly darker skin tones .  </li>
            <li> Being a natural redhead I found this product to work perfectly with my natural pink tint.</li>
            <li> After over 1 month use, I have found, however, it&#x27;s more effective as a surface color correction under makeup because of the green tint, but not so much as a real treatment over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product was recommended by my Dermatologist and it&#x27;s a good one for anyone who has redness of the face they would like to tone down.</li>
            <li> You apply it lightly to the red areas, rubbing it lightly in, in my case to my cheeks and nose and then apply foundation and powder.</li>
            <li> Such a great product &amp; inexpensive to help conceal facial redness.</li>
            <li> It made a great base for my makeup and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> Super fast company that shipped it here too.</li>
            <li> The lotion is a good cover up , but it doesn&#x27;t relief the redness as much like i expected it too.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer looked very promising, as both a cover and a treatment.</li>
            <li> It is very effective, and especially helps when he occasionally gets a flare-up.  </li>
            <li> but but if you have super dry skin that should be ok.  </li>
            <li> He has very dry, very red skin on his face - the first time he put this on, it worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> positive is that it does provide sunscreen and that seems effective with limited use.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I expected.</li>
            <li> This product even at first use neutralized any uneveness my skin had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically a love it or leave it mechanism that will be well/ill received based on your personal taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my makeup looks better and stays on longer in comparison to my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be similar to many tinted primers that are on the market today.  </li>
            <li> I love it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> read about this stuff, and I tried it for the first time today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> greenish tint in the moisturizer is a bit off-putting at first, but you do need to use it sparingly</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t emphasize enough how much I love all of Eucerin&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> Need something more for red blotches.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this first as it caught my curiosity.</li>
            <li> Now, instead of fighting just the facial redness, I am fighting the redness and many blemishes that appeared as a result of using this product.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more of a marketing ploy than an actual product designed to reduce redness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it consistently for four weeks on a couple of reddish skin patches, not sunburn.  </li>
            <li> First, let me say that the product does do what it claims it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since Christmas (it&#x27;s February now), and it&#x27;s not making my overall redness any better.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to wear makeup, and that is sadly not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I feel OK about going out in public.  </li>
            <li> Then I very generously slathered on the lotion (too much to be absorbed), and waited about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks and am quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This product felt calming at first use - and along with the cleanser and night cream it solved my embarrassing redness.</li>
            <li> The SPF is just an added bonus ;)</li>
            <li> This lotion really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with swollen, red cheeks for many years now.</li>
            <li> I found this out the first day I used it.  </li>
            <li> i have been using this product for exactly one week now</li>
            <li> /&gt;Decent stuff, but not my favorite product and will only keep for emergencies if needed for cover up if I have a flare up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this lotion alone, over another moisturizer with a higher spf, and also under foundation.  </li>
            <li> I blush a lot and this lotion really helps minimize all my redness!</li>
            <li> Seemed to help at first</li>
            <li> First of all, it is not moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Euerin</li>
            <li> I think the Clinique wasn&#x27;t as bright green as this product.  </li>
            <li> First you have to learn how to use it and get used to it.</li>
            <li> in that it causes severe facial redness, but it&#x27;s a much more consistent redness</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s something you should be aware of.&lt;br</li>
            <li> apply a bit of it on affected areas and then apply makeup for a smooth clear appearance.</li>
            <li> This does have some good qualities, but the green tint is not for me.</li>
            <li> At any rate, it&#x27;s not very expensive and is worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a product like this to solve your redness problems.</li>
            <li> It would be ok, except it doesn&#x27;t go on quite as smooth as normal face lotion and since my skin is kinda dry, i tend to have to mix some of my face lotion in with it which then decreases the amount of redness it can cover.</li>
            <li> this helps the scales and the redness making my skin condition more comfortable and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to finally find something to reduce redness.  </li>
            <li> unless I used so little as to be ineffective for masking red, the lotion did show and didn&#x27;t look very good.  </li>
            <li> Under a broad coverage foundation, it looks fine.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s allot more expensive but it lasts a long time &amp; works wonderful.</li>
            <li> It helps tremendously with redness and does not cause acne like other creams I&#x27;ve tried. :)</li>
            <li> My wife had been using Aveeno Calming to manage her mild Rosacea but wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li> After using it 2 weeks my skin is less red, but my rosacea flares up and gets better on its own, so I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s the product.</li>
            <li> But for early stage rosacea where symptoms are basically warm discomfort and red complexion - it works.</li>
            <li> It might work very well for people whose skin is dryer than mine or has more redness, but I don&#x27;t want to have to use one lotion for the red parts of my skin and another for the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> most of my redness is gone thanks to my argan facial oil, so i dont think i&#x27;ll use this product again though.</li>
            <li> This cream goes on light green (which you have to rub in or let absorb), which I LOVE because it balances the redness of my face</li>
            <li> This product will make you look pale if you do more than lightly spot treat.</li>
            <li> The only time it isn&#x27;t helpful is on hot humid days when it sweats off easily</li>
            <li> I ended up on many occasions spending more time outside than expected and getting my face burnt.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for the redness, which is really the point of using it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does a nice job of toning it down, and like another reviewer commented, this would work well under your foundation.  </li>
            <li> are reducing redness and easy to apply, with no greasy residue left on skin.&lt;br /&gt;Guys</li>
            <li> It is in fact a heck of a lot more comfortable to wear than the pancake makeup I usually have to use which feels like I&#x27;m smearing lard on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have really dry skin use another moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li> : If you have large pores or acne scars, this product will VISIBLY CLOG your pores -</li>
            <li> /&gt;*AVOID USING LARGE AMOUNTS</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because if your skin wasn&#x27;t acne prone, I would certainly use it.</li>
            <li> I have the type with both redness in certain areas and also bumps.</li>
            <li> i use one pump to cover up just certain areas of redness on the face or two to reduce redness everywhere.</li>
            <li> and I have large pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never put this on in a large area again.</li>
            <li> Most of the time it looks pretty obvious in the right lighting because I&#x27;m still not sure how to make it look convincing.</li>
            <li> and i got very fair skin and work in a hot factory, just judging by this past week i have noticed not been as red and even haven&#x27;t felt as much of the sensitivity that i normal would feel while i&#x27;m working, i would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I swear that I could fill a soup bowl with skin lotion, stick my elbows in it, and the bowl would be sucked dry in a matter of minutes! :-)</li>
            <li> The product is fine, it does have some greenish tint to it, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything to alieve those tiny capillaries.  </li>
            <li> The main ingredient is pretty interesting(licorice), read about it, might explain the lighter skin...</li>
            <li> , i have to make sure i exfoliate enough because the color of this lotion will settle on dry patches, but it does leave a nice complexion instead of the red undertones and doesnt leave my combo skin greasy or parched in places.</li>
            <li> if anything it may make the skin look a little paler on its own</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to putting a nice little glob on my fingertips then smoothing it all over my face.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on higher priced tone correctors, you will not need them!</li>
            <li> This lotion is very dry and didn&#x27;t cover up nor do any good to the slightly red area around my nose.</li>
            <li> I add a little to the daily spf 30 moisterizer by Eucerin with great results.</li>
            <li> The lotion is a light green that applies smoothly.</li>
            <li> The green pigment is great for covering red skin.</li>
            <li> It really does cover any redness you have across cheeks, nose or chin area.  </li>
            <li> It is very soothing.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t very redness relieving though.</li>
            <li> so it is not so noticeable, but it really does help</li>
            <li> , one area at a time and don&#x27;t try to do your whole face at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You look like you&#x27;re ready to pass out!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> This produce is the bomb for rosacia and redness, covers and improves skin appearance, very soothing and healing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t really \\&quot;reduce\\&quot; redness, just masks it</li>
            <li> I tried eucerine because it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This product really helps to lessen the redness and keeps the dryness in check.</li>
            <li> Of something you really can&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product and the price</li>
            <li> It feels like putting sunscreen on your face, which doesn&#x27;t much surprise me, since it does contain SPF 15.</li>
            <li> After trying the Eucerin Redness Relief face wash, I was very eager to try this product.  </li>
            <li> It soaks into your skin in a reasonable amt of time and sometimes I&#x27;ll just use this when I don&#x27;t feel like putting on all of my makeup</li>
            <li> Thanks Eucerin</li>
            <li> I really like that this product has sunscreen</li>
            <li> Also, it isn&#x27;t very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> After letting it cool, I gently washed my face with a wet, cool washcloth.  </li>
            <li> Instead of rubbing it in, I patted it, which helped cover the redness very well.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much at ALL.  </li>
            <li> One day, I went biking for an hour, and I came home expecting to see very flushed cheeks.</li>
            <li> It spreads so much because the skin can&#x27;t absorb any of it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> When I have a flare up, I use this cream and it helps so much.</li>
            <li> However, in my experience it doesn&#x27;t really make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> I find I have to put on my normal face lotion first, and then put on this after.</li>
            <li> cause don&#x27;t know if it really helps the problem.</li>
            <li> Absolutely works, I call this product my miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 5 days now and my cheeks are much lighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> , my face feels nourished and really hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful.</li>
            <li> It really worked.</li>
            <li> The pump bottle is well made but do be careful as the pump is more projectile than not.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really just masking the redness.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After this I went straight to Ulta and tried Mario Badescu&#x27;s anti-redness package.  </li>
            <li> So I just moisturized when absolutely needed.  </li>
            <li> I really bought into the \\&quot;redness relief\\&quot; promise and just figured I couldn&#x27;t solve it.</li>
            <li> It just takes a thin layer over my face and neck to greatly reduce the appearance of the redness.  </li>
            <li> If you put too much on it does look greenish until it is absorbed, but under foundation this isn&#x27;t a problem since the green counters the redness and helps give the foundation a more even color.  </li>
            <li> And I really like that I can wear it alone or with whatever else</li>
            <li> but sometimes they just heat up so much</li>
            <li> I have now tried Aveeno Postitively Radiant lotion that I really like.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t really cover the redness either.</li>
            <li> Though, I don&#x27;t think it is doing a whole lot for my rosacea.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen much redness relief.</li>
            <li> blusher(that is a real thing haha)</li>
            <li> I find I don&#x27;t have to use as much cover up.</li>
            <li> This product comes out too much at one time.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;relieve\\&quot; the redness so much as mask</li>
            <li> Very peculiar Lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the night cream in the same line and it makes my face all smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really improved my confidence knowing that I don&#x27;t look like a sunburnt lobster every time I go out in</li>
            <li> in the end, I do REALLY like this product and what it&#x27;s done for my face.</li>
            <li> on my face at times it is very drying.</li>
            <li> So very dissappointed.  </li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> It works well but needs to be mixed with regular moisturizer, any kind.  </li>
            <li> The lotion has a green undertone that can be quite effective at minimizing redness if used under a foundation.  </li>
            <li> My skin tends to be red and sensitive from product overuse and too many glycol peelings....</li>
            <li> This has a green tint to it, but not all that effective in covering redness.</li>
            <li> Since Superfit was discontinued it hasn&#x27;t been quite so good, but at least I know which product is causing the problem.</li>
            <li> It is not perfect, but it is the best so far.</li>
            <li> I naturally have pale, porcelain skin, so this works great for me at restoring my skin closer to its natural color.</li>
            <li> Many don;t like its rather dry texture and green colouring, but this has been the first moisturiser I&#x27;ve ever been able to tolerate.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> However, I gave it four stars because it&#x27;s better than any other product I have used.</li>
            <li> facial redness has been reduced significantly.</li>
            <li> you suffer from redness or have a lot red tones in your skin, then this product is worth trying!</li>
            <li> I still enjoy other Eucerin products, this guy just wasn&#x27;t right for my skin type.</li>
            <li> When I put my makeup on over it, it looked fine to start, but throughout the day it would start to cake and look strange.  </li>
            <li> Probably fine for a climate other than hot humid South Florida, but does not let my skin breath</li>
            <li> I discontinued using the night creame, but continue to use the lotion as it does a good job making my skin look significantly less red by masking it.  </li>
            <li> The very first time I put the light green lotion on my cheeks, I had an instantaneous result.</li>
            <li> I can not stress enough how much I dislike this product &amp; I tried many ways of using it, finally gave up &amp; threw it out.</li>
            <li> So overall, not a bad experience.</li>
            <li> I have very fair, sensitive dry skin that is VERY cool-toned, which brings a lot of pink into my skin especially on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> But, mixed with equal parts tinted moisturizer (like Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moist with SPF 30), the Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion does a great job of neutralizing some of the redness.</li>
            <li> You can always try a travel size sold on many sites at half</li>
            <li> I think you need quite a dry oil free moisturiser for Rosacea.</li>
            <li> anytime I knew I was going to be outside, but disliking the way most facial sunscreens felt, greasy and oily, I wouldn&#x27;t use them as often as I should.</li>
            <li> look like I have a decent sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I was recently prescribed MetroCream by my dermatologist for some mild rosacea which gives me redness across my nose and cheeks.  </li>
            <li> If I use it daily, my skin the next day appears more even-toned.</li>
            <li> think it did a decent job of neutralizing the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am using the night cream as an AM &amp; PM treatment and I really recommend it instead and just using a green tinted primer on top for make up purposes.</li>
            <li> I have very red cheeks, sometimes with bumps, but mostly just red flare-ups from weather, heat, spicy food or alcohol.</li>
            <li> The green tint is helpful in covering the redness, and then I put my regular foundation over it and it looks good.</li>
            <li> I quickly washed the lotion off and the area was so irritated and when I looked in the mirror the lines were screaming fire engine red</li>
            <li> Much better than the Clinique product I used to use (which was also much more expensive, mind you).</li>
            <li> Anyway, it&#x27;s soft and you don&#x27;t need to use too much to cover the whole face.</li>
            <li> I love Eucerin products in general, so would recommend this brand  to anyone with red, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne and oily skin since I was a teenager, but now that I&#x27;m older, I tend to have clear skin except for breakouts at certain times of the month, which coincide with my menstrual cycle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the redness relief range for roscea.</li>
            <li> /&gt;FYI, I have been using the companion product, Eucerin Soothing Cleanser, for about 7 weeks and would highly recommend it for redness relief.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone who needs a bit</li>
            <li> I lose that beautiful tan and am left with a pale, red-toned facial skin color.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job of covering up the red by using a green color base, but don&#x27;t expect a perfect red-free complexion.</li>
            <li> After two days my skin is looking a little better (or maybe placebo effect?</li>
            <li> This is a lighter moisturizer, so if you&#x27;re looking for something heavy to gloop on your face at night, this likely won&#x27;t fit, but I do see there is a nighttime moisturizer available in this product line.</li>
            <li> It really helps with my sensitive face.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my normal face cream</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, it makes my skin soft without being greasy and the green tint really evens out your skin.</li>
            <li> It does a good job covering red face, but if your face is very red, it will make it pink.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of tinted mineral spf creams and even mineral make-up with sunscreen that I prefer to use because I only have to put on one product that covers the red with a more natural color.</li>
            <li> On several sites regarding skin care for Rosacea prone skin, I read that this product is useful for calming the skin.  </li>
            <li> Helpful only to a minor degree although better than nothing.</li>
            <li> The green does counteract the redness somewhat, making it look more tan colored.</li>
            <li> can see how this product might have good intentions for those who suffer from redness, but the chemical sunscreens used in the product made my situation worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lotion is nice though and not too thick.</li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t always completely cover up the redness, it helps to tone it down so that when I put on makeup, I can better cover the redness.  </li>
            <li> Better off using plain ole yellow concealer (not green) to cover your red before applying makeup...haven&#x27;t found anything to top that yet.</li>
            <li> never want to look more pale than I have to just to mask the redness.  </li>
            <li> I have a mild case of roscacea, coupled with periodic eczema and overall sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and with one use my skin felt soft and no longer was red and irritated.</li>
            <li> I LOVE their face wash and night cream, though, and my skin is overly sensitive, so I can&#x27;t give it less than a 3 star.</li>
            <li> I pump it right on the back of my hand.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I found I can get it at Amazon, but you don&#x27;t often have to buy it because it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> After trying many, many products to control the KP on my young son&#x27;s face, I was hoping this would help clear the redness and bumps, but unfortunately, it did not work for him.</li>
            <li> considering using a good, very light self tanner to see if that helps make the redness less noticeable (by making my normal skin tone not quite so pale - less contrast).</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on smooth, but I&#x27;ve noticed that it isn&#x27;t compatible with other lotions</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on like any other type of light lotion, but it has a greenish tint to it.  </li>
            <li> I will always buy this product, unless something else new appears.</li>
            <li> I am seasonal and live in FL and MN.  </li>
            <li> Try new face products on days you don&#x27;t plan on leaving the house.  </li>
            <li> Just mentioning to save you time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosacea is a relatively new development in my life.  </li>
            <li> This is a product I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> Almost nothing triggers it now, and even if it does, the redness is nowhere near as extreme as it was, and it disappears very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazingly efficient, as it spreads thinly and one doesn&#x27;t need to use much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; my sensitive  skin generally cannot tolerate any SPF higher than that.  </li>
            <li> If you have super dry skin, moisturize before using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did; the Eucerin product isn&#x27;t really a moisturizer, at least for my 66-year-old skin, so using both is the answer.  </li>
            <li> but, alas, I will continue to use this product because it does SUCH a great job.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and when the weather is changing so does my skin.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for anyone at any age with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this actually does very much.</li>
            <li> The summer time can be brutal on the skin, and fair skinned people like my wife and son get burned very easily in this Texas heat.  </li>
            <li> In my case I have very sensitive facial skin, especially on my forehead, and finally realized I must be allergic to ingredients in many lotions, creams and sunscreens - even had a severe reaction to Metrogel when I tried it for a couple days.</li>
            <li> For me, however, it&#x27;s exactly what I needed to get my confidence back.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times and the first thing I look for is the grease level.</li>
            <li> It definitely covers up the problem a bit when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have rosacea, but I do turn red often: when I&#x27;m stressed, when I&#x27;m embarrassed, when I&#x27;ve been in the sun, when I&#x27;m hot, etc.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last night.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am pretty dissatisfied that it doesn&#x27;t lessen the redness, but I give Eucerin an A for trying and hope they continue trying to improve their products.</li>
            <li> After my ghostbuster first day, I experimented with smaller amounts and how I apply it to my face.  </li>
            <li> Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion not only has the SPF 15 factored into its formula (sunscreen is crucial for rosacea patients), but my husband is pleased that it is non greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product daily for years and it has never failed me.  </li>
            <li> bought this for sensitive skin and it is just a normal lotion.</li>
            <li> Not sure which is better.  </li>
            <li> This is because parts of my face are more dry than others and the dry areas will grab onto the Eucerin cream and make it look, well, ...</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product, but not a good alternative to a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how strongly tinted green</li>
            <li> Overall, good product, but just use it in small amounts on problem areas only if you don&#x27;t want to look like Kermit the Frog.</li>
            <li> I tried the Eucerin, and it might be okay for those with just a ruddy complexion, but it still did not cover enough of my redness to keep it hidden.  </li>
            <li> My skin tone appears more even and less red when I use it, and that is the purpose of the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s goes on easily, stays put and washes off with plain soap and water.</li>
            <li> Right now I am fighting dry itch flaky elbows.</li>
            <li> This lotion is fine as SPF protection, but I already had a few of those.</li>
            <li> would say this is better for red and DRY skin, although it doesn&#x27;t necessarily</li>
            <li> My deep flushing  still continues - after four years of use, I believe that it helps to a certain degree.  </li>
            <li> I found it useful to blend this lotion with my other daily moisturizer that has a higher SPF.</li>
            <li> The only thing is I wish it was just a little more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I do add a little of my Organic facial moisturizer on top of the Eucerin.  </li>
            <li> and I had to rub my face so hard to get it to go on, my face was more irritated than before I used it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember my face being this clear ...</li>
            <li> That isn&#x27;t clear to me from the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Granted, I have relatively early stage rosacea -</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> After cleaning my face very well 2) I will apply a *sheer layer of this product 3)</li>
            <li> I have 2-3 medium size scars and simply pat the excess out gently w/ my finger, before doing the</li>
            <li> Since I have been using Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion, I have noticed a real change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have some old battle scars to heal up...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference the next day though or the day after while I maintained use of</li>
            <li> leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> So far, it seems to be reducing the redness I have with rosacea.</li>
            <li> far as the greenish tint that offsets the appearance of redness, it works to an extent.  </li>
            <li> It goes on a light green but blends in with your skin.  </li>
            <li> It never fully blends in with your skin, and I&#x27;m a VERY light-skinned Mexican comparible to East Asians.</li>
            <li> , my face starts to become itchy and sensitive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a godsend for those of us with unsolvable sensitive</li>
            <li> mix this with Oil of Olay Sensitive Skin SPF 30.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really how red my skin had gotten until I applied this and saw how even and radiant my skin on my face looked!  </li>
            <li> The green tint is not visible on my skin once I smooth the lotion in, and it visibly diminishes the redness.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and stays moisturized throughout the day, even up to bedtime without a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> it calms my skin, keeps it soft</li>
            <li> It really does mask any redness, but I found that all redness is gone by simply using the redness relief night</li>
            <li> and so my skin has become sensitive and started flushing.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Leaves my shin feeling soft and it has a glowing look after applying it.</li>
            <li> Completely removes redness.</li>
            <li> The only product that I haven&#x27;t used as much is this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within 5 days my skin was noticeably smoother, much less red, more even-toned and not totally dry as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok just the color is a little strange.  </li>
            <li> You only need to use a very little amount, I have tried using a lot to cover up my rosacea better</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this as your only sunscreen if you plan to be outside for a long period of time, but for those of use who can burn when only outside for a limited amount of time and don&#x27;t want to remember to use a separate sunscreen, this works great as a daily sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Obviously I have to put some blush on, but that&#x27;s not any more than usual.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re pretty much smearing mint green all over your face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it appears to have caused a mild breakout across my face (not horribly since I only used it twice)</li>
            <li> Initially I became interested after I read a personal recommendation on a Squidoo Lens</li>
            <li> For the last ten years all I have seen in the mirror or in pictures of myself is RED RED and more RED.  </li>
            <li> First off, it is a very dry moisturizer....</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it and only product we found that truly does it.</li>
            <li> I am a light, black skinned female.</li>
            <li> It made the dry skin green and more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> but, hey it is worth trying, especially if your face isn&#x27;t dry from medicine..</li>
            <li> Only use aliiitle bit - otherwise the green will be too strong and you might look like a frog</li>
            <li> I am very eager to see how it works out in the long run.</li>
            <li> What I saw was lightly blushed cheeks, which means that Eucerin did its job to lessen the usual redness.</li>
            <li> Very Pasty , not natural, doesn&#x27;t do a thing for redness</li>
            <li> does come out like a light mint green, kind of weird</li>
            <li> The reduction in redness is pretty minimal.</li>
            <li> I am almost back to normal.  </li>
            <li> The greenish tint helps make my red skin look normal.  </li>
            <li> I have convinced him to start treating his nose for rosacea and it is starting to return to normal</li>
            <li> But also they have found yellow is better than green at making red go away.</li>
            <li> My pores just look full of green gunk.</li>
            <li> very light, it is green, to combat the red but really tones it down..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using the range about 5/6 months and, as I wear make-up most days, it&#x27;s hard to know what to do to alleviate the itch.</li>
            <li> few more important notes:  if you have rosacea and your eyes are itchy or dry or if it is hard to see out of them sometimes wearing your glasses or not, you may have</li>
            <li> I just live with my slightly red cheeks, and consider it built in blush for now.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recently prescribed Mirvaso, a new prescription cream which relieves redness (sort of) by shrinking blood vessels temporarily.</li>
            <li> I felt like a new person showing up to work without a red</li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive skin like me, don&#x27;t even get it any where near your eyes unless you want runny, red, bloodshot eyes (&amp;</li>
            <li> /&gt;After several weeks of daily use, I do see a reduction in the amount of redness in my cheeks, which is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Eucerin Redness Relief Daily is only product that really works well with my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;ALSO, rosacea can cause the bulbous red nose that older people can get (Think classic fisherman&#x27;s red nose), even if the rest of their skin is not red.  </li>
            <li> I have red skin from rosacea and this really helps cover the red.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of masking redness but can leave a white residue and can be difficult to rub in.</li>
            <li> I have mild rosacea type 2 with redness, some bumps, a few visible capillaries and severe dryness/flakiness, Did not like this one.</li>
            <li> However, it does make me look a little more pale than normal</li>
            <li> This product is more of a weak sunscreen than a redness cover for rosa era which is what it was touted to be.</li>
            <li> I walked into work the other day after applying this for the first time and my boss looked at me in horror.  </li>
            <li> started this routine in May 2013, and two months later, nearly all the redness is GONE!  </li>
            <li> but it seems to work about the same when I only use a little, possibly even better.</li>
            <li> I only wish Eucerin had a tinted, sensitive skin, spf moisterizer!</li>
            <li> so it wouldn&#x27;t make me look super pale or bead up when I put my make-up on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super moisturizing and its kind of a small bottle</li>
            <li> Another reviewer mentioned that you can&#x27;t really use it with any facial hair, which is frustrating because my facial hair grows at an annoyingly fast rate (I like being clean shaven anyway</li>
            <li> calm being the only word I can think of to describe the sensation, or maybe lack of the sensation, I get with other products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this lotion would probably be useful for someone with redness on their whole face, and someone who is not very fair skinned, or someone who wears concealer and foundation on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Was very streaky and felt very dry.</li>
            <li> However, on a serious note I offer that this product has helped me with my predicament, and its effects last for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Unlike the Physician&#x27;s Formula powder, you really have to have a particular &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; for the green to cancel out.</li>
            <li> There is no need for a huge amount because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My husband pointed out that it look a teeny bit green at first, but my usual powder evens the tone out just fine.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers; this stuff can leave a residue on your face, making you look more odd than you would with red skin.</li>
            <li> It may prevent a sunburn, which could prevent a red face, but otherwise, it&#x27;s goal is to mask the skin with a green-tinted moisturizer that goes on clear.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is, if it provided any redness relief at all, it was barely noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to my Aveno calming lotion: it has no green tint, and does wonders for decreasing redness and dryness.</li>
            <li> My mother loves this - she has sensitive skin and only purchases this brand.</li>
            <li> So far, I can see a difference in the texture and tone of my skin while at the same time look like my wearing nothing at all!  </li>
            <li> Apparently, the thickness of the lotion will not allow it to blend into hair follicles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much of a moisturizer, doesn&#x27;t soak into my face very well</li>
            <li> It is kind of expensive but works somewhat.</li>
            <li> , keep in mind that 98% of the people who you walk past on the street aren&#x27;t going to notice or care that your face looks kind of green</li>
            <li> After a month of using it, there is a difference in this lotion from other face products - you have to be smart about how you apply</li>
            <li> I found this lotion to be more sticky than my previous moisturizer and the green color does nothing to counteract the &amp;#34;redness&amp;#34; problem.</li>
            <li> A light, delicate lotion with a subtle, light scent that is barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Works well but had to experiment with it quite a few times to get the right amount</li>
            <li> My face is no less red than before.  </li>
            <li> So - if you feel like going home early - just put this stuff on in large amounts and you will look like the Walking Dead.  </li>
            <li> We have purchased this product a couple times before and have really notice the difference it makes compared to other competing products.</li>
            <li> Very soothing on the roscea parts of my face which can get extremely itchy.</li>
            <li> Much thicker than other redness lotions I have used.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any other product that works really at all.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t have an issue with this (and prefer physical sunscreens) but because this product is also tinted green, you REALLY have to rub it</li>
            <li> Is it there to convince us that this is a serious concoction, or does it smell because an important healing ingredient happens to smell.  </li>
            <li> no I don&#x27;t stick it in my eye balls, just couldn&#x27;t get it anywhere near them making this product even more useless).</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for people with redness but not dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried at least 15 different products for my face, including several expensive prescription medication, and none of them really alleviated the redness and just made me feel more hopeless about improving my appearance.</li>
            <li> The green tint is too strong for my admittedly very pale skin tone and is actually visible unless I apply this very sparingly.</li>
            <li> A little greasy for daytime, especially if you are wearing makeup—I would suggest getting a concealer or green concealer and mixing a little into some liquid foundation or into your own moisturizer to cancel out redness instead of just using this particular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> But he also had a bit of dry skin, and the lotion there gave him a light greenish, Frankenstein&#x27;s monster tone, not particularly desirable at times other than Halloween.  </li>
            <li> The Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion Broad Spectrum SPF 15 is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> As a lotion that actually reduces the redness, not just the appearance of redness, it seemed to work on a small, moderately light red area, but not on a darker, larger one.</li>
            <li> Light green lotion,looks a little whiter than before but still be natural.</li>
            <li> and there was mention in other reviews of a previous kind that wasnt tinted green which I wouldve also tried</li>
            <li> First of all, it doesn&#x27;t absorb, leaving a coat of green residue.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the product is green and feels like caked-on makeup.  </li>
            <li> I used it everyday when I first got it, but every time I used, people would ask me if I was feeling well.</li>
            <li> First it&#x27;s green in color.</li>
            <li> Has really calmed my rosacea down.  </li>
            <li> It really helps with the roseca and clams the redness down..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it because a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my skin has always been so sensitive that most lotions and other treatments cause worse skin problems than the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that in order to hide my redness, I needed to apply an excessive amount, which didn&#x27;t work under any primer or liquid foundation---it just came right off.</li>
            <li> I needed a product that would not only instantly calm my redness, but work overtime to help with the sensitivity and excessive dryness.  </li>
            <li> To solve this problem, I generally apply this lotion only to my problem areas (cheeks and nose), and then use a separate Cetaphil SPF-15 facial lotion for the rest of my face (forehead, jaw, chin, etc.).  </li>
            <li> In addition, it left my skin feeling far oilier than I like, and I had a minor blackhead breakout on the 5th and 6th days I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get eczema on my fave and am normally really self-conscious about the rash and general ruddy, uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this lotion won&#x27;t be useful, except for the small red bumps on my face, which it seems to cover with no irritation -it</li>
            <li> When I put less on, I am a little less green, but because my skin is dry from it not being a good moisturizer, there are light green flakes that appear.</li>
            <li> My cheeks and forehead skin are less red and much softer.</li>
            <li> I like the light texture of this daily lotion and the green tint helps \\&quot;cool\\&quot; down any redness going on.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 months and have a lot left so while the price is a little much</li>
            <li> First, know that a little of this stuff goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> It is bluish/green which sound crazy but does a great job as a foundation for covering little broken blood vessels and redness.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works, but the reason I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars is that it&#x27;s not soothing and the green &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; is a little much.  </li>
            <li> I applied very little, a small amount, &amp; then tried more &amp; no type of application worked.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews, good and bad, then decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> I also gently use it in the delicate corners of my eyes near the nose which makes it act like a concealer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also going to investigate the potential connection between my rosacea and SIBO (small intestine bacteria overgowth) and/or heliocopter pilori, the bacteria responsible for ulcers, which we apparently all carry on our skin.  </li>
            <li> The green tint helped a lot; however, I have pretty dry skin and the lotion</li>
            <li> This day cream is very thick and seems to instantly dry the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I mix it half and half with a non-tinted moisturizer to decrease the strength of the green coloring.  </li>
            <li> I have a few other Eucerin products and know they are pricey, but worth the money, so I took my chance on it.    </li>
            <li> First of all, this product makes you look very pale and does not permanently reduce the redness.</li>
            <li> Because I only have a problem on my cheeks and nose, this product will last a long time, especially when I mix it this way.</li>
            <li> My husband has a very ruddy complexion, and when I used him as a guinea pig and put the lotion on only half of his face (he is a very tolerant guy), the treated half did look slightly less red than the untreated side.  </li>
            <li> I used only a small dab and it really wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> some of your skin looks like it has been touched up with something slightly green or something, but the main redness is there.  </li>
            <li> the shade is def not &#x27;subtle green&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, oily skin with slight redness on my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> Eucerin products are often recommended by doctors for sensitive skin, so I ordered the Redness Relief Daily Perfecting lotion in the hopes that it would tone down the \\&quot;sunburned\\</li>
            <li> The heavy texture and the necessary green tint will give you a pale complexion if you slather it on like you would most face lotions.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any serious skin problems, but my water has terribly high rust from old pipes</li>
            <li> if I put it on a small area of my face, but since this has an SPF of 15, it&#x27;s meant for your whole face.     </li>
            <li> Its green sunblock, not thick but takes forever to work into the skin.  </li>
            <li> since the first application it reduced the redness (at least superficially).</li>
            <li> So are the long term effects meant only for redness caused by UV rays?  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have rosacea, but my skin was really red from staying out in the sun for too long.</li>
            <li> It does last a long time</li>
            <li> I have had a red face every day as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> Normally I use Obagi Rosaclear line, but thought I could save a few dollars with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick.  </li>
            <li> either way, this product comes out very green and u must rub in very well.  </li>
            <li> Once that was dry (you could see a thin layer of Epsom salts on the surface of my skin), I gently washed off the lotion, and re-applied a very small amount that could be easily absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is Green as the bad reviews say lol...</li>
            <li> That dry skin or skin that has not been exfoliated will NOT do well - it will cake and be a total disaster - and keep it AWAY from your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I experience dry, red face skin.</li>
            <li> In the long run you&#x27;ll be spending just as much money, if not more, than if you would have just bought a nicer line of product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lotion is very mild and causes no irritation, which I was skeptical about.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend you use a tiny, tiny amount - about half the size of a pea or less after using your normal moisturizing.</li>
            <li> One smallish, moderately red patch seems to have actually lightened or become less red in the time I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> I like the feeling of \\&quot;nothing\\&quot; on my face, and I get that with other moisturizers, such as Olay Total Effects.</li>
            <li> So if I use this only on my cheeks, I need to use a second lotion on all other parts of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Give it a try if many other things have failed.</li>
            <li> My local Walgreens actually discontinued the product due to low/no sales, I should have figured out why, if it worked they would have sold it.  </li>
            <li> I apply a highly concentrated benzoyl peroxide cream to dry out my numerous zits, but then I need something to keep the dryness from damaging the skin without undoing all the benzoyl peroxide&#x27;s hard work.</li>
            <li> skin is sensitive and this was not irritating and it has only a faint sunscreen odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say stay clear of this, it doesnt work and is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is still red but not nearly as much as before I started using the lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also seems to add a strange texture or lumpyness to the surface of the skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion comes from the folks at Eucerin who have long history of producing quality products.</li>
            <li> Maybe its the way I&#x27;ve been blending this into my skin, but I can never really make this blend in enough without having my face look a bit \\&quot;off.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This definitely seems to work for her, just be careful of</li>
            <li> This helps but does not completely cover up my redness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts a long time...</li>
            <li> It moisturizes the skin, makes redness invisible for long hours</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I get red from stress and this did not really help with that.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s chalky and sort of strange.</li>
            <li> Covers it up some, but then found a green stick makeup that covers it completely.</li>
            <li> The night creme was working slowly, but being self conscious, I decided to turn to the daily perfecting lotion which was a big mistake!</li>
            <li> the green color really brings down the redness in my skin alone or under makeup.</li>
            <li> (if you weren&#x27;t aware, this stuff is green since red and green cancel each other out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin actually got less red after discontinuing the \\&quot;redness relief\\&quot; product line.</li>
            <li> It is too thick to spread easily on my dry skin, and makes me look like a ghost if I use it straight.</li>
            <li> After showering or washing my face in the morning, I&#x27;ve used a small amount of the lotion over my whole face with a little extra added to my problem areas.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend a mixture of the three if you&#x27;re experiencing redness due to blemishes or scarring from hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> You just need a very small amount and dab it on, then gently blend in.</li>
            <li> I can see myself using this for a long time, hopefully they don&#x27;t change anything!</li>
            <li> I do the same for one cheek, then the other.  </li>
            <li> It keeps the comments from other people about my red face away!</li>
            <li> Recently the bumps have become extreme, and after doing some reading, I realized what I was dealing with.  </li>
            <li> I have only tried one other product for rosacea, Clinique Redness solution.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get this product!</li>
            <li> This is a very strange product.</li>
            <li> I notice when I don&#x27;t use it that my face feels really dry.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed this on my skin where it is dry:  </li>
            <li> which then made my foundation dry.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes, too, and my face doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s about to &amp;#34;crack&amp;#34; from dry, irritated skin anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did nothing for dry spots and did not mask any redness.  </li>
            <li> my cheeks tend to stay dry</li>
            <li> The lotion itself it a bit watery and takes awhile to dry.</li>
            <li> However, I used it all over my face, not all of which is red, and the regions that are NOT red came out with a sickly green tinge to them.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried the dermalogica anti-redness cream before this one, and it decreased redness but left my face looking very shiny and oily.</li>
            <li> The mineral colorants give it a green tone that helps to neutralize the appearance of red facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The green definitely blends the red away.</li>
            <li> like I hit a point of no return a few years back when I stopped tanning at all and just burned no matter what, and this means I don&#x27;t have to add a sunscreen to what would (without this) be an ever growing list of products to apply daily, and an ever growing collection of countertop</li>
            <li> The key is to use the amount of green you need to counteract the redness,  and for very red skin you will probably need to apply a concealer over the lotion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a green, thin, lightweight lotion, that I smooth on my face, concentrating on the reddest areas of my face, but there is no diminished look of the redness.</li>
            <li> I have used many different types of facial lotion but this one caused me one of the worst acne breakouts that I&#x27;ve had since high school.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell a major difference with the green tint</li>
            <li> The lotion seems a bit expensive, but for myself, a little goes a long way (I only use half a pump; a full pump is too much for my face and makes me look green).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I made my own lotion using some really thick, rich lotion base (it&#x27;s used for making bath/beauty products and is as thick as shortening), and added an equal amount of water to it ....</li>
            <li> This moisturizer on its own is a bit too green for us and leaves a pallor that makes us look a little ill.</li>
            <li> I mean, I haven&#x27;t gone outside without 50 SPF block and full body coverage plus wide brimmed hat for at least a decade.  </li>
            <li> so the green won&#x27;t be so apparent.</li>
            <li> The green tint really does minimize redness, but you have to be careful not to put it on non-red areas or your skin will look green.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have tried for rosacea and have been using it for over a year because I am too scared to try something else in case it makes it worse.</li>
            <li> will say the redness is not completely disguised with this product, however, the irritated red look is calmed down to a healthier pink glow.</li>
            <li> If you have rosacea that is anything past looking like a mild sunburn, this product will only make it worse.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that most people with regular or darker complexions would have this problem, but it left me looking a little sea sick all the time.  </li>
            <li> It has helped me to feel less self-concious in public</li>
            <li> Herein lies the problem for me -- I don&#x27;t typically wear foundation, especially in the summer time.  </li>
            <li> My skin is dry and this is not very moisturizing at all.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with rough, dry skin on my elbows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, so I&#x27;m not sure how well it works overall.</li>
            <li> Leaves an odd white film on my face, does not absorb well at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an evil little condition in that it makes you feel incredibly unattractive and erodes your self confidence, but it doesn&#x27;t affect your (physical) health at all and the only real &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; for it is expensive laser surgery that costs $500-700 per treatment that may or may not work and makes you look like a circus freak for a week or two afterwards</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and Eucerin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> First, the lotion is very light, which means I have to put a LOT on in order to use it for dry skin, and second, the tint is a pale green which just made my face look scary and weird.</li>
            <li> During harsh winters, my face gets red, dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> If you have rosacea or just cheeks that are a little too rosy, you can use this alone or blend with your regular moisturizer to get a nice even base for makeup.</li>
            <li> The only problem is I have a hard time finding it in the local drug stores.</li>
            <li> For my friend with milky white skin with freckles it defiantly left a greenish tinge no matter how hard she rubbed it</li>
            <li> The only bad part about this is that if you wear it outside and sweat your whole face will turn white.</li>
            <li> Just not what I expected</li>
            <li> This 1.7 oz bottle has lasted me 6 months and still has a few months of use left in it.  </li>
            <li> If too mush is applied to white areas, the skin turns green.</li>
            <li> So putting the green over the red skin helps even out the skin tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Green tinted lotion requires extra rubbing to blend into skin</li>
            <li> Just a few drops daily do the trick, so one bottle will last a few months.</li>
            <li> Just be careful in applying it...</li>
            <li> Finally something that truly helps my reddish face that doesn&#x27;t look like a green face mask.</li>
            <li> I currently have a bit of a tan, so this completely flushed out the tan and cast an eerie paleness over my face that was enough to make him comment.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and get pink in the cheeks.</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s tinted green, I don&#x27;t notice any actual reduction of redness on my face.</li>
            <li> I was unaware when I purchased this product that it is tinted green for covering up the redness.  </li>
            <li> If you already have a green tinted makeup to counteract redness, then I don&#x27;t see this product doing anything different, except for the moisturizing component.</li>
            <li> I think if you do not have as red a skin, the green could be too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My friends told me about various products on the market that reduce redness by having a green tone.  </li>
            <li> After Googling around and finding Eurcerin for a minimal cost, I thought I couldn&#x27;t lose.  </li>
            <li> Remember, it is colored green, which neutralizes red.</li>
            <li> Whatever is left of the green pea, I use on my temples and then neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is mint green because green is opposite red on the color spectrum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not very excites about this cream.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;green tint\\&quot; in this does seem to diminish the appearance of redness, it is not moisterizing enough.</li>
            <li> I apply a tiny bit on my cheeks, and after smearing it on there are always spots of green that I have to wipe</li>
            <li> so I could actually read the writing on it, and two thumbs up for the pump dispenser and a product that&#x27;s thick enough it doesn&#x27;t run all over my fingers before I can get it to my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of sunscreen especially at this time of the year</li>
            <li> The only comlplaint is that it&#x27;s a bit to thick to massage evenly over his facial hair.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce redness with the green tint and serves as a good base for makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, once the redness was mostly gone, I looked a little bit shiny and very, very white - almost sickly.</li>
            <li> Previously, if I exercised or drank just a tiny bit of an alcoholic beverage, my face would turn beet red within minutes.  </li>
            <li> And if to pale just use on red areas!</li>
            <li> (at this point, I start to look pale, and need blush on my cheek bones, the struggles of having Irish skin!).</li>
            <li> The only people trying to counteract redness are pale, Eucerin.  </li>
            <li> It is certainly not gone, but it&#x27;s better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not certain what the purpose of that is either.</li>
            <li> It helps tame the red; use it under your foundation.  </li>
            <li> I started putting a very small amount (so it completely disappears...</li>
            <li> I put it on one side of my face and compared it to the other side and absolutely no difference.  </li>
            <li> who knows but I see my face a little bit less red).</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> Use it sparingly because a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> (Dumb, but I can only make hubby do so much) and never burns (at least visibly) noticed his nose is getting bumpy and bulbous.  </li>
            <li> I tried the &amp;#34;Soothing Cleanser&amp;#34; facewash and I&#x27;m really not sure if that actually does anything, but I&#x27;m still sticking with it anyway because it&#x27;s certainly not hurting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little wary of the ingredients because some of them can not be natural (though Eucerin does not claim it is natural by</li>
            <li> (tip - cover your rosacea with green minerals over the lotion), plus improves the overall condition of your skin - less pores, even tone.</li>
            <li> Regular use of this line of products does seem to make my skin less reactive, in addition to the cosmetic effect of the green tint.</li>
            <li> I was experiencing a lot of redness on my face due to hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li> If you put it on without mixing with other moisturizer, it streaks and doesn&#x27;t blend as well.  </li>
            <li> anyone with a flare up due to soap or a chronic redness I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> upon reading other reviews I want to emphasize that this is NOT a moisturizing lotion; you should apply it *</li>
            <li> which means they cancel each other out.</li>
            <li> other</li>
            <li> I take a little of my other facial lotion and mix a little of this with it in my palm, then apply to my rosy cheeks and nose.</li>
            <li> It feels heavy, greasy, doesn&#x27;t soak on for a long time (takes hours</li>
            <li> I had the highest hopes, but, as with most skin care products that are supposed to help rosacea, I was deeply disappointed.  </li>
            <li> No need to spend the $250 for Mirvaso or any other prescription</li>
            <li> It also takes a bit of effort to rub in the sunscreen due to the titanium dioxide.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I then applied small amounts of the redness cream to the red areas.  </li>
            <li> A total waste of time and my money!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this!</li>
            <li> Use it sparingly as other said and it works well.</li>
            <li> Some of the other products I have checked out are four times the cost.  </li>
            <li> People with tan skin, be careful!</li>
            <li> Only takes a small amount</li>
            <li> Does help neutralize/mask redness due to rosacea, before putting on foundation.</li>
            <li> Im not sure this is a fix, only a cover, but</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, not much more to say, just give it a shot if you have a red face all the time</li>
            <li> It is in the cabinet with the other 30 or so products that haven&#x27;t helped.</li>
            <li> Also using other products to help with my skin</li>
            <li> green color is a little frightening at first, but it counteracts the red and smoothes out my complexion so that I do not have to use any other masking problems if I want to apply make up that day.  </li>
            <li> I personally feel that the cream is a little heavy, so I use it as a night cream.</li>
            <li> but it makes the skin look very rough</li>
            <li> have to wear very heavy, greasy makeup to cover my red</li>
            <li> The green counteracts the redness, thus hiding it, but if applied to non-red areas of the skin you will definitely have a green tinted face going on.  </li>
            <li> cream is green- green and red are complementary colors-</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the green didn&#x27;t help neutralize the red at all (just made my face green-ish, and I didn&#x27;t use much) and the chemicals used in the sunscreen caused my face to itch and slightly burn.</li>
            <li> I am one of those lucky people who suffers from rosacea.</li>
            <li> Its not great as a sunblock because you only use a tiny bit.  </li>
            <li> This is green tinted like I like but instead of feeling like a green tinted moisturizer (creamy and thick), it feels more like green tinted sunscreen (thin and stings).</li>
            <li> I am caucasian, with medium skin tone (not really fair but no dark tan either).</li>
            <li> The implication, of course, is for help with conditions such as rosacea, as other reviewers have noted, but that was not my experience with it, at least not after a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I assume it would work better for women who are using this as a base under other makeup, rather than as a men&#x27;s moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I can vouch that it&#x27;s VERY green but that it truly makes her face look less red.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone that may feel insecure about their skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the methol smell.  </li>
            <li> This is a creme that dispenses blue/green, colors known to help hide dark blemishes</li>
            <li> The SPF is only 15 when it should be 25 at least.  </li>
            <li> I came across this line of products late last month (May 2014).</li>
            <li> It seems you will ether love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> Rosacea is one of those conditions that I&#x27;ve found get&#x27;s more annoying over time and as we age.</li>
            <li> While I was curious about the green color of the lotion</li>
            <li> The redness tends to make a butterfly pattern: it runs from just over my eyebrows down over my nose, and across the tops of my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lotion didn&#x27;t create blemishes and it tones down my too-pink complexion with or without makeup.</li>
            <li> And when I sweat, which is what I do a lot, it trickles down and reminds me</li>
            <li> This product helps tone down the redness often associated with rosacea.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews that their face turned green from using the product</li>
            <li> I purchased this with a few other redness relief cremes to hopefully reduce my rosacea, and after a week I notice a difference.</li>
            <li> As a redhead, I&#x27;ve suffered from slightly a slightly redder skin tone than I&#x27;d like as well as the propensity to burn anytime I&#x27;m in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, and do notice a difference with less redness all around.</li>
            <li> Even men who get razor burn from shaving will have less redness with this lotion, as one of my sons discovered when I had him try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that i get less flare ups when since I have started using this.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed because it left my skin looking ghostly which required me to put on make-up afterwards.</li>
            <li> It slightly reduces redness -</li>
            <li> I heated it slightly in the microwave</li>
            <li> This can be a serious condition AND the treatment is simple so please check it out!  </li>
            <li> The glass bottle is odd</li>
            <li> and it did not even reduce the redness slightly.  </li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t believe it), troubled by steadily worsening rosacea for about 10 years.</li>
            <li> take a little lotion, not much,  and rub it in all over my face, let it set for a few minutes, then puff on a little corn starch (face powder makes me itch).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that is due to the active ingredients or if that is something added just for the color.</li>
            <li> or you will have an obvious green tint.&lt;br /&gt;2,  Since it is green if you are not careful you can get it into hairlines and eyebrows where it is difficult to remove</li>
            <li> At first I was a little shocked by the green tinge but then remembered green can counteract the red tone of skin.</li>
            <li> You definitely don&#x27;t want to put this lotion anywhere where your skin is not red, otherwise it will be difficult to avoid making it look green.</li>
            <li> It is unclear if long term use helps \\&quot;treat\\&quot; the redness that exists, but at least temporarily it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get normal coverage.</li>
            <li> The green color of the lotion does help to immediately tone down the redness, though.</li>
            <li> It does help the redness a little because it is very green, but instead of red you get this strange texture which looks worse.    </li>
            <li> Now in my late 40&#x27;s my face is dry too.</li>
            <li> The problem however, as others have stated in previous reviews, is the green color of the lotion.  </li>
            <li> The slight green tint to the moisturizer adds to the amazingness.</li>
            <li> It feels a little odd to put a green lotion on your face.</li>
            <li> Then when I would go to put my makup on, it sort of rolled up into little balls.</li>
            <li> so add a little bronzer.</li>
            <li> Yes it can make your face a little lighter, but who cares,i&#x27;d rather look a little lighter compared to a discomfort of a skin irritation on my face...</li>
            <li> This cream helps the redness a little.  </li>
            <li> can get a little rosy and she wanted to help the redness.</li>
            <li> The SPF makes it feel a little sticky though.</li>
            <li> I looked a little \\&quot;weird\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I found this little guy at Walgreens, where he was a whopping $15.</li>
            <li> Water cuts the tint a little.  </li>
            <li> A little drying - mix it with moisturizer</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put on a lot; just try a little at a time.</li>
            <li> I have used avar green cream in the past but stopped due to its $$.</li>
            <li> and sometimes the dry scaly bits of rosacea look like weird green scabs, because the moisturizer isn&#x27;t moist enough.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d used the cream base before, and although it was fine for a moisturizer, it alone didn&#x27;t do anything to stop the redness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you must use a little at a time, or you will be rubbing in a lot of green.  </li>
            <li> The green tint helps a little bit to counteract the redness in my face when used under my BB Cream.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive or breakout prone skin, be a little wary.</li>
            <li> I suggest practicing this method on your hand a few times before, using on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are all so heavy &amp; greasy &amp; this ones</li>
            <li> Finish Color Correcting Foundation Primer, tinted green.</li>
            <li> This product has a built in tinted green concealer which is used to combat redness in the skin via camouflage.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product doesn&#x27;t completely mask the redness of my skin.</li>
            <li> When applying the lotion note that it is GREEN and must be rubbed well into the skin.</li>
            <li> It just made my skin look green</li>
            <li> For YEARS I have fought breakouts and recently they seemed to get worse.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize that it was tinted green, which I know counteracts redness.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks, there was no difference in my skin tone, texture, or anything.</li>
            <li> This was, unfortunately, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> While no redness relief, it does sooth the skin without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li> green-</li>
            <li> I did not find it heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> but oh boy does it come out green.  </li>
            <li> However, if you are acne prone, buyer beware: the self-consciousness caused by your imminent acne breakout might be worse than your self-consciousness from the facial redness.</li>
            <li> Just a pea size of this green perfecting lotion is all you need per day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sink it for me, just smooches around making my face patchy green.</li>
            <li> (The lotion is a mint green color.)</li>
            <li> The green tint is helpful for immediate coverage, but I have a make up primer with green tint for that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I think a few people said it made their skin look green.</li>
            <li> To my knowledge, there is nothing else like this on the marketplace - green tint, plus the beneficial licorice extract combo.  </li>
            <li> thought the green tint would be helpful, but I do not like it at all.</li>
            <li> Of course... because, its green.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the green tint to this cream might help conceal the redness in my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> I have been using your product for a few years now .</li>
            <li> I rinse my face in the morning, apply the moisturizer, and then apply a green tinted moisturizer over my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Wipe it in well otherwise you have a green face</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s green.</li>
            <li> It does remove some redness, since the color of the lotion is green.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the green tone fool you.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is mint green to cancel out the redness for immediate results.</li>
            <li> Works well instead of foundation for everyday use.</li>
            <li> does not give the skin a green tint at all.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion everyday.  </li>
            <li> The green tint makes it work like makeup and immediately reduces the redness.</li>
            <li> And I got tired of constantly being asked if I had been in the sun.  </li>
            <li> Put it on heavy at night and treat it as a moisturizer and healer.</li>
            <li> and then you have green lotion</li>
            <li> When I ordered the product I did not realize the lotion was green, and it stays green.  </li>
            <li> This is what works for me:  I pump out the size of a green pea on my fingertip.</li>
            <li> and I have green splotches on my face.</li>
            <li> Been using this green lotion to counteract the RetinA Micro redness.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t blend it just the way you want in a short amount of time, it cakes, which is really frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Have used this 2 x day since I got it a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> and I see green crusty layers of green.  </li>
            <li> so my face isn&#x27;t green.</li>
            <li> I like the green tint and the sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Yes this lotion is mint green.  </li>
            <li> It is green in color that helps \\&quot;cancel out\\&quot; the redness.</li>
            <li> so a lot isn&#x27;t wasted.</li>
            <li> , the green tint made my skin look  pasty/chalky.  </li>
            <li> They make you believe it&#x27;s green tinted moisturizer, with sunblock.</li>
            <li> It does none of those things, except it green sunblock</li>
            <li> Heavy.</li>
            <li> After a few days we noticed his dryness and flakiness had improved, and the texture of his skin was smoother.</li>
            <li> This has a green tint to it.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t like looking green.</li>
            <li> I found myself layering on another coat of moisterizer, therefore defeating the purpose of the green tint.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s green hue.</li>
            <li> This green hue is supposed to mask the redness, but all it seems to do is make my face green.</li>
            <li> would not buy this again, and instead get a cheaper SPF lotion for my face that isn&#x27;t green.</li>
            <li> Avoid getting it in your eyebrows, some green residue will be left behind.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan as it seems to take a lot of rubbing to get the greenish tint into the skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pale so the green just helps to even out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely pale skin, and it didn&#x27;t look green on me once I smoothed it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to rub the moisture due to its green color.</li>
            <li> but you look as pale as a ghost, even when applying powder or foundation over it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked in the mirror and it made one side of my face look pale because of the consistency of this product.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably look pale after applying this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also mentioned that it can make your face look eerily pale</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;m really pale to begin with</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any other product that helps, so at least this is an option.</li>
            <li> &quot; If it works long-term to improve the condition of the redness, that will change my mind, but I&#x27;d probably buy the plain creme instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, not greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> It is heavy and thick and not easily absorbed so you must massage it in well</li>
            <li> Maybe some very slight relief ...</li>
            <li> used this product after I had a very painful chemical peel--a very invasive peel which required a general anesthetic and which basically burned my skin off, to be frank.  </li>
            <li> I usually used it over my Oil  of Olay and it still dried out my skin....</li>
            <li> Hard to get the green color out and was a little too drying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and it has toned down my redness by at least  50%.</li>
            <li> Even though it seems a little expensive, this bottle should last you for ages.  </li>
            <li> If I am just going somewhere casual I can put a little bit of this on my nose and cheeks where they are red</li>
            <li> The green &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; is VERY green.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you have any dry skin with the redness, it&#x27;s even worse, it draws attention to the flakey skin.  </li>
            <li> This green-blue colored lotion requires very, very little to spread on skin area.  </li>
            <li> but that sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get the green worked in.</li>
            <li> this stuff is garbage, it has a weird consistancy which is just the opposite of that, it spreads on your skin clumpily.</li>
            <li> I use it every day because it is a sunblock too and sun is deadly for rosacea, as all rosacea people know!</li>
            <li> there is no way to just dispense a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, for me it would not blend with my skin at all, unless I used an amount so small that my skin was left feeling</li>
            <li> When I go to a tanning bed, I&#x27;m the \\&quot;sometimes tans, usually burns\\&quot; type.</li>
            <li> All it takes is a small pump</li>
            <li> I went into shock when my pharmacy said it was going to cost me $250 for a small tube.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly though, or you&#x27;ll look like an alien.</li>
            <li> Use a small amount to start with&lt;</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the fact</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I have to say, it has evened my skin tone and not only that</li>
            <li> If I went overboard rubbed it all over to cover every bit of red, it got weird</li>
            <li> I usually stock up when I purchase it as I don&#x27;t like to run out.  </li>
            <li> I did not find any relief for my Rosacea from the thick green goo.</li>
            <li> -it was absolutely startling, I&#x27;ve never seen it so red.</li>
            <li> Actually has like a faint burning sensation.</li>
            <li> It helps with the redness but is really thick and too much green.</li>
            <li> not worth the money and made my face worse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little less expensive as well.</li>
            <li> Its hard to describe</li>
            <li> works for me  have been using it for years  hard to find</li>
            <li> This product says that it is non-comedogenic but that is hard for me to believe.</li>
            <li> this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it&#x27;s really hard to apply correctly.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy, greasy, pasty, &amp; even when using a very small amount you just can&#x27;t blend it into your skin.</li>
            <li> It has made my little rosacea bumps worse.</li>
            <li> well duh-</li>
            <li> that come late afternoon</li>
            <li> The trickles show the color again, at least on me.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t feel like it, at least I do not look like I have a sunburn.  </li>
            <li> You can take that as a compliment or not, but that indicated to me that the product at least worked.</li>
            <li> Having read the reviews here, I expected the perfecting lotion product to be difficult to spread.  </li>
            <li> I found this product to work for me and would suggest to at least try it.  </li>
            <li> but the lotion is way too thick.</li>
            <li> green color of this lotion didn&#x27;t bother me, but it also didn&#x27;t counter the redness of my cheeks upon application as seems to be one of the ideas behind this product.</li>
            <li> consistency is thick and took some time to work into my skin.</li>
            <li> It is thick.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that claim to help with rosacea and they often make my skin worse!  </li>
            <li> Since I have been using these Eucerin products I have had a significant reduction in the horrible burning sensation that I used to have in my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday!!</li>
            <li> but I just couldn&#x27;t get past the weird green.</li>
            <li> Wanted it to work as a day cream under make-up especially because of the green tint, but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;m usually going for one of two shades of pale (startlingly or disturbingly)</li>
            <li> Used very small amount and noticed it just sort of sat in my pores.</li>
            <li> You have to use it sparingly in very small amounts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You need to use a very small amount, or you will get the Hulk look.</li>
            <li> I read numerous reviews on this product, very skeptical ~</li>
            <li> Very thick and very green.</li>
            <li> Days when all else fails it never lets me down.</li>
            <li> I think a lot of us would do just about anything to have their rosacea be simply a flushed face, as most of us have to deal with things that are devastating to our self esteems, and at the least uncomfortable and painful.  </li>
            <li> Too bad ---I&#x27;m disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t find something that is really easy to find in stores and on Amazon.</li>
            <li> If you have red skin that is peeling forget about using this, it will collect on the edges of whats peeling and leave a silver-ish green mess that looks terrible.</li>
            <li> Last year it got so bad that my close friends and family asked if I had sunburn from a tanning bed.  </li>
            <li> Not a good product for skin of color.</li>
            <li> I looked so pale and washed out that she thought I was seriously ill.  </li>
            <li> As others have said, once you put it on your face is a pasty, sickly looking white, so now you have to put on makeup, even in the summer.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s just annoying in general).</li>
            <li> But unfortunately, this has a VERY GREEN color</li>
            <li> It goes on very thick and does not blend well or absorb well.</li>
            <li> Very thick.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I have broken capallaries in my cheeks from sun damage.</li>
            <li> I got addicted to it.</li>
            <li> Nothing seemed to help, and I was SO tired of having sunburnt-looking skin all the time.  </li>
            <li> This is a green lotion, but don&#x27;t be afraid...</li>
            <li> The secret is in the application.  </li>
            <li> It has always worked well for me, and the condition has never gotten worse.</li>
            <li> but I know it&#x27;s not making it worse.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really frustrating.</li>
            <li> Plus, the lotion gives all the other parts of my face a sickly sort of glow.</li>
            <li> My usual care for my rosacea could not hold up to cold, brutel winds this winter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so when I received the lotion I put it on and my redness became very very subtle.</li>
            <li> My face would look fantastic immediately after applying this product, but as soon as any oil accumulated on my face it looked disgusting, and the greenish tint would show (I would look sick).</li>
            <li> I found it really tough to make it disappear in my beard, leaving me with a weird residue look.</li>
            <li> but this turned my skin ugly green!  </li>
            <li> It comes out EXTREMELY GREEN &amp; thick out of the bottle &amp; leaves a nasty residue on your face.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I must have bought the wrong product.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find these days in drug stores.</li>
            <li> Sorry I ever purchased this.  </li>
            <li> My husband said it did cast a weird whiteness over my face.</li>
            <li> I had tried expensive prescriptions from my dermatologist and they didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I unfortunately suffer from rosacea.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too expensive so plus one for that.</li>
            <li> Nothing horrible happened when using it, but I found it to be drying to my skin and overly thick/pasty even when using a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> So sad.  </li>
            <li> But besides the weird color it gave my skin, it did nothing for my rosacea.</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> This may work well for others, but for me I found it to be useless.</li>
            <li> It made my face look like a very unhealthy shade of grey/green.</li>
            <li> I have awful, and I mean AWFUL 1\\&quot; red streaks that look like marionette lines going from the corners of my mouth to my jawline.</li>
            <li> and it looks like you have something wrong or some badly applied makeup.</li>
            <li> It works well for my acne-prone skin and my boyfriend&#x27;s aging skin (sorry, honey!).</li>
            <li> Gunky and unpleasant to use.</li>
            <li> Still, it helps even on bad days and my skin likes it.</li>
            <li> and that was a bad choice.</li>
            <li> Not too badly though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> like I was sick no matter</li>
            <li> but it can cut your skin :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product, but it may work well for others.  </li>
            <li> I was thoroughly disappointed with the consistency of the product.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, not the pimples, just the annoying redness.  </li>
            <li> I did NOT give myself a chance to look in the mirror (like an idiot.)  </li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed after having tried it.</li>
            <li> worst product ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works great, Thanks</li>
            <li> Not greasy, very good.</li>
            <li> Has really calmed my rosacea down.  I am using it nite &amp; day.</li>
            <li> As a redhead, I&#x27;ve suffered from slightly a slightly redder skin tone than I&#x27;d like as well as the propensity to burn anytime I&#x27;m in the sun.  Eucerin Redness relief has been a god send for me.  It evens out my skin tone while also offering me daily SPF protection from the sun.  Before finding this, I used to have to try to remember to wear sunscreen anytime I knew I was going to be outside, but disliking the way most facial sunscreens felt, greasy and oily, I wouldn&#x27;t use them as often as I should. I ended up on many occasions spending more time outside than expected and getting my face burnt.  Now I use the redness relief as part of my daily make up regiment and I&#x27;,m automatically wearing sunscreen which I don&#x27;t find to be oily or greasy.  I wouldn&#x27;t use this as your only sunscreen if you plan to be outside for a long period of time, but for those of use who can burn when only outside for a limited amount of time and don&#x27;t want to remember to use a separate sunscreen, this works great as a daily sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I expected.</li>
            <li> Love eucerin products but this one, not so much. It goes on very thick and does not blend well or absorb well. Was very streaky and felt very dry. Then when I would go to put my makup on, it sort of rolled up into little balls. Just not what I expected and I had to rub my face so hard to get it to go on, my face was more irritated than before I used it. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with the nighttime version because I have rosacea and I was hoping this would help with the redness. This doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything to reduce the redness on my skin but it definitely helps to cover it up. If I am just going somewhere casual I can put a little bit of this on my nose and cheeks where they are red and I am good to go without any other makeup. It also works well under foundation if you want more coverage. The SPF is nice, but unless your face is red everywhere, you are going to need a separate SPF product. You definitely don&#x27;t want to put this lotion anywhere where your skin is not red, otherwise it will be difficult to avoid making it look green.</li>
            <li> Daughter had problems with redness on face. Used for a couple of weeks and redness is gone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 7 years.  I love it!  It does not feel heavy or greasy and is perfect for moisturizing under my makeup.  I like the fact that is contains SPF 15.  I use the lotion daily in combination with the Eucerin Redness Relief Soothing Cleanser.  My rosacea is no longer the annoyance that it used to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently been diagnosed with rosacea at the age of 40.  I basically have discomfort and feel/look like I have a decent sunburn.  After one use (a) it relieved the sensation of being sunburned.  It relieved the warm sensation on my face.  My wife mentioned that it had made a visible difference in my complexion too.  I believe it more than masks the redness - it does in fact have a mild impact on the underlying causes of the redness.        Granted, I have relatively early stage rosacea - so I don&#x27;t have the rash or swelling on the nose.  But for early stage rosacea where symptoms are basically warm discomfort and red complexion - it works.</li>
            <li> this stuff is garbage, it has a weird consistancy which is just the opposite of that, it spreads on your skin clumpily. If you have red skin that is peeling forget about using this, it will collect on the edges of whats peeling and leave a silver-ish green mess that looks terrible. Make sure you don&#x27;t put more then a tiny dab on too, otherwise you&#x27;ll look like the hulk (unless thats the look you&#x27;re going for). worst product ever.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It really does cover any redness you have across cheeks, nose or chin area.  I use it under my foundation.</li>
            <li> I do love this product.  My skin is sensitive so it&#x27;s nice to find something that helps instead of irritates.</li>
            <li> I have used this marvelous product for many years and panic completely when I cannot find it in my local drugstore. Rite Aid used to carry it but doesn&#x27;t anymore for some reason. Luckily I found I can get it at Amazon, but you don&#x27;t often have to buy it because it lasts a long time.  You apply it lightly to the red areas, rubbing it lightly in, in my case to my cheeks and nose and then apply foundation and powder. I use it every day because it is a sunblock too and sun is deadly for rosacea, as all rosacea people know! It is very soothing.</li>
            <li> This is a super nice product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very efective as an undertone corrector/primer for redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I like to use it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) After cleaning my face very well 2) I will apply a *sheer layer of this product 3) let set 4) *lightly powder w/ a translucent face powder 5) *lightly mist my face with water and let set again. I suggest practicing this method on your hand a few times before, using on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the only caveat: If you have large pores or acne scars, this product will VISIBLY CLOG your pores - I have 2-3 medium size scars and simply pat the excess out gently w/ my finger, before doing the powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes without saying; That dry skin or skin that has not been exfoliated will NOT do well - it will cake and be a total disaster - and keep it AWAY from your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*AVOID USING LARGE AMOUNTS (less is best)</li>
            <li> I tried this product based on pretty good reviews. It seems you will ether love it or hate it. I am fair skinned with mild to moderate Rosacea &amp; gave it a try because it was fairly inexpensive. I can not stress enough how much I dislike this product &amp; I tried many ways of using it, finally gave up &amp; threw it out. It is very heavy, greasy, pasty, &amp; even when using a very small amount you just can&#x27;t blend it into your skin. It may take away some of the redness but you look as pale as a ghost, even when applying powder or foundation over it. It comes out EXTREMELY GREEN &amp; thick out of the bottle &amp; leaves a nasty residue on your face. Also, the SPF may be a bonus to some but if you have sensitive skin like me, don&#x27;t even get it any where near your eyes unless you want runny, red, bloodshot eyes (&amp; no I don&#x27;t stick it in my eye balls, just couldn&#x27;t get it anywhere near them making this product even more useless). I am SO done with ANY Eucerin products. They are all so heavy &amp; greasy &amp; this ones no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product to try is Smashbox Photo Finish Color Correcting Foundation Primer, tinted green. Yes, it&#x27;s allot more expensive but it lasts a long time &amp; works wonderful. You can always try a travel size sold on many sites at half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line..if you enjoy looking like a pale version of \\&quot;The Incredible Hulk\\&quot; then go ahead &amp; give the Eucerin a try..Sorry but I have absolutely nothing good to say about it.</li>
            <li> I was recently prescribed MetroCream by my dermatologist for some mild rosacea which gives me redness across my nose and cheeks.  At the time of my appointment she also recommended I look into Eucerin&#x27;s Redness Relief line of products for additional relief of symptoms.  Overall I like the lotion.  It absorbs into the skin well without feeling greasy.  The problem however, as others have stated in previous reviews, is the green color of the lotion.  The green counteracts the redness, thus hiding it, but if applied to non-red areas of the skin you will definitely have a green tinted face going on.  To solve this problem, I generally apply this lotion only to my problem areas (cheeks and nose), and then use a separate Cetaphil SPF-15 facial lotion for the rest of my face (forehead, jaw, chin, etc.).  The lotion seems a bit expensive, but for myself, a little goes a long way (I only use half a pump; a full pump is too much for my face and makes me look green).  Overall, good product, but just use it in small amounts on problem areas only if you don&#x27;t want to look like Kermit the Frog.</li>
            <li> I like the light texture of this daily lotion and the green tint helps \\&quot;cool\\&quot; down any redness going on. It also has sunscreen in it so an added bonus. It can also be used under makeup too.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 6 months ago along with the night creame.  After 3 months of using both daily, it did not treat the redness at all.  I discontinued using the night creame, but continue to use the lotion as it does a good job making my skin look significantly less red by masking it.  It has helped me to feel less self-concious in public and I try not to leave the house without it on.  This 1.7 oz bottle has lasted me 6 months and still has a few months of use left in it.  Overall, a good product, but not a good alternative to a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This is a nice non-irratating product. Feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was experiencing a lot of redness on my face due to hyper pigmentation. I am a light, black skinned female. This lotion, teamed up with some licorice root extract, and the night time Eucerin redness cream really transformed my skin condition in just a few days. I definitely recommend a mixture of the three if you&#x27;re experiencing redness due to blemishes or scarring from hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty severe paranoia about having red skin, to the point that any redness at all bothers me excessively. This product even at first use neutralized any uneveness my skin had. I am very eager to see how it works out in the long run. Though, admittedly I will keep using this product even if it does nothing to my skin underneath, it is amazing for under makeup or just by itself to cut redness.  Buy it! You will love it!</li>
            <li> I gave this 2 stars only because it will cover up the redness; however, it will not cure it.  I put it on my face and because it is such a heavier consistency it will cover up the red because it is green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked in the mirror and it made one side of my face look pale because of the consistency of this product.  I like the Dermarest much better, it actually helps the redness itself and gives a nice glow to your skin in the morning.</li>
            <li> Better deal here than at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and stayed on well. My only complaint is the smell. It smells exactly like sunscreen, whish is not that attractive in my opinion. Now that I think about it, extra must be applied to the reddest areas. If too mush is applied to white areas, the skin turns green. it took practice, but eventually it helped. I also liked that there was no real perfum added, so it is good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product has a built in tinted green concealer which is used to combat redness in the skin via camouflage. It&#x27;s basically a love it or leave it mechanism that will be well/ill received based on your personal taste. I happen to like it and can see an immediate difference after application. It&#x27;s a great day lotion if you are on accutane and need something that is non-comodegenic, non-irritating, and oil-free. I had the most difficult time finding a lotion that fits the bill, but this product delivers on every front. I&#x27;m quite pleased with the way it absorbs as well. Just make sure not to slather it on, blend well, and you should be good to go. Hope you enjoy this product as much as I have.</li>
            <li> I needed this for my Rosales and it seems like it is okay.</li>
            <li> Made my face extremely red everywhere I applied it. Gunky and unpleasant to use.</li>
            <li> The Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion Broad Spectrum SPF 15 is just what I needed. At first I was a little shocked by the green tinge but then remembered green can counteract the red tone of skin. The green disappears when you gently rub in the lotion. It goes on easily, not greasy or oily. I can then then apply my mineral powder foundation as the Eucerin Perfecting Lotion absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of the Eucerin Redness Relief Lotion.  While it doesn&#x27;t always completely cover up the redness, it helps to tone it down so that when I put on makeup, I can better cover the redness.  The really good things about the product are that it works immediately, the bottle lasts quite a while and my skin doesn&#x27;t reject it.  I&#x27;ve tried other products that claim to help with rosacea and they often make my skin worse!  I think that the effectiveness of the product depends on how inflamed the rosacea is from day to day.  On good days, the lotion is completely effective, on bad days it&#x27;s not as effective.  Still, it helps even on bad days and my skin likes it.</li>
            <li> It works well but needs to be mixed with regular moisturizer, any kind.  If you put it on without mixing with other moisturizer, it streaks and doesn&#x27;t blend as well.  Does the job and I really like it.</li>
            <li> A light, delicate lotion with a subtle, light scent that is barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Good are reducing redness and easy to apply, with no greasy residue left on skin.&lt;br /&gt;Guys be warned, my son used this lotion and had to wash his goatee, as the lotion got into his beard and left a blue coating.&lt;br /&gt;We had a joke about blue beard but apart from that it did work for him too.&lt;br /&gt;For anyone with a flare up due to soap or a chronic redness I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The reduction in redness is pretty minimal. Sometimes I think I noticed it, others I&#x27;m not so sure. It does feel relieving, though.</li>
            <li> I found this lotion to be more sticky than my previous moisturizer and the green color does nothing to counteract the &amp;#34;redness&amp;#34; problem.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for products that would reduce the redness on my nose and cheeks for years. I bought this product in addition to the overnight redness reducing Eucerin product. The lotion is a light green that applies smoothly. I&#x27;ve read other reviews that their face turned green from using the product but I have yet to have any issues. Unfortunately, this product doesn&#x27;t completely mask the redness of my skin. However, I gave it four stars because it&#x27;s better than any other product I have used. I&#x27;ve noticed that my makeup looks better and stays on longer in comparison to my regular moisturizer. I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone that may feel insecure about their skin.</li>
            <li> Being a natural redhead I found this product to work perfectly with my natural pink tint. The texture of the product is smooth and watery, bendable with the perfect amount of moisture for my AM routine. This is a must have in your beauty kit!</li>
            <li> I have subtype I  rosacea and, the women who have it will probably agree that the redness of your skin will bleed through your make-up. I tried the Eucerin, and it might be okay for those with just a ruddy complexion, but it still did not cover enough of my redness to keep it hidden.  I use a prescription cream morning and night, which I don&#x27;t think does much good until I don&#x27;t use it, then I really notice the redness.  If you have rosacea and need to wear make-up, you will need an additional concealer.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, like most Eucerin. Isn&#x27;t very redness relieving though. Haven&#x27;t seen a difference</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion that can be bought over the counter to reduce the appearance of redness, and I have tried many. I have used avar green cream in the past but stopped due to its $$. I have a fair complexion and a very noticeable amount of redness so when I received the lotion I put it on and my redness became very very subtle. When applying the lotion note that it is GREEN and must be rubbed well into the skin. There is no need for a huge amount because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this in lieu of having to wear concealer. I don&#x27;t think I have rosacea, just mild redness and it works for me. However, it does make me look a little more pale than normal so add a little bronzer.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a significant reduction in redness but it goes on smoothly and feels good to the touch.</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. This irritated my face, put abrasions on my cheeks, and gave me an infection.  I do not know what is mixed with this product but it can cut your skin :(</li>
            <li> I like the idea but the lotion is way too thick. It feels more like sunblock than lotion. Not something I would want to wear during the day where people could notice.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, not the pimples, just the annoying redness.  My face looks like I have a permanent sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Every foundation I have tried does not give me enough coverage. Since I have been using Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion, I have noticed a real change in my skin.  If I use it daily, my skin the next day appears more even-toned. It is still red but not nearly as much as before I started using the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take a little lotion, not much,  and rub it in all over my face, let it set for a few minutes, then puff on a little corn starch (face powder makes me itch). The results are flawless.  My skin looks almost the way it did when I was a teen only without the acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a lot of redness, try this product.</li>
            <li> I naturally have pale, porcelain skin, so this works great for me at restoring my skin closer to its natural color. I get eczema on my fave and am normally really self-conscious about the rash and general ruddy, uneven skin tone. I put this on under a powder foundation, and it&#x27;s perfect. Obviously I have to put some blush on, but that&#x27;s not any more than usual. This is a skin correcting product, so if you don&#x27;t have problems with your skin being too red then it won&#x27;t be for you. For me, however, it&#x27;s exactly what I needed to get my confidence back.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have been ordering it for a while. It helps tremendously with redness and does not cause acne like other creams I&#x27;ve tried. :)</li>
            <li> This product does not work as it states. It just made my skin look green like I was sick no matter how lightly I applied it. I won&#x27;t ever buy again!</li>
            <li> It covers the redness so well that people I see often notice a difference!</li>
            <li> I use this every morning to keep the redness away</li>
            <li> This has transformed my skin!  For YEARS I have fought breakouts and recently they seemed to get worse. I started putting a very small amount (so it completely disappears...under my makeup too) on my face after washing and moisturizing morning and evening.  I can&#x27;t remember my face being this clear ...since childhood...and believe me...I tried EVERYTHING!  I have some old battle scars to heal up...but I&#x27;m amazed at how fast and well this worked for me! :-)))</li>
            <li> irratated my skin when I used with foundation  used alone it was fine though redness was still somewhat visible</li>
            <li> I have that trademark fair skin that redheads have, and it gets more and more sensitive as the years pass, so the idea of \\&quot;redness relief\\&quot; in this product intrigued me. I gave it a full month trial. The bottom line is, if it provided any redness relief at all, it was barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green color of this lotion didn&#x27;t bother me, but it also didn&#x27;t counter the redness of my cheeks upon application as seems to be one of the ideas behind this product. I do appreciate that it has sunscreen in it -- great for daily use -- but is it really fair to say that the sunscreen essentially accounts for its \\&quot;redness-relieving\\&quot; quality (since the marketing here is carefully worded)? Just the fact that it can prevent sunburn? Hmmmm ... The implication, of course, is for help with conditions such as rosacea, as other reviewers have noted, but that was not my experience with it, at least not after a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion comes in a quality bottle of glass, which I appreciate, and I like that it&#x27;s fragrance-free. It was kind to my skin, leaving it soft. So overall, not a bad experience. Just not quite as good as implied. :)</li>
            <li> It is Green as the bad reviews say lol...no kidding the label says that!    I mix it with my normal face cream so it is not so noticeable, but it really does help and I think does a good job of hiding a bit of redness all day. It also feels good.    Just be prepared to play with it a bit and after it absorbs into the skin it looks much better.  And if to pale just use on red areas!</li>
            <li> Such a great product &amp; inexpensive to help conceal facial redness. I love it</li>
            <li> Wanted to camouflage some redness but this turned my skin ugly green!  I could have tried out for &amp;#34;wicked&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a naturally dark skinned male and was a bit apprehensive about trying this product since most people seem to have fair skin that have the redness problem and have given good reviews for this product. It does a good job of masking redness but can leave a white residue and can be difficult to rub in. Overall I think its a good product however, I think its better used for people with fairer skin. I wish I could find one more suitable for my skin type that blends better.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product, but it may work well for others.  I have extremely fair skin and red undertones that I would like to minimize.  I was actually hoping that this product would reduce the redness rather than just cover it up.  I found this product to be similar to many tinted primers that are on the market today.  The lotion has a green undertone that can be quite effective at minimizing redness if used under a foundation.  Herein lies the problem for me -- I don&#x27;t typically wear foundation, especially in the summer time.  When I applied this product to my face as a daily SPF moisturizer, it left a greenish tint on my skin.  I don&#x27;t think that most people with regular or darker complexions would have this problem, but it left me looking a little sea sick all the time.  Under a broad coverage foundation, it looks fine.  The lotion is nice and silky, it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out, and it is really a good value for an all-in-one moisturizer, primer, and SPF lotion.  I&#x27;ll save it and use it later in the year.  For me, the search continues.</li>
            <li> I bought this in a whim after I ran out of my regular lotion.  I don&#x27;t have overall redness in my face, but I do have acne scars.  I put this on one night and the next morning I saw noticeable reduction in the redness of my acne scars.  I&#x27;m extremely pale so the green just helps to even out my skin tone.  On top of helping with the scaring it has kept new blemishes from popping up.  I love it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> The product was recommended by my Dermatologist and it&#x27;s a good one for anyone who has redness of the face they would like to tone down.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the night cream and moisturiser, those are both good and I will keep using them. They dont help the redness but they make the skin feel nice.    This day cream is very thick and seems to instantly dry the skin very quickly. It also seems to add a strange texture or lumpyness to the surface of the skin. Its hard to describe but it makes the skin look very rough and it looks like you have something wrong or some badly applied makeup. It does help the redness a little because it is very green, but instead of red you get this strange texture which looks worse.    I would say stay clear of this, it doesnt work and is a waste of money. It also took over a month to be delivered and I had to repeatedly chase the supplier and they simply ignored me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 5 years.  I got free samples from my dermatologist and I have been using it ever since.  This product is meant to go over your initial moisturizer (I use the Redness Relief Night Cream, even in the daytime, as suggested by the dermatologist).  Dab it on / pat it on, do not rub it on!  Use sparingly, you do not glob it on!  It does not cure the redness but reduces it.  My skin tone appears more even and less red when I use it, and that is the purpose of the product. I like the SPF 15; my sensitive  skin generally cannot tolerate any SPF higher than that.  Edit: upon reading other reviews I want to emphasize that this is NOT a moisturizing lotion; you should apply it *after* your moisturizing lotion.  You just need a very small amount and dab it on, then gently blend in. After all, rubbing your face is only going to make it redder!  One bottle lasts about 6 months for me; I apply it twice a day.  I apply my moisturizer each time before I apply the redness-reducer.</li>
            <li> I found this product making my face tone appear lighter, this is great , I don&#x27;t need to apply BB cream anymore and still look like I was fully rested last night.</li>
            <li> I use this each morning under makeup.  It does a really good job of covering the redness, even on days I don&#x27;t wear foundation.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen. Light and rubs in fast</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize that it was tinted green, which I know counteracts redness. It would be ok, except it doesn&#x27;t go on quite as smooth as normal face lotion and since my skin is kinda dry, i tend to have to mix some of my face lotion in with it which then decreases the amount of redness it can cover.</li>
            <li> I have definitely seen a difference in the redness of my face (for the better!)</li>
            <li> First, know that a little of this stuff goes a LONG way.  After using it for a few weeks, there was no difference in my skin tone, texture, or anything. I took before and after pictures. No difference.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, in perfect condition. This lotion is non-irritating, light, non-oily, etc. It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it because a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> works for me  have been using it for years  hard to find</li>
            <li> I have always loved Eucerin products but this just simply does not work at all for me. First, the lotion is very light, which means I have to put a LOT on in order to use it for dry skin, and second, the tint is a pale green which just made my face look scary and weird. When I put less on, I am a little less green, but because my skin is dry from it not being a good moisturizer, there are light green flakes that appear. Not a fan, wish I hadn&#x27;t used it or could get a refund even though I already did use it. This was, unfortunately, a waste of money. But I guess it works for some people! I&#x27;m going back to my Aveno calming lotion: it has no green tint, and does wonders for decreasing redness and dryness. Good luck!</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and this is not very moisturizing at all. As everyone else said, rub it in well so the green won&#x27;t be so apparent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 6 yrs.  I have very fair skin and very sensitive skin.  This is the only product that works on my face without breaking it out or cause any skin irritations..Yes it can make your face a little lighter, but who cares,i&#x27;d rather look a little lighter compared to a discomfort of a skin irritation on my face...I have no redness,does NOT break me out and i wear it daily under my makeup...Also love that its fragrance free..The main ingredient is pretty interesting(licorice), read about it, might explain the lighter skin...Also, when i go to bed,i apply NO products to my face..I let my face \\&quot;air out\\&quot; for the night..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok and does provide some protection from the sun.  While no redness relief, it does sooth the skin without being too heavy.  Just keep it away from your eyes it bothers mine.</li>
            <li> I usedthis under daily make-up and that was a bad choice. Then I used it alone and it works well.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised.  Non greasy and takes out the red when used as directed.  I use it after exposure to sun or wind.</li>
            <li> Been using this for several years for my rosacea.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had rosacea all my life. I guess I&#x27;m lucky, I don&#x27;t get the bumps and lumps and scaliness, I just look like I have a permanent sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to wear very heavy, greasy makeup to cover my red skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about this stuff, and I tried it for the first time today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it did a decent job of neutralizing the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is green- green and red are complementary colors- which means they cancel each other out. So putting the green over the red skin helps even out the skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to use it *sparingly*!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews of people saying it turned their face green- well duh- it will if you slather it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rub it in well, one area at a time and don&#x27;t try to do your whole face at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very creamy and easy to blend. I did not find it heavy or greasy. It is in fact a heck of a lot more comfortable to wear than the pancake makeup I usually have to use which feels like I&#x27;m smearing lard on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff and a little powder did an excellent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I don&#x27;t get any adverse reactions I will definitely buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li> No matter what high-end moisturizer I try, they always seem to work the same way for me no matter what the price, so I went into this one with my sceptical hat on. Thumbs up on the packaging, even the box had a white background so I could actually read the writing on it, and two thumbs up for the pump dispenser and a product that&#x27;s thick enough it doesn&#x27;t run all over my fingers before I can get it to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The greenish tint in the moisturizer is a bit off-putting at first, but you do need to use it sparingly or you&#x27;ll get a greenish cast to your face. Take the time to rub it in thoroughly. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, and do notice a difference with less redness all around. The product has an SPF OF 15 according to the manufacturer, but I haven&#x27;t been out in the sun enough to see how well it protects. This is a lighter moisturizer, so if you&#x27;re looking for something heavy to gloop on your face at night, this likely won&#x27;t fit, but I do see there is a nighttime moisturizer available in this product line. I plan on picking it up and giving it a whirl.</li>
            <li> The summer time can be brutal on the skin, and fair skinned people like my wife and son get burned very easily in this Texas heat.  Eucerin&#x27;s Redness Relief is great at allowing them to return outdoors after getting burned.  While it is suggested to use sunscreen before the sunburn occurs, it is a fact that sunburn happens.  The Redness Relief, while not eliminating all the discomfort of the sunburn, helped sooth the red areas enough to where my son was eager to go outside.  I can&#x27;t emphasize enough how much I love all of Eucerin&#x27;s products.  This is no exception.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell the lotion is ok.  IT is soothing, not too greasy, and goes on fine.  My only complaint is the methol smell.  Is it there to convince us that this is a serious concoction, or does it smell because an important healing ingredient happens to smell.  Bring this out in an unscented version and I am all over it.</li>
            <li> didnt like the product actually irritated my skin. The cleanser i also used it and broke me out. the only thing i use is their night cream which helps with redness and eliminates it for me. I put some lavender essential oil in the night cream to help with the acne other then that I wouldnt use anything else from this line.</li>
            <li> This product is more of a weak sunscreen than a redness cover for rosa era which is what it was touted to be.</li>
            <li> This does work for moisturizing and it does have spf in it, but oh boy does it come out green.  you must use a little at a time, or you will be rubbing in a lot of green.  problem is, once it is all rubbed in, you still have those red blotches you started with...  some of your skin looks like it has been touched up with something slightly green or something, but the main redness is there.  I must have bought the wrong product. Need something more for red blotches.  either way, this product comes out very green and u must rub in very well.  I do see anything special about it at all.</li>
            <li> Yeah - my title is accurate.  I walked into work the other day after applying this for the first time and my boss looked at me in horror.  I looked so pale and washed out that she thought I was seriously ill.  &amp;#34;Oh my god, are you ok?  You need to go home!  You look like you&#x27;re ready to pass out!&amp;#34;  I did NOT give myself a chance to look in the mirror (like an idiot.)  So - if you feel like going home early - just put this stuff on in large amounts and you will look like the Walking Dead.  This stuff does what it says it will but for best results you have to take the advice of what others are saying.  Don&#x27;t slather it on.</li>
            <li> This cream helps the redness a little.  I like it because it moisturizes my face without giving me pimples.  I notice when I don&#x27;t use it that my face feels really dry.  So, I use it every am. It helps the redness more if I use a couple squirts instead of just one and rub it in good that way your face won&#x27;t look green. This costs $16.00 at Walgreens!</li>
            <li> This produce is the bomb for rosacia and redness, covers and improves skin appearance, very soothing and healing.  Difficult to find these days in drug stores.</li>
            <li> After several weeks of daily use I am very pleased with this product and hope that I continue to have good luck with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this first as it caught my curiosity. I wondered if it would minimize the redness from my rosacea. It not only minimized, it helps conceal. What a great product. The first one to make any noticeable difference!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and when the weather is changing so does my skin. Right now I am fighting dry itch flaky elbows. I have used many products over the years-most don&#x27;t work very well. I have used it several times and the first thing I look for is the grease level. This is not greasy and I dont leave stains on my couches after using. Very milky clean fresh feeling after using. It has helped my elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would use again in the future!</li>
            <li> I have a problem with rough, dry skin on my elbows. I swear that I could fill a soup bowl with skin lotion, stick my elbows in it, and the bowl would be sucked dry in a matter of minutes! :-) However, on a serious note I offer that this product has helped me with my predicament, and its effects last for most of the day. I apply it once in the morning and once before bedtime, and this seems to solve my problem quite well.</li>
            <li> I was having problems for months with skin redness. I used both the Eucerin redness relief night creme and this lotion. If you are prone to acne breakouts, stick with just the night creme. The night creme was working slowly, but being self conscious, I decided to turn to the daily perfecting lotion which was a big mistake! This product says that it is non-comedogenic but that is hard for me to believe. I have used many different types of facial lotion but this one caused me one of the worst acne breakouts that I&#x27;ve had since high school. Now, instead of fighting just the facial redness, I am fighting the redness and many blemishes that appeared as a result of using this product. I gave it two stars because if your skin wasn&#x27;t acne prone, I would certainly use it. It did an excellent job concealing redness. However, if you are acne prone, buyer beware: the self-consciousness caused by your imminent acne breakout might be worse than your self-consciousness from the facial redness. Stick with a tinted non-comedogenic lotion during the day and use the Eucerin redness relief night creme at night.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s some things to love about this lotion and there&#x27;s some things to sigh over, here are my pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Fragrance free&lt;br /&gt;- Gentle, good for sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;- Does mask redness&lt;br /&gt;- Effectively moisturizes and provides good sun protection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t really \\&quot;reduce\\&quot; redness, just masks it&lt;br /&gt;- Smells like sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;- Green tinted lotion requires extra rubbing to blend into skin&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves skin looking moderately shiny&lt;br /&gt;- May cause break outs in some skin types&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: Don&#x27;t jump for joy when you see \\&quot;Redness Relief\\&quot; stamped on this bottle, it&#x27;s more of a marketing ploy than an actual product designed to reduce redness. It may prevent a sunburn, which could prevent a red face, but otherwise, it&#x27;s goal is to mask the skin with a green-tinted moisturizer that goes on clear. It&#x27;s not a BAD moisturizer with SPF, in fact, it may be the best one in my cabinet, but it also doesn&#x27;t bring anything exciting or new to the table. I give it a moderate recommendation.</li>
            <li> I got this thinking it would be a \\&quot;reediness relief\\&quot; formula. It seems more like a redness coverup formula. The color of the product is sort of an olive green, which does cover some redness, but in areas where you aren&#x27;t red makes you appear corpse-like, and at SPF 15, isn&#x27;t going to really keep you from getting any redder. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
            <li> I waited eagerly for a chance to use this product. Being fair skinned, I hoped that this might alleviate some problems when they aroused. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of sunscreen especially at this time of the year so I had an opportunity to put this to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion kind of works. It definitely covers up the problem a bit when you first apply it. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference the next day though or the day after while I maintained use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to say how effective this is. Part of me thinks it employs a \\&quot;sweep under the rug approach.\\&quot; At any rate, it&#x27;s not very expensive and is worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a product like this to solve your redness problems.</li>
            <li> I am ECSTATIC about this product. I don&#x27;t even need to wear foundation with this. It evens my skin tone and...as a bonus...leaves it feeling soft. Hooray!</li>
            <li> very light, it is green, to combat the red but really tones it down..(rosacea) no miracles here...but a great product</li>
            <li> My face tends to have redness in the cheek area. I tried eucerine because it&#x27;s reasonably priced. I love this moisturizer, it makes my skin soft without being greasy and the green tint really evens out your skin. It made a great base for my makeup and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I experience dry, red face skin. This product really helps to lessen the redness and keeps the dryness in check. We have purchased this product a couple times before and have really notice the difference it makes compared to other competing products. It will be something we will keep purchasing.</li>
            <li> In my early 40s, I developed a very mild case of rosacea that&#x27;s aggravated by ingredients in most anti-aging serums, lotions and creams. Eucerin products are often recommended by doctors for sensitive skin, so I ordered the Redness Relief Daily Perfecting lotion in the hopes that it would tone down the \\&quot;sunburned\\&quot; look of my cheeks and nose... and it has! After showering or washing my face in the morning, I&#x27;ve used a small amount of the lotion over my whole face with a little extra added to my problem areas. Within a week I could see a noticeable improvement, and after three weeks my face is smooth and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for anyone at any age with sensitive skin. Even men who get razor burn from shaving will have less redness with this lotion, as one of my sons discovered when I had him try it. Just a few drops daily do the trick, so one bottle will last a few months.</li>
            <li> Just a pea size of this green perfecting lotion is all you need per day. It goes on smooth and makes my skin feel silky. So far, it seems to be reducing the redness I have with rosacea. I gave it 4 stars because the smell is medicinal-which I don&#x27;t care for, but the results are worth the smell.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this product.  I&#x27;ve used it consistently for four weeks on a couple of reddish skin patches, not sunburn.  One smallish, moderately red patch seems to have actually lightened or become less red in the time I&#x27;ve used it.  A larger patch seems no different, but it is a darker red.  The product claims it \\&quot;improves the condition of visibly red skin in 4 weeks,\\&quot; I thought that meant it would decrease the redness but perhaps I am misinterpreting the claim.  It&#x27;s a fine line there.  It also states \\&quot;Protects from redness provoking UV rays.\\&quot;  So are the long term effects meant only for redness caused by UV rays?  That isn&#x27;t clear to me from the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the greenish tint that offsets the appearance of redness, it works to an extent.  My husband has a very ruddy complexion, and when I used him as a guinea pig and put the lotion on only half of his face (he is a very tolerant guy), the treated half did look slightly less red than the untreated side.  But he also had a bit of dry skin, and the lotion there gave him a light greenish, Frankenstein&#x27;s monster tone, not particularly desirable at times other than Halloween.  I also noticed this on my skin where it is dry:  unless I used so little as to be ineffective for masking red, the lotion did show and didn&#x27;t look very good.  So, as a masking lotion, I would have hoped for better results.  As a lotion that actually reduces the redness, not just the appearance of redness, it seemed to work on a small, moderately light red area, but not on a darker, larger one.</li>
            <li> My rosacea has worsened as I age. Now in my late 40&#x27;s my face is dry too. I take a little of my other facial lotion and mix a little of this with it in my palm, then apply to my rosy cheeks and nose. I finally look like I used to! Because I only have a problem on my cheeks and nose, this product will last a long time, especially when I mix it this way. It is too thick to spread easily on my dry skin, and makes me look like a ghost if I use it straight. Mixing it works just right for me. I have used all of the redness relief products and this one has really helped me feel better about showing my face. It works well under makeup and has not made me break out. Since I have been using these Eucerin products I have had a significant reduction in the horrible burning sensation that I used to have in my nose and cheeks. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I have broken capallaries in my cheeks from sun damage. Most people say they don&#x27;t notice it, but it&#x27;s something that bothers me. I hadn&#x27;t realized how strongly tinted green this was. You&#x27;re pretty much smearing mint green all over your face. It doesn&#x27;t sink it for me, just smooches around making my face patchy green. I used only a small dab and it really wasn&#x27;t for me. As just a regular lotion without the tint I&#x27;d probably like it, but I just couldn&#x27;t get past the weird green. I just live with my slightly red cheeks, and consider it built in blush for now. I think using a tinted moisturizer is easier to use then this stuff. I continue to look for a good moisturizer with spf(preferably 30 and over).</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me and I SO SO wanted it to.  First off, it is a very dry moisturizer....as in, it actually goes on chalky and dries out my skin, no actual moisturizing benefits that I could discern.  I usually used it over my Oil  of Olay and it still dried out my skin....which then made my foundation dry.  It did nothing to alleviate or camouflage the redness.  And it comes out of the pump bottle quickly....there is no way to just dispense a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side.....you get a big bottle.  Of something you really can&#x27;t use.  So you got that going for you.</li>
            <li> Very good, very moist, but not Concealer</li>
            <li> I was optimistic that this moisturizer would work well to help mask some of the redness and rosacea on my face. Unfortunately, for me it would not blend with my skin at all, unless I used an amount so small that my skin was left feeling like I never put any moisturizer on at all. It also seemed to sweat off easily, and would gather in the wrinkle lines on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because if I didn&#x27;t mind the green tint, I would have been happy with the feel of this product. I assume it would work better for women who are using this as a base under other makeup, rather than as a men&#x27;s moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use this every day. I got addicted to it. I feel like my face does not look as good as with this on. It does a good job covering red face, but if your face is very red, it will make it pink. You have to learn how to apply it. You only need a little bit. I&#x27;ve noticed that i get less flare ups when since I have started using this. Been using for 2 months now.</li>
            <li> To start, let me describe the sort of skin I have: I&#x27;m fair-skinned with medium-to-dark blonde hair. When I go to a tanning bed, I&#x27;m the \\&quot;sometimes tans, usually burns\\&quot; type. I have struggled with acne and oily skin since I was a teenager, but now that I&#x27;m older, I tend to have clear skin except for breakouts at certain times of the month, which coincide with my menstrual cycle. I don&#x27;t have rosacea, but I do turn red often: when I&#x27;m stressed, when I&#x27;m embarrassed, when I&#x27;ve been in the sun, when I&#x27;m hot, etc. The redness tends to make a butterfly pattern: it runs from just over my eyebrows down over my nose, and across the tops of my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the product. First, let me say that the product does do what it claims it does. I applied it every day for a week just after a shower in the morning, and the lotion does reduce redness noticeably. However, I used it all over my face, not all of which is red, and the regions that are NOT red came out with a sickly green tinge to them. (The lotion is a mint green color.) I was actually asked by a coworker one day whether I was unwell. In addition, it left my skin feeling far oilier than I like, and I had a minor blackhead breakout on the 5th and 6th days I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not a product I would purchase for myself. It might work very well for people whose skin is dryer than mine or has more redness, but I don&#x27;t want to have to use one lotion for the red parts of my skin and another for the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and the price is right.  I have a mild case of rosecea and this products works for me. It goes on a light green but blends in with your skin.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this at all. It feels heavy, greasy, doesn&#x27;t soak on for a long time (takes hours and I don&#x27;t slather it on) and even then I can still feel it on my face. I like the feeling of \\&quot;nothing\\&quot; on my face, and I get that with other moisturizers, such as Olay Total Effects. The green color of the lotion does help to immediately tone down the redness, though. And it has licorice root for a cumulative effect on the redness. Made in Germany.</li>
            <li> It feels a little odd to put a green lotion on your face. Yet if you have facial redness this lotion does in fact work, and reduces the appearance of redness. It is unclear if long term use helps \\&quot;treat\\&quot; the redness that exists, but at least temporarily it works. This lotion comes from the folks at Eucerin who have long history of producing quality products. This is a lightweight lotion that applies easily, has a mild scent, and would be useful for women or men. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product along with the night moisturizing cream and facial cleanser. After washing my face in the morning, I apply the Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion (this stuff). It feels like putting sunscreen on your face, which doesn&#x27;t much surprise me, since it does contain SPF 15. The green tint is helpful for immediate coverage, but I have a make up primer with green tint for that. I&#x27;ve been using this product since Christmas (it&#x27;s February now), and it&#x27;s not making my overall redness any better. So I&#x27;ll probably just stick to regular sunscreen and my primer after the bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried the dermalogica anti-redness cream before this one, and it decreased redness but left my face looking very shiny and oily. this does and even better job at decreasing the redness and leaves a more matte-like appearance; more natural looking.</li>
            <li> After trying the Eucerin Redness Relief face wash, I was very eager to try this product.  I had the highest hopes, but, as with most skin care products that are supposed to help rosacea, I was deeply disappointed.  If you have rosacea that is anything past looking like a mild sunburn, this product will only make it worse.  I think a lot of us would do just about anything to have their rosacea be simply a flushed face, as most of us have to deal with things that are devastating to our self esteems, and at the least uncomfortable and painful.  This cream uses our frustration and willingness to try anything against us to sell their product.  Take my advice and do not use this product.  I had much, much better luck with Triderma MD rosacea repair cream.</li>
            <li> This product works as it states.  It will cover your redness but use sparingly.  You can always apply more if needed.  It&#x27;s great for spot touch ups and men will be able to use this product as well.  No fragrance!  It&#x27;s goes on easily, stays put and washes off with plain soap and water.</li>
            <li> This product just goes on too white/green.  It never fully blends in with your skin, and I&#x27;m a VERY light-skinned Mexican comparible to East Asians. Coverage will be just okay if I put it on a small area of my face, but since this has an SPF of 15, it&#x27;s meant for your whole face.     Maybe its the way I&#x27;ve been blending this into my skin, but I can never really make this blend in enough without having my face look a bit \\&quot;off.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion SPF 15, 1.7 Ounce Bottle, this product gave me very good results, good thing I found it .</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be red and sensitive from product overuse and too many glycol peelings.... this product plus the night cream combined with two IPL laser treatments made my skin golden and healthy again. I would recommend this product. Only use aliiitle bit - otherwise the green will be too strong and you might look like a frog</li>
            <li> This product is really a great product.  It really helps with my sensitive face. Im looking to maybe purchase more Eucerin products.  Thankis</li>
            <li> it is nice ,and I like it, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it .</li>
            <li> Mom says she likes this lotion but that sometimes it&#x27;s hard to get the green worked in. I can vouch that it&#x27;s VERY green but that it truly makes her face look less red.</li>
            <li> This product helps if I&#x27;m applying makeup, however, the redness continues to be on my face and doesn&#x27;t seem to go away.  But, I suppose it does give some relief.  I haven&#x27;t found anything better.  My Dr. likes Eucerin products.</li>
            <li> tried product and noticed the odor right away. Headache time for me. Used very small amount and noticed it just sort of sat in my pores. Maybe not noticeable to anyone but me but who knows.  I may try again . Everything deserves a second chance .</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and therefore had to try this product. I was pretty disappointed because it left my skin looking ghostly which required me to put on make-up afterwards. There are plenty of tinted mineral spf creams and even mineral make-up with sunscreen that I prefer to use because I only have to put on one product that covers the red with a more natural color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a week, so I can&#x27;t comment on the long-term results, but I have some comments about how it works to cover redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I think a few people said it made their skin look green. I have extremely pale skin, and it didn&#x27;t look green on me once I smoothed it out. It&#x27;s not like foundation where you can keep applying layers until everything looks perfect. It won&#x27;t look perfect and remove every sign of redness and other imperfections, but it does help quite a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, once the redness was mostly gone, I looked a little bit shiny and very, very white - almost sickly. I do have a very fair complexion, so maybe I&#x27;m just not used to seeing myself without the redness!  :)  But even makeup for fair skin never made me look quite like this does. I bought this so I wouldn&#x27;t have to wear makeup, and that is sadly not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again because makeup does a better job of making me look \\&quot;normal.\\&quot; If it works long-term to improve the condition of the redness, that will change my mind, but I&#x27;d probably buy the plain creme instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m considering using a good, very light self tanner to see if that helps make the redness less noticeable (by making my normal skin tone not quite so pale - less contrast). Has anyone ever tried that?</li>
            <li> Very soothing on the roscea parts of my face which can get extremely itchy. I do feel though, that come late afternoon, my face starts to become itchy and sensitive. Not too badly though.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using the range about 5/6 months and, as I wear make-up most days, it&#x27;s hard to know what to do to alleviate the itch. I can&#x27;t cleanse as I&#x27;m at work, and not a chance will I go without make-up. I may have to look at the drying agents in my make-up. So, although I love it, I wish it protected my face for longer.&lt;br /&gt;I was advised to use a factor 50 sunblock and so have to use another product on top of the moisturiser. Wish this was added to the Eucerin range.&lt;br /&gt;My facial redness has been reduced significantly. I highly recommend the redness relief range for roscea.</li>
            <li> Light green lotion,looks a little whiter than before but still be natural.Very good.</li>
            <li> To my knowledge, there is nothing else like this on the marketplace - green tint, plus the beneficial licorice extract combo.  My deep flushing  still continues - after four years of use, I believe that it helps to a certain degree.  I like the fact that it contains an SPF rating.  I will always buy this product, unless something else new appears.</li>
            <li> I have cheeks that always look flushed so I was looking around for something that would reduce the redness. I found this and after reading the reviews decided to try it. It does a pretty good job of covering up the red by using a green color base, but don&#x27;t expect a perfect red-free complexion. The lotion goes on smooth, but I&#x27;ve noticed that it isn&#x27;t compatible with other lotions - it tends to clump and not cover well if the two come into contact. I use it under my powder makeup and it does soften the redness - it also works okay with foundation. All it takes is a small pump and I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 months and have a lot left so while the price is a little much, I would consider buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product for the number of good reviews it has but I was very disappointed after having tried it. This lotion is very dry and didn&#x27;t cover up nor do any good to the slightly red area around my nose.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok just the color is a little strange.  too white for me</li>
            <li> My mother loves this - she has sensitive skin and only purchases this brand.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well! I got this for my wife who&#x27;s cheeks can get a little rosy and she wanted to help the redness. This definitely seems to work for her, just be careful of you get it on your clothes, will require a wash to come out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair-skinned male, age 66 (I can&#x27;t believe it), troubled by steadily worsening rosacea for about 10 years. My dermatologist recently prescribed Mirvaso, a new prescription cream which relieves redness (sort of) by shrinking blood vessels temporarily. I went into shock when my pharmacy said it was going to cost me $250 for a small tube. That&#x27;s when I tried this Eucerin Daily Perfecting Lotion. This stuff works! It&#x27;s basically a coverup and moisturizer, goes on easily and quickly and blends well for a natural looking, normal-colored skin. No need to spend the $250 for Mirvaso or any other prescription now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, I have been using the companion product, Eucerin Soothing Cleanser, for about 7 weeks and would highly recommend it for redness relief. I use it in my morning showered and at bedtime, and find my skin has improved quite dramatically. In my case I have very sensitive facial skin, especially on my forehead, and finally realized I must be allergic to ingredients in many lotions, creams and sunscreens - even had a severe reaction to Metrogel when I tried it for a couple days. It was almost like my skin was in a perpetual state of being burned or irritated by products and then healing over a couple weeks. You can imagine how happy I was to find the Eucerin Soothing Cleanser - at last I could feel like my skin being cleaned without burning or irritation! Within 5 days my skin was noticeably smoother, much less red, more even-toned and not totally dry as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know everyone&#x27; skin situation is different, so these products may or may not work for you, but they have been great for me. Good luck to all rosacea sufferers!</li>
            <li> I panicked when this wasn&#x27;t on the local W shelves!  This lotion helps with my English/Irish skin.  This is not a treatment!  It helps tame the red; use it under your foundation.  Just be careful in applying it...you can look ghostly by putting it on the bits that aren&#x27;t red.</li>
            <li> Eucerin Redness Relief provides immediate redness relief. It provides light, all-day moisture and UV protection while reducing visible redness and blotchiness, for an even-toned complexion.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and my dermatologist recommended this as an alternative to using 3 separate products.  It&#x27;s a moisturizer, redness reducer and SPF all in one lotion.  It soaks into your skin in a reasonable amt of time and sometimes I&#x27;ll just use this when I don&#x27;t feel like putting on all of my makeup and I feel OK about going out in public.  It slightly reduces redness - it&#x27;s not going to take it all away, but it helps.</li>
            <li> Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion come is a 1.7 oz. glass bottle with a pump that dispenses just the right amount.  It absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and provides SPF 15.  The mineral colorants give it a green tone that helps to neutralize the appearance of red facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive and this was not irritating and it has only a faint sunscreen odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it does a good job moisturizing and would be suitable for daily use.</li>
            <li> On several sites regarding skin care for Rosacea prone skin, I read that this product is useful for calming the skin.  I used it for the first time last night.  First of all, it doesn&#x27;t absorb, leaving a coat of green residue.  This morning I woke up with red blotchiness all over my face.  Sorry I ever purchased this.  It&#x27;s on its way to the trash.  I will continue using Aveeno Ultra Calming Lotion.</li>
            <li> Helpful only to a minor degree although better than nothing.</li>
            <li> The green tint helps a little bit to counteract the redness in my face when used under my BB Cream.  I love Eucerin products in general, so would recommend this brand  to anyone with red, sensitive skin.  I cannot find this moisturizer in the stores, so thank god for amazon.com</li>
            <li> This does have some good qualities, but the green tint is not for me. If you wear foundation or concealer every day, you might have better luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the green tint would be helpful, but I do not like it at all. I have redness only on my cheeks. The green does counteract the redness somewhat, making it look more tan colored. So then I have tan blotches on my fair skin tone. Plus, the lotion gives all the other parts of my face a sickly sort of glow. Of course... because, its green. So if I use this only on my cheeks, I need to use a second lotion on all other parts of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several weeks of daily use, I do see a reduction in the amount of redness in my cheeks, which is very helpful. I think this is from the Licochalcone, (licorice extract) which is supposed to reduce redness. It is certainly not gone, but it&#x27;s better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this lotion would probably be useful for someone with redness on their whole face, and someone who is not very fair skinned, or someone who wears concealer and foundation on a daily basis. For me, I&#x27;m going to look for something with licorice extract that is not tinted. Perhaps the Eucerine night cream.</li>
            <li> Finally something that truly helps my reddish face that doesn&#x27;t look like a green face mask. It absorbs quickly and beautifully. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have a mild case of roscacea, coupled with periodic eczema and overall sensitive skin. I was hoping the green tint to this cream might help conceal the redness in my cheeks and chin. Unfortunately, the green didn&#x27;t help neutralize the red at all (just made my face green-ish, and I didn&#x27;t use much) and the chemicals used in the sunscreen caused my face to itch and slightly burn. I had to wash this moisturizer off. It also takes a bit of effort to rub in the sunscreen due to the titanium dioxide. I normally don&#x27;t have an issue with this (and prefer physical sunscreens) but because this product is also tinted green, you REALLY have to rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how this product might have good intentions for those who suffer from redness, but the chemical sunscreens used in the product made my situation worse. I do appreciate the non-plastic bottle and easy to use pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s freakin&#x27; genius. It&#x27;s a godsend for those of us with unsolvable sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The licorice extract, or whatever it is that reduces redness, is amazing. The slight green tint to the moisturizer adds to the amazingness. Use sparingly though, or you&#x27;ll look like an alien. lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix this with Oil of Olay Sensitive Skin SPF 30. 3 parts Oil of Olay, 2 parts Eucerin. Mix in your palm and apply after washing your face. Be sure to rub it in, and you&#x27;ve got a miracle moisturizing regime.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this lotion - it covered up a lot of the redness I have from perioral dermatitis and scarring/hyperpigmentation. I also love the Eucerin Q10 cream—it has never made me breakout with my sensitive skin. So I figured this redness relief would be a good option since I don&#x27;t wear makeup to cover up any blemishes or hyperpigmentation. Unfortunately, it appears to have caused a mild breakout across my face (not horribly since I only used it twice) but enough for my skin to show irritation. My husband said it did cast a weird whiteness over my face. I currently have a bit of a tan, so this completely flushed out the tan and cast an eerie paleness over my face that was enough to make him comment. I still enjoy other Eucerin products, this guy just wasn&#x27;t right for my skin type. If you have sensitive or breakout prone skin, be a little wary.</li>
            <li> I have been using your product for a few years now . The only problem is I have a hard time finding it in the local drug stores. The CVS I was buying it from stopped carring it. I decided to go on line and look.I have a prescription lotion from my doctor that I apply morning and night it is a combination of Hydrocortisone 1% and metrogel 1% in a DML loton. I then apply the Eucerin redness relief lotion in the morning before I apply my makeup and it really helps to neutralize the redness and helps my makeup cover better. Thanks Eucerin</li>
            <li> This product is okay. I have rosacea and get pink in the cheeks. It is so aggravating!  The lotion moisturizes well, goes on smooth, and does not irritate my skin. It does not do a great job reducing redness. I rinse my face in the morning, apply the moisturizer, and then apply a green tinted moisturizer over my cheeks. This helps but does not completely cover up my redness. I need either foundation and/ or a redness reducing powder to adequately cover my redness (at this point, I start to look pale, and need blush on my cheek bones, the struggles of having Irish skin!). I really like that this product has sunscreen and it really does do a good job moisturizing. Hope this is helpful!</li>
            <li> This product works for me. Each day I use Eucerin Redness Relief twice-a-day, and it keeps the redness to a low level. My daughter also has facial skin redness but cannot tolerate this Eucerin product, so it is not for everyone. Give it a try if many other things have failed.</li>
            <li> I have a bit of rosacea and sensitive skin and this moisturizer is excellent. Very light and no smell. I like that it evens my skin tone, specially on days when my skin is more red. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This takes out the redness mildly&lt;br /&gt;And blocks uv rays... Does it&#x27;s job.. Wipe it in well otherwise you have a green face</li>
            <li> Good product as always</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m putting on make-up and it&#x27;s green. The green definitely blends the red away. I use it daily as a face sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The green tint really does minimize redness, but you have to be careful not to put it on non-red areas or your skin will look green. It also feels a bit dry--not nearly as wonderful as their night creme-- and sometimes the dry scaly bits of rosacea look like weird green scabs, because the moisturizer isn&#x27;t moist enough.</li>
            <li> I just went to the dermatologist and was diagnosed with rosacae...which runs in the family.  Since I knew a prescription may not be necessary and sometimes can even cause things to flare up I decided to try this. My rosacae is mild according to the doctor. I didn&#x27;t really how red my skin had gotten until I applied this and saw how even and radiant my skin on my face looked!  I also bought the cleanser.</li>
            <li> The green pigment is great for covering red skin. The SPF makes it feel a little sticky though. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> So this lotion has a distinct smell of sunscreen. Though it&#x27;s tinted green, I don&#x27;t notice any actual reduction of redness on my face. Also, it isn&#x27;t very moisturizing. I still have to use shea butter before applying this. If I apply only this lotion, my face will be peeling off still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I hope this product is available forever. It&#x27;s that helpful in calming redness. I use it every morning before I put on my makeup, and the redness disappears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been officially diagnosed, but I&#x27;m 99.9% sure I have rosacea. Nothing seemed to help, and I was SO tired of having sunburnt-looking skin all the time.  It was so embarrassing!  Finally I came across this product, and figured I&#x27;d try it.  Here&#x27;s what I did:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I made my own lotion using some really thick, rich lotion base (it&#x27;s used for making bath/beauty products and is as thick as shortening), and added an equal amount of water to it .... about 1/4 cup of each.  I heated it slightly in the microwave so it would blend, and dissolved about a tablespoon of Epsom salts into it.  After letting it cool, I gently washed my face with a wet, cool washcloth.  Then I very generously slathered on the lotion (too much to be absorbed), and waited about 10 minutes.  Once that was dry (you could see a thin layer of Epsom salts on the surface of my skin), I gently washed off the lotion, and re-applied a very small amount that could be easily absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That brings me to this product.  I then applied small amounts of the redness cream to the red areas.  Instead of rubbing it in, I patted it, which helped cover the redness very well.  It doesn&#x27;t take much at ALL.  Even though it seems a little expensive, this bottle should last you for ages.  It moisturizes, too, and my face doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s about to &amp;#34;crack&amp;#34; from dry, irritated skin anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I&#x27;ve got the redness cream on, I then apply my makeup as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started this routine in May 2013, and two months later, nearly all the redness is GONE!  Previously, if I exercised or drank just a tiny bit of an alcoholic beverage, my face would turn beet red within minutes.  Almost nothing triggers it now, and even if it does, the redness is nowhere near as extreme as it was, and it disappears very quickly.  I don&#x27;t know if it was the Eucerin or the combination of Eucerin and Epsom salts, but one or both of them helped tremendously.  (I&#x27;d used the cream base before, and although it was fine for a moisturizer, it alone didn&#x27;t do anything to stop the redness.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this product again.  Eucerin: please, please, please don&#x27;t stop making it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I&#x27;m not a doctor and am not qualified to give medical advice.  I&#x27;m just telling what seems to have worked for me.  :-)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks and am quite pleased with the results. Initially I became interested after I read a personal recommendation on a Squidoo Lens ([...] I purchased the lotion and it does everything I hoped for. My cheeks and forehead skin are less red and much softer. This lotion didn&#x27;t create blemishes and it tones down my too-pink complexion with or without makeup.</li>
            <li> Put on my arms and it hid the red!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a daily moisturizer that could cover up my rosacea on days that I did not want to wear foundation. Eucerin Redness Relief does a fantastic job of dulling/neutralizing my redness on my cheeks. Because of the green texture, I had to blend the lotion into my skin very well. I found it useful to blend this lotion with my other daily moisturizer that has a higher SPF. One day, I went biking for an hour, and I came home expecting to see very flushed cheeks. What I saw was lightly blushed cheeks, which means that Eucerin did its job to lessen the usual redness. I wouldn&#x27;t say it covers the redness perfectly, but I am very happy to have found a decent, oil-free lotion to mask my rosacea and give me a more natural look on no-foundation days.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product! This product felt calming at first use - and along with the cleanser and night cream it solved my embarrassing redness. I am almost back to normal.  I had tried expensive prescriptions from my dermatologist and they didn&#x27;t work.  These products are amazing.  Thank you Eucerin!!</li>
            <li> It does remove some redness, since the color of the lotion is green. The spf is really mild though.</li>
            <li> Probably fine for a climate other than hot humid South Florida, but does not let my skin breath and I end up sweating this right off. This has a green tint to it, but not all that effective in covering redness. Did not aggravate my rosacea.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before.  I will continue to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a long time...a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things:&lt;br /&gt;1. Use a small amount to start with&lt;br /&gt;2. It will create a pasty whiteness until you get it rubbed in good&lt;br /&gt;3. It does help mask redness (which I have)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from redness or have a lot red tones in your skin, then this product is worth trying! The SPF is just an added bonus ;)</li>
            <li> This green-blue colored lotion requires very, very little to spread on skin area.  It&#x27;s amazingly efficient, as it spreads thinly and one doesn&#x27;t need to use much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s strength is it&#x27;s weakness though, like many things.  It spreads so much because the skin can&#x27;t absorb any of it.  And when I sweat, which is what I do a lot, it trickles down and reminds me it&#x27;s there.  The trickles show the color again, at least on me.</li>
            <li> so i didnt know by &#x27;redness relief&#x27; they really meant green tinted lotion. the shade is def not &#x27;subtle green&#x27; it looks like sth shreck threw up. that said, it actually neutralizes the redness on my face and it IS soothing. most of my redness is gone thanks to my argan facial oil, so i dont think i&#x27;ll use this product again though.</li>
            <li> I was unaware when I purchased this product that it is tinted green for covering up the redness.  Works well but had to experiment with it quite a few times to get the right amount so it wouldn&#x27;t make me look super pale or bead up when I put my make-up on.  I only use this when I wear make up and use a different product when I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> This is the only spf moisturized I use, since they changed the formulation for the Aveno Calming collection. Goes on clean and light, no heavy perfume. good for rosacea!</li>
            <li> This product will make you look pale if you do more than lightly spot treat. Personally, I&#x27;m usually going for one of two shades of pale (startlingly or disturbingly) so this product is perfect for me. It has the added benefit of evening out the tone of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it&#x27;s a moisturizer and sunscreen as well. I apply a highly concentrated benzoyl peroxide cream to dry out my numerous zits, but then I need something to keep the dryness from damaging the skin without undoing all the benzoyl peroxide&#x27;s hard work. The light-feeling moisturization this product provides is perfect for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to it being a sunscreen, it&#x27;s sort of like I hit a point of no return a few years back when I stopped tanning at all and just burned no matter what, and this means I don&#x27;t have to add a sunscreen to what would (without this) be an ever growing list of products to apply daily, and an ever growing collection of countertop clutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is absolutely one of my favorite skincare/cosmetic products.</li>
            <li> Leaves residue on your skin</li>
            <li> I am caucasian, with medium skin tone (not really fair but no dark tan either). This lotion seems to take the edge off the redness, but the non-red areas then look whiter. My husband thoguht I looked a little \\&quot;weird\\&quot; so I&#x27;m probably not going to continue using it.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised! Have used this for many years.</li>
            <li> Hides the redness of damaged skin.  Light feeling and does the trick.  Would order again and continue to use.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I unfortunately suffer from rosacea.  When I have a flare up, I use this cream and it helps so much. Feels soothing and also has an SPF which is really great.  I like this cream.  Thank you, I hope you found my review helpful.</li>
            <li> It can mask redness but can&#x27;t treat it,</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  Don&#x27;t let the green tone fool you.  It didn&#x27;t work very well the first time I used it, but after that it was great!</li>
            <li> This lotion really works! It keeps my skin moisturized and it prevents the redness! I definitely recommend this lotion if you have a problem with redness!</li>
            <li> Great product, helped my skin heal from working outside. Also has good spf</li>
            <li> Rosacea is one of those conditions that I&#x27;ve found get&#x27;s more annoying over time and as we age. I have the type with both redness in certain areas and also bumps. This moisturizer looked very promising, as both a cover and a treatment. After over 1 month use, I have found, however, it&#x27;s more effective as a surface color correction under makeup because of the green tint, but not so much as a real treatment over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is thick and took some time to work into my skin. It has a pleasant smell, not perfum-y (important for sensitive skin that can react to perfumes with more redness). If you already have a green tinted makeup to counteract redness, then I don&#x27;t see this product doing anything different, except for the moisturizing component.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week, so I&#x27;m not sure how well it works overall. I purchased it because I read in a fitness magazine that using it longterm helps reduce redness. Haven&#x27;t determed yet if this will be the case, but it seems ok thus far.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and Eucerin helps a great deal, I have never used the redness relief before and LOVE IT.. I have light skin and red shows up easily  this soothes my irritated skin and without out an obnoxious smell and NO greasy feel.. I would recommend it highly.. wonderful product, but anything in their line seems to work well for me.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this lotion for awhile and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. I have very sensitive, oily skin with slight redness on my cheeks and chin. This lightweight lotion absorbs quickly into my skin, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy, contains SPF 15 and hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts. This moisturizer is mint green to cancel out the redness for immediate results. Use it sparingly because a little goes a long way but it&#x27;s very easy to blend into your skin. I&#x27;m pleased with the results and I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This product provides excellent coverage for those suffering from Rosacea.  Since the lotion also contains SPF 15 it provides a double whammy - coverage of redness and sun damage protection.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin,&lt;br /&gt;and Eucerin Redness Relief Daily is only product that really works well with my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I mix it half and half with a non-tinted moisturizer to decrease the strength of the green coloring.  Works well instead of foundation for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week, but I can say that this only seems to &#x27;hide&#x27; my rosacea. I was expecting something more permanent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for just over a month now, waiting to see some, Any results.  There have been none.  I tried to return it and they will not let me.  A total waste of time and my money!  Never again will I trust this brand.</li>
            <li> Very Pasty , not natural, doesn&#x27;t do a thing for redness</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Daily Lotion as well as the Soothing Night Creme for over a month and I&#x27;m very happy with my results.  I have very fair, sensitive dry skin that is VERY cool-toned, which brings a lot of pink into my skin especially on my cheeks.  I needed a product that would not only instantly calm my redness, but work overtime to help with the sensitivity and excessive dryness.  So far, I can see a difference in the texture and tone of my skin while at the same time look like my wearing nothing at all!  This is a green lotion, but don&#x27;t be afraid...it blends quickly into your skin and cancels out redness without making you look like Shrek or the Wicked Witch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product from ULTA originally, but see that Amazon has a much better price!  I have a full review &amp; video on my blog if you&#x27;d like to hear more about my thoughts on this product:  http://www.richelleloveslife.com/2015/05/dealing-with-redness-my-skincare.html  I hope these products help you they way they helped me!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I both have very fair skin, and very light skin can be prone to redness. This moisturizer on its own is a bit too green for us and leaves a pallor that makes us look a little ill. But, mixed with equal parts tinted moisturizer (like Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moist with SPF 30), the Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion does a great job of neutralizing some of the redness. I wouldn&#x27;t wear this alone, but it&#x27;s perfect when paired with a tinted moisturizer. I wish there was a higher SPF in this product, but I feel better by mixing it with the Aveeno SPF 30. It works well for my acne-prone skin and my boyfriend&#x27;s aging skin (sorry, honey!). I should mention that I don&#x27;t mix the moisturizers together in the bottle, but just mix a squirt of each in my hand in the morning.</li>
            <li> this green tinted moisturizer is great. the green color really brings down the redness in my skin alone or under makeup. it is a good hydrating and non-greasy moisturizer with sunscreen. the pump is great too. i use one pump to cover up just certain areas of redness on the face or two to reduce redness everywhere. does not give the skin a green tint at all. if anything it may make the skin look a little paler on its own but it does reduces redness well and moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion didn&#x27;t hide any of my reactive redness and stung quite a bit when I applied it (which may be because of the SPF they put in it). I found that in order to hide my redness, I needed to apply an excessive amount, which didn&#x27;t work under any primer or liquid foundation---it just came right off. And if you&#x27;re skin is impeccable and you don&#x27;t need any concealing beyond your redness, you may look like the Hulk with over application.</li>
            <li> Glad to find this online.  Perfect for the rosacea on my neck and chest.  A little goes a long way with this!</li>
            <li> I am older (60s), fair, freckled so like this product.  It has no scent:)  It is bluish/green which sound crazy but does a great job as a foundation for covering little broken blood vessels and redness.  I have not been diagnosed with rosacea.  I like this, esp. when &amp;#34;going out.&amp;#34;  It contains SPF 25.</li>
            <li> This is a creme that dispenses blue/green, colors known to help hide dark blemishes be them circles, acne, etc.  I learned they also help to hide redness.  However, in my experience it doesn&#x27;t really make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day to minimize the damage to my skin from rosacea.  The greenish tint helps make my red skin look normal.  The sellers were great too.  Fast service.</li>
            <li> My favorite day cream I have ever used! This cream goes on light green (which you have to rub in or let absorb), which I LOVE because it balances the redness of my face and if i&#x27;m wearing makeup acts as a concealer.  Some reviews state it is too green, in my opinion that&#x27;s only if you use too much product- and if this happens- i just wait a second for it to absorb. My skin can also get greasy during the days and i&#x27;ve found that this cream helps matte some of the oiliness without drying out my skin either. Great product. I can see myself using this for a long time, hopefully they don&#x27;t change anything!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and am so delighted to get it on Amazon, especially for the price!  It lasts for about three months and does what advertised.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion everyday.  It&#x27;s great and really does help reduce redness on the face.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. My wife uses it for rosacia and I use it for the rdness caused by my CPAP.</li>
            <li> This lotion is perfect to normalize your red patches on face. It moisturizes the skin, makes redness invisible for long hours (tip - cover your rosacea with green minerals over the lotion), plus improves the overall condition of your skin - less pores, even tone. Great!</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion. Does a good job at taking any of my redness away, and smells like sun tan oil-one of my favorite smells. The only thing is I wish it was just a little more moisturizing. I find I have to put on my normal face lotion first, and then put on this after. Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> This worked well to cover up the redness on my face.  The green tint helped a lot; however, I have pretty dry skin and the lotion did not help with that. It made the dry skin green and more noticeable.  I would recommend it for people with redness but not dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all.  I was using it in combination with the facial cleanser.  It did nothing for dry spots and did not mask any redness.  I applied very little, a small amount, &amp; then tried more &amp; no type of application worked.  Luckily, Walgreens takes refunds on cosmetic products, so I was able to return it.</li>
            <li> Only product I&#x27;ve found that will remove the redness from my face.&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff. Would highly recommend to anyone who needs a bit&lt;br /&gt;of help getting rid of the redness.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000P1S0N8 Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion, SPF 15 - 1.7 Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;I used this product after I had a very painful chemical peel--a very invasive peel which required a general anesthetic and which basically burned my skin off, to be frank.  The doctor who did the procedure provided free product which was some name brand and which was \\&quot;created\\&quot; for people who had had skin/chemical peels. I COULDN&#x27;T WEAR IT! It set my face on fire!!! There was only ONE product which did not give me pain after my peel, and that is this product: Eucerin. I used regular Eucerin, but during the day, I began using the Eucrin for redness.  It really helped, and the green worked out okay if I used it sparingly. I was tempted to \\&quot;pour\\&quot; it on! But the best way is to do it one area at a time, starting with somewhat moistened (&amp; clean) skin; not bone dry skin. That worked best for me, anyway. I love you, Eucerin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything to reduce redness for me</li>
            <li> Tried it after reading these reviews and figured I had nothing to lose since nothing else helped my red forehead and cheeks. The green tint makes it work like makeup and immediately reduces the redness. Use it sparingly as other said and it works well. Gave it a four right now cause don&#x27;t know if it really helps the problem. Expensive but worth it if you really have a redness issue.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic!  For the last ten years all I have seen in the mirror or in pictures of myself is RED RED and more RED.  I couldn&#x27;t get past the fact I looked like I had a permanent sunburn.  And I got tired of constantly being asked if I had been in the sun.  I mean, I haven&#x27;t gone outside without 50 SPF block and full body coverage plus wide brimmed hat for at least a decade.  I couldn&#x27;t understand why my face was still so darn red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my skin has always been so sensitive that most lotions and other treatments cause worse skin problems than the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FInally I got turned on to this product.  After a month of using this faithfully plus the night time redness relief and the redness relief cleanser, the redness is vastly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green color is a little frightening at first, but it counteracts the red and smoothes out my complexion so that I do not have to use any other masking problems if I want to apply make up that day.  If I don&#x27;t feel like it, at least I do not look like I have a sunburn.  I think if you do not have as red a skin, the green could be too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few more important notes:  if you have rosacea and your eyes are itchy or dry or if it is hard to see out of them sometimes wearing your glasses or not, you may have \\&quot;Ocular Rosacea\\&quot; even if your eyelids are not red.  I didn&#x27;t know this existed but after reading about it, I have been treating my eyes every night (simply wash your eyelids with diluted baby shampoo or with one of the products sold for the condition) and I am no longer having the problems I had been having.  This can be a serious condition AND the treatment is simple so please check it out!  Your eyes will appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, rosacea can cause the bulbous red nose that older people can get (Think classic fisherman&#x27;s red nose), even if the rest of their skin is not red.  My husband who NEVER uses sunscreen (Dumb, but I can only make hubby do so much) and never burns (at least visibly) noticed his nose is getting bumpy and bulbous.  I have convinced him to start treating his nose for rosacea and it is starting to return to normal shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will be in my beauty routine for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Absolutely works, I call this product my miracle in a bottle. I suffer from rosacea and this product is the best.</li>
            <li> I am one of those lucky people who suffers from rosacea. I&#x27;ve dealt with swollen, red cheeks for many years now. I tried seeking help from dermatologists and paid a lot in co-pays and prescription creams with no avail. When I came across this product I thought &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;. The very first time I put the light green lotion on my cheeks, I had an instantaneous result. The redness went away immediately. I am so thrilled with this product. I have been using it for 5 days now and my cheeks are much lighter and smoother. I personally feel that the cream is a little heavy, so I use it as a night cream. Best product I have found so far.</li>
            <li> I am seasonal and live in FL and MN.  While in FL I always have a tan.  Once I get to MN I lose that beautiful tan and am left with a pale, red-toned facial skin color.  I am Italian so I&#x27;m not pasty white,but I would notice that my face always had a reddish tone compared to my neck.  It was obvious to me when I would look at my chin to my neck.  For years I have been trying different regular facial lotions, not putting my face in the shower water thinking it was the friction of the well water and some years just going along with my reddish skin tone.  Last year it got so bad that my close friends and family asked if I had sunburn from a tanning bed.  I then realized it wasn&#x27;t my imagination.  I am strict on health and generally only use Organic products on my skin, but after dealing with this redness a week after returning from Florida, I know I needed to do something.  My friends told me about various products on the market that reduce redness by having a green tone.  After Googling around and finding Eurcerin for a minimal cost, I thought I couldn&#x27;t lose.  I was skeptical, but I have to say, it has evened my skin tone and not only that, my face feels nourished and really hydrated.  I do add a little of my Organic facial moisturizer on top of the Eucerin.  I am much more confident and overall am so pleased with this product.  Some of the other products I have checked out are four times the cost.  For the money, this is ideal.</li>
            <li> One of my &amp;#34;can&#x27;t do without&amp;#34; products.  I have reddish skin, and can flush bright red after eating hot food or drink or alcohol.  The green tint is not visible on my skin once I smooth the lotion in, and it visibly diminishes the redness.  Regular use of this line of products does seem to make my skin less reactive, in addition to the cosmetic effect of the green tint.</li>
            <li> I found this little guy at Walgreens, where he was a whopping $15. I have a few other Eucerin products and know they are pricey, but worth the money, so I took my chance on it.    I don&#x27;t have rosacea, but my skin was really red from staying out in the sun for too long. I used this product in the morning, as instructed. Later on during the day, a friend said to me, \\&quot;You look pale!\\&quot; (versus me looking &#x27;red&#x27;). You can take that as a compliment or not, but that indicated to me that the product at least worked. However, I will definitely use sparingly next time. I agree with other reviewers; this stuff can leave a residue on your face, making you look more odd than you would with red skin. Again, USE SPARINGLY. People with tan skin, be careful! I don&#x27;t wear make-up, so if you do, you may not experience this &#x27;problem&#x27; (foundation, concealer, etc).        Avoid getting it in your eyebrows, some green residue will be left behind. If you have super dry skin, moisturize before using. The product can create a splotchy effect if you don&#x27;t moisturize prior.    Overall, does it&#x27;s advertised to do. SPF is a plus!</li>
            <li> First of all, this product makes you look very pale and does not permanently reduce the redness. It does sort of mask the redness, but not all of it and not that well. It does last a long time and it&#x27;s not too expensive so plus one for that. You only need to use a very little amount, I have tried using a lot to cover up my rosacea better but it seems to work about the same when I only use a little, possibly even better. This is the first product I have tried for rosacea and have been using it for over a year because I am too scared to try something else in case it makes it worse. Overall, I am pretty dissatisfied that it doesn&#x27;t lessen the redness, but I give Eucerin an A for trying and hope they continue trying to improve their products.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I am a repeat customer and will continue using this product I love the results.</li>
            <li> Bought this and the redness relief night cream. I have mild rosacea type 2 with redness, some bumps, a few visible capillaries and severe dryness/flakiness, Did not like this one. Nothing horrible happened when using it, but I found it to be drying to my skin and overly thick/pasty even when using a tiny amount. Wanted it to work as a day cream under make-up especially because of the green tint, but was disappointed. I am using the night cream as an AM &amp; PM treatment and I really recommend it instead and just using a green tinted primer on top for make up purposes. You can see my review of the overnite cream.</li>
            <li> Very helpful. Covers Redness completely.&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to write an article about this. So let me go please.....</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He has very dry, very red skin on his face - the first time he put this on, it worked beautifully. Red was gone. Irritation was gone. He had gorgeous skin. This stuff WORKS.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce redness with the green tint and serves as a good base for makeup. It can make your skin oily, but after a number of weeks, my skin was able to adjust or use oil absorbing paper/sheets.</li>
            <li> For those with Rosacea this product is wonderful ! Days when all else fails it never lets me down. Put it on heavy at night and treat it as a moisturizer and healer. Use it lightly as a calming concealer in the day. Remember, it is colored green, which neutralizes red. Never sets your face on fire. Try it !</li>
            <li> I love it , it works great !</li>
            <li> Bought to address constant facial redness for my son, and I also tried it as well to soften my ruddy complexion.  It is moderately effective but it has some negatives that you have to consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It is heavy and thick and not easily absorbed so you must massage it in well or you will have an obvious green tint.&lt;br /&gt;2,  Since it is green if you are not careful you can get it into hairlines and eyebrows where it is difficult to remove and then you have green lotion obvious.&lt;br /&gt;One  positive is that it does provide sunscreen and that seems effective with limited use.</li>
            <li> Started clearing up my redness in two weeks!  Only takes a small amount and I pat it on.</li>
            <li> I ended up with more redness than I had before it. Normally I use Obagi Rosaclear line, but thought I could save a few dollars with this product. I guess it&#x27;s a case of you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Did not help my rosacea at all. In fact, it stung and burned when applied. And even caused a worsening of the redness. This is not for everybody.</li>
            <li> When I ordered the product I did not realize the lotion was green, and it stays green.  Will have to find something else for my red skin, since this makes me look like a Martian.</li>
            <li> I have had very good results with this (not so good with the night cream). Many don;t like its rather dry texture and green colouring, but this has been the first moisturiser I&#x27;ve ever been able to tolerate.&lt;br /&gt;For a while when combining this with Calmin cleanser and Superfit Foundation my skin was perfect. Since Superfit was discontinued it hasn&#x27;t been quite so good, but at least I know which product is causing the problem. I will remain faithful to this as my moisturiser. It does enough to stop me getting any flakiness but doesn&#x27;t break me out. I think you need quite a dry oil free moisturiser for Rosacea.</li>
            <li> I had been using another self-correcting redness lotion for years but I saw this product for half the cost which was attractive.  I read the reviews, good and bad, then decided to try it.  After a month of using it, there is a difference in this lotion from other face products - you have to be smart about how you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is thick.  Much thicker than other redness lotions I have used.  A thicker lotion means its coverage will be heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. You have to use it sparingly in very small amounts.  The heavy texture and the necessary green tint will give you a pale complexion if you slather it on like you would most face lotions.  I found this out the first day I used it.  I&#x27;m used to putting a nice little glob on my fingertips then smoothing it all over my face.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t work that way.  The redness was gone but my entire face had a ghostly green tint to it...and even hours later, it didn&#x27;t fade much.  Lesson: Try new face products on days you don&#x27;t plan on leaving the house.  lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The secret is in the application.  After my ghostbuster first day, I experimented with smaller amounts and how I apply it to my face.  This is what works for me:  I pump out the size of a green pea on my fingertip. I touch the lotion just enough to get some on my applying finger then massage that into my forehead.  I do the same for one cheek, then the other.  Then, I lightly apply it to the areas around my nose and mouth.  I also gently use it in the delicate corners of my eyes near the nose which makes it act like a concealer.  Whatever is left of the green pea, I use on my temples and then neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: Guys, DON&#x27;T use it on areas with facial hair, even short stubble.  Apparently, the thickness of the lotion will not allow it to blend into hair follicles.  I found it really tough to make it disappear in my beard, leaving me with a weird residue look. Now, I just work it in on skin up to the hair line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could pay doublethe price for a more convenient lotion but I after a week, this is just as easy to do.  My skin is soft and stays moisturized throughout the day, even up to bedtime without a greasy feeling.  And, my complexion is getting compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say the redness is not completely disguised with this product, however, the irritated red look is calmed down to a healthier pink glow.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for years and love it. If you have rosacea or just cheeks that are a little too rosy, you can use this alone or blend with your regular moisturizer to get a nice even base for makeup. Do not waste your money on higher priced tone correctors, you will not need them!</li>
            <li> Unlike the Physician&#x27;s Formula powder, you really have to have a particular &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; for the green to cancel out. You&#x27;ll probably look pale after applying this product.</li>
            <li> Its green sunblock, not thick but takes forever to work into the skin.  Not a good product for skin of color.</li>
            <li> The best product , I have found to relieve redness, also has SPF 15.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time. It keeps the comments from other people about my red face away! The only time it isn&#x27;t helpful is on hot humid days when it sweats off easily and I have green splotches on my face. For indoors or warm/cool days outside, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It really worked. I&#x27;d recommend you use a tiny, tiny amount - about half the size of a pea or less after using your normal moisturizing. As a man, I don&#x27;t want it to look like I&#x27;m wearing makeup, so was best used to &amp;#34;take the edge off&amp;#34;. My redness is kind of blotchy, so I just dabbed it on the reddest spots. If I went overboard rubbed it all over to cover every bit of red, it got weird (you have to remember that &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; people still have red tone to their skin). It doesn&#x27;t fix everything, but definitely helped a lot. I recommend it to all my friends with redness.</li>
            <li> My favorite under-makeup sunscreen.  Use it sparingly, or you can appear a bit like Caspar.</li>
            <li> I have minor rosacea localized to my nose, and this product does a great job of covering up the redness and evening out the skin tone. Make sure to use this sparingly, and I also recommend to exfoliate the area before applying the lotion for best results. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Been using this green lotion to counteract the RetinA Micro redness.  The pump bottle is well made but do be careful as the pump is more projectile than not.  I pump it right on the back of my hand.  Right after the shower is when I apply this.  Water cuts the tint a little.  Do blend well or you&#x27;ll have one Frankenstein eyebrow like me and no one will tell you.  The SPF is only 15 when it should be 25 at least.  The only people trying to counteract redness are pale, Eucerin.  All in all, great for day under makeup.</li>
            <li> A little drying - mix it with moisturizer</li>
            <li> pretty good, but not hydrated enough</li>
            <li> did cover the red well but made my eyes burn so I&#x27;m allergic to it and my face itchy</li>
            <li> This product is pricey but worth every cent. it calms my skin, keeps it soft this helps the scales and the redness making my skin condition more comfortable and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> This product does everything it was promoted to do.  Worth the price. Should be recommended by Doctors instead of Rx meds.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to have found this Eucerin product available through the  Amazon site.  My husband&#x27;s dermatologist recommended it for his rosacea , and he has been using it for about 5 yrs now.  It is very effective, and especially helps when he occasionally gets a flare-up.  Calms, soothes, and takes care of the situation.  However, we had not been able to locate it anywhere, since not one pharmacy or retail stores carries it any longer within our area and surroundings.  He is relieved that he can now continue getting the product that has proven so beneficial and effective for him.  Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion not only has the SPF 15 factored into its formula (sunscreen is crucial for rosacea patients), but my husband is pleased that it is non greasy feeling.  If you or a loved one has rosacea, I STRONGLY and HIGHLY recommend this Eucerin product!  The price is excellent, although the supplier charges tax (which we would have had to pay if purchased elsewhere).</li>
            <li> I get red from stress and this did not really help with that. I guess I just have to stick with makeup. The lotion did feel really good and I thought the smell was good. The glass bottle is odd but I have dropped it several times and it did not break...yet!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to finally find something to reduce redness.  First of all, the product is green and feels like caked-on makeup.  When it dries, it&#x27;s itchy.  Also, if you have any dry skin with the redness, it&#x27;s even worse, it draws attention to the flakey skin.  Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> It may work for some people, but I sure didn&#x27;t like it.  If you don&#x27;t blend it just the way you want in a short amount of time, it cakes, which is really frustrating.  It&#x27;s really just masking the redness.  When I put my makeup on over it, it looked fine to start, but throughout the day it would start to cake and look strange.  After a couple weeks, the redness never got better and I gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never want to look more pale than I have to just to mask the redness.  Don&#x27;t cheap out and try a bunch of brands like this.. like I did.  In the long run you&#x27;ll be spending just as much money, if not more, than if you would have just bought a nicer line of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this I went straight to Ulta and tried Mario Badescu&#x27;s anti-redness package.  I&#x27;d recommend that a thousand times before anything else.  If I could, I would marry the anti-redness calma mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Have used this 2 x day since I got it a few weeks ago.  My face is no less red than before.  I had a sample from my dermatologists office so thought I&#x27;d try it out full size.  If you put too much on your face is green and it DOESN&#x27;T soak in.  I go to put my makeup on and I see green crusty layers of green.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very thick and very green. It&#x27;s difficult to get normal coverage.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for exactly one week now and i got very fair skin and work in a hot factory, just judging by this past week i have noticed not been as red and even haven&#x27;t felt as much of the sensitivity that i normal would feel while i&#x27;m working, i would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months, and I discovered that my face looked good if I didn&#x27;t use sunscreen. So I just moisturized when absolutely needed.  Then testing for a different allergy revealed that I am allergic to parabens.  So now I&#x27;m back to finding a cleanser/moisturizer regiment. So sad.  I really bought into the \\&quot;redness relief\\&quot; promise and just figured I couldn&#x27;t solve it.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan as it seems to take a lot of rubbing to get the greenish tint into the skin so my face isn&#x27;t green. It really does mask any redness, but I found that all redness is gone by simply using the redness relief night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent stuff, but not my favorite product and will only keep for emergencies if needed for cover up if I have a flare up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this actually does very much. I have very dry skin and this just doesn&#x27;t have enough oomph, even for a daytime lotion. The green tint is too strong for my admittedly very pale skin tone and is actually visible unless I apply this very sparingly. It also irritates my skin, causing a burning sensation for a short time after applying.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this is the only lotion I use.  Takes the redness away.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have slightly red skin and it had spf. It feels good on my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. The only bad part about this is that if you wear it outside and sweat your whole face will turn white.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years to reduce redness and it works fairly well.  I buy it on-line as I can&#x27;t always find it locally.  I usually stock up when I purchase it as I don&#x27;t like to run out.  I haven&#x27;t found another product that works as well for me as this one.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, but the reason I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars is that it&#x27;s not soothing and the green &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; is a little much.  My face is definitely more clear since I&#x27;ve been using it, but here&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s pretty thick.  I&#x27;m used to moisturizers going on with a soothing sensation.  LIke your skin is drinking.  You don&#x27;t get that with this stuff&lt;br /&gt;2) The green &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; is VERY green.  When I put it on, I look pasty and close to death.  The pastiness does go away after a while (maybe an hour or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I will continue to buy this because it does work, but just know what you&#x27;re getting when you purchase it.  Also, this one jar has lasted me about 2 months and I use it every morning.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It really helps with the roseca and clams the redness down.. Super fast company that shipped it here too.</li>
            <li> I could be in a commercial for Eucerin products.  I have been using them for over a decade.  This is a great face product.  It has significantly reduced redness in my face.  It is not greasy.  As with all Eucerin products, it soaks into the skin instead of merely sitting on top.</li>
            <li> Does help neutralize/mask redness due to rosacea, before putting on foundation.</li>
            <li> Great product - thanks</li>
            <li> My usual care for my rosacea could not hold up to cold, brutel winds this winter.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this product on line and ordered it. It came quickly and with one use my skin felt soft and no longer was red and irritated.</li>
            <li> Very Happy with the Service</li>
            <li> I like the green tint and the sunscreen. It&#x27;s not super moisturizing and its kind of a small bottle but I like it well enough that I bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, and use prescription meds to treat it, but my skin still stays quite red. This lotion does pretty good job on covering redness to some degree, it protects my skin from sun and, the most important thing, it does not irritate my skin, as so many other lotions I tried. It is not perfect, but it is the best so far. I also like the redness relief facial cleaner, lookd like they work the best together</li>
            <li> This product broke me out. I LOVE their face wash and night cream, though, and my skin is overly sensitive, so I can&#x27;t give it less than a 3 star.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not a cure or treatment for rosacea, but it sure helps cosmetically!  I&#x27;ve worn this lotion alone, over another moisturizer with a higher spf, and also under foundation.  It works great every time.  It just takes a thin layer over my face and neck to greatly reduce the appearance of the redness.  If you put too much on it does look greenish until it is absorbed, but under foundation this isn&#x27;t a problem since the green counters the redness and helps give the foundation a more even color.  I love how easily this works,  I&#x27;ve tried many products some that cost a lot more and none have worked this well.  It isn&#x27;t greasy, it&#x27;s a perfect light moisturizer with the added benefit of hiding the ever-present redness of my skin.  And I really like that I can wear it alone or with whatever else I want to pair with it.</li>
            <li> I did not find any relief for my Rosacea from the thick green goo. It made my face look like a very unhealthy shade of grey/green. I used it everyday when I first got it, but every time I used, people would ask me if I was feeling well. But besides the weird color it gave my skin, it did nothing for my rosacea.</li>
            <li> This lotion is fine as SPF protection, but I already had a few of those. I was hoping for &amp;#34;redness relief&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s a green, thin, lightweight lotion, that I smooth on my face, concentrating on the reddest areas of my face, but there is no diminished look of the redness.</li>
            <li> I have very red cheeks, sometimes with bumps, but mostly just red flare-ups from weather, heat, spicy food or alcohol. I can control it most of the time but sometimes they just heat up so much, I can&#x27;t get them to cool down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reading the reviews and hoping this would be the ticket. But unfortunately, this has a VERY GREEN color and I have large pores. My pores just look full of green gunk. I had to rub and rub to get the cream to blend and soak in. By then, I was all red just from the rubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion is nice though and not too thick. If I didn&#x27;t have big pores this might work okay. But also they have found yellow is better than green at making red go away. Who knows, but this didn&#x27;t work at all. So sad. Back on the hunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:3/27/14&lt;br /&gt;Try the night cream! I&#x27;m having much better results and NO green color! It&#x27;s actually slightly yellow! Yay!</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Goes on easily, and you don&#x27;t need much!  The green tint is helpful in covering the redness, and then I put my regular foundation over it and it looks good.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m suffering with hives on my face resulting from a bug bite.  The welts are quite red, so I thought I would try this to suppress their appearance.  It does a nice job of toning it down, and like another reviewer commented, this would work well under your foundation.  I like the design of the glass bottle, and the dispenser spits out just the right amount.  The lotion is very mild and causes no irritation, which I was skeptical about.  Some complain about the green being visible, and I really can&#x27;t say that was my experience.  This lotion also has a SPF 15.</li>
            <li> you only use a tiny bit! Its not great as a sunblock because you only use a tiny bit.  Im not sure this is a fix, only a cover, but ok as that.</li>
            <li> This is green tinted like I like but instead of feeling like a green tinted moisturizer (creamy and thick), it feels more like green tinted sunscreen (thin and stings). Next time I will buy clinque; although it costs more I liked it much better.</li>
            <li> Yes this lotion is mint green.  It is mint green because green is opposite red on the color spectrum.  The key is to use the amount of green you need to counteract the redness,  and for very red skin you will probably need to apply a concealer over the lotion.  I tried it on several friends, and it works best on slightly darker skin tones .  For my friend with milky white skin with freckles it defiantly left a greenish tinge no matter how hard she rubbed it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not oily at all and does not leave your face feeling sticky or greasy.  It also does not have a scent.  It provides SPF 15 protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to use a very small amount, or you will get the Hulk look.</li>
            <li> I have had a red face every day as long as I can remember.  Eventually I just gave up on even caring about it until I came across this on an ad here on Amazon.  I decided for $12 I&#x27;ll give it a try and I was not disappointed.  I felt like a new person showing up to work without a red face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on like any other type of light lotion, but it has a greenish tint to it.  Once it was absorbed into my skin, I could see the difference immediately.  I wanted to rush to the keyboard and type a review, however, I told myself to wait and see if the effects lasted all day, and indeed they do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs quickly, has an SPF (but doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen when its on your face), and it feels very light...I didn&#x27;t even notice it on throughout the day.  Or maybe I was too excited that it actually worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, not much more to say, just give it a shot if you have a red face all the time</li>
            <li> Works great to take the redness out.</li>
            <li> This product works some to cover up redness. I haven&#x27;t seen any other product that works really at all. It is green in color that helps \\&quot;cancel out\\&quot; the redness. It is kind of expensive but works somewhat. I suggest taking off the top when it will no longer come out of the pump and \\&quot;dig\\&quot; the rest of the product out of the bottle so a lot isn&#x27;t wasted. Don&#x27;t put on a lot; just try a little at a time. I believe this product is worth a try. - -&lt;br /&gt; I have now tried Aveeno Postitively Radiant lotion that I really like. If you get the light or medium color added it will cover up the redness also pretty well. You can get it with 15 or 30 spf for sun protection. I recommend this over the Eucerin Redness Relief. Don&#x27;t get either one in your eyes though. It is about $15.00 - $20.00 for 2.5 oz.</li>
            <li> hasn&#x27;t helped with redness at all, but I still use it for the sunscreen benefit</li>
            <li> I like this cream.  I have alot of redness on my cheeks, I put this cream on before I apply makeup. Between my makeup and the cream - I don&#x27;t see the redness.</li>
            <li> I bought this and tried it. I returned it. It didn&#x27;t absorb well, kind of sat on top of my skin, the green tint made my skin look  pasty/chalky.  I do love the gel cleanser for sensitive skin, and the night cream too.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, it does have some greenish tint to it, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything to alieve those tiny capillaries.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  So that is good.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for Rosacea for years. It has always worked well for me, and the condition has never gotten worse. Our local stores don&#x27;t carry this anymore, so I&#x27;m happy to be able to get it online.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have rosacea, but I&#x27;ve still always been as red as a stop sign.  after using this product every morning, and their night cream every night, for about 2 weeks, I&#x27;m not a color found on the standard human spectrum.  The difference is amazing, i&#x27;m so happy!  no longer look like i&#x27;m constantly blushing or about to burst into flames!!  couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
            <li> I use this for my Rosacia and it helps. Plus I like the face it has spf 15 for sun protection. I use it daily in the morning and the price is in line and cheaper than Walgreens.</li>
            <li> The lotion is a good cover up , but it doesn&#x27;t relief the redness as much like i expected it too. You would have to use the cream constantly.  It&#x27;s hard to rub the moisture due to its green color. I have been using the cream for about a two weeks now. I expected way more better results form this cream .</li>
            <li> I have been using this product daily for years and it has never failed me.  I do not break out and it does lessen the redness on my face.  It also provides me with a 15 sunscreen for daily shopping trips in and out of the car, to the store, return.  I am satisfied with this product and I sincerely hope they don&#x27;t tweak the ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is the hardest product to find in stores! I was so thankful when I found it an amazon and for such a great price! I blush a lot and this lotion really helps minimize all my redness! It is amazing!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this product.  Use it everyday!! the green fades into thte skin and really helps balance out my red skin (rosacea)</li>
            <li> This products evens out the red skin tones and allows the application of &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; make-up to be effective.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I have awful, and I mean AWFUL 1\\&quot; red streaks that look like marionette lines going from the corners of my mouth to my jawline. They hurt like hell and if I cover them up with makeup of any kind they burn. So I&#x27;ve been using a combination of Crisco and petroleum jelly and it&#x27;s worked fine, but we&#x27;re talking Crisco and PB here so it doesn&#x27;t work outside of the home, where I can shine to my heart&#x27;s content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I figured the redness wash is wonderful and very soothing, so this would work great. Boy was I wrong. After I applied it, it felt like someone had cut me with a knife in both lines the pain was unbearable.  I quickly washed the lotion off and the area was so irritated and when I looked in the mirror the lines were screaming fire engine red -it was absolutely startling, I&#x27;ve never seen it so red. I quickly applied my home remedy and the irritation vanished. I&#x27;m going to try E45, which is a European lotion sold here on Amazon, to see if that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this lotion won&#x27;t be useful, except for the small red bumps on my face, which it seems to cover with no irritation -it does come out like a light mint green, kind of weird and it doesn&#x27;t fade, it&#x27;s chalky and sort of strange. I&#x27;d never put this on in a large area again. Too bad ---I&#x27;m disappointed that I couldn&#x27;t find something that is really easy to find in stores and on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to post this same review to the perfecting lotion, cleanser, and night creme, so if you read one, you&#x27;ve read them all. Just mentioning to save you time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosacea is a relatively new development in my life.  Recently the bumps have become extreme, and after doing some reading, I realized what I was dealing with.  Wanting to address the problem as thoroughly as possible, I bought the redness relief perfecting lotion, the cleanser, and the night cream.  I am amazed at the results after only 24 hours; my husband even noticed!  Redness is dramatically reduced and the bumps are much smaller.  Having read the reviews here, I expected the perfecting lotion product to be difficult to spread.  The review suggested mixing this product with another moisturizer to increase \\&quot;spreadability.\\&quot;  But they must have changed the formula, because it isn&#x27;t.  Of course I didn&#x27;t know that when I was shopping, so I also bought an Aveeno redness calming moisturizer.  I&#x27;m glad I did; the Eucerin product isn&#x27;t really a moisturizer, at least for my 66-year-old skin, so using both is the answer.  The cleanser is amazing; my skin feels so calm after washing; calm being the only word I can think of to describe the sensation, or maybe lack of the sensation, I get with other products.  And the night creme doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.  I&#x27;m giving those two products 5 stars; the 4 stars for the perfecting lotion is only because I need additional moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also going to investigate the potential connection between my rosacea and SIBO (small intestine bacteria overgowth) and/or heliocopter pilori, the bacteria responsible for ulcers, which we apparently all carry on our skin.  I&#x27;m not medical, so don&#x27;t quote me on this, but there&#x27;s a lot of info out there.</li>
            <li> Seemed to help at first but then my face broke out. When stopped using this product, my face cleared up. It may be just me as I have numerous allergies; it may help others, just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even worth one star. First of all, it is not moisturizer. They make you believe it&#x27;s green tinted moisturizer, with sunblock. And calms redness, etc. It does none of those things, except it green sunblock, that&#x27;s it. Very thick. Actually has like a faint burning sensation. It has made my little rosacea bumps worse. It don&#x27;t really cover the redness either. Take any sunblock, or even any face primer, then apply your powder/foundation/whatever, and you get the same coverage effect. Thats why some think it works for coverage, cause it&#x27;s so thick it&#x27;s just working like a primer. Bottom line, so not worth the money and made my face worse. Better off using plain ole yellow concealer (not green) to cover your red before applying makeup...haven&#x27;t found anything to top that yet.</li>
            <li> All my life I had problems with over blushing, getting too red when being in the sun. This product is AMAZING!!!!! Wish it was advertised more so I could have found it sooner.  This is a product I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> This lotion does reduce the look of redness, but it needs to be blended in quickly because it gets thicker as it sits. I haven&#x27;t found any other product that helps, so at least this is an option. I would continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Feels nice. I can&#x27;t tell a major difference with the green tint but I know it&#x27;s not making it worse. Though, I don&#x27;t think it is doing a whole lot for my rosacea.</li>
            <li> This is a very strange product. First it&#x27;s green in color. I&#x27;m not sure if that is due to the active ingredients or if that is something added just for the color. I am not certain what the purpose of that is either. It&#x27;s not much of a moisturizer, doesn&#x27;t soak into my face very well and I haven&#x27;t seen much redness relief. It may be a good sunscreen, but I really have had exposure to see how effective that is. Quite frankly, it seems more like makeup than a skincare product.</li>
            <li> A little greasy for daytime, especially if you are wearing makeup—I would suggest getting a concealer or green concealer and mixing a little into some liquid foundation or into your own moisturizer to cancel out redness instead of just using this particular moisturizer. Takes the same amount of time to apply</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Euerin and it&#x27;s great for my red face,you need to really blend until the green tite disappears. I use Eucerin and Neutrogena daily moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 15 great combo. If you have really dry skin use another moisturizer on top. This is also great under foundation. Hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> My wife had been using Aveeno Calming to manage her mild Rosacea but wanted to try something new.  She is very pleased with this product and would but it again.  It&#x27;s a little less expensive as well.</li>
            <li> It will do.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for sensitive skin and it is just a normal lotion. If you have sensitivity issues you might want to try a different lotion. But as a SPF it works well.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff. i bought it online because i cnt find it in stores any more. but i am a cronic blusher(that is a real thing haha) and it stained my cheeks permanently red and under my makeup this is flawless. i only put it on my cheeks. if this has to go on a persons nose or forehead i will stress this would get too oily on my nose.  but but if you have super dry skin that should be ok.  my cheeks tend to stay dry but i hve an oily T-zone so this stuff is perfect for me</li>
            <li> Does not seem to do anything. Maybe some very slight relief ... but could be my imagination.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU - JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.</li>
            <li> I like the suffering for the color that minimizes the redness. The lotion itself it a bit watery and takes awhile to dry. You have to apply it evenly too. After using it 2 weeks my skin is less red, but my rosacea flares up and gets better on its own, so I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s the product. The best feature is, it works really great under makeup. I find I don&#x27;t have to use as much cover up. I just wish it was more cream like and felt moisturizing, but I just put a moisturizer over it. Maybe mixing the two and then applying would work.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my rosacea.  I have only tried one other product for rosacea, Clinique Redness solution.  I like the Clinique better.  This product comes out too much at one time.  I&#x27;m going to have to make sure to just put a dot on my face. I think the Clinique wasn&#x27;t as bright green as this product.  As others have said, once you put it on your face is a pasty, sickly looking white, so now you have to put on makeup, even in the summer.  Going back to Clinique, much more money, but works much better.</li>
            <li> Bought to cover up a red blotch on my face caused by a deep sunburn I got years ago. Covers it up some, but then found a green stick makeup that covers it completely. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> My face would look fantastic immediately after applying this product, but as soon as any oil accumulated on my face it looked disgusting, and the greenish tint would show (I would look sick). Use in moderation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this is better for red and DRY skin, although it doesn&#x27;t necessarily \\&quot;relieve\\&quot; the redness so much as mask it. I used it for a couple weeks and noticed zero improvement. My skin actually got less red after discontinuing the \\&quot;redness relief\\&quot; product line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;s not what I expected. I does not absorb evenly on the skin.</li>
            <li> Very peculiar Lotion. First you have to learn how to use it and get used to it. Only then you realize its great positive qualities</li>
            <li> Heavy. Not what I would expect for a daily lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like putting on foundation but it does block some sun</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 17 year-old male who has had severe Keratosis Pilaris Rubra Faceii (KPRF) since I was a baby, but it went away for most of my childhood and resurfaced when I was 12/13 or so. For the unaware, it&#x27;s not unlike rosacea (which this product is intended for) in that it causes severe facial redness, but it&#x27;s a much more consistent redness and I never get any sort of bumps or acne-like stuff on my face. It&#x27;s an evil little condition in that it makes you feel incredibly unattractive and erodes your self confidence, but it doesn&#x27;t affect your (physical) health at all and the only real &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; for it is expensive laser surgery that costs $500-700 per treatment that may or may not work and makes you look like a circus freak for a week or two afterwards (if you&#x27;re a girl you can probably wear makeup or something but that isn&#x27;t very appealing as a guy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried at least 15 different products for my face, including several expensive prescription medication, and none of them really alleviated the redness and just made me feel more hopeless about improving my appearance. I came across this line of products late last month (May 2014). I tried the &amp;#34;Soothing Cleanser&amp;#34; facewash and I&#x27;m really not sure if that actually does anything, but I&#x27;m still sticking with it anyway because it&#x27;s certainly not hurting. I&#x27;ve also tried the night cream in the same line and it makes my face all smooth but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for the redness, which is really the point of using it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just jump to the point real quick: It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had several people comment that my face looks better and that they&#x27;re impressed with my appearance (i lost like 30 lbs recently so that helps, too). It&#x27;s really improved my confidence knowing that I don&#x27;t look like a sunburnt lobster every time I go out in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it&#x27;s really hard to apply correctly. Most of the time it looks pretty obvious in the right lighting because I&#x27;m still not sure how to make it look convincing. Another reviewer mentioned that you can&#x27;t really use it with any facial hair, which is frustrating because my facial hair grows at an annoyingly fast rate (I like being clean shaven anyway so that&#x27;s just annoying in general). It&#x27;s also mentioned that it can make your face look eerily pale (i&#x27;m really pale to begin with so that doesn&#x27;t bother me), so that&#x27;s something you should be aware of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re worried about buying this, keep in mind that 98% of the people who you walk past on the street aren&#x27;t going to notice or care that your face looks kind of green (if you weren&#x27;t aware, this stuff is green since red and green cancel each other out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the end, I do REALLY like this product and what it&#x27;s done for my face. If you have facial redness and you&#x27;re self-conscious about it, I would suggest that you try this. I still need to figure out how to apply it convincingly (i&#x27;d really appreciate any advice for that!), but it&#x27;s worked leagues better than anything else has, so I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. I love the way it evens my skin tone and protects me from the sun.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any serious skin problems, but my water has terribly high rust from old pipes and so my skin has become sensitive and started flushing.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is perfect for me. It evens out my skin tone and gives everything a nice matte, porcelain finish. My husband pointed out that it look a teeny bit green at first, but my usual powder evens the tone out just fine. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Leaves an odd white film on my face, does not absorb well at all.  However it does cover the redness.  Not sure which is better.  Redness or looking as if I have white goop on my face?</li>
            <li> This may work well for others, but for me I found it to be useless. It is too runny and just makes your skin look pasty offering no moisture at all.</li>
            <li> I have used this day creme every day  for over a year. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and like the way it goes on and like the coverage.  I have red skin from rosacea and this really helps cover the red.</li>
            <li> Worked great way better then</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who has rosacea because he, understandably, doesn&#x27;t want to use makeup to cover the redness. The product smells great and goes on smoothly, without leaving any green tinted streaks. After a few days we noticed his dryness and flakiness had improved, and the texture of his skin was smoother. The only comlplaint is that it&#x27;s a bit to thick to massage evenly over his facial hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and it has toned down my redness by at least  50%. Leaves my shin feeling soft and it has a glowing look after applying it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to get this product! It works wonder for me!!!!</li>
            <li> this stuff works, I use with the cleanser and night cream and skin is much better, I gave 4 stars because I wish it had higher SPF and there was mention in other reviews of a previous kind that wasnt tinted green which I wouldve also tried, i have to make sure i exfoliate enough because the color of this lotion will settle on dry patches, but it does leave a nice complexion instead of the red undertones and doesnt leave my combo skin greasy or parched in places.</li>
            <li> Hard to get the green color out and was a little too drying</li>
            <li> After trying many, many products to control the KP on my young son&#x27;s face, I was hoping this would help clear the redness and bumps, but unfortunately, it did not work for him. It is in the cabinet with the other 30 or so products that haven&#x27;t helped.</li>
            <li> This has a green tint to it. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> While I was curious about the green color of the lotion I was thoroughly disappointed with the consistency of the product. I felt like I was putting sun screen on every morning. Yuck!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for reducing redness - I mix with my usual moisturizer for best results.</li>
            <li> I may have misunderstood what I was getting, but I thought I read a bunch of reviews. This product does not treat the cause of the redness, it masks it, and it is short lived. It is a pretty good facial sunscreen I guess.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisture every day for years.  It is my favorite, and Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> I am still trying this. on my face at times it is very drying. others it helps some what. just don&#x27;t like looking green. but, hey it is worth trying, especially if your face isn&#x27;t dry from medicine.. i&#x27;d buy again</li>
            <li> another Eucerin product that works. You really have to rub it in, however, or the green color will remain. Thanks for a good product!</li>
            <li> Works well when used on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This product helps tone down the redness often associated with rosacea.  apply a bit of it on affected areas and then apply makeup for a smooth clear appearance.</li>
            <li> Not very excites about this cream. It helps with the redness but is really thick and too much green.</li>
            <li> Very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! I have perpetually red skin and my complexion is fair so it&#x27;s really frustrating. The Eucerin Redness Relief works WONDERS. In order to ensure that it blends properly, I apply a moisturizer before applying the Eucerin cream. This is because parts of my face are more dry than others and the dry areas will grab onto the Eucerin cream and make it look, well, ...scaly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little wary of the ingredients because some of them can not be natural (though Eucerin does not claim it is natural by any means)...but, alas, I will continue to use this product because it does SUCH a great job. Much better than the Clinique product I used to use (which was also much more expensive, mind you).</li>
            <li> I read numerous reviews on this product, very skeptical ~ your know, almost too good to be true.  But it got great reviews, lots of people said it helped their redness.  So I took a chance. TO GOOD TO BE TRUE!  I got bitten again!!  I put it on one side of my face and compared it to the other side and absolutely no difference.  I smeared it all over my face and it did not even reduce the redness slightly.  So very dissappointed.  My local Walgreens actually discontinued the product due to low/no sales, I should have figured out why, if it worked they would have sold it.  So, buy at your own risk but my advise, just stick with foundation!</li>
            <li> Completely removes redness. Highly recommend it and only product we found that truly does it. Also blends in so you don&#x27;t feel like you put anything on</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  It was packed perfect and delivered on time.  I found this product to work for me and would suggest to at least try it.  I do use their night cream as well which is amazing.  Also using other products to help with my skin and I have finally found a great combo that works for me.</li>
            <li> My skin is has a trifecta of issues; sensative, reddish and dry.&lt;br /&gt;Although the \\&quot;green tint\\&quot; in this does seem to diminish the appearance of redness, it is not moisterizing enough. I found myself layering on another coat of moisterizer, therefore defeating the purpose of the green tint. (My skin seems to be redder when it&#x27;s dryer.)&lt;br /&gt;It was okay, but I think the daily moisterizer and night cream are far superior. (As a side note; the Garnier BB tinted moisterizer is great. I add a little to the daily spf 30 moisterizer by Eucerin with great results. I only wish Eucerin had a tinted, sensitive skin, spf moisterizer! haha, I know I&#x27;m asking a lot...)</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. During harsh winters, my face gets red, dry and irritated. I thought this could help negate the redness. However, after two uses its now sitting in  a drawer until I eventually throw it away during a purge. It just didn&#x27;t rub in properly. The product just sat on top of my skin providing no moisturizing affect and keeping it&#x27;s green hue. Worthless.</li>
            <li> since the first application it reduced the redness (at least superficially). After two days my skin is looking a little better (or maybe placebo effect? who knows but I see my face a little bit less red). Anyway, it&#x27;s soft and you don&#x27;t need to use too much to cover the whole face. Don&#x27;t forget to go to the dermatologist anyways, especially if you have rosacea. The product helps but cant not be the only treatment.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with a few other redness relief cremes to hopefully reduce my rosacea, and after a week I notice a difference. The only product that I haven&#x27;t used as much is this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the consistency and smell of sunscreen, and it is a light grass-green color. This green hue is supposed to mask the redness, but all it seems to do is make my face green. I apply a tiny bit on my cheeks, and after smearing it on there are always spots of green that I have to wipe away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this again, and instead get a cheaper SPF lotion for my face that isn&#x27;t green.</li>
    </ol>
