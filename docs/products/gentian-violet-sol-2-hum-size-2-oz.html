            <li>Effective product for healing wounds.</li>
            <li>She said Neosporin is ok, silver gel is great, but gentian violet is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I used the gentian violet morning and evening for 3 days, then stopped treatment for 2 days so that a doctor would be able both see the wound and would be able to get a good culture of anything that might be living in there.</li>

            <li>I love the stuff</li>
            <li>I love the stuff &amp; at $ 3.00 a bottle  </li>
            <li>We use to be able to puchase this OTC</li>
            <li>Otherwise, do some research and find out more about gentian violet.</li>
            <li>After trying a steroid cream, which made it slightly better</li>
            <li>He was able to keep the area covered so no one noticed.</li>
            <li>..make sure you dont drip or spill it on flooring, counter tops, clothing, bedding etc.</li>
            <li>Has many uses including fungal infections,..</li>
            <li>but I think it is okay</li>
            <li>Glad I found it</li>
            <li>So glad I found it.</li>
            <li>Treats oral thrush quickly and effectively where nothing else I&#x27;ve tried, even prescription drugs, works as well.  </li>
            <li>Glad the option of 2 ounce bottles was available for purchase.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Good natural anti-fungal for dog ears and more.</li>
            <li>Modern medicines cost more and are not as effective.</li>
            <li>I was able to treat it at first with Nystatin but the sugar in the solution played havoc with my blood sugar and the more I used it</li>
            <li>After quickly curing a chronic infection in my pet&#x27;s paw, I had used up the excess gentian violet by (deliberately!)</li>
            <li>However, a HUGE CAUTION--when you put liquid in a dogs ear they like to shake it out.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily for mixing up an ear remedy for my dogs.  </li>
            <li>Before using the Blue Power Ear solution on your dog PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE make sure a vet has checked the dog&#x27;s ears to make sure there isn&#x27;t a perforation!</li>
            <li>I use this to clean the spaniels ears.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find in Drug stores it is still an excellent product</li>
            <li>First let me say the actual product was great</li>
            <li>great not much to say it works.</li>
            <li>That was good enough recommedation for me.</li>
            <li>Other than the purple mouth, it worked great.  </li>
            <li>Knocked my ringworm out quickly and painlessly.  </li>
            <li>By the time I was able to get a doctor&#x27;s appointment, five days after starting gentian violet, the wound had completely scabbed over, so they told me I&#x27;d done a good job taking care of it and sent me packing without any additional treatment.</li>
            <li>dyeing my white bikini a lovely deep purple, so I had to get more for my own wound.</li>
            <li>Customer service is good, as expected, timely, would do business with them again.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the idea of having my entire mouth, tongue and teeth purple</li>
            <li>, I figure it&#x27;s worth it to stop an infection from spreading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are treating your dog, it is a really good idea to use the stuff outside and wearing old clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE:</li>
            <li>Product was delivered very fast</li>
            <li>Facing upcoming medical procedures wanted to make sure I had this on hand to treat mouth sores.  </li>
            <li>After I applied it the second time (even though the thrush was disappearing)the purple disappeared from the healthy skin in 24 hours and 48 hours from the affected area.  </li>
            <li>It helps to heal cracks and make your feet feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>If it gets on the pillow cases just pour some alcohol on the case then put in washing machine on hot water, it will come out.</li>
            <li>Magic stuff for drying out abrasions and sores without using band-aids - have used it on our kids for 27 years, presently treating a sore on the dog.  </li>
            <li>i use it for various things love it</li>
            <li>If you want to try it just be aware that it really stains!</li>
            <li>My son has thrush, and after reading all the positive reviews of gentian violet I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>In addition, when I had used it on my pet rat&#x27;s open wound, his skin did not retain a tattoo but instead turned a healthy clear pink within days of stopping treatment; and that&#x27;s what happened when I used it on my own skin.</li>
            <li>the less effective it became.  </li>
            <li>so the q-tip does not drip anywhere and gently rub the tongue.  </li>
            <li>Really purple...</li>
            <li>Came fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>The upside: very inexpensive and quick-acting.</li>
            <li>so you have it ready and waiting when needed.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t stop using it right away, even if it looks clear it can reactivate.</li>
            <li>or foot or toenail fungus, just watch out because it is a dye and a bright dark purple for that matter, so be sure to be cautious about potential staining on your floors or carpets and only wear old socks with it.</li>
            <li>Great for healing cancre sores, diaper rash and any smaller open wounds,  Needs to air dry and does stain but will eventually wash out of clothing and off body parts!</li>
            <li>Make sure you let it dry completely</li>
            <li>Still highly recommended for fungal infections.</li>
            <li>Yes it stains, but accidental stains on skin, fabric, and hard surfaces can be removed with rubbing alcohol followed by warm water.</li>
            <li>I had had success treating open ulcers in pets, using gentian violet, which I had obtained in an aerosol form at a horse supply store.</li>
            <li>I put it in whatever my favorite shampoo is of the moment and also my conditioner, you can add as much as you like, making it a very dark purple or light one that I can use everyday.</li>
            <li>The last resort was the Gentian voilet and it should&#x27;ve been used as the first trratment.</li>
            <li>After that it was completely gone!</li>
            <li>After two applications, the site is nearly clear.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to see if I can clear up my Cocker Spaniels chronic ear infection..  </li>
            <li>even if you get it on your fingers, you will have purple fingers for a while, so avoid using the applicator directly on an area to avoid drips, but instead dab it on a swab</li>
            <li>In three days the skin fungus was almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>Use lots of old newspaper to protect the area from spills,.. or having said that,..</li>
            <li>Old time remedy that I used as a kid.</li>
            <li>This product is an old time remedy for the treatment of ringworm.</li>
            <li>It relatively inexpensive and works very well.</li>
            <li>My main use will be for treating bites and gashes from the coming democrat zombies in the near future of the continued downfall of America,..just telling the truth.</li>
            <li>but I did have healthy appearing more normal nail growing in from the base.</li>
            <li>However, I also found that, not too long ago, I developed a very stubborn case of athlete&#x27;s foot that just wouldn&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li>Anti fungal and antibacterial, this purple liquid can be used to treat a wide range of first aid situations, keep some on hand</li>
            <li>(it can take up to 6 months or more for a toenail to grow out, even a year from the base to the tip) and then apply more as needed</li>
            <li>Not only did it clear the thrush up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll stain countertops and walls too, if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>The staining on the infected area is useful to know you&#x27;ve gotten the medicine to the affected area and the stain disappears in a few days.</li>
            <li>I also put several drops in a spray bottle and sometimes just spray my hair if it is getting brassy, tones it right down.</li>
            <li>However, she warned, we want to leave a small opening for any infected material to drain out; therefore, gentian violet should not be used for the first few days because it might cause the wound to HEAL TOO QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>The drawback is the staining potential if not careful.</li>

            <li> However, she warned, we want to leave a small opening for any infected material to drain out; therefore, gentian violet should not be used for the first few days because it might cause the wound to HEAL TOO QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> The drawback is the staining potential if not careful.</li>
            <li> I bought this for ringworm and this combined with neem oil, tea tree oil, MD cream, and EXTREME CLEANLINESS which finally completely resolved it.</li>
            <li> It took a long time, but we finally \\&quot;licked it!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> that last me a long time I can&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years for minor cuts and such.  </li>
            <li> , you want to paint several coats on your toenail and let it dry well between coats, then cover with your oldest socks that you don&#x27;t care about getting stained.</li>
            <li> it took care of minor cuts and scratches.</li>
            <li> ...just apply with a q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time and can be used on animal sores.</li>
            <li> I use this on my feet when they get dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li> While it is bitter, it is not for internal consumption and has no connection other than the word &#x27;gentian&#x27; to the plant genus gentian.</li>
            <li> However, if you get it on your clothing or other things, it is difficult to clean up.(I use disposable latex gloves)</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon because finding gentian violet is getting harder and harder to do.  </li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL, YES</li>
            <li> (I use to have to be careful and not use the purple shampoo every day</li>
            <li> Within hours of applying, the open wound dried and the inflammed area started to shrink in size.</li>
            <li> This product will stain everything so be careful.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to touch pets with the infected areas as it could  contaminate to your pet</li>
            <li> Just be careful as it does stain.</li>
            <li> It stained my nail so much it looked worse then</li>
            <li> Yes, it is messy if you aren&#x27;t careful and if you don&#x27;t cover it during treatment, but if nothing else works for an open wound, try this.</li>
            <li> Other than that...</li>
            <li> It worked and was the archetypical bitter medicine!</li>
            <li> or it will stain clothing or other parts of your body.</li>
            <li> Check body regularly even after the &amp;#34;ring&amp;#34; goes away as a small spore could have traveled onto something and it could reactivate.  </li>
            <li> The product is very messy and stains - would look for an alternative and use this as a last resort.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to comment on the effectiveness of the product because I only used it once on my finger nail.  </li>
            <li> My parents had taken their dog to the veterinarian twice concerning the irritation with no success.  </li>
            <li> Let it dry and then put on the usual cream.  </li>
            <li> Dip the q-tip into the bottle slightly so</li>
            <li> I used heavy duty paper towels instead of towels when the fungus was active.</li>
            <li> This stuff stains and ruins everything!  </li>
            <li> I put a little on a cotton swab and coated the affected area.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my dog who had a little staph infection.  </li>
            <li> and it is sad that it is getting harder to find locally.  </li>
            <li> After doing this for a few days, my athlete&#x27;s foot was gone.  </li>
            <li> It will dye skin purple for a few days, and forget about wearing garments that get touched with the stuff.  </li>
            <li> Used for a yeast infection that I&#x27;d been fighting since a heavy dose of antibiotics.  </li>
            <li> The purple stain goes away over a few days.</li>
            <li> I do believe the gentian violet helped tremendously as it dried it out.  </li>
            <li> It took a few applications but resolved the infection.  </li>
            <li> However, I did use it on an open wound because, well, I was really tired of having an open wound and was very afraid that I was liable to spread some hideous disease to other people, and I decided that I would prefer a small round tattoo on my shin to getting my leg amputated due to chronic infection.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It stains pretty badly</li>
            <li> I suppose I should give it a chance, but it&#x27;s hard to walk around with a dark purple nail and explain it to people who ask!  </li>
            <li> That said, it is messy!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if this could be used on pets</li>
            <li> It is very messy and it didn&#x27;t help his thrush at all.</li>
            <li> Gentian violet is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Doctors have a hard time recommending it and it will stain everything in your house permanently</li>
            <li> Does not come off for at least 2 days...</li>
            <li> At least I can get it here on line.</li>
            <li> I mean IT STAINS.  </li>
            <li> I mean Everything</li>
            <li> Add a very small amount of gentian violet to your shampoo/conditioner to tone your blonde/white hair.</li>
            <li> Once it drips, it will never come off without serious intervention (bleach, acetone, rubbing alcohol etc.)  </li>
            <li> We accidentally spilled this stuff and used plain water to try to wipe it up and it made things worse!  </li>
            <li> Gentian Violet is one of the ingredients and very hard to find</li>
            <li> and then worse, we tried gentian violet.  </li>
            <li> rosemary--pretty much any antimicrobial that I had around the house that was recommended for nasty and unresponsive infections, and any antiinflammatory I could think of including cortisone cream, benedryl gel, salicylic acid, resveratrol, n-acetyl cysteine (\\&quot;NAC\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> It just kept getting worse, and nothing could stop the flow of liquid or make it scab over.</li>
            <li> but it does work when the alternatives made my kids puke everywhere and were probably just as toxic or worse.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell how well it worked - there were extenuating circumstances the few times I used it, but just a warning that it stains like MAD.</li>
            <li> Lets just say ill</li>
            <li> I will say place in some type of small bottle with a dropper, this stains like crazy, I always get some on my fingers when making some up!</li>
            <li> Just two data points, but when the worst a medication can do to you is possibly leave a mark</li>
            <li> Where expensive vet prescription meds had failed -- this worked in just days!</li>
            <li> and it is very difficult to get out,</li>
            <li> and it is very difficult to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> Gentian Violet STAINS and STAINS badly.</li>
            <li> When your baby gets thrush, then passes it to you through nursing, it is wildly painful.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have a fingernail that becomes infected as a result of a stupid  nurse injuring this finger while trying to take my blood sugar.</li>

            <li> My Irish Wolfhound has chronic ear issues and a friend recommended something called the Blue Power Ear Solution. Gentian Violet is one of the ingredients and very hard to find so I was happy to find it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blue Power Ear solution worked on the dog! However, a HUGE CAUTION--when you put liquid in a dogs ear they like to shake it out. Gentian Violet STAINS and STAINS badly. Once it is on your clothes you probably can write them off. If you are treating your dog, it is a really good idea to use the stuff outside and wearing old clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE: Before using the Blue Power Ear solution on your dog PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE make sure a vet has checked the dog&#x27;s ears to make sure there isn&#x27;t a perforation!</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that worked to get rid of Oral Thrush on my infant son!  We tried two rounds of Nystatin and it did nothing.  WARNING: This stuff stains and ruins everything!  Best way to use this is when your baby is in a diaper (no clothes) and in a place where staining can be avoided.  Would recommend a bathtub with water or even outside in the grass so dripping isn&#x27;t a big concern.  Once it drips, it will never come off without serious intervention (bleach, acetone, rubbing alcohol etc.)  We accidentally spilled this stuff and used plain water to try to wipe it up and it made things worse!  You can use rubbing alcohol to get it off the skin.  The best way to apply is with a q-tip.  Dip the q-tip into the bottle slightly so only 2-3 drops of violet are on the q-tip, drip off the excess so the q-tip does not drip anywhere and gently rub the tongue.  Do this once a day for 2-3 days and the thrush should be gone for good.</li>
            <li> Customer service is good, as expected, timely, would do business with them again.  The product is very messy and stains - would look for an alternative and use this as a last resort.</li>
            <li> When your baby gets thrush, then passes it to you through nursing, it is wildly painful.  I used this along with Diflucan for me, liquid Diflucan for the baby, and Nystatin cream for my nipples.  It took a long time, but we finally \\&quot;licked it!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter who had thrush. First let me say the actual product was great it cleared it up in no time at all about 2-3 days total. Now on to the company I ordered it from...Humco holding group. I ordered it on Thursday and added rush delivery paid an extra $8.00 or so to have it next day delivered and it didn&#x27;t show up till the following Friday!! Lets just say ill never order from them again and I will let everyone I know about it too!!!</li>
            <li> Got it, used it... It works! Does not come off for at least 2 days... Really purple... Bottle is good with a functional applicator. Came fast in the mail. Satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a great cure for fungus nails. or foot or toenail fungus, just watch out because it is a dye and a bright dark purple for that matter, so be sure to be cautious about potential staining on your floors or carpets and only wear old socks with it. I bought this months ago and have used it on my toenails and friends as well, you want to paint several coats on your toenail and let it dry well between coats, then cover with your oldest socks that you don&#x27;t care about getting stained. then apply another coat in a week or two, keep an eye on it, after some time, (it can take up to 6 months or more for a toenail to grow out, even a year from the base to the tip) and then apply more as needed but I did have healthy appearing more normal nail growing in from the base. it does work, you can pain the skin between the toes for athlete&#x27;s foot cure as well, the bottle comes with it&#x27;s own applicator.</li>
            <li> GENTIAN VIOLET SOL 2% ***HUM Size: 2 OZ. great not much to say it works.But boy it does not smell very good so be prepared and boy does also dye your skin toooo</li>
            <li> worked wonders in my dogs ears</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon because finding gentian violet is getting harder and harder to do.  I use it primarily for mixing up an ear remedy for my dogs.  However, I also found that, not too long ago, I developed a very stubborn case of athlete&#x27;s foot that just wouldn&#x27;t go away.  since it helps prevent yeast infections in my dog&#x27;s ears, I figured I would try some on my problem.  I put a little on a cotton swab and coated the affected area.  Let it dry and then put on the usual cream.  After doing this for a few days, my athlete&#x27;s foot was gone.  it didn&#x27;t not burn but helped ease the itch, which was nice.  Now if you never have used gentian violet before, I have to worn you, it stains.  I mean IT STAINS.  I mean Everything and it is very difficult to get out, even if you get it on your fingers, you will have purple fingers for a while, so avoid using the applicator directly on an area to avoid drips, but instead dab it on a swab and you should be OK.  I love the stuff and it is sad that it is getting harder to find locally.  At least I can get it here on line.</li>
            <li> Gentian violet is great stuff. I remember my mother putting it on our scrapes and cuts just like people put neosporin. She would even put it on our mouth sores, on our cat after a fight to help it&#x27;s wounds heal faster. I love the stuff &amp; at $ 3.00 a bottle  that last me a long time I can&#x27;t complain if you can&#x27;t  find it Wal-Mart carries it in the hispanic section of the pharmacy &amp; alot of hispanic stores and pharmacies carry it</li>
            <li> Somehow the local stores don&#x27;t have this stuff.  I&#x27;ve used it for years for minor cuts and such.  The only thing is...it stains!  Other than that...it took care of minor cuts and scratches.</li>
            <li> We use to be able to puchase this OTC but now only off the web.  Facing upcoming medical procedures wanted to make sure I had this on hand to treat mouth sores.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> My husband told me about gentian violet being used both in WWI and WWII. Used to treat wounded soldiers.....and soldiers who had been &#x27;indiscreet&#x27;. That was good enough recommedation for me. BE CAREFUL, YES IT DOES STAIN. Otherwise, do some research and find out more about gentian violet. I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> My infant son had a persistent oral thrush and neither nystatin or diflucan worked t get rid of it. The last resort was the Gentian voilet and it should&#x27;ve been used as the first trratment. Other than the purple mouth, it worked great.  &lt;br /&gt;WARNING &lt;br /&gt;It stains pretty badly so make sure it doesn&#x27;t spill or get on any good fabrics.</li>
            <li> shipped two days earlier.&lt;br /&gt;using it on my blonde hair two times a week so the orange tints will not showed. work great for me .</li>
            <li> I am a diabetic and one of the side affects of that (for me) is a constant battle with oral thrush. I was able to treat it at first with Nystatin but the sugar in the solution played havoc with my blood sugar and the more I used it the less effective it became.  After having the thrush return again, I purchased Gentian Violet 2%.  I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the idea of having my entire mouth, tongue and teeth purple but I was at my wits end.  Not only did it clear the thrush up it was gone after only 2 applications. I will NEVER be without this again.  The staining on my teeth lasted about 24 hours.  The staining in my mouth in the affected areas lasted 48 hours. After I applied it the second time (even though the thrush was disappearing)the purple disappeared from the healthy skin in 24 hours and 48 hours from the affected area.  After that it was completely gone!</li>
            <li> We used this to alleviate a fungal condition on my mother&#x27;s dog.  After two applications, the site is nearly clear.  My parents had taken their dog to the veterinarian twice concerning the irritation with no success.  After trying a steroid cream, which made it slightly better and then worse, we tried gentian violet.  It is an alternative treatment for fungus that we heard of years ago.  It worked great!  (I am just passing on what we heard.  Research it for yourself before trying. I&#x27;m not a vet, nor a medical doctor.)</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. My husband has a recurring skin fungus problem. Every five years or so he&#x27;s had to go to the doctor&#x27;s for another prescription. This time, we tried over-the-counter Gentian Violet. It did the job wonderfully. In three days the skin fungus was almost completely gone. The downside: It does stain the skin purple, but only for the duration of use. He was able to keep the area covered so no one noticed. The upside: very inexpensive and quick-acting.</li>
            <li> Good natural anti-fungal for dog ears and more.</li>
            <li> I have white/blonde hair, and have used purple shampoo/conditioner of some type for years. After reading something online about toning hair they had this tip. Add a very small amount of gentian violet to your shampoo/conditioner to tone your blonde/white hair. It works like a dream!! I put it in whatever my favorite shampoo is of the moment and also my conditioner, you can add as much as you like, making it a very dark purple or light one that I can use everyday. (I use to have to be careful and not use the purple shampoo every day or it would start looking too blue or gray). I also put several drops in a spray bottle and sometimes just spray my hair if it is getting brassy, tones it right down. Also this is anti fungal so if you have any dandruff issues it will prevent them! Love it! I will say place in some type of small bottle with a dropper, this stains like crazy, I always get some on my fingers when making some up!</li>
            <li> Every household should have this on hand. I discovered it when searching for help with my dog&#x27;s chronic ear and skin infections caused by yeast. Where expensive vet prescription meds had failed -- this worked in just days! &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; it on affected areas with a cotton swab. Yes it stains, but accidental stains on skin, fabric, and hard surfaces can be removed with rubbing alcohol followed by warm water. The alcohol dissolves the stain where water alone will not. Anti fungal and antibacterial, this purple liquid can be used to treat a wide range of first aid situations, keep some on hand so you have it ready and waiting when needed.</li>
            <li> Should have done my &#x27;research&#x27; before purchasing this as a potential bitterant to use in my experiments to create craft tonics. While it is bitter, it is not for internal consumption and has no connection other than the word &#x27;gentian&#x27; to the plant genus gentian. Can remember Dad swathing my throat with it when I was a kid and had a sore throat. It worked and was the archetypical bitter medicine!</li>
            <li> I had an open wound for several weeks. Maybe it was a spider bite, or a flea bite, maybe it was some resistent infection. Tried neosporin, both ointment and cream; silver gel; tolnaftate cream; peroxide scrubs; alcohol; manuka honey; magnesium sulfate; rosemary--pretty much any antimicrobial that I had around the house that was recommended for nasty and unresponsive infections, and any antiinflammatory I could think of including cortisone cream, benedryl gel, salicylic acid, resveratrol, n-acetyl cysteine (\\&quot;NAC\\&quot;). Tried covering it, and leaving it open to the air. It just kept getting worse, and nothing could stop the flow of liquid or make it scab over. I had had success treating open ulcers in pets, using gentian violet, which I had obtained in an aerosol form at a horse supply store. After quickly curing a chronic infection in my pet&#x27;s paw, I had used up the excess gentian violet by (deliberately!) dyeing my white bikini a lovely deep purple, so I had to get more for my own wound. I ordered this one and got it in two days. Within hours of applying, the open wound dried and the inflammed area started to shrink in size. I kept it covered just enough to prevent getting purple spots on everything. I used the gentian violet morning and evening for 3 days, then stopped treatment for 2 days so that a doctor would be able both see the wound and would be able to get a good culture of anything that might be living in there. By the time I was able to get a doctor&#x27;s appointment, five days after starting gentian violet, the wound had completely scabbed over, so they told me I&#x27;d done a good job taking care of it and sent me packing without any additional treatment. Yes, it is messy if you aren&#x27;t careful and if you don&#x27;t cover it during treatment, but if nothing else works for an open wound, try this. Incidentally, the instructions say NOT to use it on an open wound because it might cause tattooing. However, I did use it on an open wound because, well, I was really tired of having an open wound and was very afraid that I was liable to spread some hideous disease to other people, and I decided that I would prefer a small round tattoo on my shin to getting my leg amputated due to chronic infection. In addition, when I had used it on my pet rat&#x27;s open wound, his skin did not retain a tattoo but instead turned a healthy clear pink within days of stopping treatment; and that&#x27;s what happened when I used it on my own skin. Just two data points, but when the worst a medication can do to you is possibly leave a mark, I figure it&#x27;s worth it to stop an infection from spreading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: A week after writing the above, one of my pets had surgery to drain an infection in his jaw, and was sent home with oral antibiotics. I asked her if I could also apply a topical antimicrobial, and listed what I have at home. She said Neosporin is ok, silver gel is great, but gentian violet is fantastic. However, she warned, we want to leave a small opening for any infected material to drain out; therefore, gentian violet should not be used for the first few days because it might cause the wound to HEAL TOO QUICKLY. She didn&#x27;t offer an explanation of how that happens, just decades of experience with animals.</li>
            <li> After contracting ringworm, I tried every over-the-counter remedy I could find.  Iodine did almost nothing, tea tree and coconut oil worked, slowly, for a few weeks but the damn fungal patch grew back after partially fading away, and oregano oil was about as effective as tea tree but burned like the dickens and made me smell like a human spice rack.  Then I learned about Gentian Violet, a now-nearly forgotten antifungal and antiseptic.  Knocked my ringworm out quickly and painlessly.  That said, it is messy!  It will dye skin purple for a few days, and forget about wearing garments that get touched with the stuff.  It&#x27;ll stain countertops and walls too, if you&#x27;re not careful.  Still highly recommended for fungal infections.</li>
            <li> I use this on my feet when they get dry and cracked.  It makes the shower floor purple but it will come off after a couple weeks.  It helps to heal cracks and make your feet feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Beware,..this stuff is royal purple ink and takes forever to come off skin,..make sure you dont drip or spill it on flooring, counter tops, clothing, bedding etc. Use lots of old newspaper to protect the area from spills,.. or having said that,..Has many uses including fungal infections,..I&#x27;ve even read of women soaking a tampon in 2 tablespoons and inserting in their vagina to get rid of stubborn yeast infections that no prescription drug would get rid of. Also kills staph infections (along with sulpher soap) but may still need antibiotics to get rid of staph.. My main use will be for treating bites and gashes from the coming democrat zombies in the near future of the continued downfall of America,..just telling the truth.</li>
            <li> Great Product with healing qualities.  Easy to use...just apply with a q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time and can be used on animal sores.</li>
            <li> This was actually prescribed for my by a doctor. I have a fingernail that becomes infected as a result of a stupid  nurse injuring this finger while trying to take my blood sugar. Had surgery by this doctor and removed the nail which took care of the problem but it has flared up again 18 months later. Prompt mailing. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Used for a yeast infection that I&#x27;d been fighting since a heavy dose of antibiotics.  The purple stain goes away over a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a fungus in both ears for over 10 years this product helps control it. If it gets on the pillow cases just pour some alcohol on the case then put in washing machine on hot water, it will come out.</li>
            <li> Most people today do not know about this excellent fungicide and antibacterial solution. This product will stain everything so be careful. Make sure you let it dry completely or it will stain clothing or other parts of your body. The stain on your skin will go away eventually and lightens with washing so don&#x27;t worry. My parents used this for everything and also for mouth sores and thrush. I bought this for ringworm and this combined with neem oil, tea tree oil, MD cream, and EXTREME CLEANLINESS which finally completely resolved it. I do believe the gentian violet helped tremendously as it dried it out.  It takes awhile to get rid of ringworm so don&#x27;t stop using it right away, even if it looks clear it can reactivate. Check body regularly even after the &amp;#34;ring&amp;#34; goes away as a small spore could have traveled onto something and it could reactivate.  Wash bedding, sheets and towels. I used heavy duty paper towels instead of towels when the fungus was active. Be careful not to touch pets with the infected areas as it could  contaminate to your pet and it is very difficult to get rid of.  I am not sure if this could be used on pets but I think it is okay but it is best to check with a pharmacist or vet before using.</li>
            <li> This gentian violet is perfection in combating a fungi infection on skin.</li>
            <li> Old time remedy that I used as a kid. WEAR GLOVES and cover any surfaces that you don&#x27;t want to turn PURPLE.</li>
            <li> Effective product for healing wounds.</li>
            <li> Magic stuff for drying out abrasions and sores without using band-aids - have used it on our kids for 27 years, presently treating a sore on the dog.  Great for healing cancre sores, diaper rash and any smaller open wounds,  Needs to air dry and does stain but will eventually wash out of clothing and off body parts! LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Gentian violet is hard to find.  Treats oral thrush quickly and effectively where nothing else I&#x27;ve tried, even prescription drugs, works as well.  Glad I found it</li>
            <li> Good product does what it is suppose to do. Just be careful as it does stain. I would buy it again</li>
            <li> I use this to clean the spaniels ears.  it works wonders to keep her comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I do buy this all the time.</li>
            <li> i use it for various things love it</li>
            <li> it is what it says. I use it for a mixture i make for my dog. I dont know what else to say about it.</li>
            <li> Product will be used to treat thrush in horses. Glad the option of 2 ounce bottles was available for purchase.</li>
            <li> Worked great for getting if yeast on nipples!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing in the world. So glad I found it. This cures everything. From cuts to fungus</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell how well it worked - there were extenuating circumstances the few times I used it, but just a warning that it stains like MAD. Some of my clothes are permanently stained purple despite extensive washing/soaking/etc.</li>
            <li> This product is an old time remedy for the treatment of ringworm. It relatively inexpensive and works very well. Modern medicines cost more and are not as effective. The drawback is the staining potential if not careful. The staining on the infected area is useful to know you&#x27;ve gotten the medicine to the affected area and the stain disappears in a few days. However, if you get it on your clothing or other things, it is difficult to clean up.(I use disposable latex gloves) Product was delivered very fast and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It was suggested to me to try this dye for an infection on my cuticle called PARONYCHIA.  The instructions say not to bandage the area.  The dye is deep violet and gets on everything and it cannot be removed.  I have not used it in over 2 weeks and my fingers are still deep violet.</li>
            <li> My son has thrush, and after reading all the positive reviews of gentian violet I decided to try it. It is very messy and it didn&#x27;t help his thrush at all. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought this as something i read on the internet to help cure a nail yeast infection. It is what it is. PURPLE! I stopped using it after one use because it stained my nail purple and took a week to go away. I&#x27;ll never know if it was helpful in getting rid of the infection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to comment on the effectiveness of the product because I only used it once on my finger nail.  It stained my nail so much it looked worse then the infection.  I suppose I should give it a chance, but it&#x27;s hard to walk around with a dark purple nail and explain it to people who ask!  If you want to try it just be aware that it really stains!</li>
            <li> Hard to find in Drug stores it is still an excellent product</li>
            <li> I purchased this to see if I can clear up my Cocker Spaniels chronic ear infection..  After I mix it with alcohol and boric acid I swab her ears out with it.  I find it only stains when it is undiluted.  Her ears are better but not cured, she is showing relief and for that we are both happy.  I believe if i continue the cleaning routine faithfully she will only improve.</li>
            <li> Doctors have a hard time recommending it and it will stain everything in your house permanently but it does work when the alternatives made my kids puke everywhere and were probably just as toxic or worse. You decide.</li>
            <li> Stained my mouth. Did not help the candida.</li>
            <li> I used this on my dog who had a little staph infection.  It took a few applications but resolved the infection.  This product was a great find on Amazon.</li>
