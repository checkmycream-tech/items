            <li>&lt;br /&gt;After the FIRST nights application</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m interested to see whether the collagen production this stuff is supposed to encourage</li>
            <li>One jar is good for few months.</li>
            <li>Great for moisturizing my dry, dry skin.</li>
            <li>I think I need a little more for my &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; face!</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t tell if I had it on or not.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I am going to give this product away because on my skin, it is very drying to my face.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make me breakout, so that was a plus, but I didn&#x27;t really see any benefit from using it either.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t greasy and did not have much of a smell.  </li>

            <li>Nice night cream, helps keep me moisturized without the heavy oily feel.  </li>
            <li>but I have used other products that have done a better job for the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff religiously and it has made a tremendous difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that the quality of my skin had completely evened out -</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff religiously and it has made a tremendous difference in my skin.  I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> Everything in this brand is great!  It hasn&#x27;t been that long since the purchase, but so far I really like the products.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping, goes on nicely</li>
            <li> NOT greasy.  Feels great on my skin and provides excellent moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> Nice night cream, helps keep me moisturized without the heavy oily feel.  Never clogs the pores.  No smell.  I have lightly oily but sensitive skin and this works well for me!</li>
            <li> Great product, great service</li>
            <li> I like the product very much.  I will purchase it again.  I knew of this product through a good estatician.</li>
            <li> This night cream did not moisturize my face at all.  I really couldn&#x27;t tell if I had it on or not.  Some may like that feature but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed with this Revision Restorative Night Cream. I purchased it because the seller did not have the Revision Firming Night Cream, which I have been using for years, and like very much. I so wish I had not purchased it and will not purchase it again. In fact, I am going to give this product away because on my skin, it is very drying to my face.</li>
            <li> THIS CREAM IS GREAT, IT TIGHTENS AND LIFTS THE SKIN&lt;br /&gt;AS WELL AS HYDRATES IT.&lt;br /&gt;MY SKIN IS SMOOTH AND SOFT AND TONED.</li>
            <li> Whether or not it actually does anything, I don&#x27;t know.  But it feels great!  Not oily and feels so cool going on.</li>
            <li> This is the second jar of this cream I have purchased.  The first one was from the dermatologist at about $20 more.  It makes your skin feel and look great and is not too oily.  Helps make fine lines not as visible.</li>
            <li> Great for moisturizing my dry, dry skin. This is not perfumed so it doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies. It isn&#x27;t greasy. This is just great, moisture rich cream that makes your skin look and feel great!</li>
            <li> Perfectly acceptable night cream. Didn&#x27;t make me breakout, so that was a plus, but I didn&#x27;t really see any benefit from using it either.</li>
            <li> I like this product. Has helped improve skin texture. Like thatvit comes in a jar vs a squeeze tube orvoumpbbottle.  Again I think the product is c a bit I ver priced.</li>
            <li> I usually get this product at a spa, which is more expensive and they don&#x27;t always have it in stock which can be very disappointing in both aspects. Now that I know I can order it on Amazon at a cheaper rate and when I need it makes a lot more sense to me. I would give this five stars for price, convenience and it is the same product I always use.</li>
            <li> Allergic reaction...swelling and redness appeared on the second morning. Not sure of the causative ingredient. Definitely the night cream and nectafirm.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry skin</li>
            <li> I have been using the tinted moisturizer for years from Revision.  Actually bought it in a dermatologist office and loved it but found much better prices on Amazon.  Went I went to replenish I saw this item and one other from the revision line.  I haven&#x27;t been impressed with this.  It is very light weight almost like putting lotion on your face.  I expected it to be heavier as a night cream.  I bought it to moisturize dry winter skin it does alright but I have used other products that have done a better job for the money.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t care for this cream. It wasn&#x27;t greasy and did not have much of a smell.  I just didn&#x27;t notice much difference in the morning in softness of my skin.  I think I have better luck with the Philosophy brand.</li>
            <li> The label rubbed off and the product is a cheap imitation of what I&#x27;ve previously purchased else where!  Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Expensive but my facialist says it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have only used the night cream for one month and it is ok.  My face does feel well moisturized when I wake up.  I am not sure if I will continue with this cream or switch to the Firming Night Cream.  I think I need a little more for my &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; face!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some time now.  I try other ones but seem to always go back to this one.  It&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream the past year. One jar is good for few months. Texture is perfect for my dry skin. Pleasure to look at myself in a mirror in a morning</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Revision&#x27;s brightening face wash and that stuff is awesome so when I went in search of a night cream, I decided to try one from the same brand.  I&#x27;ve been battling adult acne for some years and my face is a mess - oily here, dry and flaky there...&lt;br /&gt;After the FIRST nights application I noticed that the quality of my skin had completely evened out - the flaky skin was much less so and the oiliness I usually wake up with was also much less pronounced.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week now but I&#x27;m interested to see whether the collagen production this stuff is supposed to encourage will halp with my acne scars.  Will update after about a month of use.</li>
            <li> My face broke out when I began using this product, so I stopped for a while.  I&#x27;ll try it again after the stress of the holiday&#x27;s is over</li>
    </ol>
