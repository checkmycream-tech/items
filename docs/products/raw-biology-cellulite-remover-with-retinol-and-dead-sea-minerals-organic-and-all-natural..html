            <li>I am loving this stuff already.</li>
            <li>I received this product as part of a promotion in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>Cellulite remover can be an effective cream to use on those troublesome areas of the body.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>I waited to do these types of reviews so that I can give an honest opinion.</li>
            <li>Bottles are a nice size.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products claiming to remove or smooth out cellulite dimples any nothing works as good as this product!</li>
            <li>This cellulite remover will be your butt and thighs new best friend!!  </li>
            <li>I am happy with this product and will continue to use it to see tremendous results.</li>
            <li>Wanted to wait till I used all the product to make sure I gave an honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found so far for cellulite.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most effective cream I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used just about every lotion and homemade potions on the internet, this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>It feesl nice to touch - not sticky and has a very, very mild nice scent.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my skin as well.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying the roller and some vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t like most diet&#x27;s, supplements, or any of that.</li>
            <li>Definitely better then just diet and exercise alone.</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t wait for summer to show off my legs :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this product on sale.</li>
            <li>For better result you need to do some excersises and massage</li>
            <li>It has more of a gel consistency.  </li>
            <li>After I gave birth to my lovely daughter, i started to notice my cellulite.</li>
            <li>My skin is now smoother, tighter and contoured and looks like better then ever.</li>
            <li>I think I need to give it more time.</li>
            <li>As ladies we know cellulite can be the most unflattering thing</li>
            <li>I battle cellulite and have tried so many products to no avail.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I use the retinol cellulite remover for my love handles and it has tightened and smoothed my cottage cheese exponentially.</li>
            <li>So many creams and serums tend to overwhelm you with the added fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is temporarily refreshing.  </li>
            <li>so I have to order more</li>
            <li>it went on nice and smooth the area it was applied</li>
            <li>I LOVE using serums instead of creams because they go deeper into the skin</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I used it as instructed , go to the gym , drink a gallon of water a day and eat healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using cellulite products for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have been equally pleased.  </li>
            <li>This is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Also love that its organic.</li>
            <li>I will continue using for those great results at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>I know from my doctor and skin care professionals that it is more genetic than anything else.  </li>
            <li>and I like it better.</li>
            <li>It caught me by surprise after the first week of using it!!!</li>
            <li>I cant wait to see the results as I use this longer if it keeps repairing my skin at this rate, soooo excited!</li>
            <li>Best Product I have tried in a very long time.</li>
            <li>The results are really nice and quick</li>
            <li>I could not recommend it more strongly.</li>
            <li>The fine detailed bumps that I used to See Are gone!</li>
            <li>but so far I am loving the feeling and think I&#x27;ll love even more one I purchase a massager!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten great results so far.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much of this product and the bottles are a good size</li>
            <li>I love this stuff it really works!!!</li>
            <li>It is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>The results were very quick.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this is a clean product by most standards and doesn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;aqua&amp;#34; in it.  </li>
            <li>the more you glow from the inside which i find so true</li>
            <li>Not bad, I can see a difference, but the cellulite creams with retinol in them work much better.</li>
            <li>It did nothing to remove fine lines or their appearance.  </li>
            <li>It looks and seems to be just fine</li>
            <li>but it is very encouraging to work out to stay fit!!</li>
            <li>The steps are easy to follow, the product amount is great, especially for the price, and it doesn&#x27;t have an unattractive smell/medical smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it will buy more Thanks for making this wonderful product this is unbelievable</li>
            <li>Truly feel and see a huge difference</li>
            <li>and I already see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>its not working yet but its only been 3 weeks LOL</li>
            <li>Makes my legs smooth</li>
            <li>but this is a very cost effective way to boost your confidence.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>are really disappearing!!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited to test this product out.</li>
            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>Guys if you want to make the woman happy here&#x27;s the excuse you&#x27;ve been waiting for.</li>
            <li>I purchased this based on the reviews and I have to say I&#x27;m so glad I did the first application of this</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and no bad smell.</li>
            <li>Cellulite is lighten up and my skin is super smooth..</li>
            <li>With this product it really helped my skin, the skin where I used this looks much better</li>
            <li>It feels good to treat myself to something smelling so relaxing and at the same time knowing its helping fight</li>
            <li>Smells nice and made my skin soft but did nothing for cellulite.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it as directed for full effects.  </li>
            <li>I apply the cream at least once a day and am very happy.  </li>
            <li>well, The ingredients are not bad smelling when you apply .</li>
            <li>I will definetly continue to use this since the results really seem to get better and better as the days go on, i notice less and less cellulite and dimples, and its actually a great motivator to get me moving on my own too!</li>
            <li>It does work and it would probably work better if I used it more religiously.</li>
            <li>the scent is mild and fragrant.</li>
            <li>You know they say the more confident you feel outside</li>
            <li>Plus who cant love a natural, cruelty free product?</li>
            <li>Quick delivery but</li>
            <li>when I first put it on I could feel a tightening sensation and my legs looked smooth.</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast!</li>
            <li>It really feels great when the skin is firmer than earlier which looks far better now.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li>I saw results after just the first use!</li>
            <li>I cannot wait to see the results after several more months!</li>
            <li>My husband and I noticed a difference the first day!</li>
            <li>But it does smell good and is not sticky when dry and leaves the skin feeling smoother!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait till tonight when I get to see this product in action, also they send you a pamphlet on how to keep your cellulite away and how to help the product work better</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this product is natural and organic.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s natural and organic which is even better.</li>
            <li>After about a week of using, my skin feels soooo soft and it looks smooth now!</li>
            <li>But now this has made them more sensitive to contouring in all my workouts.</li>
            <li>My girl friend was too embarrassed to right a review</li>
            <li>I do it right after my shower in the morning and evening</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive my new products!  </li>
            <li>been using this for a little more than a month, mostly 2x a day-morning and night.</li>
            <li>I have used many different Cellulite creams in the past, and this by far is the best smelling.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to give this a try and can not say for certain this worked for me because i didn&#x27;t use it faithfully as instructed!</li>
            <li>when ever I know I will be showing off my legs and the retinol is really good at regenerating skin which means your stretch mark scars will also fade slightly.</li>
            <li>First I apply the serum in the required area and just message it gently, it dries up quickly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll do the same for you.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>You will see better result when you exfoliate your skin prior as well.</li>
            <li>Well after about three weeks of first trying the cellulite remover, she noticed an immediate difference.</li>
            <li>I tried many products but none gave me the proper results.</li>
            <li>This is the first anti-cellulite product I have used.</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because it doesn&#x27;t smell funky like most cellulite lotions, but that&#x27;s about the only benefit.</li>
            <li>Still using my first set.</li>
            <li>I have been using this on my thighs, and it really is working!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the serum and gel and would never dare to wear a bikini before massaging this onto my entire body.</li>
            <li>it does exactly as it should</li>
            <li>so when I saw this product I was willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>i started using it couple of days ago so hopefully by my 2nd week i&#x27;m able to see a difference</li>
            <li>I would return it but the postal fee will probably be more than what I&#x27;ll get back.</li>
            <li>The only thing is got for sure is the cinnamon oil that you can smell.</li>
            <li>but i can say that I would definitely pay more.  </li>
            <li>Very excited to see results &amp; will update later.</li>
            <li>Very quick I realised my legs looks much better, cellulite looks less intense.</li>
            <li>But It really helped stain away the cellulite from my ass and my  inner thighs that was showing the most.</li>
            <li>The product is extremely easy to use, just apply the first product then apply the 2nd cream</li>
            <li>I used the first set probably less sparingly than I should have because I loved the effect it had in my skin, my thighs each have lost an inch in circumference and the dimpling that I had on the backs of my thighs are almost completely GONE not to mention they are much firmer.</li>
            <li>I can say that your skin certainly feels softer after applying the products.  </li>
            <li>Its only been 3 days but so far it feels like an amazing product my skin feels very smooth and firm.</li>
            <li>I give this product 5stars and a great review its so hard to actually find something worth purchasing again and again</li>
            <li>I am grateful this product exists because It helped me out so much.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this to anyone who is really looking for something to work.</li>
            <li>No matter how much i worked out, it would not go away.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect to see any difference but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It really seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>I really wish I had taken before and after pictures.</li>
            <li>After gaining so much weight I have noticed cellulite and dimpling around my butt, and thighs.</li>
            <li>now I have a very noticeable difference in my leg area and have just started on my stomach.</li>
            <li>now I&#x27;m even happier, my wife wants me tho rub the cellulite product on her.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely can see it.</li>
            <li>I have high hope for this line, hence my 5 stars!</li>
            <li>Really works and</li>
            <li>I received this product at a discounted rate (not free) for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Following a great experience with the Vitamin C Serum, Hyaluronic Acid and Retinol three pack from Raw Biology</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited about what it will do over the next month!!!!</li>
            <li>I recommend the cellulite product from raw biology for any women or man that is looking for rapid and highly effective results at unbeatable value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely making my legs look good already and for less than 20 bucks you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li>There not expensive and there all natural.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin on my thighs feel tighter too, less jiggle more firmness.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t have not even half the things it should.</li>
            <li>With aging my skin became older and I found some cellulite on my legs.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product - the results are such that It is now part of my daily routine!</li>
            <li>This particular product seems to be working well for me.  </li>
            <li>I immediately saw a difference, however I do only have mild cellulite</li>
            <li>I am confident with daily use they will improve and finally disappear.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love this product I&#x27;ve been using it a little over a week</li>
            <li>Have begun my new skin care regiment and cannot wait to unleash the new me!  </li>
            <li>This all natural cellulite remover and dimple filler are the real deal.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how fast it arrived.</li>
            <li>These products have done more for my skin in a few months</li>
            <li>Even though I don&#x27;t usually leave a review for cellulite cream, this remover is good enough to go out on a limb for.</li>
            <li>New update.  </li>
            <li>The products smell very natural and &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; .  </li>
            <li>Good so far, but have only used it a couple of days - so hard to say if any results.</li>
            <li>at whatt i consider a pretty young age (mid 20s).</li>
            <li>Been using for a week now, my cellulite  have smooth a little.  </li>
            <li>I love all the Raw Biology products!</li>
            <li>Well whatever it is her skin is smoother and even I can clearly see the difference.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t order this product but it won&#x27;t clear from my list without an review.  </li>
            <li>I will continue using them to see how far they can take me.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend is quite self conscious about herself</li>
            <li>The natural and organic ingredients, i wasn&#x27;t worried that it would irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised but it works.</li>
            <li>I have been using a cellulite massager along with this product for a month and have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>My wife wanted me to purchase this for her to see how well it would work, just as a test and so far the results haven&#x27;t been mind-blowing</li>
            <li>She wants to continue to use it for the time-being but has expressed that for the price, it has been a relatively reliable product.</li>
            <li>and Im willing to try just about anything as long as it doesn&#x27;t harm me.  </li>
            <li>After my wife let me know she was feel self conscious</li>
            <li>I purchased this after seeing the reviews, and the deciding factor was because it is made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>, it makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li>and I love how my skin sucks the products in.</li>
            <li>super conscious about the way I look and in the past 2 years have noticed a build up of cellulite in certain areas of my body.  </li>
            <li>First off let me start by saying thankfully I was wrong, I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply tough, and absorbe fast with my skin.</li>
            <li>Nothing special - the bottles are very small - so the product goes very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I bought this product, I was not confident about it, but after using it and getting the super fast results, I have become a regular user of it.</li>
            <li>But I guess that is to be expected as its an organic product that I need to use over a large area.  </li>
            <li>I think for anyone - male or female - the key ingredients to looking good are maintaining an active lifestyle and using &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; cosmetics and the raw biology range meets those criteria.  </li>
            <li>The main brand products in stores are so much more expensive than what I can find from vendors on amazon or google.  </li>
            <li>Like the &#x27;Trinity&#x27; range, this product works over the course of several months and results are clearly visible - Smoother, tighter and firmer.....</li>
            <li>Anyway, these little beauties right here have made a difference already.</li>
            <li>If you are like me, and have tried many other similar products, you should try the Raw Biology product line and see for yourself.</li>
            <li>I have been using the raw biology product range for sometime with success</li>
            <li>I was unsure about the two step process at first, as I thought the serum would be slimy and messy, but</li>
            <li>I will b ordering more of this product!! :(</li>
            <li>My mom has used so many products - finally one that works without a bad skin reaction and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Instead of losing unintended weight in certain areas, she&#x27;s slowly getter her body back to what she used to look like back in high school.</li>

            <li> The serum smells nice and the gel smells like it has a job to do.</li>
            <li> I am loving this stuff already.</li>
            <li> I received this product as part of a promotion in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Cellulite remover can be an effective cream to use on those troublesome areas of the body.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> I waited to do these types of reviews so that I can give an honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Bottles are a nice size.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products claiming to remove or smooth out cellulite dimples any nothing works as good as this product!</li>
            <li> This cellulite remover will be your butt and thighs new best friend!!  </li>
            <li> I am happy with this product and will continue to use it to see tremendous results.</li>
            <li> Wanted to wait till I used all the product to make sure I gave an honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found so far for cellulite.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most effective cream I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used just about every lotion and homemade potions on the internet, this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> It feesl nice to touch - not sticky and has a very, very mild nice scent.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my skin as well.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off buying the roller and some vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t like most diet&#x27;s, supplements, or any of that.</li>
            <li> Definitely better then just diet and exercise alone.</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t wait for summer to show off my legs :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this product on sale.</li>
            <li> For better result you need to do some excersises and massage</li>
            <li> It has more of a gel consistency.  </li>
            <li> After I gave birth to my lovely daughter, i started to notice my cellulite.</li>
            <li> My skin is now smoother, tighter and contoured and looks like better then ever.</li>
            <li> I think I need to give it more time.</li>
            <li> As ladies we know cellulite can be the most unflattering thing</li>
            <li> I battle cellulite and have tried so many products to no avail.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I use the retinol cellulite remover for my love handles and it has tightened and smoothed my cottage cheese exponentially.</li>
            <li> So many creams and serums tend to overwhelm you with the added fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This is temporarily refreshing.  </li>
            <li> so I have to order more</li>
            <li> it went on nice and smooth the area it was applied</li>
            <li> I LOVE using serums instead of creams because they go deeper into the skin</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I used it as instructed , go to the gym , drink a gallon of water a day and eat healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cellulite products for many years.  </li>
            <li> I have been equally pleased.  </li>
            <li> This is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Also love that its organic.</li>
            <li> I will continue using for those great results at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I know from my doctor and skin care professionals that it is more genetic than anything else.  </li>
            <li> and I like it better.</li>
            <li> It caught me by surprise after the first week of using it!!!</li>
            <li> I cant wait to see the results as I use this longer if it keeps repairing my skin at this rate, soooo excited!</li>
            <li> Best Product I have tried in a very long time.</li>
            <li> The results are really nice and quick</li>
            <li> I could not recommend it more strongly.</li>
            <li> The fine detailed bumps that I used to See Are gone!</li>
            <li> but so far I am loving the feeling and think I&#x27;ll love even more one I purchase a massager!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten great results so far.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much of this product and the bottles are a good size</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it really works!!!</li>
            <li> It is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> The results were very quick.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this is a clean product by most standards and doesn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;aqua&amp;#34; in it.  </li>
            <li> the more you glow from the inside which i find so true</li>
            <li> Not bad, I can see a difference, but the cellulite creams with retinol in them work much better.</li>
            <li> It did nothing to remove fine lines or their appearance.  </li>
            <li> It looks and seems to be just fine</li>
            <li> but it is very encouraging to work out to stay fit!!</li>
            <li> The steps are easy to follow, the product amount is great, especially for the price, and it doesn&#x27;t have an unattractive smell/medical smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it will buy more Thanks for making this wonderful product this is unbelievable</li>
            <li> Truly feel and see a huge difference</li>
            <li> and I already see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> its not working yet but its only been 3 weeks LOL</li>
            <li> Makes my legs smooth</li>
            <li> but this is a very cost effective way to boost your confidence.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> are really disappearing!!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited to test this product out.</li>
            <li> Many thanks!</li>
            <li> Guys if you want to make the woman happy here&#x27;s the excuse you&#x27;ve been waiting for.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the reviews and I have to say I&#x27;m so glad I did the first application of this</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and no bad smell.</li>
            <li> Cellulite is lighten up and my skin is super smooth..</li>
            <li> With this product it really helped my skin, the skin where I used this looks much better</li>
            <li> It feels good to treat myself to something smelling so relaxing and at the same time knowing its helping fight</li>
            <li> Smells nice and made my skin soft but did nothing for cellulite.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it as directed for full effects.  </li>
            <li> I apply the cream at least once a day and am very happy.  </li>
            <li> well, The ingredients are not bad smelling when you apply .</li>
            <li> I will definetly continue to use this since the results really seem to get better and better as the days go on, i notice less and less cellulite and dimples, and its actually a great motivator to get me moving on my own too!</li>
            <li> It does work and it would probably work better if I used it more religiously.</li>
            <li> the scent is mild and fragrant.</li>
            <li> You know they say the more confident you feel outside</li>
            <li> Plus who cant love a natural, cruelty free product?</li>
            <li> Quick delivery but</li>
            <li> when I first put it on I could feel a tightening sensation and my legs looked smooth.</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast!</li>
            <li> It really feels great when the skin is firmer than earlier which looks far better now.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li> I saw results after just the first use!</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to see the results after several more months!</li>
            <li> My husband and I noticed a difference the first day!</li>
            <li> But it does smell good and is not sticky when dry and leaves the skin feeling smoother!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait till tonight when I get to see this product in action, also they send you a pamphlet on how to keep your cellulite away and how to help the product work better</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product is natural and organic.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s natural and organic which is even better.</li>
            <li> After about a week of using, my skin feels soooo soft and it looks smooth now!</li>
            <li> But now this has made them more sensitive to contouring in all my workouts.</li>
            <li> My girl friend was too embarrassed to right a review</li>
            <li> I do it right after my shower in the morning and evening</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my new products!  </li>
            <li> been using this for a little more than a month, mostly 2x a day-morning and night.</li>
            <li> I have used many different Cellulite creams in the past, and this by far is the best smelling.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a try and can not say for certain this worked for me because i didn&#x27;t use it faithfully as instructed!</li>
            <li> when ever I know I will be showing off my legs and the retinol is really good at regenerating skin which means your stretch mark scars will also fade slightly.</li>
            <li> First I apply the serum in the required area and just message it gently, it dries up quickly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll do the same for you.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> You will see better result when you exfoliate your skin prior as well.</li>
            <li> Well after about three weeks of first trying the cellulite remover, she noticed an immediate difference.</li>
            <li> I tried many products but none gave me the proper results.</li>
            <li> This is the first anti-cellulite product I have used.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because it doesn&#x27;t smell funky like most cellulite lotions, but that&#x27;s about the only benefit.</li>
            <li> Still using my first set.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my thighs, and it really is working!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the serum and gel and would never dare to wear a bikini before massaging this onto my entire body.</li>
            <li> it does exactly as it should</li>
            <li> so when I saw this product I was willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> i started using it couple of days ago so hopefully by my 2nd week i&#x27;m able to see a difference</li>
            <li> I would return it but the postal fee will probably be more than what I&#x27;ll get back.</li>
            <li> The only thing is got for sure is the cinnamon oil that you can smell.</li>
            <li> but i can say that I would definitely pay more.  </li>
            <li> Very excited to see results &amp; will update later.</li>
            <li> Very quick I realised my legs looks much better, cellulite looks less intense.</li>
            <li> But It really helped stain away the cellulite from my ass and my  inner thighs that was showing the most.</li>
            <li> The product is extremely easy to use, just apply the first product then apply the 2nd cream</li>
            <li> I used the first set probably less sparingly than I should have because I loved the effect it had in my skin, my thighs each have lost an inch in circumference and the dimpling that I had on the backs of my thighs are almost completely GONE not to mention they are much firmer.</li>
            <li> I can say that your skin certainly feels softer after applying the products.  </li>
            <li> Its only been 3 days but so far it feels like an amazing product my skin feels very smooth and firm.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5stars and a great review its so hard to actually find something worth purchasing again and again</li>
            <li> I am grateful this product exists because It helped me out so much.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to anyone who is really looking for something to work.</li>
            <li> No matter how much i worked out, it would not go away.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect to see any difference but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It really seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> I really wish I had taken before and after pictures.</li>
            <li> After gaining so much weight I have noticed cellulite and dimpling around my butt, and thighs.</li>
            <li> now I have a very noticeable difference in my leg area and have just started on my stomach.</li>
            <li> now I&#x27;m even happier, my wife wants me tho rub the cellulite product on her.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely can see it.</li>
            <li> I have high hope for this line, hence my 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Really works and</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discounted rate (not free) for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Following a great experience with the Vitamin C Serum, Hyaluronic Acid and Retinol three pack from Raw Biology</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited about what it will do over the next month!!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend the cellulite product from raw biology for any women or man that is looking for rapid and highly effective results at unbeatable value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely making my legs look good already and for less than 20 bucks you can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> There not expensive and there all natural.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin on my thighs feel tighter too, less jiggle more firmness.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t have not even half the things it should.</li>
            <li> With aging my skin became older and I found some cellulite on my legs.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product - the results are such that It is now part of my daily routine!</li>
            <li> This particular product seems to be working well for me.  </li>
            <li> I immediately saw a difference, however I do only have mild cellulite</li>
            <li> I am confident with daily use they will improve and finally disappear.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this product I&#x27;ve been using it a little over a week</li>
            <li> Have begun my new skin care regiment and cannot wait to unleash the new me!  </li>
            <li> This all natural cellulite remover and dimple filler are the real deal.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how fast it arrived.</li>
            <li> These products have done more for my skin in a few months</li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t usually leave a review for cellulite cream, this remover is good enough to go out on a limb for.</li>
            <li> New update.  </li>
            <li> The products smell very natural and &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; .  </li>
            <li> Good so far, but have only used it a couple of days - so hard to say if any results.</li>
            <li> at whatt i consider a pretty young age (mid 20s).</li>
            <li> Been using for a week now, my cellulite  have smooth a little.  </li>
            <li> I love all the Raw Biology products!</li>
            <li> Well whatever it is her skin is smoother and even I can clearly see the difference.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order this product but it won&#x27;t clear from my list without an review.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using them to see how far they can take me.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is quite self conscious about herself</li>
            <li> The natural and organic ingredients, i wasn&#x27;t worried that it would irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised but it works.</li>
            <li> I have been using a cellulite massager along with this product for a month and have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> My wife wanted me to purchase this for her to see how well it would work, just as a test and so far the results haven&#x27;t been mind-blowing</li>
            <li> She wants to continue to use it for the time-being but has expressed that for the price, it has been a relatively reliable product.</li>
            <li> and Im willing to try just about anything as long as it doesn&#x27;t harm me.  </li>
            <li> After my wife let me know she was feel self conscious</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing the reviews, and the deciding factor was because it is made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> , it makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> and I love how my skin sucks the products in.</li>
            <li> super conscious about the way I look and in the past 2 years have noticed a build up of cellulite in certain areas of my body.  </li>
            <li> First off let me start by saying thankfully I was wrong, I am completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply tough, and absorbe fast with my skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing special - the bottles are very small - so the product goes very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I bought this product, I was not confident about it, but after using it and getting the super fast results, I have become a regular user of it.</li>
            <li> But I guess that is to be expected as its an organic product that I need to use over a large area.  </li>
            <li> I think for anyone - male or female - the key ingredients to looking good are maintaining an active lifestyle and using &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; cosmetics and the raw biology range meets those criteria.  </li>
            <li> The main brand products in stores are so much more expensive than what I can find from vendors on amazon or google.  </li>
            <li> Like the &#x27;Trinity&#x27; range, this product works over the course of several months and results are clearly visible - Smoother, tighter and firmer.....</li>
            <li> Anyway, these little beauties right here have made a difference already.</li>
            <li> If you are like me, and have tried many other similar products, you should try the Raw Biology product line and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I have been using the raw biology product range for sometime with success</li>
            <li> I was unsure about the two step process at first, as I thought the serum would be slimy and messy, but</li>
            <li> I will b ordering more of this product!! :(</li>
            <li> My mom has used so many products - finally one that works without a bad skin reaction and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Instead of losing unintended weight in certain areas, she&#x27;s slowly getter her body back to what she used to look like back in high school.</li>
            <li> I also use it in my stomach and arms which were always such hard spots for toning and sculpting but my stomach is noticeably flatter and my arms are much firmer as well!</li>
            <li> One thing is that the product doesnt last long although the bottle size is quite generous.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give this product a try as a last attempt before going forward with more expensive treatment options!</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be helping a little bit.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week</li>
            <li> It really helps in hiding dimples and I can hardly see them now.</li>
            <li> iIm constantly trying to find ways to combat this and find that most products are somewhat gimmicky or/and expensive.  </li>
            <li> Ive been usin this product for less than a month!!The cellulite on my inner thigh area and mid area stretchmarks</li>
            <li> My product came 4 days earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I have not been using product for very long but have already seen difference in the appearance.</li>
            <li> I am very careful with my diet and work out regularly</li>
            <li> The Raw Biology line is made of natural and organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times because I recently received it</li>
            <li> I gave this product a shot and with the 100% satisfaction guarantee, what can i possibly loose but the cellulite.</li>
            <li> I have curves and I have several areas of cellulite to test this on - Hands down this product</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works long term!!  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks I really saw no difference - I am a thin person with very minimal issues - so I thought after reading the reviews I would see a big improvement - but no luck 😕</li>
            <li> I use this every night and dry brush every morning!</li>
            <li> Used product for 1 month as per directions on bottle and noted slight to moderate improvements.</li>
            <li> Skeptically at first because MANY things say they will work and just end up disappointing !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen dramatic results since my first round, I&#x27;m now going on my third bottle.</li>
            <li> am only 133 lbs thought this would help with a few cellulite</li>
            <li> This product works to remove cellulite, but te 2 step thing is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> It definitely tightens and my dimples become less and less visible as the hours go on.</li>
            <li> It definitely tightens and everything become less and less visible as the hours go on.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much raw biology, I&#x27;m thinking I might try your facial products as well!</li>
            <li> My skin looks supple and smooth and it works just like the expensive peels that I had done in the past.</li>
            <li> At least the derma roller actually took the cellulite away, although it left scars, my legs was not a bumpy mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit too time consuming to have to use 2 products - in fact 1 finished faster than the other.</li>
            <li> I regret being skeptical at first and not taking before</li>
            <li> It comes in a pack of two bottles; one containing serum and other gel.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Raw Biology!!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too  expensive and there is no instructions as to how much you should use</li>
            <li> Its something I don&#x27;t see slowing down</li>
            <li> My skin feel tight and I can see the cellulite on the back of my thigh slowly going away.</li>
            <li> Using with a natural body brush to push it in but after one week I can see a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> I can see less dimples already on my thighs</li>
            <li> The instructions say to exfoliate, I don&#x27;t every time, but when I do the area feels even tighter and looks even less dimply.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a week and a half now</li>
            <li> but I think I&#x27;ll return to my previous cream.</li>
            <li> and it feels less dimlping.</li>
            <li> I can see less cellulite  already on my thighs</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this ,I used it for a month it did nothing for me</li>
            <li> I feel I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I am noticing my cellulite disappear and the areas that were dimpling are now firm and even.</li>
            <li> Boo to thigh trouble-</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t feel so heavy.</li>
            <li> I also use the Raw Biology Retinol-a for my face.</li>
            <li> DONOT WASTE YOUR HARD EAEN CASHDo not be</li>
            <li> and after pictures in order to prove my point :/</li>
            <li> Have used endermologie in the past</li>
            <li> and it makes me so self concious to wear dresses that show thigh which is not okay</li>
            <li> Over the past month I have noticed a visible difference - where the appearance of cellulite and lines has been reduced.  </li>
            <li> My thighs are my trouble section!</li>
            <li> not sure if I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Minerals from the dead sea? !</li>
            <li> There is no better value product on the market in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Just as my wrinkles are beginning to disappear on my face - I have found that after 3 weeks I am starting to see a marked disappearance of ugly cellulite on my body!  </li>
            <li> I have serious problems with cell build up even though I work out everyday.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s plain salt people!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money because I assure you the only thing that is 100% is the 5 star reviews...100% fake!</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply, does not leave any nasty residue.</li>
            <li> At least for me it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> And I know its only going to get worse with age :(  </li>
            <li> Thought this product was gonna b a waste of my money!!!</li>
            <li> but I wanted to take care of it before it got worse and this is the product to get the job done there was no stinging or tingling</li>
            <li> This is the 3 rd product I tried for now and for now I&#x27;m not happy with it.</li>
            <li> And the dimples even look worse.</li>
            <li> What I value about the raw biology cellulite cream is that the majority of the ingredients are natural/organic and there isn&#x27;t a laundry list of artificial ingredients that I am unable to pronounce.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately my experience with the product did not produce results.</li>
            <li> Not good!!!</li>
            <li> some others have a really bad odor that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> so I cant speak for those who have bad</li>
            <li> I always wanted to get rid of the ugly cellulite.</li>
            <li> but she isn&#x27;t disappointed in it either.</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This cellulite remover+ is great. It really helps in hiding dimples and I can hardly see them now. If you&#x27;ve got issues with yourself I recommend getting this to try and improve. It&#x27;s helped me and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll do the same for you.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It does exactly what it says. It works every time and is simple to use. I love the way it feels on my skin as well. I am grateful this product exists because It helped me out so much. The results were magnificent.</li>
            <li> These products have done more for my skin in a few months then anything I have EVER purchased or been given. I am almost 50 and have struggled with acne prone skin all my life and now I&#x27;m dealing with it&#x27;s after effects. So please by all means give these products a try. There not expensive and there all natural. I&#x27;m about to re-order for myself and my daughters.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for 3 weeks with no results. I have been exfoliating before applying the product and tried wrapping. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> At least the derma roller actually took the cellulite away, although it left scars, my legs was not a bumpy mess.This stuff softens your legs but so does argan oil. You&#x27;re better off buying the roller and some vitamin C serum. Don&#x27;t waste your money because I assure you the only thing that is 100% is the 5 star reviews...100% fake! Have a blessed day!</li>
            <li> It did nothing to remove fine lines or their appearance.  I used it faithfully as instructed.</li>
            <li> The product looks just like the picture. The serum smells nice and the gel smells like it has a job to do. I can see less dimples already on my thighs so I just started using it on my stomach too. It definitely tightens and my dimples become less and less visible as the hours go on. I will continue using them to see how far they can take me. It&#x27;s motivating me to get back into the gym!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> It does work and it would probably work better if I used it more religiously. You will see better result when you exfoliate your skin prior as well.</li>
            <li> With aging my skin became older and I found some cellulite on my legs. This doesn&#x27;t look good and I didn&#x27;t want to go on swimming pool or wear shorts. My friend gave me advice to try this Cellulite remover. Very quick I realised my legs looks much better, cellulite looks less intense. I&#x27;ll wear shorts this summer like I&#x27;m a teenager again!</li>
            <li> I did not give a rating of 5 at this time, because I am still trying the items and am waiting to see what happens. I can say that your skin certainly feels softer after applying the products.  I believe you need to wrap the cellulite areas after applying the products or either use a cellulite brush to help loosen the cellulite.  There are several things to be considered.  I am going to continue trying the products.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products claiming to remove or smooth out cellulite dimples any nothing works as good as this product! I have only been using it a short time and already see a big difference.</li>
            <li> I must say, this has exceeded my expectations! I have seen the appearance of cellulite on my front and back thighs disappearing! I use this every night and dry brush every morning!</li>
            <li> Nothing special - the bottles are very small - so the product goes very fast.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit too time consuming to have to use 2 products - in fact 1 finished faster than the other. After 2 weeks I really saw no difference - I am a thin person with very minimal issues - so I thought after reading the reviews I would see a big improvement - but no luck 😕</li>
            <li> I decided to give this product a try as a last attempt before going forward with more expensive treatment options! I&#x27;ve seen dramatic results since my first round, I&#x27;m now going on my third bottle. I absolutely love this product - the results are such that It is now part of my daily routine! I regret being skeptical at first and not taking before and after pictures in order to prove my point :/</li>
            <li> Easy to use and feels great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s claims have not been proven for me. Need to return .</li>
            <li> I think it actually works. Would have given 5 stars but it&#x27;s too  expensive and there is no instructions as to how much you should use</li>
            <li> A friend suggested this product and I&#x27;m very happy she did.  I had remarkable ressults in about 10 days, I&#x27;m a believer and recommend this amazing product to my friends.  I also use the Trinity facial products by this company with gret results as well. I hope my experience help others decide to go with them to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeanne P</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is quite self conscious about herself and I&#x27;ve even talked to her about it but she insisted still, so I just sat back and let her do what she felt she wanted. Well after about three weeks of first trying the cellulite remover, she noticed an immediate difference. It wasn&#x27;t like most diet&#x27;s, supplements, or any of that. Instead of losing unintended weight in certain areas, she&#x27;s slowly getter her body back to what she used to look like back in high school. Definitely better then just diet and exercise alone.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to get rid of the ugly cellulite. I tried many products but none gave me the proper results. When I bought this product, I was not confident about it, but after using it and getting the super fast results, I have become a regular user of it. It really feels great when the skin is firmer than earlier which looks far better now.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this ,I used it for a month it did nothing for me</li>
            <li> This is the first anti-cellulite product I have used. It is really easy to use. It comes in a pack of two bottles; one containing serum and other gel. First I apply the serum in the required area and just message it gently, it dries up quickly. Then I apply the gel in that place and do the same as in case of serum. I have not got any side effects instead I received amazing results.</li>
            <li> Followed the instructions, but didn&#x27;t work for me. Customer Service was great but unfortunately my experience with the product did not produce results.</li>
            <li> Using with a 2.5 derma roller on my legs for 1 month. Truly feel and see a huge difference</li>
            <li> been using this for a little more than a month, mostly 2x a day-morning and night. I have not noticed improvement. I feel I wasted my money. And the 2 step process is a time waster.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it really works!!! Now I can&#x27;t wait for summer to show off my legs :)</li>
            <li> My girl friend was too embarrassed to right a review but she started using this and within a fortnight I noticed a great reduction, she continues to use it and her legs and bum appear a much more toned/tighter than before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still awaiting the results specified; too soon to say yea or nay!</li>
            <li> This is a great skin product, I had cellulite build ups on my legs and stomach that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of for the longest time. With this product it really helped my skin, the skin where I used this looks much better and it hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years. The product is extremely easy to use, just apply the first product then apply the 2nd cream and that&#x27;s it. The results were very quick.</li>
            <li> ;Works like a charm, faster than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. I love this stuff and can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li> My product came 4 days earlier than expected! Can&#x27;t wait to try this product out and from the reviews I have read it seems it works! Can&#x27;t wait till tonight when I get to see this product in action, also they send you a pamphlet on how to keep your cellulite away and how to help the product work better so that&#x27;s a plus! Thank you so much raw biology, I&#x27;m thinking I might try your facial products as well!</li>
            <li> This cellulite remover and retinol have worked.  My boyfriend noticed a difference I my legs in 2 weeks.  I have noticed it also.  I will continue to use this product.  It works to tighten skin  and reduce cellulite.</li>
            <li> This is some good stuff I feel the righting i n my legs I&#x27;m loving it will buy more Thanks for making this wonderful product this is unbelievable I finally found something to get rid of my cellulite Yaaaaay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this product on sale. I noticed zero difference using the product. I would not recommend this to anyone who is really looking for something to work. I gave it two stars because it doesn&#x27;t smell funky like most cellulite lotions, but that&#x27;s about the only benefit.</li>
            <li> Still using my first set. Skin becomes silky. For better result you need to do some excersises and massage</li>
            <li> I have used many different Cellulite creams in the past, and this by far is the best smelling.  I was unsure about the two step process at first, as I thought the serum would be slimy and messy, but it it was not at all.  It has more of a gel consistency.  The products smell very natural and &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; .  I have been using this on my thighs, and it really is working!  I have only been using it once a day, and am already seeing results!  I definately reccomend this cream to anyone looking for an at home spa like solution to their cellulite.  It feels good to treat myself to something smelling so relaxing and at the same time knowing its helping fight my cellulite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li> its not working yet but its only been 3 weeks LOL</li>
            <li> A friend gave me some for a gift! I absolutely loved it !!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product is natural and organic. I do have quite a bit of dimpling and cellulite on my inner thighs and and I&#x27;m excited to test this product out. The steps are easy to follow, the product amount is great, especially for the price, and it doesn&#x27;t have an unattractive smell/medical smell.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times because I recently received it but so far I am loving the feeling and think I&#x27;ll love even more one I purchase a massager!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the serum and gel and would never dare to wear a bikini before massaging this onto my entire body. The instructions say to exfoliate, I don&#x27;t every time, but when I do the area feels even tighter and looks even less dimply.</li>
            <li> After I gave birth to my lovely daughter, i started to notice my cellulite. It was awful. No matter how much i worked out, it would not go away. I gave this product a shot and with the 100% satisfaction guarantee, what can i possibly loose but the cellulite. It has made my dimples shrink. My skin is now smoother, tighter and contoured and looks like better then ever. The natural and organic ingredients, i wasn&#x27;t worried that it would irritate my skin. the scent is mild and fragrant. I apply this religiously and work out and it has made a world of difference.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any results.  Makes my legs smooth that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Almost done... I love it!!</li>
            <li> This works! I&#x27;m surprised but it works. Using with a natural body brush to push it in but after one week I can see a dramatic difference. My cellulite was just starting to appear so I can only speak for myself but I&#x27;m very very happy with this.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I see a big different in my skin. I will br buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of my cellulite, so I bought this last month. I have not seen a difference at all. I am putting the creams on twice a day. I&#x27;ve also been working out. I have lost weight, but still have cellulite. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect to see any difference but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It really seems to be working.  I really wish I had taken before and after pictures.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be helping a little bit.  I think I need to give it more time.</li>
            <li> Cellulite is still there.</li>
            <li> I have been using a cellulite massager along with this product for a month and have been pleasantly surprised.  I reserved writing a review until I was convinced it had actually made a difference and it has.  Have used endermologie in the past but this is a very cost effective way to boost your confidence.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and made my skin soft but did nothing for cellulite.</li>
            <li> great product. I tried it and it was very effective the product didn&#x27;t smell at all like some others have a really bad odor that I don&#x27;t like. But It really helped stain away the cellulite from my ass and my  inner thighs that was showing the most. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted me to purchase this for her to see how well it would work, just as a test and so far the results haven&#x27;t been mind-blowing but she isn&#x27;t disappointed in it either. She wants to continue to use it for the time-being but has expressed that for the price, it has been a relatively reliable product.</li>
            <li> Wanted to wait till I used all the product to make sure I gave an honest opinion.  This stuff didn&#x27;t&#x27; work at all.</li>
            <li> Used product for 1 month as per directions on bottle and noted slight to moderate improvements. Wish to continue for another month but currently unavailable.</li>
            <li> Great products, great price, great service! Many thanks!</li>
            <li> This 2 powerhouse cellulite remover is the best thing that happen to me! After gaining so much weight I have noticed cellulite and dimpling around my butt, and thighs. I haven&#x27;t worn a swimsuit because of the cellulite, I have been using all sorts of treatments trying to get rid of the cellulite spending tons of money and nothing worked. As soon as I was giving up I found these 2 miracle in a bottle! They are easy to apply, does not leave any nasty residue. I am noticing my cellulite disappear and the areas that were dimpling are now firm and even. I am so happy and planning a trip to the beach this summer and I will be wearing a swimsuit with confidence!</li>
            <li> There is no such thing as a miracle cream so you have to give it some time.  I have been using it for 6 weeks now I have a very noticeable difference in my leg area and have just started on my stomach. I would defiantly recommend this product to others and in fact I already have!!&lt;br /&gt;not only does it work but it is very encouraging to work out to stay fit!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any changes at ALL!  After eating properly, drinking plenty of water and exercising, this stuff still didn&#x27;t go anything for me.  I did not miss a day and followed directions to the &amp;#34;tee&amp;#34; yet there was no change.</li>
            <li> New update.  My daughter is in med school. She took the time to explain the properties of the product. Now I know why it melts the cellulite&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I&#x27;m even happier, my wife wants me tho rub the cellulite product on her. Now nothing beats that! Guys if you want to make the woman happy here&#x27;s the excuse you&#x27;ve been waiting for. So my question is how does this stuff work? Is it melting the fat cells??? Well whatever it is her skin is smoother and even I can clearly see the difference. My daughter isn&#x27;t using this because her legs are rocksolid. But my wife was wearing some shorts and kept saying can you see the difference, can you see the difference! She loves it and I absolutely can see it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is freakn awesome!!! Ive been usin this product for less than a month!!The cellulite on my inner thigh area and mid area stretchmarks are really disappearing!!! Thought this product was gonna b a waste of my money!!! It caught me by surprise after the first week of using it!!! Very pleased and happy!!! I will b ordering more of this product!! :( Uugghhhh!!!Wish the bottles were bigger!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me I saw no results..</li>
            <li> I am loving this stuff already. As ladies we know cellulite can be the most unflattering thing and it makes me so self concious to wear dresses that show thigh which is not okay at whatt i consider a pretty young age (mid 20s). Anyway, these little beauties right here have made a difference already. It makes my skin on my thighs feel tighter too, less jiggle more firmness. I will definetly continue to use this since the results really seem to get better and better as the days go on, i notice less and less cellulite and dimples, and its actually a great motivator to get me moving on my own too! You know they say the more confident you feel outside the more you glow from the inside which i find so true anytime i come across a total gem like this serum. I would definetly reccomend this to anyone reading or batteling with cellulite like I do. Theres no need for the embarassment when theres a cure. Plus who cant love a natural, cruelty free product? Dont miss out on this!</li>
            <li> Great Product! I saw results after just the first use! I have cellulite on the back of my upper legs and it always makes me self-conscious. This product works wonders! I can&#x27;t wait to see how much more of a difference I see after weeks of using! I received this product at a discounted rate (not free) for my honest, unbiased review. I love it! I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Will order again!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! I just got it and I already like it omg I am def gonna buy more!</li>
            <li> so I bought this product,.. Skeptically at first because MANY things say they will work and just end up disappointing !!! First off let me start by saying thankfully I was wrong, I am completely satisfied with this product. I used the first set probably less sparingly than I should have because I loved the effect it had in my skin, my thighs each have lost an inch in circumference and the dimpling that I had on the backs of my thighs are almost completely GONE not to mention they are much firmer. I also use it in my stomach and arms which were always such hard spots for toning and sculpting but my stomach is noticeably flatter and my arms are much firmer as well! I give this product 5stars and a great review its so hard to actually find something worth purchasing again and again and it&#x27;s natural and organic which is even better. Lastly I am a nursing student and have done extensive research on the ingredients and (that&#x27;s why I bought it) I&#x27;m proud to say, it does exactly as it should and that&#x27;s what matters most !!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  I&#x27;ve only been using it a week and I already see a huge difference.  I love all the Raw Biology products!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mom after a friend recommended it.  The speed in which I visibly saw the difference was incredible.  My mom has used so many products - finally one that works without a bad skin reaction and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to receive this product will post before &amp; after picture. To show you all if you will waist your money or not 😊</li>
            <li> I have not been using product for very long but have already seen difference in the appearance. I am hoping will continue to improve....</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Very nice on the skin! After about a week of using, my skin feels soooo soft and it looks smooth now! My thighs do not have the lumpy appearance that has been haunting me since I had kids! I cant wait to see the results as I use this longer if it keeps repairing my skin at this rate, soooo excited!</li>
            <li> Im writing this product as a guy who fully admits to having a cellulite problem.  Im super conscious about the way I look and in the past 2 years have noticed a build up of cellulite in certain areas of my body.  Its something I don&#x27;t see slowing down and Im willing to try just about anything as long as it doesn&#x27;t harm me.  I have been using the raw biology product range for sometime with success so when I saw this product I was willing to give it a try.  I like the fact that this is a clean product by most standards and doesn&#x27;t have any &amp;#34;aqua&amp;#34; in it.  Over the past month I have noticed a visible difference - where the appearance of cellulite and lines has been reduced.  I think for anyone - male or female - the key ingredients to looking good are maintaining an active lifestyle and using &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; cosmetics and the raw biology range meets those criteria.  I shall be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my new products!  I battle cellulite and have tried so many products to no avail.  The Raw Biology line is made of natural and organic ingredients.  Have begun my new skin care regiment and cannot wait to unleash the new me!  Thanks, Raw Biology!!!</li>
            <li> My thighs are my trouble section! Boo to thigh trouble- I know you guys know what i&#x27;m talking about. Everything I do, no matter what I do, those guys never get smaller. But now this has made them more sensitive to contouring in all my workouts. I work out twice daily and I apply this twice a day post work out. My skin looks supple and smooth and it works just like the expensive peels that I had done in the past. The fine detailed bumps that I used to See Are gone! Love this product.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week and I love it!  I use it along with a cellulite massager twice daily and have seen noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Not bad, I can see a difference, but the cellulite creams with retinol in them work much better. I would take a look at the skingenixx cream [[ASIN:B00VSDVDH2 Skingenixx Anti-Cellulite Toning and Slimming Cream]] and give that a try instead.</li>
            <li> After my wife let me know she was feel self conscious I instantly bought her this product! The results we&#x27;re amazing, now she is confident and loves to show off! Would recommend this to anyone who has the same occurrence or feeling.</li>
            <li> DONOT WASTE YOUR HARD EAEN CASHDo not be fool product don&#x27;t work I have use this for 30 days with no results am only 133 lbs thought this would help with a few cellulite also I contact the seller and got no respond</li>
            <li> Nothing works on cellulite ... nothing.. it takes a good diet and exercise... I have done my last fad..</li>
            <li> Feels great on y skin. I started applying twice a day instead of once and I see a big difference!</li>
            <li> I use the retinol cellulite remover for my love handles and it has tightened and smoothed my cottage cheese exponentially. I also use the Raw Biology Retinol-a for my face. I am a big believer in vitamin a and what it can do for your entire body.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery but not sure if I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This cellulite remover will be your butt and thighs new best friend!!  I use it once a day and I&#x27;ve gotten great results so far.  I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works long term!!  You don&#x27;t need to use much of this product and the bottles are a good size so I imagine these will last me awhile.  This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found so far for cellulite.  I received this product as part of a promotion in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order this product but it won&#x27;t clear from my list without an review.  It looks and seems to be just fine</li>
            <li> So far so good.  It feesl nice to touch - not sticky and has a very, very mild nice scent.  So many creams and serums tend to overwhelm you with the added fragrance.  Some even resemble the odor of fish...that does NOT go away. This is temporarily refreshing.  I will continue to use it as directed for full effects.  I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most effective cream I have ever purchased. Will defiantly buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 days and nights and I can already see a difference, when I first put it on I could feel a tightening sensation and my legs looked smooth. So to see if it was my imagination I put some on my husband&#x27;s chin and he was like I feel a tightening and now he&#x27;s using my stuff so I have to order more (why did I do that). It&#x27;s definitely making my legs look good already and for less than 20 bucks you can&#x27;t beat it and I&#x27;ve used just about every lotion and homemade potions on the internet, this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> I just received  my products today i cant wait to see the results!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product I&#x27;ve been using it a little over a week and I can tell a difference.. Cellulite is lighten up and my skin is super smooth.. I totally recommend this</li>
            <li> Cellulite remover can be an effective cream to use on those troublesome areas of the body.&lt;br /&gt;We purchased the Cellulite Remover Cream in a promotion for testing and review.&lt;br /&gt; This particular product seems to be working well for me.  It glides on and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Feeling that tightening in the skin almost immediately. My skin feels younger and looks smoother.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is made with quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing the reviews, and the deciding factor was because it is made with natural ingredients. I wanted to give this a try and can not say for certain this worked for me because i didn&#x27;t use it faithfully as instructed! But it does smell good and is not sticky when dry and leaves the skin feeling smoother! Hopefully i will dedicate myself to use it as directed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of products and this is the best thing I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the reviews and I have to say I&#x27;m so glad I did the first application of this I immediately saw a difference, however I do only have mild cellulite so I cant speak for those who have bad but I wanted to take care of it before it got worse and this is the product to get the job done there was no stinging or tingling it went on nice and smooth the area it was applied looks great and feels great I would definitely buy it again if needed and recommend it. Awesome product and the price is great as well.</li>
            <li> Been using for a week now, my cellulite  have smooth a little.  Good product  , will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I waited to do these types of reviews so that I can give an honest opinion. This all natural cellulite remover and dimple filler are the real deal. After having my son at 40, I have stretch marks, dimples and cellulite in places I didn&#x27;t know it could form! This has greatly helped reduce these issues. I am confident with daily use they will improve and finally disappear. Well packaged, feels great on my skin, no yucky smell and not sticky.</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast! Bottles are a nice size. Goes on smoothly and no bad smell. This product had excellent reviews and tips. Going to try with plastic wrap as suggested. I have high hope for this line, hence my 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I LOVE using serums instead of creams because they go deeper into the skin and they don&#x27;t feel so heavy. I use this when ever I know I will be showing off my legs and the retinol is really good at regenerating skin which means your stretch mark scars will also fade slightly. The results are really nice and quick so if you want something that will show results you should get this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok i started using it couple of days ago so hopefully by my 2nd week i&#x27;m able to see a difference</li>
            <li> Excellent products I am using every day twice I will let you guys how it work on my skin</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a week and a half now and I have seen some great results. I do it right after my shower in the morning and evening, it makes my skin feel so soft and I love how my skin sucks the products in. My skin feel tight and I can see the cellulite on the back of my thigh slowly going away. I am happy with this product and will continue to use it to see tremendous results. Thank You.</li>
            <li> Hi y&#x27;all. This is the 3 rd product I tried for now and for now I&#x27;m not happy with it. At least for me it doesn&#x27;t work. And the dimples even look worse. I used it as instructed , go to the gym , drink a gallon of water a day and eat healthy. I would return it but the postal fee will probably be more than what I&#x27;ll get back. It smells good but I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t have not even half the things it should. Minerals from the dead sea? ! It says sodium chloride that&#x27;s plain salt people! Try It and see if it&#x27;s salty. Is not. The only thing is got for sure is the cinnamon oil that you can smell. Maybe it just didn&#x27;t work on me but I think I&#x27;ll return to my previous cream. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I have curves and I have several areas of cellulite to test this on - Hands down this product is transforming the contours of my body. Like the &#x27;Trinity&#x27; range, this product works over the course of several months and results are clearly visible - Smoother, tighter and firmer..... I cannot wait to see the results after several more months!</li>
            <li> Good so far, but have only used it a couple of days - so hard to say if any results. Easy to apply tough, and absorbe fast with my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cellulite products for many years.  The one thing I have found is that many of them irritate my skin and are also quite expensive.  The main brand products in stores are so much more expensive than what I can find from vendors on amazon or google.  What I value about the raw biology cellulite cream is that the majority of the ingredients are natural/organic and there isn&#x27;t a laundry list of artificial ingredients that I am unable to pronounce.  Results have been great and I shall be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for almost 3 weeks doing diet and some exercise and didn&#x27;t work out for me</li>
            <li> Not good!!! Thought I would be because of the great reviews I saw about, but not for me.....</li>
            <li> Following a great experience with the Vitamin C Serum, Hyaluronic Acid and Retinol three pack from Raw Biology I was eager to try their cellulite formula.  I have been equally pleased.  There is no better value product on the market in my opinion.  Just as my wrinkles are beginning to disappear on my face - I have found that after 3 weeks I am starting to see a marked disappearance of ugly cellulite on my body!  I am very careful with my diet and work out regularly but cellulite has everything to do with genetics and being a women!!  And I know its only going to get worse with age :(  I recommend the cellulite product from raw biology for any women or man that is looking for rapid and highly effective results at unbeatable value.</li>
            <li> Best Product I have tried in a very long time. Really works and I could not recommend it more strongly.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous! My husband and I noticed a difference the first day! I&#x27;m excited about what it will do over the next month!!!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how fast it arrived. Its only been 3 days but so far it feels like an amazing product my skin feels very smooth and firm.</li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t usually leave a review for cellulite cream, this remover is good enough to go out on a limb for. We all struggle with it and I want women to know that this will help their struggle. It helped mine and I am grateful and I would buy it again. I don&#x27;t do it every time but when I do I can feel it tightening and it feels less dimlping. Received from a friend to try and thought I would leave a review</li>
            <li> Finally a product that work to diminish the sight of cellulite! Although there is no cure for cellulite, the combination of these products (when used as directed) greatly helps reduce the sight of it. If you are like me, and have tried many other similar products, you should try the Raw Biology product line and see for yourself. You will be amazed by the results!&lt;br /&gt;-Julia D.</li>
            <li> Just got this this today &amp; love the feel of it!! Also love that its organic. Very excited to see results &amp; will update later.</li>
            <li> The product looks just fits my cellulite well, The ingredients are not bad smelling when you apply . I can see less cellulite  already on my thighs so I just started using it on my buttocks too. It definitely tightens and everything become less and less visible as the hours go on. I will continue using for those great results at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I started using this product after my friend recommended that I try it.  I have serious problems with cell build up even though I work out everyday.  I know from my doctor and skin care professionals that it is more genetic than anything else.  iIm constantly trying to find ways to combat this and find that most products are somewhat gimmicky or/and expensive.  I was attracted to this by the relatively low price but i can say that I would definitely pay more.  One thing is that the product doesnt last long although the bottle size is quite generous.  But I guess that is to be expected as its an organic product that I need to use over a large area.  Either way Ive found a solution.  I apply the cream at least once a day and am very happy.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product works to remove cellulite, but te 2 step thing is kind of annoying. I switched over to the skingennix cream instead [[ASIN:B00VSDVDH2 Skingenixx Anti-Cellulite Toning and Slimming Cream]] and I like it better.</li>
