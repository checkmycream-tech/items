            <li>This brand is always top notch, moisturizes skin without leaving an oily feel/film.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since she was a baby we have tried with so many moisturizing creams and lotions as per the suggestions from her pediatricians, dermatologists &amp; Allergy specialists.</li>
            <li>After hearing about how Aveeno had oatmeal in it, I decided to give it a try and have been using it for more than a year now.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this body lotion, never had problems with it.</li>
            <li>This holds up for many hours.  </li>
            <li>As a health care worker in the dermatology field, I have heard many colleagues recommend Aveeno and Eucerin products.  </li>
            <li>Not my most favorite</li>
            <li>This lotion was okay</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t think of a better item.  </li>
            <li>Now they don&#x27;t itch any more.  </li>
            <li>most of the reviewers used this cream with skin ailments like eczema etc.</li>
            <li>I like the most is-</li>
            <li>I apply this cream after a shower in the evening and it keeps my skin moistured for more than 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Works better then</li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works that much better with the shower oil.</li>

            <li>I think I&#x27;ll probably use more Aveeno products now because of it.</li>
            <li>This lotion can be found elsewhere for considerably more.</li>
            <li>For someone who has a lot of itching, has problems with many skin care products, who needs lotion for ulcer-prone skin, and who would like a product that can be used all over the body, then give this a try.</li>

            <li>After trying other moisturizers I found this one to be best for me.</li>
            <li>For the first time to buy, so size a bit error, but after the purchase, I&#x27;ll choose to more suitable size.</li>
            <li>Very mild smell and not too greasy.</li>
            <li>Some of the strong lotions are oily and I don&#x27;t like that greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY remedies lotions, special soaps, Shea butter &amp; Vaseline....</li>
            <li>, i&#x27;ll be using it more often so that I get the full affects of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>

            <li>This is fabulous stuff.</li>
            <li>Silky smooth and just a hint of almond fragrance.</li>
            <li>if I have to use it more often it is worth the price difference.</li>
            <li>that it is fragrance free as well.</li>
            <li>My husband uses this on his face each day after his shower and says it&#x27;s perfect since it is not too heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>My husband likes it too because it is fragrance free.  </li>

            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I am comfortable all day.</li>
            <li>my skin is still silky smooth</li>
            <li>I look for products that are fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Also great to heart out on current tattoos to keep the skin moist.</li>
            <li>My wife and I use this sometimes, but it is primarily for our children (5 and 2).</li>
            <li>It is a light texture and no smell to speak of.  </li>
            <li>The item felt light to the skin.</li>
            <li>I like the light nature of the lotion vs some of its competitors.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s worth every penny, why pay more when you can save dollars per bottle through Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best lotion as it continues to do its job of moisturizing until I take my next shower&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for carrying this product</li>
            <li>I have to have a mild soap and a strong lotion.  </li>

            <li>It works great on my itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have dry  skin and this does works great.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin and this leaves it nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause any itching, absorbs in well.</li>
            <li>Great lotion for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>and this is a great lotion for very dry skin</li>
            <li>This lotion has shea butter which is super rich &amp; moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Yes it costs more than your store brand, but you will get something that works very well.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite part of this is it is NOT scented.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion will purchase again real soon</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for the better pricing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a good, basic lotion to help prevent cracks during winter.</li>
            <li>Okay so I have yet to see a dermatologist to see what the heck is really up with my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>We live in the desert which can be very dry, so a product of this nature and at this price is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li>The improvement in skin quality is just as good as with other brands as well, so it is not as though it cheats to be able to be absorbed</li>
            <li>This particular lotion comes in this huge bottle and lasts us months on end!</li>
            <li>I find that it does control egzema better than Curel, and actually promotes healthy skin growth.  </li>
            <li>After trying the body wash and applying this to my skin--I kept wondering and wishing how it would be more enjoyable if I bought one that had the same scent as the moisturizing  body wash.</li>
            <li>Loyal customer for 3 years.</li>
            <li>This lotion absorbs quickly and moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li>What I like most about it is that it PENETRATES and HYDRATES from within (rather than sits on top of skin acting as a sealant).</li>
            <li>My doctor recommended that I start using Aveeno products because their natural ingredients are among the gentlest on the skin, and she specifically said that the Aveeno Active Naturals lotions tend to do the best job at moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My boy have a very strong skin problem any cream was helping him, we tried a lot of different ones, one year ago me test this one and his skin looks smooth and relief</li>
            <li>I live in the woods and I am glad that I could order it online.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty sure Amazon&#x27;s price is very close to that of a store like Wal-Mart etc.</li>
            <li>Of course, if you use strong soap and really scrub, you do have to re-apply the lotion afterwards, but I noticed that even after washing out a glass using dish detergent, my fingers still felt somewhat moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and most lotions cause irritation and sometimes a rash.  </li>
            <li>My family has lots of allergies and very sensitive skin - we love the Aveeno products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d put it on after my shower at night and wake up the next day and not have to put more on!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>I also love this pump version, makes it really easy to get moisturizer without getting it all over the outside of the bottle.</li>
            <li>excellent cream softens skin, my child has dry skin and moisturizes dermatitis, and especially that I was sent on time.</li>
            <li>It creates a film on the skin that lasts for a whole day, and it is not greasy so it does not attract dust and fine powders.</li>
            <li>It also makes my skin very smooth and soft throughout the entire day but more importantly has NO smell</li>
            <li>This lotion is perfect for my skin with less additives than most other lotions.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>Not only is my skin amazingly moisturized</li>
            <li>The lotion is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this lotion is technically not a cure for atopic dermatitis, since atopic dermatitis is a genetic condition, it effectively stops all symptoms.</li>
            <li>siz, I decided it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>so takes a bit longer to absorb but well worth.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, nice natural scent and does keep my skin moisturized much longer than the others.  </li>
            <li>It is absorbed well by the skin.</li>
            <li>So far I love this it.</li>
            <li>Just that my skin is more soft than if I hadn&#x27;t put it on.</li>
            <li>It just seems to work pretty good for my extremely dry hands.</li>
            <li>But I am glad it suit my other daughter :)</li>
            <li>The cooling effect of the lotion is unique and really works.  </li>
            <li>you are hyper-sensitive to lotions of any kind, need a product without scents, and which is very reasonably priced as compared to similar products, then this is the thing for you.</li>
            <li>I will be buying it until they stop making it because it suits my needs and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Use it right after showering in the morning.</li>
            <li>In addition, the product has no nauseating fragrance, and it absorbs right away (having to wait for lotion to absorb is one of my pet peeves).</li>
            <li>Majority of the time it soothes my itchiness ad dryness right away.</li>
            <li>Love the Aveeno brand in general!</li>
            <li>My skin is no longer dry, its soft and i am so happy.</li>
            <li>After a while I started using Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save service to stock up, which has saved me money (it&#x27;s usually under $8 per bottle) and the worry that I&#x27;ll ever run out of this great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You might have to reapply to your hands due to hand washing, but so far a very good product used by whole family.</li>
            <li>have tried many of the other brands including the Neutrogena Deep Moisture Hand Cream, Butter Cream as well but find this cream good for price vs value and the job it does.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone, it&#x27;s worth the money paid to buy it!</li>
            <li>While others are oily, the Aveeno product is much creamer and absorbs quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It also has a very relaxing, mild oat scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its mild, its gentle and</li>
            <li>Nice product for dry skin during these summer time.</li>
            <li>It is simply the best everyday body lotion that I have found.  </li>
            <li>great product which i can now buy at the local store at the same or even cheaper prices.  </li>
            <li>We both like this one very much because it absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t smell like a perfume counter.  </li>
            <li>Also, compared to a lot of products out there, it is very reasonably</li>
            <li>I do like the Aveeno products very much.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s black, soft, natural, and beautiful look!</li>
            <li>this lotion is awesome for dry or extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have something a little more natural too.</li>
            <li>To me, the only way that this product could be better is if it was made in the USA</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference by the next day, and within two weeks my hands were perfectly healthy again.</li>
            <li>tried using this on my cheeks, which get very chapped, and I replaced dryness with acne!  </li>
            <li>Will replace regular Aveeno purchased at Costco with this better product and it does not stink . . .</li>
            <li>And if it&#x27;s summer or hot weather -- ew.</li>
            <li>Believe if they want to sell on line better come up with a different price structure.  </li>
            <li>Now this version is even better than the regular.  </li>
            <li>first time I used it I noticed a difference</li>
            <li>Good for my sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer, especially for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Would be good for the winter but a little much for the warmer months</li>
            <li>skin is soft and smooth , fast shipping</li>
            <li>It does not have a very overpowering scent, which I like very much.</li>
            <li>A tiny bit greasy at first, but goes away very quickly (trust me,</li>
            <li>First time in 2 years that I have been able to control my dry flaky skin, It did not, however make me look like Jennifer Aniston.</li>
            <li>Positively Nourishing Aveeno Smoothing Body Wash, Pomegranate + Rice, 16 ounces]]</li>
            <li>I try pretty much any treatment</li>
            <li>This lotion does feel better on both oily and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I have itchy dry skin and since I have been using this lotion, my problem is 10 times better.</li>
            <li>This is a large bottle size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>keep one of these large containers at home and carry one of the pocket size containers when traveling.</li>
            <li>I like the consistency of the product and the nice relief it gives to my mom&#x27;s dry yet sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It works and moistens  very dry skin better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li>This lotion sinks into the skin, smells fine, and just keeps my skin soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is so hard to find a good body lotion in 2015.</li>
            <li>Its hard to find a nice lotion at the drugstore without being loaded with cheap, synthetic materials that make your skin *seem* moisturized but not actually doing anything useful.</li>
            <li>really fast).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it really really REALLY works.  </li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
            <li>It really helps the skin</li>
            <li>I work on a computer much of the day</li>
            <li>im glad i finally found whats good for my sensitive and delicate skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very mousturizing.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves it too, so much</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are really thankful to Aveeno.</li>
            <li>Thanks Aveeno.</li>
            <li>it is not what I like much.</li>
            <li>it really works.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are really gentle and this lotion is truly unscented.</li>
            <li>It works really well, but makes my hands repel water and moisture</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know that it really lasts 24 hours.</li>
            <li>but it is very compatible with my skin</li>
            <li>though it was unscented (no complaints about it--i really planned on getting an unscented one).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice, big size and should last thru the winter months</li>
            <li>It soaks into the skin quickly and is barely greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other products made it better, but didn&#x27;t cure the issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I have used many products by both brands, as well as those of other over-the-counter brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has worked much better than other lotions for me.</li>
            <li>I am using this cream for over 3 weeks now and found it not to leave an oily layer on my skin or any stains on the inside of my clothes like many other creams do.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>The many skin and blood tests I did always turned out negative, but it is clear I am allergic to fine powders:</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes your skin and leaves it feeling soft and silky!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from it helping alleviate my skin condition, this Aveeno lotion is also just pleasant to use; it&#x27;s unscented and unobtrusive, and it rubs into your skin really well without leaving any funky, sticky residue behind.</li>
            <li>Never feels like it sinks in completely (leaves a bit of residue), but overall seems to moisture fairly well.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone dealing with dry hands!</li>
            <li>My hair is completely damage because of I straightened way too much!</li>
            <li>Better than all of the other baby lotions we tried!</li>
            <li>It spreads and is absorbed easily plus is long lasting.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, many products promise much, deliver little.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe that I could live without it!</li>
            <li>short: Aveeno products may cost more than other brands, but they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li>I like this lotion because it goes on easily, does not smell and sinks into the skin</li>
            <li>It also helps to heal severely dry and even cracked skin and it&#x27;s fragrance free,</li>
            <li>but the product uses more organic oils, I think it&#x27;ll be less greasy to me.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s, I think, a negligible two tenths of a percent less than the Remedy Skin Repair lotion, which costs 3 to 4 times more than this Aveeno lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent cream cleanser</li>
            <li>I just love that it works so well with no greasey mess or feel.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended by our dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for folks in my position.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>&quot; in a little more</li>
            <li>I wish it smelled a little better</li>
            <li>the bottle was a little bit defective but it is ok does not affect the use</li>
            <li>It makes my face look a little better and feel a little better.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for its gentle and natural properties.  </li>
            <li>Really makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I am 32 and suffered my whole life (since 8 months old) from atopic dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have begun experiencing some eczema on my face that needs gentle care.</li>
            <li>:) My husband said that it felt greasy, but the product just needs a few minutes to absorb fully into your skin.</li>
            <li>If you have ezcema or worse, try their ezcema cream, it&#x27;s pretty effective.</li>
            <li>My life is now normal.</li>
            <li>Used to be confused on what product was good for me.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m a special case when it comes to dry skin...</li>
            <li>I am super sensitive, especially in the winter and my doctor recommended this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been a few days and already my skin is looking better and the cracking &amp; bleeding has stopped!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other Aveeno products and they were all fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like trying to get Heinz ketchup out of a new ketchup bottle.</li>
            <li>I will try a new body cream called California baby cream which costs a lot</li>
            <li>Why is this my new go-to?  </li>
            <li>How did i live without it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>This lotion by Aveeno works super well for moisturizing dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Either way, it was a tremendous help for my dry skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and every new thing i try</li>
            <li>Definitely worth paying a little extra than cheap lotion.</li>
            <li>first purchased the Aveeno lotion from a local grocer.  </li>
            <li>I knew from the first application, this lotion just felt different.  </li>
            <li>Great buy here on Amazon vs in local stores like CVS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other moisturizers (including others from Aveeno), but this is the ONLY one that keeps me moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li>We cannot find it in our local stores, and it works so much better than the other Aveeno products.  </li>
            <li>We have been using this for awhile now and works fantastic vs any other lotion for sensitive skin and/or eczema.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>The only other lotion I can use is Vanicream, but Aveeno Skin Relief is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It was the first Aveeno product I used--and I definitely plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li>I will keep getting this as it is wonderful for cold weather with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this and the Aveeno bath/shower oil after I was desperate to find any product that would soothe my skin&#x27;s problems and it has honestly helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; of slime like a lot of other lotions do.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this lotion while using the other Aveeno lotions and was looking for something better as I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li>This lotion is Great when you have chicken pox.  </li>
            <li>It helps with the frequent itching feeling I experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried like everything to find all natural and organic - non toxic -</li>
            <li>My 18 year old girl loves this lotion.</li>
            <li>My hands do feel better as well, at least until I wash my hands once to often.  </li>
            <li>But it look old.</li>
            <li>You are still soft 24 hours after application.  </li>
            <li>then what I could find in a near by store,</li>
            <li>She is seven years old now.</li>
            <li>So far, we have tried Cetaphil (cream and lotion), Eucerine (cream and lotion), CeraVe(cream) and Vanicream moisturizing creams.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My family all have sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that the ingredients are mostly natural that they don&#x27;t pose health concern.</li>
            <li>Had to replace it with the old one.</li>
            <li>I use it myself as weel as on my children ages 7 to 11years old.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Keeps skin silky soft and not sticky, all day.</li>
            <li>but everyone is always saying what young looking skin he has when I never hear that.  </li>
            <li>I already had some, and needed something to complete my order.  </li>
            <li>lotion, along with the aveeno intense moisturizer that comes in jars, has been nothing short of a miracle for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I took a leap of faith and was plesantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This was old stock and the pump did not work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin still feels soft in the morning after applying it before going to bed.</li>
            <li>It seems to soften lines near my eyes too.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is Wow.</li>
            <li>My skin when I go to bed is still moisturized, soft, not dried out.</li>
            <li>Though a bit more expensive than others, it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hands smooth and soft though, unlike others I&#x27;ve used that seem to work for an hour or two, but then feel dried out.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;ll relieve skin ---by covering it with a waxy, draggy, thick layer of skin soothers.</li>
            <li>Carpet in particular attracts so much dust, and it is in every single apartment (and I cannot afford a house).</li>
            <li>I am a senior male with dry skin and mild  eczema living in humid Florida.</li>
            <li>but it absorbs quickly &amp; becomes less greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried oils and other lotions, which have left my skin almost as dry, entirely too greasy or caused some kind of irritation.</li>
            <li>She has a huge bottle of it at home and during the day she brings a small sample sized bottle of it with her in her purse and she let me try it.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate at high elevation, so my skin tends to crack, etc.  </li>
            <li>work a lot with wood (cutting, sanding, and filling), dirt (gardening etc), and many other DIY activities that all seem to contribute to this drying effect even more.  </li>
            <li>I have tired a few other brands of hand lotion and I for some reason or another like the Aveeno brand of hand lotion the best.</li>
            <li>It really helps my dry skin</li>
            <li>SO NOT TRUE, gave the other away and went and bought more of this</li>
            <li>After receiving 3+ tubes of this, i&#x27;ve used enough to experience the sticky film that stays on your body, rendering you too filmy to touched by your loved one (forget a night of intimacy unless you want to stick uncomfortably), and squeakiness when rubbing your legs together.  </li>
            <li>It is better than almost every other over-the-counter cream or lotion that I have used for the dry, cracked skin that comes from winter dry</li>
            <li>Before my skin is very dry, since I use it, my skin has improved, I very like, recommend to my friends</li>
            <li>she can get her hands on, though this is pretty much the only thing that can stop me from scratching my skin raw.</li>
            <li>Not only did this help clear her up</li>
            <li>but it was small enough to fit into my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend for people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>days ago we visited my daughter&#x27;s allergy Doctor for a regular appointment and he has surprised to see the improvement in her skin.</li>
            <li>far, it seems that this lotion is similar to hundreds of others.  </li>
            <li>Everyone now asks me now what product i used to get such soft skin.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old says this is the only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t she&#x27;ll use!</li>
            <li>It is really thick but dries light.</li>
            <li>Sometimes worse, sometimes better, but I always seem to return to the Aveeno.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is its expensive, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found, so</li>
            <li>highly recommend this as the solution to severe issues of dry hands.  </li>
            <li>This lotion works really well to relieve my extra dry hands.</li>
            <li>As a man with chronically dry hands, I have struggled to find a moisturizer that works effectively, doesn&#x27;t leave my hands smelling of perfume and does not leave oily residue behind.</li>
            <li>Since I started using it, I have not had a single episode of extended rash, while for my whole life I had to cover myself in cortisone not to have constant extended</li>
            <li>The goods is well packed and fast delivery together with other goods I bought.</li>
            <li>This is stronger and longer lasting than the original (Standard Green) aveeno daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I live in dry Las Vegas and this product is keeping my feet and legs moisturized.  </li>
            <li>For dry skin I&#x27;ve mainly stuck with oil-based deep moisturizers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to the one in the green bottle, this one feels better when it is on, but I think the one in the green bottle (without the \\&quot;soothing oatmeal essence\\&quot;) lasts longer.</li>
            <li>It will feel a little greasy when you first put it on</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re big fans of Aveeno products in general and this one did not dissapoint.  </li>
            <li>My chronic itch has stopped from the first day I have used it (few months ago).</li>
            <li>Within a week, the eczema had cleared up considerably, and not long after that I actually started getting unsolicited compliments on how soft and smooth my skin was -- it had gone from \\&quot;angry hag\\&quot; to \\&quot;cooing baby\\&quot; in just under a month</li>
            <li>I purchased this because my hands are really dry, and a week of this fixed that</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and in the winter, my skin gets extremely dry.</li>
            <li>When you have severely dry and sensitive skin, you just have to go with what works, and this is my go-to product for skin issues.</li>
            <li>I have natural dry skin and was looking out for a lotion that would work for me</li>
            <li>It is not too thick but it does give some moisture and does not evaporate too quickly.  </li>
            <li>$10 seemed a little steep when I bought my first bottle from a local drugstore, but I swallowed my complaints and started applying this daily after my morning showers to help lock in the moisture.</li>
            <li>I touched due to the heavier, less effective lotions of the past).</li>
            <li>, I found out that I had nummular eczema, which is basically a fancy way of saying that my skin was a dry, finicky old hag who I needed to start treating with kid gloves: no fabric softener, no perfumed skin products, and lots of daily moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old has a very dry itchy skin but this lotion does not seem to help.</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak for the price as I haven&#x27;t really looked for this item in the store but Aveeno products are pretty expensive compared to other brands</li>
            <li>Finally found a lotion for dry skin that absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel &#x27;heavy!&#x27;</li>
            <li>Aveeno, on the other hand, always meets my expectations in quickly absorbing into dry skin and not leaving any greasiness or tingling.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;Since she was a baby we have tried with so many moisturizing creams and lotions as per the suggestions from her pediatricians, dermatologists &amp; Allergy specialists.</li>
            <li> After hearing about how Aveeno had oatmeal in it, I decided to give it a try and have been using it for more than a year now.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>

            <li> This holds up for many hours.  </li>
            <li> As a health care worker in the dermatology field, I have heard many colleagues recommend Aveeno and Eucerin products.  </li>
            <li> Not my most favorite</li>
            <li> This lotion was okay</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t think of a better item.  </li>
            <li> Now they don&#x27;t itch any more.  </li>
            <li> most of the reviewers used this cream with skin ailments like eczema etc.</li>
            <li> I like the most is-</li>
            <li> I apply this cream after a shower in the evening and it keeps my skin moistured for more than 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I think I&#x27;ll probably use more Aveeno products now because of it.</li>
            <li> This lotion can be found elsewhere for considerably more.</li>
            <li> For someone who has a lot of itching, has problems with many skin care products, who needs lotion for ulcer-prone skin, and who would like a product that can be used all over the body, then give this a try.</li>

            <li> Very mild smell and not too greasy.</li>
            <li> Some of the strong lotions are oily and I don&#x27;t like that greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY remedies lotions, special soaps, Shea butter &amp; Vaseline....</li>
            <li> , i&#x27;ll be using it more often so that I get the full affects of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>

            <li> This is fabulous stuff.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth and just a hint of almond fragrance.</li>
            <li> if I have to use it more often it is worth the price difference.</li>
            <li> that it is fragrance free as well.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on his face each day after his shower and says it&#x27;s perfect since it is not too heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it too because it is fragrance free.  </li>

            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I am comfortable all day.</li>
            <li> my skin is still silky smooth</li>
            <li> I look for products that are fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Also great to heart out on current tattoos to keep the skin moist.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use this sometimes, but it is primarily for our children (5 and 2).</li>
            <li> It is a light texture and no smell to speak of.  </li>
            <li> The item felt light to the skin.</li>
            <li> I like the light nature of the lotion vs some of its competitors.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s worth every penny, why pay more when you can save dollars per bottle through Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best lotion as it continues to do its job of moisturizing until I take my next shower&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for carrying this product</li>
            <li> I have to have a mild soap and a strong lotion.  </li>

            <li> Great lotion for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> and this is a great lotion for very dry skin</li>
            <li> This lotion has shea butter which is super rich &amp; moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Yes it costs more than your store brand, but you will get something that works very well.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite part of this is it is NOT scented.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion will purchase again real soon</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon for the better pricing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a good, basic lotion to help prevent cracks during winter.</li>
            <li> Okay so I have yet to see a dermatologist to see what the heck is really up with my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> We live in the desert which can be very dry, so a product of this nature and at this price is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> The improvement in skin quality is just as good as with other brands as well, so it is not as though it cheats to be able to be absorbed</li>
            <li> This particular lotion comes in this huge bottle and lasts us months on end!</li>
            <li> I find that it does control egzema better than Curel, and actually promotes healthy skin growth.  </li>
            <li> After trying the body wash and applying this to my skin--I kept wondering and wishing how it would be more enjoyable if I bought one that had the same scent as the moisturizing  body wash.</li>
            <li> Loyal customer for 3 years.</li>
            <li> This lotion absorbs quickly and moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li> What I like most about it is that it PENETRATES and HYDRATES from within (rather than sits on top of skin acting as a sealant).</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended that I start using Aveeno products because their natural ingredients are among the gentlest on the skin, and she specifically said that the Aveeno Active Naturals lotions tend to do the best job at moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My boy have a very strong skin problem any cream was helping him, we tried a lot of different ones, one year ago me test this one and his skin looks smooth and relief</li>
            <li> I live in the woods and I am glad that I could order it online.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty sure Amazon&#x27;s price is very close to that of a store like Wal-Mart etc.</li>
            <li> Of course, if you use strong soap and really scrub, you do have to re-apply the lotion afterwards, but I noticed that even after washing out a glass using dish detergent, my fingers still felt somewhat moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and most lotions cause irritation and sometimes a rash.  </li>
            <li> My family has lots of allergies and very sensitive skin - we love the Aveeno products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d put it on after my shower at night and wake up the next day and not have to put more on!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I also love this pump version, makes it really easy to get moisturizer without getting it all over the outside of the bottle.</li>
            <li> excellent cream softens skin, my child has dry skin and moisturizes dermatitis, and especially that I was sent on time.</li>
            <li> It creates a film on the skin that lasts for a whole day, and it is not greasy so it does not attract dust and fine powders.</li>
            <li> It also makes my skin very smooth and soft throughout the entire day but more importantly has NO smell</li>
            <li> This lotion is perfect for my skin with less additives than most other lotions.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> Not only is my skin amazingly moisturized</li>
            <li> The lotion is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this lotion is technically not a cure for atopic dermatitis, since atopic dermatitis is a genetic condition, it effectively stops all symptoms.</li>
            <li> siz, I decided it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> so takes a bit longer to absorb but well worth.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, nice natural scent and does keep my skin moisturized much longer than the others.  </li>
            <li> It is absorbed well by the skin.</li>
            <li> So far I love this it.</li>
            <li> Just that my skin is more soft than if I hadn&#x27;t put it on.</li>
            <li> It just seems to work pretty good for my extremely dry hands.</li>
            <li> But I am glad it suit my other daughter :)</li>
            <li> The cooling effect of the lotion is unique and really works.  </li>
            <li> you are hyper-sensitive to lotions of any kind, need a product without scents, and which is very reasonably priced as compared to similar products, then this is the thing for you.</li>
            <li> I will be buying it until they stop making it because it suits my needs and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Use it right after showering in the morning.</li>
            <li> In addition, the product has no nauseating fragrance, and it absorbs right away (having to wait for lotion to absorb is one of my pet peeves).</li>
            <li> Majority of the time it soothes my itchiness ad dryness right away.</li>
            <li> Love the Aveeno brand in general!</li>
            <li> My skin is no longer dry, its soft and i am so happy.</li>
            <li> After a while I started using Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save service to stock up, which has saved me money (it&#x27;s usually under $8 per bottle) and the worry that I&#x27;ll ever run out of this great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You might have to reapply to your hands due to hand washing, but so far a very good product used by whole family.</li>
            <li> have tried many of the other brands including the Neutrogena Deep Moisture Hand Cream, Butter Cream as well but find this cream good for price vs value and the job it does.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to everyone, it&#x27;s worth the money paid to buy it!</li>
            <li> While others are oily, the Aveeno product is much creamer and absorbs quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It also has a very relaxing, mild oat scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its mild, its gentle and</li>
            <li> Nice product for dry skin during these summer time.</li>
            <li> It is simply the best everyday body lotion that I have found.  </li>
            <li> great product which i can now buy at the local store at the same or even cheaper prices.  </li>
            <li> We both like this one very much because it absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t smell like a perfume counter.  </li>
            <li> Also, compared to a lot of products out there, it is very reasonably</li>
            <li> I do like the Aveeno products very much.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s black, soft, natural, and beautiful look!</li>
            <li> this lotion is awesome for dry or extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have something a little more natural too.</li>
            <li> To me, the only way that this product could be better is if it was made in the USA</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference by the next day, and within two weeks my hands were perfectly healthy again.</li>
            <li> tried using this on my cheeks, which get very chapped, and I replaced dryness with acne!  </li>
            <li> Will replace regular Aveeno purchased at Costco with this better product and it does not stink . . .</li>
            <li> And if it&#x27;s summer or hot weather -- ew.</li>
            <li> Believe if they want to sell on line better come up with a different price structure.  </li>
            <li> Now this version is even better than the regular.  </li>
            <li> first time I used it I noticed a difference</li>
            <li> Good for my sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, especially for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Would be good for the winter but a little much for the warmer months</li>
            <li> skin is soft and smooth , fast shipping</li>
            <li> It does not have a very overpowering scent, which I like very much.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit greasy at first, but goes away very quickly (trust me,</li>
            <li> First time in 2 years that I have been able to control my dry flaky skin, It did not, however make me look like Jennifer Aniston.</li>
            <li> Positively Nourishing Aveeno Smoothing Body Wash, Pomegranate + Rice, 16 ounces]]</li>
            <li> I try pretty much any treatment</li>
            <li> This lotion does feel better on both oily and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have itchy dry skin and since I have been using this lotion, my problem is 10 times better.</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> keep one of these large containers at home and carry one of the pocket size containers when traveling.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of the product and the nice relief it gives to my mom&#x27;s dry yet sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It works and moistens  very dry skin better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li> This lotion sinks into the skin, smells fine, and just keeps my skin soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find a good body lotion in 2015.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a nice lotion at the drugstore without being loaded with cheap, synthetic materials that make your skin *seem* moisturized but not actually doing anything useful.</li>
            <li> really fast).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it really really REALLY works.  </li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
            <li> It really helps the skin</li>
            <li> I work on a computer much of the day</li>
            <li> im glad i finally found whats good for my sensitive and delicate skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very mousturizing.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves it too, so much</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are really thankful to Aveeno.</li>
            <li> Thanks Aveeno.</li>
            <li> it is not what I like much.</li>
            <li> it really works.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are really gentle and this lotion is truly unscented.</li>
            <li> It works really well, but makes my hands repel water and moisture</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know that it really lasts 24 hours.</li>
            <li> but it is very compatible with my skin</li>
            <li> though it was unscented (no complaints about it--i really planned on getting an unscented one).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice, big size and should last thru the winter months</li>
            <li> It soaks into the skin quickly and is barely greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other products made it better, but didn&#x27;t cure the issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I have used many products by both brands, as well as those of other over-the-counter brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has worked much better than other lotions for me.</li>
            <li> I am using this cream for over 3 weeks now and found it not to leave an oily layer on my skin or any stains on the inside of my clothes like many other creams do.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> The many skin and blood tests I did always turned out negative, but it is clear I am allergic to fine powders:</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes your skin and leaves it feeling soft and silky!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from it helping alleviate my skin condition, this Aveeno lotion is also just pleasant to use; it&#x27;s unscented and unobtrusive, and it rubs into your skin really well without leaving any funky, sticky residue behind.</li>
            <li> Never feels like it sinks in completely (leaves a bit of residue), but overall seems to moisture fairly well.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone dealing with dry hands!</li>
            <li> My hair is completely damage because of I straightened way too much!</li>
            <li> Better than all of the other baby lotions we tried!</li>
            <li> It spreads and is absorbed easily plus is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, many products promise much, deliver little.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that I could live without it!</li>
            <li> short: Aveeno products may cost more than other brands, but they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion because it goes on easily, does not smell and sinks into the skin</li>
            <li> It also helps to heal severely dry and even cracked skin and it&#x27;s fragrance free,</li>
            <li> but the product uses more organic oils, I think it&#x27;ll be less greasy to me.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s, I think, a negligible two tenths of a percent less than the Remedy Skin Repair lotion, which costs 3 to 4 times more than this Aveeno lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent cream cleanser</li>
            <li> I just love that it works so well with no greasey mess or feel.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended by our dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for folks in my position.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> &quot; in a little more</li>
            <li> I wish it smelled a little better</li>
            <li> the bottle was a little bit defective but it is ok does not affect the use</li>
            <li> It makes my face look a little better and feel a little better.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for its gentle and natural properties.  </li>
            <li> Really makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li> I am 32 and suffered my whole life (since 8 months old) from atopic dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have begun experiencing some eczema on my face that needs gentle care.</li>
            <li> :) My husband said that it felt greasy, but the product just needs a few minutes to absorb fully into your skin.</li>
            <li> If you have ezcema or worse, try their ezcema cream, it&#x27;s pretty effective.</li>
            <li> My life is now normal.</li>
            <li> Used to be confused on what product was good for me.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m a special case when it comes to dry skin...</li>
            <li> I am super sensitive, especially in the winter and my doctor recommended this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days and already my skin is looking better and the cracking &amp; bleeding has stopped!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Aveeno products and they were all fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like trying to get Heinz ketchup out of a new ketchup bottle.</li>
            <li> I will try a new body cream called California baby cream which costs a lot</li>
            <li> Why is this my new go-to?  </li>
            <li> How did i live without it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> This lotion by Aveeno works super well for moisturizing dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Either way, it was a tremendous help for my dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and every new thing i try</li>
            <li> Definitely worth paying a little extra than cheap lotion.</li>
            <li> first purchased the Aveeno lotion from a local grocer.  </li>
            <li> I knew from the first application, this lotion just felt different.  </li>
            <li> Great buy here on Amazon vs in local stores like CVS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other moisturizers (including others from Aveeno), but this is the ONLY one that keeps me moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> We cannot find it in our local stores, and it works so much better than the other Aveeno products.  </li>
            <li> We have been using this for awhile now and works fantastic vs any other lotion for sensitive skin and/or eczema.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> The only other lotion I can use is Vanicream, but Aveeno Skin Relief is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It was the first Aveeno product I used--and I definitely plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I will keep getting this as it is wonderful for cold weather with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the Aveeno bath/shower oil after I was desperate to find any product that would soothe my skin&#x27;s problems and it has honestly helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; of slime like a lot of other lotions do.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this lotion while using the other Aveeno lotions and was looking for something better as I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> This lotion is Great when you have chicken pox.  </li>
            <li> It helps with the frequent itching feeling I experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried like everything to find all natural and organic - non toxic -</li>
            <li> My 18 year old girl loves this lotion.</li>
            <li> My hands do feel better as well, at least until I wash my hands once to often.  </li>
            <li> But it look old.</li>
            <li> You are still soft 24 hours after application.  </li>
            <li> then what I could find in a near by store,</li>
            <li> She is seven years old now.</li>
            <li> So far, we have tried Cetaphil (cream and lotion), Eucerine (cream and lotion), CeraVe(cream) and Vanicream moisturizing creams.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My family all have sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the ingredients are mostly natural that they don&#x27;t pose health concern.</li>
            <li> Had to replace it with the old one.</li>
            <li> I use it myself as weel as on my children ages 7 to 11years old.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Keeps skin silky soft and not sticky, all day.</li>
            <li> but everyone is always saying what young looking skin he has when I never hear that.  </li>
            <li> I already had some, and needed something to complete my order.  </li>
            <li> lotion, along with the aveeno intense moisturizer that comes in jars, has been nothing short of a miracle for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I took a leap of faith and was plesantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This was old stock and the pump did not work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin still feels soft in the morning after applying it before going to bed.</li>
            <li> It seems to soften lines near my eyes too.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is Wow.</li>
            <li> My skin when I go to bed is still moisturized, soft, not dried out.</li>
            <li> Though a bit more expensive than others, it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hands smooth and soft though, unlike others I&#x27;ve used that seem to work for an hour or two, but then feel dried out.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;ll relieve skin ---by covering it with a waxy, draggy, thick layer of skin soothers.</li>
            <li> Carpet in particular attracts so much dust, and it is in every single apartment (and I cannot afford a house).</li>
            <li> I am a senior male with dry skin and mild  eczema living in humid Florida.</li>
            <li> but it absorbs quickly &amp; becomes less greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried oils and other lotions, which have left my skin almost as dry, entirely too greasy or caused some kind of irritation.</li>
            <li> She has a huge bottle of it at home and during the day she brings a small sample sized bottle of it with her in her purse and she let me try it.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate at high elevation, so my skin tends to crack, etc.  </li>
            <li> work a lot with wood (cutting, sanding, and filling), dirt (gardening etc), and many other DIY activities that all seem to contribute to this drying effect even more.  </li>
            <li> I have tired a few other brands of hand lotion and I for some reason or another like the Aveeno brand of hand lotion the best.</li>
            <li> It really helps my dry skin</li>
            <li> SO NOT TRUE, gave the other away and went and bought more of this</li>
            <li> After receiving 3+ tubes of this, i&#x27;ve used enough to experience the sticky film that stays on your body, rendering you too filmy to touched by your loved one (forget a night of intimacy unless you want to stick uncomfortably), and squeakiness when rubbing your legs together.  </li>
            <li> It is better than almost every other over-the-counter cream or lotion that I have used for the dry, cracked skin that comes from winter dry</li>
            <li> Before my skin is very dry, since I use it, my skin has improved, I very like, recommend to my friends</li>
            <li> she can get her hands on, though this is pretty much the only thing that can stop me from scratching my skin raw.</li>
            <li> Not only did this help clear her up</li>
            <li> but it was small enough to fit into my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend for people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> days ago we visited my daughter&#x27;s allergy Doctor for a regular appointment and he has surprised to see the improvement in her skin.</li>
            <li> far, it seems that this lotion is similar to hundreds of others.  </li>
            <li> Everyone now asks me now what product i used to get such soft skin.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old says this is the only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t she&#x27;ll use!</li>
            <li> It is really thick but dries light.</li>
            <li> Sometimes worse, sometimes better, but I always seem to return to the Aveeno.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is its expensive, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found, so</li>
            <li> highly recommend this as the solution to severe issues of dry hands.  </li>
            <li> This lotion works really well to relieve my extra dry hands.</li>
            <li> As a man with chronically dry hands, I have struggled to find a moisturizer that works effectively, doesn&#x27;t leave my hands smelling of perfume and does not leave oily residue behind.</li>
            <li> Since I started using it, I have not had a single episode of extended rash, while for my whole life I had to cover myself in cortisone not to have constant extended</li>
            <li> The goods is well packed and fast delivery together with other goods I bought.</li>
            <li> This is stronger and longer lasting than the original (Standard Green) aveeno daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I live in dry Las Vegas and this product is keeping my feet and legs moisturized.  </li>
            <li> For dry skin I&#x27;ve mainly stuck with oil-based deep moisturizers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to the one in the green bottle, this one feels better when it is on, but I think the one in the green bottle (without the \\&quot;soothing oatmeal essence\\&quot;) lasts longer.</li>
            <li> It will feel a little greasy when you first put it on</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re big fans of Aveeno products in general and this one did not dissapoint.  </li>
            <li> My chronic itch has stopped from the first day I have used it (few months ago).</li>
            <li> Within a week, the eczema had cleared up considerably, and not long after that I actually started getting unsolicited compliments on how soft and smooth my skin was -- it had gone from \\&quot;angry hag\\&quot; to \\&quot;cooing baby\\&quot; in just under a month</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my hands are really dry, and a week of this fixed that</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and in the winter, my skin gets extremely dry.</li>
            <li> When you have severely dry and sensitive skin, you just have to go with what works, and this is my go-to product for skin issues.</li>
            <li> I have natural dry skin and was looking out for a lotion that would work for me</li>
            <li> It is not too thick but it does give some moisture and does not evaporate too quickly.  </li>
            <li> $10 seemed a little steep when I bought my first bottle from a local drugstore, but I swallowed my complaints and started applying this daily after my morning showers to help lock in the moisture.</li>
            <li> I touched due to the heavier, less effective lotions of the past).</li>
            <li> , I found out that I had nummular eczema, which is basically a fancy way of saying that my skin was a dry, finicky old hag who I needed to start treating with kid gloves: no fabric softener, no perfumed skin products, and lots of daily moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old has a very dry itchy skin but this lotion does not seem to help.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak for the price as I haven&#x27;t really looked for this item in the store but Aveeno products are pretty expensive compared to other brands</li>
            <li> Finally found a lotion for dry skin that absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel &#x27;heavy!&#x27;</li>
            <li> Aveeno, on the other hand, always meets my expectations in quickly absorbing into dry skin and not leaving any greasiness or tingling.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, she has also started recovering from all her rashes from her common spots from behind the neck, knees and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now her skin is lot brighter than before, dryness is disappearing slowly and rarely scratching her skin.</li>
            <li> It has very minimal scent (everything has at least SOME scent, but this one I can barely even tell,) it is not greasy, and it rubs in quickly.  </li>
            <li> Not a big deal but kind of unpleasant moment.</li>
            <li> Within a few applications, this lotion has transformed dry cracking hands back to reasonably moisturized.</li>
            <li> and I can gently pat a small amount on inflamed facial skin without aggravating it.  </li>
            <li> The minus is that it&#x27;s too sticky and wet for every day normal use for non-dry skin.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot and, particularly in the winter, they can become dried out.  </li>
            <li> with that nightly treatment, I not only prevent the symptoms of dry skin I was dealing with (above), but if I become lax in my nightly usage in the winter and the dryness returns, I can cure it within one to two nightly treatments (and kick myself as I promise not to go to bed anymore without the lotion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It took an entire bottle with every day use to clear up the mess on my leg.</li>
            <li> I usually wait for a sale at CVS or Rite Aid, but a lot of times even the sale isn&#x27;t very discounted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing effect is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> This stuff definitely works as a basic lotion for everyday use and I&#x27;d highly recommend it if you&#x27;re fed up with other types.</li>
            <li> I can definitely see how it can be a saver for dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> I would suggest something different for DRY skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only non-prescription lotion that calms dry redness for me in the winter.</li>
            <li> I issues with dry skin, so I&#x27;ve tried a number of different products.  </li>
            <li> only downside is I bought this when my knuckles were cracked from the dry winter months</li>
            <li> And yes, my cheeks were dry enough to flake a bit, so it wasn&#x27;t the dryness factor.  </li>
            <li> Her skin was extremely dry and regularly gets rashes on neck, knees, elbows and some times on face and scratches her skin</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that helps with my dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> Being diabetic, dry skin is always an issue, and living in the mountains, especially during winter.</li>
            <li> Finally a friend who also used to have dry skin recommended this product to me.</li>
            <li> This moisturizing lotion definitely kept my skin moisturized all day long!!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and during the dry winter months I get so dried out I sometimes get dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of creams, lotions, including other Aveeno lotions, pure raw Shea Butter, prescription creams, Burt&#x27;s Bees, etc, etc.  </li>
            <li> Due to my job I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands and this bottle has last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> It provides immediate, soothing relief and works long term.  </li>
            <li> Strange cream and defective bottle.</li>
            <li> No fragrance, all day long protection, can use on face, hands and everywhere.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what took me so long to find this</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t have to continually apply on my hands all day long....</li>
            <li> It hydrates within and how long it lasts (staying power)</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my dry skin, used it for a long time</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy only when I only apply a tiny small dot.</li>
            <li> If you stumble upon this item GO FOR IT!</li>
            <li> But even if you have &amp;#34;normal skin,&amp;#34; using this lotion on a regular basis helps to keep skin from getting dry or developing other problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most of the time it just stings really bad &amp; feels smoother till the next time I wash</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also works wonders on dry heels, elbows &amp; chapped hands.  </li>
            <li> My skin is naturally extremely dry but with the help of this lotion</li>
            <li> My son has dry skin issues.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin.</li>

            <li> B001459IEE Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion, 18 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been attacked by dry itchy skin over the last few months and this is the only item that helps to soothe my skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin on my legs and have been using the Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion for about a couple of years now and found after about&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it for a few days, I noticed that my hands and especially fingers felt soft and slightly slippery even after rinsing with water.</li>
            <li> We use the Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion for us.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and it is so dry that the atmosphere sucks the moisture out of you.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive, but it works better than other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I always have very dry skin in winter.</li>
            <li> Works well to relieve very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any other lotion that works as well and as long as this lotion does.</li>
            <li> When you push the pump, it feels loose and just sinks in.</li>
            <li> Instant relief from itching and dryness, non greasy, a little does a lot.</li>
            <li> My legs get so dry in the winter and this is the only lotion I have found to tame the itch.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I began to notice little red patches all over my skin just as spring and the season of shorts was approaching.</li>
            <li> Every winter my hands begin the process of drying out to suddenly ending up in cracked knuckles, split cuticles, painful splits on tips of my fingers at the very tip of the nail groove, and splitting of the skin directly under the nail</li>
            <li> hands were dried and cracked to the point of physical pain when I started using this product.</li>
            <li> few hours my skin was back to before applying the cream.</li>
            <li> I use liberally it everyday, numerous times.</li>
            <li> It really hurts, but still I must wash which just makes it worse.</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding lotions that actually work for me</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times and am definitely</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I must wash my hands at least 20 times in a single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hand lotions have always been a major inconvenience for me.  </li>
            <li> So that means (actually used to mean) constant itch for me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> If your skin is really dry, the sensation of it staying on is soothing, but if you use it on completely dry skin, it can sometimes feel a little waxy with residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just run out, which, for me, is not smart as i&#x27;m already itching.  </li>
            <li> this aveeno gets the job done but you dont get the luxury feeling with other aveeno brands.</li>
            <li> This has helped a couple of itchy areas on my body that have been resistant to other lotions and creams.</li>
            <li> I am extremely picky when it comes to whether a moisturizer is greasy or not.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t need to keep trying other products</li>
            <li> After having some skin issues I have tried plenty of other products.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a little pricey in my opinion but does relieve the dry feeling of my hands.</li>
            <li> Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief Moisturizing Lotion is a product that I would recommend.  </li>
            <li> I was relectuant to try the Active Naturals Skin Relief Moisturizing Lotion with Soothing Oatmeal Essence</li>
            <li> its thick and rich but doesnt leave you feeling all greasy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I think this is just a little too greasy to use in any place that isn&#x27;t world weary and rough.  </li>
            <li> So I searched, found this blue bottle, and it works just as well (if not better) than the green bottle.  </li>
            <li> I really hate that it contains petroleum-based ingredients, but, like I said, I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li> There is still a smoothness and softness, and no sign of the dry tight feeling I usually have when I don&#x27;t use this.  </li>
            <li> We make less trips to Walgreens for hydrocortisone cream.</li>
            <li> When I found it for less than $10 a bottle for the 18-oz.</li>
            <li> I have been seriously abusing the skin on my hands for the last 10 months (since my baby was born)!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less greasy than the Aveeno green-labeled lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of lotion, including both off brands (not worth it, alas) and name brands.  </li>
            <li> so you may want to wait a little while before you hold anyone&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> Can adjust with a little mineral oil;&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> and i feel a little gummy afterwards but that feeling goes away.</li>
            <li> It runs in my family and I&#x27;ve had to deal with it all my life, so I have experience with all kinds of lotion since I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> then one day saw a deal on the green cap aveeno that i used to use</li>
            <li> My hands are smoother and softer than I can ever remember (despite it being the dead of winter at the time of writing this review).</li>
            <li> It works well for men because it does not including any scent, and is not greasy after a few minutes of sinking in.  </li>
            <li> My skin was so hopelessly dried out from chemo that not even vaseline could fix it.</li>
            <li> Because Amazon.com migrated the green aveeno bottle to their prime pantry.  </li>
            <li> previously i get all these rash like allergic reactions from using the wrong cream; especially on my face.</li>
            <li> Slight, not very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion as it helps my poor dry hands feel moisturized and softer.</li>
            <li> A very small amount will cut down on redness and bumps after shaving, been using it for years in both hot/dry to cold/wet conditions.</li>
            <li> It is the only product that relieves my itchy skin due to the cold weather.</li>
            <li> I  find it soothing, at least for a little while, but it does not cure eczema.  </li>
            <li> It can go on a little thick.</li>
            <li> I thought (but maybe not so for use during the day since I dislike slick</li>
            <li> I try everything to make the pump pull it up, but no luck; I find that I always have at least a few weeks where I throw the pump away and end up tapping the container against the palm of my hand to try to get the remaining lotion out.  </li>
            <li> No more if I use this once or twice per day.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face everyday at least twice.</li>
            <li> While this lotion is expensive, it works wonders for those with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Anyways, this moisturizer is a little thin</li>
            <li> My skin stays moisturizer for at least 24 hrs in the winters of Midwest.</li>
            <li> I had lost any hope to find a \\&quot;cure\\&quot; for my dermatitis, at least in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> If I put it on in the morning, I can still feel that I put it on late in the afternoon, but not in a greasy way.</li>
            <li> It was thick and just seemed to linger on my hands.  </li>
            <li> Room temperature it went to thick, where they stored it not maintain there orginal.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thick</li>
            <li> I needed something serious to put on my skin to rescue it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My worst skin problems are always taken care of quickly by this lotion.  </li>
            <li> - something in it is just no good.  </li>
            <li> I am always breaking out in hives, its really hard for me to find a product that works well with my skin, but I&#x27;ve never had an issue with Aveeno, please never change!</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll find it tough for removing mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply a very thick application, rub it in thoroughly, and go to bed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is very thick and use for after shower night treatments.</li>
            <li> The pump is broken.</li>
            <li> If I apply it to all the dry areas on my legs and arms, it gets sticky and I hate lying in my bed with any greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> it was awful, i hated it so much.</li>
            <li> apply it before bed at night and it works wonders, even in cold weather.  </li>
            <li> It has saved me from itching like crazy at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> as soon as I come in contact with dust, baby powder, cat dander, chalk, etc etc, I start scratching like crazy.</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with Aveeno!</li>
            <li> I usually get terrible hives and rashes after I shave my legs and the oil soothes it whilst in the shower and</li>
            <li> It was bad my skin burned in some spots.</li>
            <li> I even use this on my face without any bad reactions.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lighter Version:  [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t annoying; it just works.</li>
            <li> I HATE greasy lotions).  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I can definitely see how it can be a saver for dry skin issues. The minus is that it&#x27;s too sticky and wet for every day normal use for non-dry skin.</li>
            <li> It never fully absorbs to your skin. Wearing anything over top of this lotion is uncomfortable. Feels greasy and slimy until you wash it off.</li>
            <li> Aveeno has the best lotions!! This moisturizing lotion definitely kept my skin moisturized all day long!! I&#x27;d put it on after my shower at night and wake up the next day and not have to put more on!</li>
            <li> It is just what I have been looking for and needed. I like the moist feeling after applying it to my skin.  It helps with the frequent itching feeling I experience.</li>
            <li> A very small amount will cut down on redness and bumps after shaving, been using it for years in both hot/dry to cold/wet conditions.</li>
            <li> Slight, not very pleasant smell. But the moisturizer is great! My skin stays moisturizer for at least 24 hrs in the winters of Midwest.</li>
            <li> Great deal and does wonders for my skin</li>
            <li> This has to be the best lotion I have ever had - and I have gone through plenty of lotions.  I&#x27;ve tried like everything to find all natural and organic - non toxic - but I couldn&#x27;t find anything that touches this stuff ... so, I keep a stock pile of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Not as moisturizing as I had wished but I still think it is great lotion. I would suggest something different for DRY skin.</li>
            <li> Aveeno is No. 1... In lotion. God bless and thank you.</li>
            <li> We have found this lotion to be the best ,longest lasting moisturizer that we have used. no per-fumy smells either. This is a large bottle size.&lt;br /&gt; Amazon&#x27;s price is excellent.</li>
            <li> This lotion by Aveeno works super well for moisturizing dry skin.  Better than most lotions I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin.  I will be buying it until they stop making it because it suits my needs and the price is right.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I began to notice little red patches all over my skin just as spring and the season of shorts was approaching. One panicked trip to the dermatologist later, I found out that I had nummular eczema, which is basically a fancy way of saying that my skin was a dry, finicky old hag who I needed to start treating with kid gloves: no fabric softener, no perfumed skin products, and lots of daily moisturizing. My doctor recommended that I start using Aveeno products because their natural ingredients are among the gentlest on the skin, and she specifically said that the Aveeno Active Naturals lotions tend to do the best job at moisturizing. $10 seemed a little steep when I bought my first bottle from a local drugstore, but I swallowed my complaints and started applying this daily after my morning showers to help lock in the moisture. Within a week, the eczema had cleared up considerably, and not long after that I actually started getting unsolicited compliments on how soft and smooth my skin was -- it had gone from \\&quot;angry hag\\&quot; to \\&quot;cooing baby\\&quot; in just under a month (Benjamin Button, eat your heart out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from it helping alleviate my skin condition, this Aveeno lotion is also just pleasant to use; it&#x27;s unscented and unobtrusive, and it rubs into your skin really well without leaving any funky, sticky residue behind. After a while I started using Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save service to stock up, which has saved me money (it&#x27;s usually under $8 per bottle) and the worry that I&#x27;ll ever run out of this great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: Aveeno products may cost more than other brands, but they&#x27;re worth it. Take it from a former hag-skinned girl.</li>
            <li> My 18 year old girl loves this lotion. My 7 year old has a very dry itchy skin but this lotion does not seem to help. But I am glad it suit my other daughter :)</li>
            <li> While this lotion is expensive, it works wonders for those with dry skin. I purchased this because my hands are really dry, and a week of this fixed that up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way I can describe it is that it creates a \\&quot;film\\&quot; over your hands that traps moisture in. It isn&#x27;t annoying; it just works. It isn&#x27;t greasy and it lasts long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the one in the green bottle, this one feels better when it is on, but I think the one in the green bottle (without the \\&quot;soothing oatmeal essence\\&quot;) lasts longer.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I do not like moisturizers with perfumes.  We both like this one very much because it absorbs into the skin and doesn&#x27;t smell like a perfume counter.  We use it every day and before going to sleep.  This is a heavier version of the Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion; if you like a lighter lotion, you may want to try that one.  This lotion has shea butter which is super rich &amp; moisturizing.  It will feel a little greasy when you first put it on but it absorbs quickly &amp; becomes less greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works wonders on dry heels, elbows &amp; chapped hands.  And it does this without perfumey stink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lighter Version:  [[ASIN:B001459IEE Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion, 18 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> This works great for dry skin and absorbs well.  There is no fragrance.  It is the perfect companion for the aveeno itchy skin body wash.  Perfect for anyone with dry, itchy skin or eczema.  Love the Aveeno brand in general!</li>
            <li> This lotion is perfect for our 2 year old&#x27;s sensitive skin. Not only did this help clear her up but the entire family now uses it - I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this lotion.  Better than all of the other baby lotions we tried!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this again. In comparison to [[ASIN:B00182ERTO Gold Bond  Ultimate Restoring Lotion, With CoQ10, 13-Ounce Bottle]] , I feel that this one \\&quot;soaks\\&quot; in a little more but both are very good and I will be ordering them again. I do use this lotion in combination with [[ASIN:B002ZN3JF8 Aveeno Positively Nourishing Aveeno Smoothing Body Wash, Pomegranate + Rice, 16 ounces]] in the morning and that body wash with the Goldbond ultimate at night. My skin is naturally extremely dry but with the help of this lotion (that DOES last 24 hours when applied generously, when you need it to) I&#x27;ve learned how to keep the dryness at bay. I can&#x27;t really speak for the price as I haven&#x27;t really looked for this item in the store but Aveeno products are pretty expensive compared to other brands so I&#x27;m pretty sure Amazon&#x27;s price is very close to that of a store like Wal-Mart etc.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion every.  I just love that it works so well with no greasey mess or feel.  Definitely worth paying a little extra than cheap lotion.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous stuff.</li>
            <li> No oily residue. works well.</li>
            <li> This is the only non-prescription lotion that calms dry redness for me in the winter.</li>
            <li> This skin conditioner seems to work better than most skin conditioners I&#x27;ve used, I can rub the conditioner in to a point that my hands do not feel greasy. My hands do feel better as well, at least until I wash my hands once to often.  I will continue buying this product. Amazon packages it really good and ships it promptly.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT AT REASONABLE PRICE.</li>
            <li> My son has dry skin issues.  This product works well for him.  It is a little expensive, but it works better than other products I have tried.  I recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> Excellent all around body general moisturize for a fair price. It spreads and is absorbed easily plus is long lasting.  Yet  its not greasy and is odorless nor does it clogs facial pores. I am a senior male with dry skin and mild  eczema living in humid Florida. After trying other moisturizers I found this one to be best for me. Very fair pricing for large pumps on Amazon with free ship for Prime members. Recommend with no reservations.</li>
            <li> This lotion is all I use. It has no fragrance so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my perfume. It keeps my skin supple and lovely all day. Use it right after showering in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Aveeno products and they were all fantastic. This one is no different. It works great on my itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li> Every winter my hands begin the process of drying out to suddenly ending up in cracked knuckles, split cuticles, painful splits on tips of my fingers at the very tip of the nail groove, and splitting of the skin directly under the nail itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work a lot with wood (cutting, sanding, and filling), dirt (gardening etc), and many other DIY activities that all seem to contribute to this drying effect even more.  Furthermore, I must wash my hands at least 20 times in a single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hand lotions have always been a major inconvenience for me.  Putting lotion on during the day means having to deal with slippery hands, shiny keyboards, and the application of putting the lotion on all of the time (and going through it really fast).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed something amazing.  I needed a \\&quot;one-and-done\\&quot; nightly regimen.  I must have tried 4 or 5 different brands.  Nothing seemed to really work that good.  The other products made it better, but didn&#x27;t cure the issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first purchased the Aveeno lotion from a local grocer.  I knew from the first application, this lotion just felt different.  It was thick and just seemed to linger on my hands.  This was great I thought (but maybe not so for use during the day since I dislike slick hands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough, I have been using this lotion for over a year now and it really really REALLY works.  I am able to apply this lotion at night just before bed (I keep it on my nightstand).  I apply a very thick application, rub it in thoroughly, and go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with that nightly treatment, I not only prevent the symptoms of dry skin I was dealing with (above), but if I become lax in my nightly usage in the winter and the dryness returns, I can cure it within one to two nightly treatments (and kick myself as I promise not to go to bed anymore without the lotion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this as the solution to severe issues of dry hands.  I will be upset if this product is ever discontinued.  Yes it costs more than your store brand, but you will get something that works very well.</li>
            <li> Not as moisturizing as I would like but haven&#x27;t found anything better yet. At last it is non greasy</li>
            <li> I like this lotion because it goes on easily, does not smell and sinks into the skin very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice, big size and should last thru the winter months - very pleased I chose Aveeno.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by our dermatologist.  Really makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li> As described. Works good.</li>
            <li> Never feels like it sinks in completely (leaves a bit of residue), but overall seems to moisture fairly well.</li>
            <li> But it look old. Room temperature it went to thick, where they stored it not maintain there orginal.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Excellent company</li>
            <li> To me, the only way that this product could be better is if it was made in the USA (but I&#x27;ll take Canada over China any day!). Anyways, this moisturizer is a little thin so you may want to wait a little while before you hold anyone&#x27;s hand. :) My husband said that it felt greasy, but the product just needs a few minutes to absorb fully into your skin. My hands and elbows feel great!</li>
            <li> Aveeno is the only one I will use. Absorbs great and not greasy. Lasts for hours even through handwashing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had allergies since I was a baby and my skin always gets itchy and I get rashes on on my arms and legs. My mom&#x27;s a nurse and she&#x27;s made sure of it I try pretty much any treatment she can get her hands on, though this is pretty much the only thing that can stop me from scratching my skin raw. It stops itching instantly and gets rid of whatever damage I&#x27;ve done within a day or two. Recommend to anyone with eczema or allergies, it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I issues with dry skin, so I&#x27;ve tried a number of different products.  This is by far the best.  While others are oily, the Aveeno product is much creamer and absorbs quickly into the skin.  The improvement in skin quality is just as good as with other brands as well, so it is not as though it cheats to be able to be absorbed better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend anyone who needs a moisturizer give it a try.</li>
            <li> This lotion is Great when you have chicken pox.  It&#x27;s also great for everyday use.  It really helps the skin</li>
            <li> meets my expectations</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my hands.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of creams, lotions, including other Aveeno lotions, pure raw Shea Butter, prescription creams, Burt&#x27;s Bees, etc, etc.  Nothing worked, until I tried this Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it before bed at night and it works wonders, even in cold weather.  My eczema is just about gone.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, your results may vary.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;24 Hour&amp;#34; version seems to have some ingredient which makes it more effective.</li>
            <li> The best body lotion for someone with dry skin. Not greasy and your skin will soak it up and remain moisturized. Aveeno is the best value and quality lotion out there.</li>
            <li> I will keep getting this as it is wonderful for cold weather with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I always have very dry skin in winter. This is the only lotion that works. I already use 10 bottles and this is good.</li>
            <li> Finally found a lotion for dry skin that absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel &#x27;heavy!&#x27; Silky smooth and just a hint of almond fragrance. Easy dispenser plastic container that will  fit just about anywhere it&#x27;s most convenient . . . bathroom, bedroom or kitchen. Description, product information, color and visual is accurate.&lt;br /&gt;This is now on &#x27;my favorites&#x27; list . . . definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find a good body lotion in 2015. My absolute favorite part of this is it is NOT scented. It also makes my skin very smooth and soft throughout the entire day but more importantly has NO smell and I can wear my perfume with it and not have a whirlwind of smells going on.</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and it is so dry that the atmosphere sucks the moisture out of you. I have to have a mild soap and a strong lotion.  Some of the strong lotions are oily and I don&#x27;t like that greasy feeling.  This lotion does the job, feels nice, and has a light scent.  It has saved me from itching like crazy at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after applying this lotion. It also has a very relaxing, mild oat scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is I bought this when my knuckles were cracked from the dry winter months and it made my skin burn after applying it because of the alcohol in the ingredients list.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my dry skin, used it for a long time then one day saw a deal on the green cap aveeno that i used to use so thought what the heck if I have to use it more often it is worth the price difference. OH SO NOT TRUE, gave the other away and went and bought more of this it is absolutely the best for me anyhow</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of the product and the nice relief it gives to my mom&#x27;s dry yet sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> As a man with chronically dry hands, I have struggled to find a moisturizer that works effectively, doesn&#x27;t leave my hands smelling of perfume and does not leave oily residue behind. This Aveeno moisturizer is entirely fragrance-free, and within two minutes any oily feeling caused by the moisturizer is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands were dried and cracked to the point of physical pain when I started using this product. I noticed a difference by the next day, and within two weeks my hands were perfectly healthy again. My hands are smoother and softer than I can ever remember (despite it being the dead of winter at the time of writing this review). I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product, and I would strongly recommend it to anyone dealing with dry hands!</li>
            <li> Feels great and I like that it is fragrance free as well. Would definitely recommend for people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> this aveeno gets the job done but you dont get the luxury feeling with other aveeno brands. im just saying</li>
            <li> I love this lotion will purchase again real soon</li>
            <li> I got the two pack and wish I hadn&#x27;t -- it moisturizes well, like vaseline almost without being greasy. but the scent is very strong and medicinal - something in it is just no good.  I will stick to Aveeno&#x27;s oatmeal line of lotions to moisturize my winter skin!</li>
            <li> My husband and I have both used this Aveeno lotion for years and it is a staple in our home. I keep a bottle by each sink. It is perfect for my hands as it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. I work on a computer much of the day and so this is very important to me. It also helps to heal severely dry and even cracked skin and it&#x27;s fragrance free, another plus! My husband uses this on his face each day after his shower and says it&#x27;s perfect since it is not too heavy or oily. I like to stock up here on Amazon since it is much more affordable to do so and I definitely recommend this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Very good lotion.  Goes on without too much icky-sticky feeling and leaves skin feeling good.</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno products. I have very sensitive skin and every new thing i try I am always breaking out in hives, its really hard for me to find a product that works well with my skin, but I&#x27;ve never had an issue with Aveeno, please never change!</li>
            <li> Most lotions I try somewhat sting my hands or leave them feel almost soapy. Aveeno, on the other hand, always meets my expectations in quickly absorbing into dry skin and not leaving any greasiness or tingling. This stuff definitely works as a basic lotion for everyday use and I&#x27;d highly recommend it if you&#x27;re fed up with other types.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  very good quality</li>
            <li> its mild, its gentle and previously i get all these rash like allergic reactions from using the wrong cream; especially on my face. Used to be confused on what product was good for me. After trying a million and one products, a friend recomended Aveeno. its thick and rich but doesnt leave you feeling all greasy and uncomfortable. The lotion is easily absorbed into the skin. i could go on and on but lets just say im glad i finally found whats good for my sensitive and delicate skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best for the price.  You are still soft 24 hours after application.  I personally think its the best on the market and I&#x27;ve used a gazillion lotions over the years.  This just lasts.</li>
            <li> I am super sensitive, especially in the winter and my doctor recommended this. It has worked wonders for my skin. I wish it smelled a little better but the smell is not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> I like this pair of trousers, very fit.If there is need to buy pants, will once again to visit.For the first time to buy, so size a bit error, but after the purchase, I&#x27;ll choose to more suitable size.</li>
            <li> works great with babies, and adults. skin is soft and smooth , fast shipping</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate at high elevation, so my skin tends to crack, etc.  I&#x27;ve tried several brands of lotion, including both off brands (not worth it, alas) and name brands.  Of these, Aveeno is the best for my hands and elbows.  It provides immediate, soothing relief and works long term.  It soaks into the skin quickly and is barely greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using this on my cheeks, which get very chapped, and I replaced dryness with acne!  And yes, my cheeks were dry enough to flake a bit, so it wasn&#x27;t the dryness factor.  I think this is just a little too greasy to use in any place that isn&#x27;t world weary and rough.  So if you&#x27;re looking for something for shoulders or face, I&#x27;d say look elsewhere.  However, if your hands/arms/legs/etc. are the issue, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> It works and moistens  very dry skin better than anything else I have tried.  I would recommend this to everyone but especially someone who is 60 or over.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very mousturizing.  It doesn&#x27;t have the best smell since it&#x27;s unscented, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Strange cream and defective bottle.</li>
            <li> Unscented and soothing.</li>
            <li> My husband approves this lotion! He loves that it has almost no smell and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I bought two, one for the bathroom and one by the kitchen sink.</li>
            <li> I live in the woods and I am glad that I could order it online. The lotion is not greasy and it moisturizes my skin perfectly  :)</li>
            <li> My ALL time favorite moisturizer. Great buy here on Amazon vs in local stores like CVS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other moisturizers (including others from Aveeno), but this is the ONLY one that keeps me moisturized all day long. It keeps my skin from cracking or turing white-flaky-dry. I use it every night and take it with me everywhere. Best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a little pricey in my opinion but does relieve the dry feeling of my hands. Very mild smell and not too greasy.</li>
            <li> I have tired a few other brands of hand lotion and I for some reason or another like the Aveeno brand of hand lotion the best. It just seems to work pretty good for my extremely dry hands. Plus it feels good on my dry hands, more so because I wash my hands a lot. Thanks to Amazon for the better pricing then what I could find in a near by store, heck I can&#x27;t even find this big of a bottle at some of my local stores.. so it was nice to know that Amazon had it in stock and at a good price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  This is stronger and longer lasting than the original (Standard Green) aveeno daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Second bottle I have tried. Dispenser does not work. Lotion is so so.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use this daily.  We cannot find it in our local stores, and it works so much better than the other Aveeno products.  It works well for men because it does not including any scent, and is not greasy after a few minutes of sinking in.  My wife loves it too, so much so we put it on subscribe and save.  There is nothing better.</li>
            <li> Aveeno is always a great product - their lotions are more moisturizing and healing. If you have ezcema or worse, try their ezcema cream, it&#x27;s pretty effective.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin. This helps deal with that.  Can&#x27;t ask for more.  Great product. I would highly recommend for folks in my position.</li>
            <li> i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The paper envelope it arrived in was not substantial enough for the weight of the bottle. The pump doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ll probably have to transfer to another bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Great moisturizing and kind to my very sensitive skin.  My husband likes it too because it is fragrance free.  Can&#x27;t have him smelling like a girl :)</li>
            <li> I threw mines out. It smelled terrible I guess from storage. Better off buying it at the store</li>
            <li> I love it.  Stays good and moist all day and works all the time.</li>
            <li> This has helped a couple of itchy areas on my body that have been resistant to other lotions and creams. It&#x27;s definitely more effective.</li>
            <li> Nice product for dry skin during these summer time.</li>
            <li> The pump is broken. It looks like it was already not working prior to shipping since the plastic it was wrapped in has lotion all in it. Disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;I see another reviewer confirms their dispenser isn&#x27;t working either - maybe it&#x27;s a faulty batch.</li>
            <li> This brand is always top notch, moisturizes skin without leaving an oily feel/film.  Absorbs into skin without a problem. I also love this pump version, makes it really easy to get moisturizer without getting it all over the outside of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I like aveeno lotion. Good for my sensitive and dry skin. The goods is well packed and fast delivery together with other goods I bought.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been suffering from eczema since she was a baby. She is seven years old now. She used to get allergies from milk,egg &amp; tree nuts and dust. Now she has recovered from all these except tree nuts. Her skin was extremely dry and regularly gets rashes on neck, knees, elbows and some times on face and scratches her skin a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since she was a baby we have tried with so many moisturizing creams and lotions as per the suggestions from her pediatricians, dermatologists &amp; Allergy specialists. We have also tried various prescription based cartizones. So far, we have tried Cetaphil (cream and lotion), Eucerine (cream and lotion), CeraVe(cream) and Vanicream moisturizing creams. None these creams helped her to improve her symptoms or dryness of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently when were shopping at Walmart, I had noticed Aveeno Skin Relief moisturizing lotion and thought of give a try. With in three days, we noticed her skin was getting smoother and shiny. Now we have completed one month of using this lotion for my daughter. Now her skin is lot brighter than before, dryness is disappearing slowly and rarely scratching her skin. Surprisingly, she has also started recovering from all her rashes from her common spots from behind the neck, knees and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days ago we visited my daughter&#x27;s allergy Doctor for a regular appointment and he has surprised to see the improvement in her skin. He has suggested to try with Aveeno Skin cream during winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are really thankful to Aveeno.</li>
            <li> Buy this kind of Aveeno all the time. No fragrance, all day long protection, can use on face, hands and everywhere. Good price on Amazon if do subscribe and save</li>
            <li> Great product would buy again.  Value and quality very happy with purchase. . I recommend this product to anyone considering purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Aveeno products are always a good buy and this one didn&#x27;t disappoint.  We live in the desert which can be very dry, so a product of this nature and at this price is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion for dry skin I have found.</li>
            <li> Very nice and good quality. I recommend</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have dry skin and my fiance has Psoriasis.  I am not going to say it cured his psoriasis but he does like the fact that is does not have added perfumes and helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I have sensitive skin and in the winter, my skin gets extremely dry. I&#x27;ve tried oils and other lotions, which have left my skin almost as dry, entirely too greasy or caused some kind of irritation. After hearing about how Aveeno had oatmeal in it, I decided to give it a try and have been using it for more than a year now. I don&#x27;t know what took me so long to find this but, I love it! Thanks Aveeno.</li>
            <li> 1. Keeps hand and joints from cracking during winter months;&lt;br /&gt;2. Not sticky;&lt;br /&gt;3. Lasts longer than Regular Aveeno;&lt;br /&gt;4. Can adjust with a little mineral oil;&lt;br /&gt;5. Will replace regular Aveeno purchased at Costco with this better product and it does not stink . . . fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I love this. great for my sensitive skin. love not having to clip coupons. get it cheaper on amazon with having 5 items shipped monthly</li>
            <li> Works great on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> it is not what I like much.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;ll relieve skin ---by covering it with a waxy, draggy, thick layer of skin soothers. After receiving 3+ tubes of this, i&#x27;ve used enough to experience the sticky film that stays on your body, rendering you too filmy to touched by your loved one (forget a night of intimacy unless you want to stick uncomfortably), and squeakiness when rubbing your legs together.  It will not leave you smooth-feeling at all.  And if it&#x27;s summer or hot weather -- ew. that sticky residue will collect grime like a magnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that aside, i have to say it does soothe irritated skin. I use it as a makeup remover (use it like Pond&#x27;s) and any redness or blotchiness disappears along with the makeup on a cotton ball. It&#x27;s a decent cream cleanser but you&#x27;ll find it tough for removing mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all -- for body, i rate it a 1.&lt;br /&gt;For the face as a makeup remover, i rate it a 4.</li>
            <li> Aveeno is the best in lotion ,love this product!</li>
            <li> I use this for the gang in the office, It does a great job moisturizing and people with sensitive skin can use it too! The men love it because it have no scent.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this lotion while using the other Aveeno lotions and was looking for something better as I have extremely dry skin and although I do not have eczema I thought I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! it really works. I&#x27;ve put it on subscribe and save so that I can have a regular supply of it.  I&#x27;ve just run out, which, for me, is not smart as i&#x27;m already itching.  During the winter I used it every day, during the summer about twice a week (my back needs about every 2 days).  Now I have it on subscribe and save, i&#x27;ll be using it more often so that I get the full affects of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for about 4 years and I would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin.  It has no perfumes which to some can cause skin rashes/itchiness. It&#x27;s moisturizing effect is long lasting.  Though a bit more expensive than others, it is worth it.  This solved my problem with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Smooth and creamy.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve used!  It is unscented and has a creamy feel but dries matte. My skin does feel moisturized all day when I put this on.</li>
            <li> Soothing lotion with no allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> My family all have sensitive skin and eczema. We have been using this for awhile now and works fantastic vs any other lotion for sensitive skin and/or eczema. We make less trips to Walgreens for hydrocortisone cream. This particular lotion comes in this huge bottle and lasts us months on end! You did it again, Aveeno!</li>
            <li> My hair is completely damage because of I straightened way too much! I started using Aveeno and OH BOY! what a difference it was!, my hair has gone back to it&#x27;s black, soft, natural, and beautiful look! A MUST HAVE PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I use the body wash and conditioner as well, and OMG!</li>
            <li> It is simply the best everyday body lotion that I have found.  It has very minimal scent (everything has at least SOME scent, but this one I can barely even tell,) it is not greasy, and it rubs in quickly.  Also, compared to a lot of products out there, it is very reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only &amp;#34;whine&amp;#34; about this is the same thing I run into with a lot of lotions ... when the dispenser stops &amp;#34;drawing&amp;#34; up the lotion there is inevitably LOTS of lotion still left in the bottom of the container.  I try everything to make the pump pull it up, but no luck; I find that I always have at least a few weeks where I throw the pump away and end up tapping the container against the palm of my hand to try to get the remaining lotion out.  It&#x27;s almost like trying to get Heinz ketchup out of a new ketchup bottle.</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with Aveeno!</li>
            <li> My son uses this on his eczema. He has tried others with this brand and this one works the best and on works best on damp skin.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the ingredients are mostly natural that they don&#x27;t pose health concern. it doesn&#x27;t contain sulfate or parabens. But I won&#x27;t use it, cuz it feels greasy on my skin.I am extremely picky when it comes to whether a moisturizer is greasy or not. If I apply it to all the dry areas on my legs and arms, it gets sticky and I hate lying in my bed with any greasy feeling. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy only when I only apply a tiny small dot. I will try a new body cream called California baby cream which costs a lot but the product uses more organic oils, I think it&#x27;ll be less greasy to me.</li>
            <li> excellent cream softens skin, my child has dry skin and moisturizes dermatitis, and especially that I was sent on time.</li>
            <li> This is most probably the best skin cream I have ever used. It really moisturizes your skin and leaves it feeling soft and silky!! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> great product which i can now buy at the local store at the same or even cheaper prices.  Believe if they want to sell on line better come up with a different price structure.  No problem with pakcing or deliver,,,</li>
            <li> Love this body lotion, never had problems with it. But it came with the defected lid. When you push the pump, it feels loose and just sinks in. Had to replace it with the old one. Not a big deal but kind of unpleasant moment.</li>
            <li> My skin was so hopelessly dried out from chemo that not even vaseline could fix it. I tried this instead, and wow! Not only is my skin amazingly moisturized 24/7, my chemo itching is gone. In addition, the product has no nauseating fragrance, and it absorbs right away (having to wait for lotion to absorb is one of my pet peeves). Highly-recommended for us chemo folks!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and most lotions cause irritation and sometimes a rash.  This lotion does not.  It is wonderfully hydrating, soothing and not greasy.  I am sold on it!  The only other lotion I can use is Vanicream, but Aveeno Skin Relief is my favorite.  I will continue purchasing it from amazon.</li>
            <li> This holds up for many hours.  I do not find it greasy.  I also appreciate the lack of fragrance.  It&#x27;s just a good, basic lotion to help prevent cracks during winter.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, especially for very dry skin.  Best to use immediately after the shower when you&#x27;re still a little damp. It can go on a little thick. If your skin is really dry, the sensation of it staying on is soothing, but if you use it on completely dry skin, it can sometimes feel a little waxy with residue. Either way, it was a tremendous help for my dry skin and I would easily recommend it!</li>
            <li> My family has lots of allergies and very sensitive skin - we love the Aveeno products.  I use it myself as weel as on my children ages 7 to 11years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been attacked by dry itchy skin over the last few months and this is the only item that helps to soothe my skin. Thank you Aveeno!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best lotions I have used. It is really thick but dries light. I have really sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t use scented lotion. The ingredients are really gentle and this lotion is truly unscented. You also get a lot for the money. I will probably purchase this again.</li>
            <li> As a health care worker in the dermatology field, I have heard many colleagues recommend Aveeno and Eucerin products.  So I have used many products by both brands, as well as those of other over-the-counter brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, many products promise much, deliver little.  I have actually stopped reading the advertisement on the bottles of lotion, as I no longer believe any of the claims made by manufacturers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief Moisturizing Lotion is a product that I would recommend.  Like all Aveeno lotions, it is hypoallergenic, and comes in fragrance-free form.  It is of medium thickness, but dries without greasy residue.  It DOES leave hands feeling softer.  I assume that it is an aqueous, rather than oil-based product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, it seems that this lotion is similar to hundreds of others.  The cooling effect of the lotion is unique and really works.  Our family has a mixture of oily and dry skin, oily and dry scalps and extremities.  Some of us have had eczema.  Some are prone to rashes, poison ivy, allergies.  This lotion does feel better on both oily and dry skin.  The cooling sensation lasts for 5-10 minutes, but the softer skin lasts for several hours.  It is better than almost every other over-the-counter cream or lotion that I have used for the dry, cracked skin that comes from winter dry weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are reliant on this lotion to get us through the worst of winter.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is very good for dry skin. In winter my skin tends to get dry and after i started using this lotion it helped me overcome this problem</li>
            <li> The Aveeno skin relif helps in great way to relieve dry skin, it is a very good product. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> We use this body lotion from face to feet.  Keeps skin silky soft and not sticky, all day. You might have to reapply to your hands due to hand washing, but so far a very good product used by whole family.</li>
            <li> Within a few applications, this lotion has transformed dry cracking hands back to reasonably moisturized. It has worked much better than other lotions for me. The EWG gives it a safety score of 2 (scale of 0 to 10, lower is safer).</li>
            <li> I use this product for several years as moisturizer for my body&#x27;s skin. great absorption and effectiveness in keeping the skin moisturized till the next use.</li>
            <li> Why is this my new go-to?  Because Amazon.com migrated the green aveeno bottle to their prime pantry.  So I searched, found this blue bottle, and it works just as well (if not better) than the green bottle.  A tiny bit greasy at first, but goes away very quickly (trust me, I HATE greasy lotions).  Works great, buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this lotion because he gets rashes when he shaves, especially in the winter time.  He keeps a container of Aveeno on the bathroom counter year around.  He is 61 and I hate to say it but everyone is always saying what young looking skin he has when I never hear that.  Now that I meantion that, I think I&#x27;m going to start sneaking some for myself and see if I can get some compliments too.  He loves this product.</li>
            <li> easy to absorb! great one</li>
            <li> great stuff -- not greasy and lasts for the advertised 24 hours.  Recommended by my dermatologist and we are both happy with the results.  If you can get 18 oz bottles for under $10 each, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for very dry skin. Not my most favorite but it works well</li>
            <li> This lotion was okay but it wasn&#x27;t fantastic. Would be good for the winter but a little much for the warmer months</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion on the planet.  I already had some, and needed something to complete my order.  Couldn&#x27;t think of a better item.  It is all natural and full of healthy ingredients that are wonderful on the skin.  Use it with the skin relief body wash and your skin will be in the best condition of your life.</li>
            <li> I order this all the time. It is the only product that relieves my itchy skin due to the cold weather.</li>
            <li> I am 32 and suffered my whole life (since 8 months old) from atopic dermatitis. The many skin and blood tests I did always turned out negative, but it is clear I am allergic to fine powders: as soon as I come in contact with dust, baby powder, cat dander, chalk, etc etc, I start scratching like crazy. Carpet in particular attracts so much dust, and it is in every single apartment (and I cannot afford a house). So that means (actually used to mean) constant itch for me.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion, along with the aveeno intense moisturizer that comes in jars, has been nothing short of a miracle for me. It creates a film on the skin that lasts for a whole day, and it is not greasy so it does not attract dust and fine powders. My chronic itch has stopped from the first day I have used it (few months ago). Since I started using it, I have not had a single episode of extended rash, while for my whole life I had to cover myself in cortisone not to have constant extended itch.&lt;br /&gt;I am SO grateful for this lotion. I had lost any hope to find a \\&quot;cure\\&quot; for my dermatitis, at least in my lifetime. I saw dozens of dermatologists over the decades, and I have been prescribed tons of different lotions. Yet none helped, before the aveeno moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;Although this lotion is technically not a cure for atopic dermatitis, since atopic dermatitis is a genetic condition, it effectively stops all symptoms. My life is now normal. It is awesome to be able to spend days and nights without being tormented by unbearable itch.&lt;br /&gt;I just hope Aveeno does not stop making its moisturizers, and that they do not change the formula!</li>
            <li> I live in dry Las Vegas and this product is keeping my feet and legs moisturized.  Was having dryness to the point of bleeding when I scratched them.  Now they don&#x27;t itch any more.  I apply before sleep, keep my feet on a towel for the minute it takes to absorb and life is good!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin on my legs and have been using the Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion for about a couple of years now and found after about&lt;br /&gt;a few hours my skin was back to before applying the cream. I was relectuant to try the Active Naturals Skin Relief Moisturizing Lotion with Soothing Oatmeal Essence&lt;br /&gt;as most of the reviewers used this cream with skin ailments like eczema etc. which I do not have and thought this cream would be an over kill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I took a leap of faith and was plesantly surprised. I am living in a place where the temperature fluctuates from the 40-70F in January. It is dry at times and there is 90% humudity. I am using this cream for over 3 weeks now and found it not to leave an oily layer on my skin or any stains on the inside of my clothes like many other creams do.&lt;br /&gt;What I like the most is- I apply this cream after a shower in the evening and it keeps my skin moistured for more than 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many of the other brands including the Neutrogena Deep Moisture Hand Cream, Butter Cream as well but find this cream good for price vs value and the job it does.</li>
            <li> This is the best body moisturizer I have ever used.  I have itchy dry skin and I only need to apply it once and I am comfortable all day.</li>
            <li> I have itchy dry skin and since I have been using this lotion, my problem is 10 times better. I usually wait for a sale at CVS or Rite Aid, but a lot of times even the sale isn&#x27;t very discounted. When I found it for less than $10 a bottle for the 18-oz. siz, I decided it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this and best price through Amazon add on program, this is part of my subscription</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that helps with my dry itchy skin.  I don&#x27;t believe that I could live without it!</li>
            <li> I have suffered with skin problems all of my life.  Sometimes worse, sometimes better, but I always seem to return to the Aveeno.  My worst skin problems are always taken care of quickly by this lotion.  Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> I find that it does control egzema better than Curel, and actually promotes healthy skin growth.  It took an entire bottle with every day use to clear up the mess on my leg.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time &amp; could not have been more happy with the service. It was well packaged, everyone in my house loves Aveeno moisturizing lotion- especially for winter.</li>
            <li> Being diabetic, dry skin is always an issue, and living in the mountains, especially during winter. Instant relief from itching and dryness, non greasy, a little does a lot.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. I have dry  skin and this does works great. Not too greasy, oily. My only complaint is its expensive, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found, so I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best lotion as it continues to do its job of moisturizing until I take my next shower&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for carrying this product</li>
            <li> It works on my dry skin and i don&#x27;t have to continually apply on my hands all day long....This hand lotion is now my best friend ..i don&#x27;t need to keep trying other products</li>
            <li> It works really well, but makes my hands repel water and moisture so they feel clammy for hours after using it. Makes my hands smooth and soft though, unlike others I&#x27;ve used that seem to work for an hour or two, but then feel dried out.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer, and I keep a bottle of it on hand. I does moisturize for a 24-hour period and calms the skin. It was the first Aveeno product I used--and I definitely plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found any other lotion that works as well and as long as this lotion does. I really hate that it contains petroleum-based ingredients, but, like I said, I haven&#x27;t found anything better. When you have severely dry and sensitive skin, you just have to go with what works, and this is my go-to product for skin issues.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re big fans of Aveeno products in general and this one did not dissapoint.  Works well to relieve very dry skin.  I even use a bit on my lips before bed to prevent chapping.  Works better then any chap stick/lip balm I&#x27;ve tried.  It is a thicker lotion so takes a bit longer to absorb but well worth.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this at night after I shower and my skin is still silky smooth the entire next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not feel greasy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> First time in 2 years that I have been able to control my dry flaky skin, It did not, however make me look like Jennifer Aniston.</li>
            <li> Okay so I have yet to see a dermatologist to see what the heck is really up with my skin. My skin has always been so irritable and itchy and dry and I break out in hives daily. Especially after I shower. I bought this and the Aveeno bath/shower oil after I was desperate to find any product that would soothe my skin&#x27;s problems and it has honestly helped tremendously. Majority of the time it soothes my itchiness ad dryness right away. It works that much better with the shower oil. I usually get terrible hives and rashes after I shave my legs and the oil soothes it whilst in the shower and the aveeno lotion soothes it while I&#x27;m out. Great products. I would absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have really dry, irritated skin. This is the only product that I have found to work on me to alleviate my itch and keep my skin feeling moisturized. I have tried others such as Curell, Eucerin, Neutrogena, but Aveeno is the best for me! I use liberally it everyday, numerous times.</li>
            <li> it smooth the skin well and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent. great deal. the bottle was a little bit defective but it is ok does not affect the use</li>
            <li> This was old stock and the pump did not work.&lt;br /&gt;I should have returned it but I threw it out.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and sensitive. I look for products that are fragrance free. This lotion meets my needs. When you apply it in the morning you are set for the day,  I reccommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I used to have extremely dry skin and everyone noticed, it was awful, i hated it so much. Finally a friend who also used to have dry skin recommended this product to me. She has a huge bottle of it at home and during the day she brings a small sample sized bottle of it with her in her purse and she let me try it. That afternoon i drove to the store to buy it.How did i live without it.My skin is no longer dry, its soft and i am so happy. Everyone now asks me now what product i used to get such soft skin. It Is Honestly Silk In A Bottle!!!! I highly recommend this product!!! If you try this product you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno. I&#x27;ve been using it for several years. I never fails to make my skin better. I recommend it to all my friends with skin problems and without.</li>
            <li> this lotion is awesome for dry or extra sensitive skin. I use it in the winter and never get ashy.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that deals with my constant itchy lower legs. No more if I use this once or twice per day.</li>
            <li> Not as soothing as the Aveeno with oatmeal.</li>
            <li> I love aveeno products and I love this lotion. It really helps my dry skin and I can use it safely on my son.</li>
            <li> I really hate smearing lotion on myself, it&#x27;s just not my thing, ya know... it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; of slime like a lot of other lotions do. I think I&#x27;m a special case when it comes to dry skin... I probably don&#x27;t drink enough water, in fact, I know I don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I have to say, of all the numerous body lotions I have used this is the best!  I have always used body lotion and have found that Aveeno moisturizes the best of all.  It is not greasy, nice natural scent and does keep my skin moisturized much longer than the others.  Now this version is even better than the regular.  I have psoriasis and this lotion actually helps with the scales and redness.  Just amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It keeps my skin healthy from dryness and itchiness. I use this lotion in the summer and Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream in the winter. It works perfectly well.</li>
            <li> Very effective. Silky smooth skin!</li>
            <li> Nice body lotion.  I do like the Aveeno products very much.  I have somewhat sensitive skin and this leaves it nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause any itching, absorbs in well.</li>
            <li> I have been seriously abusing the skin on my hands for the last 10 months (since my baby was born)! I have been washing them about 50 times a day (not literally, but it feels like that) and my skin looks like a snake shedding &amp; is cracked &amp; bleeding. It really hurts, but still I must wash which just makes it worse. I&#x27;ve tried MANY remedies lotions, special soaps, Shea butter &amp; Vaseline....but nothing works! Most of the time it just stings really bad &amp; feels smoother till the next time I wash &amp; then it&#x27;s back to cracking, bleeding pain.&lt;br /&gt; This stuff is AMAZING!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I noticed a difference and it didn&#x27;t sting one bit! It&#x27;s only been a few days and already my skin is looking better and the cracking &amp; bleeding has stopped! It will take some time to repair all the damage I did, but I have no doubt that this lotion will do the trick quickly!!!!</li>
            <li> I picked the 3.5 oz (100g) tube of this product off the supermarket shelf for silly reasons: it was bigger than most hand creams there but it was small enough to fit into my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a few days, I noticed that my hands and especially fingers felt soft and slightly slippery even after rinsing with water. I happen to read the text on the back of the packaging: the second of a list of 4 bullets said \\&quot;Lasts through hand washing.\\&quot; Of course, if you use strong soap and really scrub, you do have to re-apply the lotion afterwards, but I noticed that even after washing out a glass using dish detergent, my fingers still felt somewhat moisturized. I do apply more lotion but I don&#x27;t &#x27;have to&#x27; every time.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to heal a new tattoo, this is the best.  I have had super fast heal times and beautiful results.  Also great to heart out on current tattoos to keep the skin moist.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, Awesome savings</li>
            <li> Before I used this item, my skin is always itching because of too dry. After I used that, my skin never itch again! Magic~!</li>
            <li> My boy have a very strong skin problem any cream was helping him, we tried a lot of different ones, one year ago me test this one and his skin looks smooth and relief, he still need it on daily basis, but we are no longer using cortisone since the skin is continuously hydrated with these cream, I recommended it 100%</li>
            <li> BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS AND IT WOKS GREAT !</li>
            <li> Item as described. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Good beauty routine lotion.  I use it on my face everyday at least twice. I use the subscribe and pay to save money.  I love Aveeno products!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone very light to the skin and lasts all day.It also works for al skin types</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.  This lotion is perfect for my skin with less additives than most other lotions.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know that it really lasts 24 hours. Reapply often on my hands because of washing often</li>
            <li> I had horrible eczema on both arms for over a week. It was bad my skin burned in some spots. I went to the Dermatologist and was given a prescription cream. The cream did NOTHING. After another week of this crud on my arms I spotted the Aveeno I had in my cupboard. I thought, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot; I applied it after showering at night twice and on day three ALL of the dry spots were gone. I love Aveeno products and no I was not paid to write this. I am a life fan now.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old says this is the only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t she&#x27;ll use! She hates when the soap dries her hands out and uses it regularly.</li>
            <li> Smalls good and works well</li>
            <li> This lotion works really well to relieve my extra dry hands. I tend to prefer the lighter variety for my body, although this works well too. I&#x27;ve also found it helpful during the course of the day when indoor heating makes make face feel parched.</li>
            <li> After having some skin issues I have tried plenty of other products. AVENO seems to beat them all. If you stumble upon this item GO FOR IT!</li>
            <li> Excellent product...Immediate relief for skin...i have used this lotion for my son, he was relieved within three days.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product to all my well wishers.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion as it helps my poor dry hands feel moisturized and softer. I wash my hands so many times a day, they need all the help they can get, and this lotion helps a lot! It&#x27;s nice to have something a little more natural too.</li>
            <li> Before my skin is very dry, since I use it, my skin has improved, I very like, recommend to my friends</li>
            <li> Aveeno is probably the best I have ever used.  Highly recommend it for its gentle and natural properties.  I order the larger size because I use it every day.</li>
            <li> My wife and I use this sometimes, but it is primarily for our children (5 and 2). We use the Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion for us.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less greasy than the Aveeno green-labeled lotion.</li>
            <li> Good for my son&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have begun experiencing some eczema on my face that needs gentle care. This lotion is not specifically for facial use but it is very compatible with my skin and I can gently pat a small amount on inflamed facial skin without aggravating it.  It is a light texture and no smell to speak of.  It is not too thick but it does give some moisture and does not evaporate too quickly.  I  find it soothing, at least for a little while, but it does not cure eczema.  It does help me manage the symptoms.  It makes my face look a little better and feel a little better.  I&#x27;m grateful.</li>
            <li> I have natural dry skin and was looking out for a lotion that would work for me so I tried it. The item felt light to the skin. There were no heaviness or sticky feel to it. It is absorbed well by the skin. Love it....though it was unscented (no complaints about it--i really planned on getting an unscented one). After trying the body wash and applying this to my skin--I kept wondering and wishing how it would be more enjoyable if I bought one that had the same scent as the moisturizing  body wash. I highly recommend it to everyone, it&#x27;s worth the money paid to buy it!</li>
            <li> Overall, the Aveeno brand has done well and I&#x27;ve not had any issues. I like the light nature of the lotion vs some of its competitors.</li>
            <li> My skin is prone to break outs and shaving causes my skin to break out, become extremely dry and even bleed. One application and I saw an 80% improvement. Is very thick and use for after shower night treatments. Extremely pleased use their shaving lotion as well. Loyal customer for 3 years.</li>
            <li> This lotion absorbs quickly and moisturizes well.  I have trouble finding lotions that actually work for me and this is a great lotion for very dry skin</li>
            <li> My legs get so dry in the winter and this is the only lotion I have found to tame the itch. I couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> This is awesome your skin stay smooth all day I will buy it again</li>
            <li> So far I love this it. I have used it a few times and am definitely I got it at such a deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, very moisturizing. My skin still feels soft in the morning after applying it before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a nice lotion at the drugstore without being loaded with cheap, synthetic materials that make your skin *seem* moisturized but not actually doing anything useful. This lotion sinks into the skin, smells fine, and just keeps my skin soft and comfortable. If I put it on in the morning, I can still feel that I put it on late in the afternoon, but not in a greasy way. Just that my skin is more soft than if I hadn&#x27;t put it on.</li>
            <li> Years ago a dermatologist recommended Aveeno to me and I have found it to be the best moisturizing lotion I have ever used.  I wash my hands a lot and, particularly in the winter, they can become dried out.  Regular use of Aveeno keeps the skin from cracking, which -- if you think about it -- provides a pathway into your system for bacteria and viruses, thereby negating the benefits of hand washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep one of these large containers at home and carry one of the pocket size containers when traveling.</li>
            <li> Aveeno is the best product I have used over all for my ageing and dry skin.  I also like their liquid bath soap.</li>
            <li> Great skin  lotion. We used it daily. Feels great and make the skin look and feel better</li>
            <li> I was suggested this by amazon and one of my friends to cure my winter itchiness and dry skin. I use it after my shower and it has been doing its job. It is a bit thick and i feel a little gummy afterwards but that feeling goes away. It does not have a very overpowering scent, which I like very much.</li>
            <li> This hand cream works ! When my wife tried to buy me a cheaper brand, I would have none of it.&lt;br /&gt;I told her, I only want Aveeno !!!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin. It runs in my family and I&#x27;ve had to deal with it all my life, so I have experience with all kinds of lotion since I was a little girl. For dry skin I&#x27;ve mainly stuck with oil-based deep moisturizers. I tried \\&quot;water-based\\&quot;-feeling type lotions before and they were always so lightweight. But then I discovered Aveeno moisturizing line, specifically the 18-hour and now it&#x27;s all I use. I have need for nothing else. What I like most about it is that it PENETRATES and HYDRATES from within (rather than sits on top of skin acting as a sealant). It hydrates within and how long it lasts (staying power) is the best I&#x27;ve seen. Also, I&#x27;m NO LONGER left with an oily or \\&quot;smudgy\\&quot; body (I&#x27;d leave smudges everywhere I touched due to the heavier, less effective lotions of the past). I feel deeply moisturized and non-oily - can&#x27;t beat it. I&#x27;m a customer for life!</li>
            <li> I am a daily swimmer, both in pools and the ocean, and my skin becomes parched, not just from the salt and chlorine but from the sun.  I needed something serious to put on my skin to rescue it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best thing I&#x27;ve tried yet for my skin, since it soaks in and softens and smooths my skin.  I put this on as soon as I get out of the pool, when my skin needs it most, and rub it in and my skin actually glows and feels wonderful.  And it does work for 24 hours.  I wake up the next morning and can still tell that my skin has been pampered with this.  There is still a smoothness and softness, and no sign of the dry tight feeling I usually have when I don&#x27;t use this.  I even use this on my face without any bad reactions.  It seems to soften lines near my eyes too.  I don&#x27;t ever want to be without this.  It has no scent, which I like also.  Of all the drugstore moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried this is the best</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and during the dry winter months I get so dried out I sometimes get dermatitis. My clothes will make my skin feel like it&#x27;s burning or cracking (although it isn&#x27;t). Now I put this on every morning. All I can say is Wow. My skin when I go to bed is still moisturized, soft, not dried out. It&#x27;s a life-saver. I think I&#x27;ll probably use more Aveeno products now because of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of lotions over the years and so far this is the best brand I&#x27;ve found. It&#x27;s not oily or sticky and actually moisturizes. Due to my job I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands and this bottle has last me a very long time. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Calms my skin during psoriasis inflamations.</li>
            <li> This lotion can be found elsewhere for considerably more. Although it&#x27;s worth every penny, why pay more when you can save dollars per bottle through Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion contains 1.3% Dimethicone. That&#x27;s, I think, a negligible two tenths of a percent less than the Remedy Skin Repair lotion, which costs 3 to 4 times more than this Aveeno lotion. For someone who has a lot of itching, has problems with many skin care products, who needs lotion for ulcer-prone skin, and who would like a product that can be used all over the body, then give this a try. I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are hyper-sensitive to lotions of any kind, need a product without scents, and which is very reasonably priced as compared to similar products, then this is the thing for you. But even if you have &amp;#34;normal skin,&amp;#34; using this lotion on a regular basis helps to keep skin from getting dry or developing other problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heck, yes, I would definitely recommend this product, this price, and the results it gives.</li>
