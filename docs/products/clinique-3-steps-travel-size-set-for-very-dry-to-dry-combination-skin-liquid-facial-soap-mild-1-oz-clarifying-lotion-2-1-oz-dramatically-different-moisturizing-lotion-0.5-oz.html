            <li>better go to marshalls to find products on full sizes for better deals</li>
            <li>but im sure when winter rolls around it will be very useful.</li>

            <li> Works great and glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Broke out my skin. The cleanser just didn&#x27;t feel clean. Usually love clinique products but this didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I love Clinique products and was thrilled to find them in travel size. What more do you need to know?</li>
            <li> This arrived in a plastic baggie.  Nothing was sealed.  The sizes are very small and the moisturizer appears to have separated.  I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for traveling.</li>

            <li> Purchased it as a gift for my daughter. She uses Clinique, so was excited to have a travel kit! Good product.</li>
            <li> I love this trio! My skin is pretty normal, but can get a little dry in the winter. This moisturizer worked wonders in the winter. And I love the smell of the soap. My favorite is the step #2... it makes my skin feel great. My only issue is that the #2 bottle only lasted a few weeks (of almost daily use). I don&#x27;t use a ton at one time, so I&#x27;m going on a month of the soap and moisturizer and still have plenty. Great product, but plan on stocking up on step #2 faster than the others!</li>
            <li> Rather than getting the mild facial cleanser I got cleanser for oily skin.</li>
            <li> This was a great product I really enjoyed it. The price was affordable. Thank you very much. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> Clinique products are great.  These are just right for a purse or travel and everyone should carry a set always!</li>
            <li> I chose this product my sister has used it for years and looks great! It&#x27;s a pricey product so when I saw the travel size I thought that was a perfect way to try it.</li>
            <li> Excellent products, but they are free samples given away when you purchase a certain dollar amount at the stores. Clearly marked &amp;#34;not for sale&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this! Used it years ago, but somehow got sidetracked and began using other products. Glad to be using these again. My skin at age 65 is beautiful. Get lots of compliments. Just 2 weeks to improvement.</li>
            <li> The complete system is great together, i have T zone combination skin. very oily on nose and forehead and very dry everywhere else. My skin doesn&#x27;t particularly break out now im in my twenties. It used to when i was younger teenager and i used this and it did wonders better than proactive, dermalogica, clarins, etc. The toner is a god send! I would repurchase the toner by itself that how much i love it for my skin. The cleanser is good, but not great. The lotion, i rarely use now that it is summer but im sure when winter rolls around it will be very useful. It is still worth buying the full size of the complete 3 steps! this stuff is the best!</li>
            <li> Got this to take on vacation so I didn&#x27;t miss my face cleaning routine. This product works only if you keep up the routine.Got it on time and in great shape</li>
            <li> These products met all my expectations.  I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> is the best s*** in the world</li>
            <li> I bought the travel size to try these products to see if I&#x27;d like it or not before buying the full size.  I saw a difference in my skin immediately, my skin was softer, smoother, and had a glow to it.  The cleanser wasn&#x27;t drying and the toner I thought helped in the appearance of my skin.  The moisturizer of course was awesome.  It helped to eliminate or smooth out some of my wrinkles and made my face feel really smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be ordering the full sizes of each.</li>
            <li> I received it just three days ago.I have not use it .though I like the price ,because it cheap for me .</li>
            <li> Perfect size and sufficient amount in each!</li>
            <li> Used Clinique for 50 years. Perfect for trips.</li>
            <li> I love Clinique. I&#x27;ve using these for a year now and it does great for my skin. I purchased these for a travel, it&#x27;s perfectly convinient. I think the toner bottle is smaller than the picture but you can refilled so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This are not travel sizes..this are samples that states not for sale..better go to marshalls to find products on full sizes for better deals</li>
            <li> Excellent, would recommend</li>
