            <li>Have been using this product for years now and completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love this floor cleaner.</li>
            <li>I love the Bone products for my floors, but I have two problems with this refill holder.  </li>
            <li>I love this system.  </li>
            <li>So glad I bought this set.</li>
            <li>It cleans them pretty good and doesn&#x27;t leave a film.  </li>
            <li>IT IS WATER-BASED, EASY TO USE, AND IT LEAVES YOUR WOOD FLOORS CLEAN AND  GLOWING WARMLY.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job on my floors and last good.</li>
            <li>I think you may be able to buy large containers of this at places like Home Depot as well and do your own refill.</li>
            <li>I HAVE TRIED OTHER BRANDS BUT BONA IS THE BEST.  </li>
            <li>Easy to used and the cartridges are now refillable.  </li>
            <li>Easy to change on floor mop.</li>
            <li>However, the broom and cartridge are easy to user and work well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and makes my Brazilian cherry wood floors glisten without making them greasy or slippery.</li>
            <li>but these are easy swap replacements.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Simple the best, have a large home and my house keeper loves this product and she knows...</li>
            <li>The refill cartridge is not as sturdy as the original and deforms easily.  </li>
            <li>A huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>fabulous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to install, clean, and leaves my floors shining.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for the red oak floors in my house.  </li>
            <li>Bona works fine, but it doesn&#x27;t get the floors really clean.  </li>
            <li>Gentle but gets get the floors clean!!</li>
            <li>Like the light clean scent and no stickiness.</li>
            <li>This just leaves the floor clean.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and economical.</li>
            <li>Bona cleaners were recommended to me by a housekeeper, who said they don&#x27;t damage floors and clean well without leaving a residue.  </li>
            <li>The floors are squeaky clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>No residue, and it dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>The Bona Product Line is convenient and easy to use for general surface cleaning, but if you are looking for a product that will clean wood floors that have the &amp;#34;scraped&amp;#34; look or those that have more surface indentations, the ingredients are quite gentle and the microfiber mop head is too smooth to penetrate the cracks and crevices just below the surface of the floor.  </li>
            <li>IT IS EASY TO USE, FAST DRYING, LEAVES NO STREAKS, AND KEEPS THE FLOOR SHINNY WITHOUT ANY BUILD UP.</li>
            <li>Out performs the Swiffer, wood floor product hands down, shape of container best for under low furniture, refillable bottle, pleasant mild fragrance, minimal storage.  </li>
            <li>THE COMPANY IS ALSO WONDERFUL AS THEY STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS  </li>
            <li>Nice that there is finally a refill catridge.</li>
            <li>No disappointment with this item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and gives the floors a nice sheen without making them slick (which is important for me because I have elderly dogs).</li>
            <li>This product really does a nice job on the hardwood floors and leaves no residue behind, just a nice clean finish!</li>
            <li>I recently purchased hardwood floors for my front room and this product has made my life very easy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean easily and requires a little more elbox grease.  </li>
            <li>- it makes cleaning the floors so much easier that I actually might do it more often!</li>
            <li>I use this with the Bona spray applicator and it works great on my hard wood floors.</li>
            <li>Very convenient!</li>
            <li>I just wish it left a better shine though.</li>
            <li>Same contents, just a better design of container.</li>
            <li>Many of the reviews I saw complained that there was no way to refill this cartridge, but the top screws right off for refill.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace the old one and snap in this new one.</li>
            <li>This cartridge has an easy to refill design and that allows you to buy the cleaner in the bulk gallon bottles and simply refill the cartridge when it runs out.  </li>
            <li>Saves money by refilling from a large container.  </li>
            <li>I havent tried the large container that you can use which is much cheaper</li>
            <li>the large jug Bona sells much easier.  </li>
            <li>This works very well on my Verathane-sealed hardwood floors.</li>
            <li>For example, when I have spilled water on the floors and wipe it up, dirt comes off with it no matter how much of this spray I use.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and much easier than getting on your hands and knees.  </li>
            <li>Very ease to use.</li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>My house keeper really likes this stuff.</li>
            <li>Cleans the floors really well.</li>
            <li>really well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy that this cleaner works to clean the floors without leaving a heavy or cloying smell behind in the house afterward.  </li>
            <li>This cartridge serves the same purpose and works well in the mop, with the added benefit of being able to refill from the large containers of Bona cleaner, or with another fluid of your choosing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Both types of flooring were set on a concrete slab.</li>
            <li>and I filled it from a large container of Bona cleaner that I had previously purchased.</li>
            <li>First, it falls out easily and stopped working, so I ordered the replacement, which I have wrapped with a small bungee cord to keep in place.  </li>
            <li>THE FLOOR STILL LOOK LIKE NEW.  </li>
            <li>We installed new floors in our 30-year-old house.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without I recommend it to all my friends with hardwood floors.</li>
            <li>I do a quick dry mop and then use the bona mop that squirts the cleaner in front of it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier, especially since I have two kids that sure know how to mess up the floors.</li>
            <li>I love these products for my hard wood floors but it sometimes leaves streaks.</li>
            <li>This is our third cartridge and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Works seemlessly with the Bona mop and gets floors much cleaner than using a traditional mop.</li>
            <li>These have screw-off caps versus the old design of a pry-off cap.  </li>
            <li>just as I expected, price right</li>
            <li>I wish they made the microfiber mop heads in white, so you could see just how much dirt they are actually picking up.</li>
            <li>THERE IS NO OTHER LIKE IT ON THE MARKET.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had problems with other products leaving waxy film in the past, so this is much better.</li>
            <li>I will refil this one as long as possible rather than buy a new cartridge each time.</li>
            <li>The cartridge is easy to install and lasts for approximately 8 cleanings (living room, dining room, library, and two bedrooms).</li>

            <li> Bona works fine, but it doesn&#x27;t get the floors really clean.  </li>
            <li> Gentle but gets get the floors clean!!</li>
            <li> Like the light clean scent and no stickiness.</li>
            <li> This just leaves the floor clean.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and economical.</li>
            <li> Bona cleaners were recommended to me by a housekeeper, who said they don&#x27;t damage floors and clean well without leaving a residue.  </li>
            <li> The floors are squeaky clean and shiny.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> No residue, and it dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> The Bona Product Line is convenient and easy to use for general surface cleaning, but if you are looking for a product that will clean wood floors that have the &amp;#34;scraped&amp;#34; look or those that have more surface indentations, the ingredients are quite gentle and the microfiber mop head is too smooth to penetrate the cracks and crevices just below the surface of the floor.  </li>
            <li> IT IS EASY TO USE, FAST DRYING, LEAVES NO STREAKS, AND KEEPS THE FLOOR SHINNY WITHOUT ANY BUILD UP.</li>
            <li> Out performs the Swiffer, wood floor product hands down, shape of container best for under low furniture, refillable bottle, pleasant mild fragrance, minimal storage.  </li>
            <li> THE COMPANY IS ALSO WONDERFUL AS THEY STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS  </li>
            <li> Nice that there is finally a refill catridge.</li>
            <li> No disappointment with this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and gives the floors a nice sheen without making them slick (which is important for me because I have elderly dogs).</li>
            <li> This product really does a nice job on the hardwood floors and leaves no residue behind, just a nice clean finish!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased hardwood floors for my front room and this product has made my life very easy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean easily and requires a little more elbox grease.  </li>
            <li> - it makes cleaning the floors so much easier that I actually might do it more often!</li>
            <li> I use this with the Bona spray applicator and it works great on my hard wood floors.</li>
            <li> Very convenient!</li>
            <li> I just wish it left a better shine though.</li>
            <li> Same contents, just a better design of container.</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews I saw complained that there was no way to refill this cartridge, but the top screws right off for refill.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace the old one and snap in this new one.</li>
            <li> This cartridge has an easy to refill design and that allows you to buy the cleaner in the bulk gallon bottles and simply refill the cartridge when it runs out.  </li>
            <li> Saves money by refilling from a large container.  </li>
            <li> I havent tried the large container that you can use which is much cheaper</li>
            <li> the large jug Bona sells much easier.  </li>
            <li> This works very well on my Verathane-sealed hardwood floors.</li>
            <li> For example, when I have spilled water on the floors and wipe it up, dirt comes off with it no matter how much of this spray I use.  </li>
            <li> It works very well and much easier than getting on your hands and knees.  </li>
            <li> Very ease to use.</li>
            <li> Worked very well.</li>
            <li> My house keeper really likes this stuff.</li>
            <li> Cleans the floors really well.</li>
            <li> really well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy that this cleaner works to clean the floors without leaving a heavy or cloying smell behind in the house afterward.  </li>
            <li> This cartridge serves the same purpose and works well in the mop, with the added benefit of being able to refill from the large containers of Bona cleaner, or with another fluid of your choosing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Both types of flooring were set on a concrete slab.</li>
            <li> and I filled it from a large container of Bona cleaner that I had previously purchased.</li>
            <li> First, it falls out easily and stopped working, so I ordered the replacement, which I have wrapped with a small bungee cord to keep in place.  </li>
            <li> THE FLOOR STILL LOOK LIKE NEW.  </li>
            <li> We installed new floors in our 30-year-old house.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without I recommend it to all my friends with hardwood floors.</li>
            <li> I do a quick dry mop and then use the bona mop that squirts the cleaner in front of it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier, especially since I have two kids that sure know how to mess up the floors.</li>
            <li> I love these products for my hard wood floors but it sometimes leaves streaks.</li>
            <li> This is our third cartridge and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Works seemlessly with the Bona mop and gets floors much cleaner than using a traditional mop.</li>
            <li> These have screw-off caps versus the old design of a pry-off cap.  </li>
            <li> just as I expected, price right</li>
            <li> I wish they made the microfiber mop heads in white, so you could see just how much dirt they are actually picking up.</li>
            <li> THERE IS NO OTHER LIKE IT ON THE MARKET.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had problems with other products leaving waxy film in the past, so this is much better.</li>
            <li> I will refil this one as long as possible rather than buy a new cartridge each time.</li>
            <li> The cartridge is easy to install and lasts for approximately 8 cleanings (living room, dining room, library, and two bedrooms).</li>
            <li> My only problem with these refillable containers is that they don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I have lots of hardwoods, so the cartridges don&#x27;t last as long as I wish, and they are pricey.  </li>
            <li> Heavier than I recalled but last a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought a house with dark floors and have a white dog-- tough to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally not sensitive to smells, but hardwood floor cleaners bother me for some reason.  </li>
            <li> I bought an extra gallon of BonaKemi and use it to fill up the cartridges when empty.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than the disposable alternative (you know who I mean Sw@ffer).</li>
            <li> But after a few months the old cartridge became dented and did not fit back  into the mop.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I had previously was that the cartridges were not refillable.  </li>
            <li> I moved over to this, sometime refill, did the math, and can buy the cartridge for almost the same $ without the mess.  </li>
            <li> Refill cartridge, not much else</li>
            <li> Overall though we use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t done the polish yet but will in next few weeks.</li>
            <li> Any other cleaner voids the warranty.  </li>
            <li> YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN SWITCH TO ANY OTHER.</li>
            <li> she cleans a lot of houses besides mine, and is extremely picky on the supplies she uses.</li>
            <li> The cartridge mounts on the lower part of the mop and gives little sprays onto the floor at the control of a small lever on the upper part of the mop handle.</li>
            <li> The previous refillable cartridge broke and bought this</li>
            <li> Helps cut cleaning time in half.</li>
            <li> Works well although I typically need to buff the floor afterwards.</li>
            <li> The swivel/ detachable cleaning head is just what&#x27;s needed for tight spaces.  </li>
            <li> We  put in wood floors a few months ago and they recommended Bona.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone wanting to save a few dollars.</li>
            <li> My Bona mop came with the cartridge design that does not refill, which I did not like in terms of plastic packaging waste and cost.  </li>
            <li> One of these lasts for a few months so haven&#x27;t tried that yet.</li>
            <li> Our installer suggested we use the Bona Hardwood Floor Cleaner on the wood floors, and we&#x27;ve been doing that for about the past 4 years.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Bona for hard wood floors</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m doing things wrong.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a reside or film behind.</li>
            <li> Ah well, I suppose if we&#x27;re going to have expensive floors then we should expect that the cleaner will be expensive too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
            <li> Expensive!</li>

            <li> Best there is, period.  We&#x27;ve tried others, but Bona rules!</li>
            <li> Simple the best, have a large home and my house keeper loves this product and she knows...it is her job! lol</li>
            <li> Good stuff for wood floors, great design, easy and it works.</li>
            <li> Happy with product and the large mop head.</li>
            <li> This is a great refillable cartridge for the Bona mop and I would purchase again if needed.. The previous refillable cartridge broke and bought this was to replace it. So disregard the answer where it states it is not refillable as it is and I filled it from a large container of Bona cleaner that I had previously purchased. Fit the mop perfectly and am able to clean my floors again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy that this cleaner works to clean the floors without leaving a heavy or cloying smell behind in the house afterward.  I&#x27;m generally not sensitive to smells, but hardwood floor cleaners bother me for some reason.  This just leaves the floor clean.  Love the spray mop system - it makes cleaning the floors so much easier that I actually might do it more often!</li>
            <li> This works very well on my Verathane-sealed hardwood floors.</li>
            <li> This cleaning cartridge does a great job and is easy to attach and use. Price is good, too.</li>
            <li> Did tons of research.  Talked to a lot of people who have wood floors.  Talked to a couple of people who service wood floors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thinks this is best.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL  THERE IS NO OTHER LIKE IT ON THE MARKET.  IT IS WATER-BASED, EASY TO USE, AND IT LEAVES YOUR WOOD FLOORS CLEAN AND  GLOWING WARMLY.  I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR  YEARS ON ALL THE FLOORS IN MY HOUSE WHICH ARE  MAPLE.  I HAVE TRIED OTHER BRANDS BUT BONA IS THE BEST.  THE COMPANY IS ALSO WONDERFUL AS THEY STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS  ONE HUNDRED PER CENT.</li>
            <li> I have used the bona system on my wood floors for years and it&lt;br /&gt;is fabulous. This was a refill cartridge and works great.</li>
            <li> delivered as ordered at fair price</li>
            <li> just as I expected, price right and I got it sent to my house.</li>
            <li> Refill cartridge, not much else I can say. Works just like the original which was great.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning hardwood. We are hooked onto it.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased hardwood floors for my front room and this product has made my life very easy. It&#x27;s easy to install, clean, and leaves my floors shining. I couldn&#x27;t be happier, especially since I have two kids that sure know how to mess up the floors.</li>
            <li> Nice that there is finally a refill catridge. Nice cleaning product as always. I would recommend Bona for hard wood floors</li>
            <li> This is what I used on my engineered hardwood floors because it was the product recommended by the manufacturer.  Any other cleaner voids the warranty.  Bona works fine, but it doesn&#x27;t get the floors really clean.  For example, when I have spilled water on the floors and wipe it up, dirt comes off with it no matter how much of this spray I use.  That being said, the Bona also hasn&#x27;t ruined the finish on the floors.</li>
            <li> My only problem with these refillable containers is that they don&#x27;t last very long. They get compressed and can&#x27;t be refilled.</li>
            <li> works great! Easy to use and economical.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and my cleaning lady was so HAPPY!! When she saw the product, she immediately knew what it was and was so glad I got it. It works very well and much easier than getting on your hands and knees.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve used it on my hardwood floors for years.  Easy to used and the cartridges are now refillable.  However, I will add that the cartridges are not refillable forever.  I just had one to wear out after about 7 years of use.  But then again, I have 2-3 and alternate them.  Very ease to use.</li>
            <li> WE HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR OUR HARDWOOD FLOORS FOR FIVE YEARS. THE FLOOR STILL LOOK LIKE NEW.  IT IS EASY TO USE, FAST DRYING, LEAVES NO STREAKS, AND KEEPS THE FLOOR SHINNY WITHOUT ANY BUILD UP. IT MAY NOT BE THE CHEAPEST PRODUCT BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU TRY THIS PRODUCT YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN SWITCH TO ANY OTHER.</li>
            <li> We installed new floors in our 30-year-old house. Expensive! About a third of the floor space was covered with stone tiles and the remaining part was covered with \\&quot;engineered\\&quot; wood. Both types of flooring were set on a concrete slab. Our installer suggested we use the Bona Hardwood Floor Cleaner on the wood floors, and we&#x27;ve been doing that for about the past 4 years. It&#x27;s an excellent cleaner and I&#x27;m amazed how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More recently, my wife discovered a Bona Mop which requires a replaceable cleaning cartridge. The mop is very nicely designed and makes cleaning simple and relatively pleasant. The cartridge mounts on the lower part of the mop and gives little sprays onto the floor at the control of a small lever on the upper part of the mop handle. Everything has worked rather well. It&#x27;s an excellent cleaner and the mop makes it easy to use. What more can I say? About the only annoyance is the cost of the replacement cartridge. Ah well, I suppose if we&#x27;re going to have expensive floors then we should expect that the cleaner will be expensive too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
            <li> Easy to change on floor mop. Does a good job on my floors and last good.</li>
            <li> Love it! Very convenient!</li>
            <li> Perfect for hardwood floors</li>
            <li> I use this with the Bona spray applicator and it works great on my hard wood floors. I had been using the Shark steam mop and I like this much better as it is so convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Worked very well. I have Brazillian cherry floors and this is the best cleaner I&#x27;ve come by! Doesn&#x27;t leave a reside or film behind.</li>
            <li> works perfectly with the Bona mop, snaps right into place and goes to town.  This IS refillable with the Bona floor cleaner liquird.</li>
            <li> Bought this and thought it would get the job done and of course it did and still does. I love Bona!</li>
            <li> Solution works great on my floors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I forgot about the instructions when I purchased the mop.  The one that comes with the mop is already refillable so don&#x27;t buy this unless yours is broke or you want an extra one on hand.  I would just buy the gallon.</li>
            <li> My housekeeper will use nothing else on my wood floors.  She swears by this, so it must be perfect.  I trust her- she cleans a lot of houses besides mine, and is extremely picky on the supplies she uses.</li>
            <li> Bona cleaners were recommended to me by a housekeeper, who said they don&#x27;t damage floors and clean well without leaving a residue.  I have lots of hardwoods, so the cartridges don&#x27;t last as long as I wish, and they are pricey.  However, the broom and cartridge are easy to user and work well.</li>
            <li> We  put in wood floors a few months ago and they recommended Bona. This is our third cartridge and it works very well. Very easy to insert and cleans floors in no time. Note that this is only for use on finished non waxed wood floors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> ...amazon has this item at a great price. This product really does a nice job on the hardwood floors and leaves no residue behind, just a nice clean finish!</li>
            <li> This is the only product we use on our hardwood floors.  Our floors look so shiny after use and stay that way between weekly cleanings.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this wood cleaner and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my floors.  We&#x27;ve had problems with other products leaving waxy film in the past, so this is much better.</li>
            <li> My house keeper really likes this stuff. This is the refill</li>
            <li> I moved over to this, sometime refill, did the math, and can buy the cartridge for almost the same $ without the mess.  Like the simplicity.</li>
            <li> Cleans the floors really well.</li>
            <li> The best and most convenient way to clean hardwood floors. I also use their stone floor cleaner for my bathrooms and kitchen.</li>
            <li> We love this product for our bamboo floors.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and makes my Brazilian cherry wood floors glisten without making them greasy or slippery.</li>
            <li> Made it to me without leakage. Heavier than I recalled but last a long time.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement cartridges. I havent tried the large container that you can use which is much cheaper but these are easy swap replacements.</li>
            <li> Works great on my floors.  A lot easier than the spray bottle!</li>
            <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve discovered for my hardwood floors.  It cleans them pretty good and doesn&#x27;t leave a film.  The cartridge is easy to install and lasts for approximately 8 cleanings (living room, dining room, library, and two bedrooms).</li>
            <li> Excellent product that does what&#x27;s promised. Like the light clean scent and no stickiness.</li>
            <li> Great product, better than Swiffer and ordered the additional products from Bona</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Also can be refilled with my favorite cleaner.  Probably shouldn&#x27;t say that, but it&#x27;s true.  Much nicer than the disposable alternative (you know who I mean Sw@ffer).</li>
            <li> I bought an extra gallon of BonaKemi and use it to fill up the cartridges when empty. But after a few months the old cartridge became dented and did not fit back  into the mop.  I will refil this one as long as possible rather than buy a new cartridge each time.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on hardwood floors and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> This stuff cleans hardwood floors (mine are Brazilian cherry) really well.  I just wish it left a better shine though.</li>
            <li> Great value and great product.</li>
            <li> great product, have used for several years, leaves the floors looking great. The refillable container does wear out over time. This is replacement for one that stared leaking.</li>
            <li> This is the best floor cleaner ever created for hardwood floors!  No residue, and it dries quickly.  The floors are squeaky clean and shiny.  Pet safe too!</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews I saw complained that there was no way to refill this cartridge, but the top screws right off for refill.</li>
            <li> This product works great for hardwood floors.  Works seemlessly with the Bona mop and gets floors much cleaner than using a traditional mop.</li>
            <li> Works great, we use it all the time.I would  Reccommed to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> The Bona Product Line is convenient and easy to use for general surface cleaning, but if you are looking for a product that will clean wood floors that have the &amp;#34;scraped&amp;#34; look or those that have more surface indentations, the ingredients are quite gentle and the microfiber mop head is too smooth to penetrate the cracks and crevices just below the surface of the floor.  I wish they made the microfiber mop heads in white, so you could see just how much dirt they are actually picking up.</li>
            <li> If you have hardwood floors, this is a fantastic cleaner!</li>
            <li> this product claims no dulling but it did nothing but do just that to my hardwood floors. i would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This products makes my hardwood floors look great.  I highly recommend this product. Have been using this product for years now and completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product works great on hardwood floors and this bottle design makes refilling from the large jug Bona sells much easier.  These have screw-off caps versus the old design of a pry-off cap.  Same contents, just a better design of container.</li>
            <li> Cleans my wood floors great!</li>
            <li> Perfect product. Easy to replace the old one and snap in this new one.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  The swivel/ detachable cleaning head is just what&#x27;s needed for tight spaces.  Cleaning wood floors is effortless. Beats using a mop each time.</li>
            <li> Saves money by refilling from a large container.  Easy to use.  I recommend it to anyone wanting to save a few dollars.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Helps cut cleaning time in half. Can&#x27;t live without I recommend it to all my friends with hardwood floors.</li>
            <li> Bona is perfect for polishing hardwoods.  Gives a nice shine, although be sure that floor is swept well before.  It doesn&#x27;t clean easily and requires a little more elbox grease.  Overall though we use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Bona is a great product. Using the cartridge in the mop handle saves time and back pain.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the red oak floors in my house.  It&#x27;s easy to use and gives the floors a nice sheen without making them slick (which is important for me because I have elderly dogs).</li>
            <li> Excellent service and product would recommend to anyone. Does beautiful work on floors and design is quick and easy. Thanks</li>
            <li> good stuff keeps my floors looking very good.</li>
            <li> Love this floor cleaner. Gentle but gets get the floors clean!!</li>
            <li> Love that you can refill cartridge !</li>
            <li> I have always loved this cleaner and the easy-to-use mops.  The only issue I had previously was that the cartridges were not refillable.  Now they are.  This cartridge has an easy to refill design and that allows you to buy the cleaner in the bulk gallon bottles and simply refill the cartridge when it runs out.  Great new design for a great product.</li>
            <li> The refill cartridge is not as sturdy as the original and deforms easily.  The cleaner fluid also seems to be different than the one that came with the mop.  This one squeeks.</li>
            <li> I love the Bone products for my floors, but I have two problems with this refill holder.  First, it falls out easily and stopped working, so I ordered the replacement, which I have wrapped with a small bungee cord to keep in place.  Second, it leaks so there is always some of the fluid on the floor under the sweeper.</li>
            <li> Out performs the Swiffer, wood floor product hands down, shape of container best for under low furniture, refillable bottle, pleasant mild fragrance, minimal storage.  No disappointment with this item.</li>
            <li> Had old hardwood floors refinished, found this was the most helpful product to keep floors in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely easy to apply and results are always pleasing.</li>
            <li> Like it really good and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have waxed wood floors and this is the only cleaner I trust on them.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Makes my wood floors look so good.</li>
            <li> Great product and great service</li>
            <li> My Bona mop came with the cartridge design that does not refill, which I did not like in terms of plastic packaging waste and cost.  This cartridge serves the same purpose and works well in the mop, with the added benefit of being able to refill from the large containers of Bona cleaner, or with another fluid of your choosing.</li>
            <li> I love this system.  I had the swiff one but the odor of that was horrendous and this system doesn&#x27;t stink up the house and works great.  A huge improvement.  So glad I bought this set.</li>
            <li> Works well although I typically need to buff the floor afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love these products for my hard wood floors but it sometimes leaves streaks. Not sure if I&#x27;m doing things wrong. I have 3000 sq ft of hardwood so need to keep multiple mop pads of both cleaner and dust mop pads. Haven&#x27;t done the polish yet but will in next few weeks.</li>
            <li> The mop is the best one out there for hardwood floors. I bought a house with dark floors and have a white dog-- tough to keep clean. I do a quick dry mop and then use the bona mop that squirts the cleaner in front of it. I think you may be able to buy large containers of this at places like Home Depot as well and do your own refill. One of these lasts for a few months so haven&#x27;t tried that yet.</li>
