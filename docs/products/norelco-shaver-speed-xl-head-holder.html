            <li>The product came fast and a very good price, but didn&#x27;t work on the shaver had to order direct from company and pay 2.5 times more.</li>
            <li>This part is just fine and was easy to install.  </li>
            <li>and I got this and a new retaining plate for my shaver for a really good price.  </li>

            <li>Does not fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>Important to replace and repaire tahn to throw.</li>
            <li>Does this item fit HQ9 philishave speed XL.</li>

            <li>It work and fit my shaver.</li>

            <li>The product works perfectly with my razor and new blades ordered earlier and provides a like-new shave.</li>
            <li>It works just like the original part.</li>
            <li>The spring-loaded hinge mechanism, floating head holders and latch work like the original.</li>
            <li>As Norelco has hundreds of products/parts, It would make sense to find a way of a more exact description of each item.</li>
            <li>This is an original Norelco part.</li>
            <li>If the description it say was made out of plastic I would have pass on this purchase my original one is metal.</li>
            <li>The original one was so worn out that the shaving heads would sometimes pop out of the holder.</li>
            <li>The part was exactly what I needed and came very quickly.</li>
            <li>Installed these new ones and now it&#x27;s as good as new!</li>
            <li>I feel that it is now better than new!</li>
            <li>I received my product quickly &amp; have used it since.  </li>
            <li>Quick service in any case.</li>
            <li>a quick listing.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I am sure it was my fault as I dropped the razor on many occasions over the course of owning it for probably ten years.  </li>
            <li>Just a quick snap on</li>
            <li>It works like new:)</li>
            <li>I get comfortable with certain things.</li>
            <li>The Norelco 8150 Shaver is one great little machine.</li>
            <li>I checked the products available through Amazon and sure enough they had what I needed.</li>
            <li>It does not fit exactly but more than enough for a very good shave.</li>
            <li>I recevied the new head holder quickly and it fit my Norelco shaver correctly and got my shaver working again.</li>
            <li>Snapped right on</li>
            <li>The right part part for the right electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Easy to install and restored the razor to like new condition.</li>
            <li>Works like new product with smooth operation.  </li>
            <li>Finally found these at a very cheap price, so I bought a couple.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery as well, you &amp;#34;shaved my day.</li>
            <li>This is fine but doesn&#x27;t fit all razors listed without some minor alterations.</li>
            <li>Head holder was the right fit, but was black on top instead of all silver.</li>
            <li>My old head holder was extremely worn on my 6-year-old Norelco shaver, so this came in very handy.  </li>
            <li>The product was exactly what I wanted a very good quality replacement for a hard to find part, saved me from buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than a new shaver that was working just fine, and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Showed up in my mailbox really fast too!</li>
            <li>Exact replacement for the one I dropped and broke.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This is an exact replacement.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It was easy to find the part, no problem replacing the old one and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>no problems and is essentially a complete knockoff of original.</li>
            <li>Fast service and exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>Sounds funny, but it really looks nicer now.</li>
            <li>I was certain that my model was included on the list.  </li>
            <li>Being able to buy the head instead of a whole new razor saved me big money</li>
            <li>It came fast.</li>
            <li>Actually, it may work better than the old head holder because I&#x27;ve been getting much closer shaves (go</li>
            <li>It like a glove and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It fit and worked properly.</li>
            <li>The delivery time was fast also, which I appreciated.</li>
            <li>Thanks Neil</li>
            <li>As advertised and fast delivery</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very close</li>
            <li>and it is funtionally working very well.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Seems somewhat on the pricey side, but its cheaper than replacing the whole shaver.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I placed my order, got the usual fast shipping and my razor is good as new.</li>
            <li>The new head holder was exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li>design is slightly different, not as flexible as original and is a different color than original, but is functional and I get to keep my razor.</li>
            <li>Not the same as the original head holder.</li>
            <li>This replacement made my razor work like brand new!</li>
            <li>So buying this saved me having to buy a whole new razor when the one I have shows no signs of wearing out.  </li>
            <li>This is a quick and simple remove &amp; replace fix-it to the problem.</li>
            <li>OLDER NORELCO.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially convenient that Amazon not only carries products but the materials to maintain them and get the most for your money.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>So far, it has performed very well.  </li>
            <li>Exact replacement for my Philips Speed XL HQ8172 except for the colour.&lt;br /&gt;The replacement unit was black, the original was grey.&lt;br /&gt;Works like new except now the shaver heads don&#x27;t fall out anymore!&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>and it works like new.</li>
            <li>It saved me from having to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I needed a new shaver head</li>
            <li>I had almost forgotten how well the shaver worked when it was brand new.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now buying new shavers instead of new blades.</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT A NEW STYLE RAZOR</li>
            <li>It saved me from having to buy an entirely new razor.</li>
            <li>Way cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>It now works like it is new.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d try this before buying a new one.  </li>
            <li>and it beats buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>My shaver runs as if it were new.</li>
            <li>Either buy it or buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>It was like hasving a new razor.</li>
            <li>While the razor blades did fit in the holes; the whole unit would not fit into the razor.</li>
            <li>Be careful in buying this type of replacement parts though as there are so many different models.</li>
            <li>After several years shaving with the Norelco razor, the head holderfinally broke a small piece that held the rotary blades in place, but I am happy that it lasted so long.  </li>
            <li>This new shaver head made my old shaver work like new.</li>
            <li>Made my old razor new with new blades.</li>
            <li>cheaper than buying a complete new shaver.</li>
            <li>now my 10 year old shaver works like new.</li>
            <li>I was trying to decide whether to spend money on my old razor or buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>Much to my chagrin the new razor lacked several features of my old one</li>
            <li>All the problems have been fixed with my shaver now.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s almost 8 year old head holder with the blades falling out.</li>
            <li>It saved old reliable to shave another day.</li>
            <li>replace the old one i had.</li>
            <li>I bought these parts and fixed up my old one.  </li>
            <li>It was well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>It has worked just fine for the last year, no problems expected!</li>
            <li>I loved my razor and was unable to find this part locally and ended up buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>You can replace the head and blades for about the same price as a new shaver.</li>
            <li>It is a little tight when trying to unhinge the top from the razor.  </li>
            <li>When this part keep breaking and cost half the price of a totally new shaver, I just ended up buying  the new shaver.</li>
            <li>This is the second time that this part has been replaced for my shaver which is several years old.  </li>
            <li>It works very sufficiently non the less</li>
            <li>With this new head holder, I don&#x27;t have the extreme play in the heads anymore which results, now, in a high-quality shave.  </li>

            <li> and I got this and a new retaining plate for my shaver for a really good price.  </li>
            <li> This replacement piece fixes the problem fine for 1/3 the cost of another shaver.</li>
            <li> Works just fine.</li>
            <li> Fit perfect restored my old razor and it works like new.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s work but not fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> It fit well, and all cutters went it and held in place admirably.</li>
            <li> Fit and works as promised...</li>
            <li> Perfict fit...</li>
            <li> Does not fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Important to replace and repaire tahn to throw.</li>
            <li> Does this item fit HQ9 philishave speed XL.</li>
            <li> As described,  the replacement part fit like a glove.</li>
            <li> It work and fit my shaver.</li>
            <li> worked fine, fits just like the original that came with razor.</li>
            <li> The product works perfectly with my razor and new blades ordered earlier and provides a like-new shave.</li>
            <li> It works just like the original part.</li>
            <li> The spring-loaded hinge mechanism, floating head holders and latch work like the original.</li>
            <li> As Norelco has hundreds of products/parts, It would make sense to find a way of a more exact description of each item.</li>
            <li> This is an original Norelco part.</li>
            <li> If the description it say was made out of plastic I would have pass on this purchase my original one is metal.</li>
            <li> The original one was so worn out that the shaving heads would sometimes pop out of the holder.</li>
            <li> The part was exactly what I needed and came very quickly.</li>
            <li> Installed these new ones and now it&#x27;s as good as new!</li>
            <li> I feel that it is now better than new!</li>
            <li> I received my product quickly &amp; have used it since.  </li>
            <li> Quick service in any case.</li>
            <li> a quick listing.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I am sure it was my fault as I dropped the razor on many occasions over the course of owning it for probably ten years.  </li>
            <li> Just a quick snap on</li>
            <li> It works like new:)</li>
            <li> I get comfortable with certain things.</li>
            <li> The Norelco 8150 Shaver is one great little machine.</li>
            <li> I checked the products available through Amazon and sure enough they had what I needed.</li>
            <li> It does not fit exactly but more than enough for a very good shave.</li>
            <li> I recevied the new head holder quickly and it fit my Norelco shaver correctly and got my shaver working again.</li>
            <li> Snapped right on</li>
            <li> The right part part for the right electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and restored the razor to like new condition.</li>
            <li> Works like new product with smooth operation.  </li>
            <li> Finally found these at a very cheap price, so I bought a couple.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery as well, you &amp;#34;shaved my day.</li>
            <li> This is fine but doesn&#x27;t fit all razors listed without some minor alterations.</li>
            <li> Head holder was the right fit, but was black on top instead of all silver.</li>
            <li> My old head holder was extremely worn on my 6-year-old Norelco shaver, so this came in very handy.  </li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I wanted a very good quality replacement for a hard to find part, saved me from buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than a new shaver that was working just fine, and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Showed up in my mailbox really fast too!</li>
            <li> Exact replacement for the one I dropped and broke.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This is an exact replacement.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It was easy to find the part, no problem replacing the old one and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> no problems and is essentially a complete knockoff of original.</li>
            <li> Fast service and exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Sounds funny, but it really looks nicer now.</li>
            <li> I was certain that my model was included on the list.  </li>
            <li> Being able to buy the head instead of a whole new razor saved me big money</li>
            <li> It came fast.</li>
            <li> Actually, it may work better than the old head holder because I&#x27;ve been getting much closer shaves (go</li>
            <li> It like a glove and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> It fit and worked properly.</li>
            <li> The delivery time was fast also, which I appreciated.</li>
            <li> Thanks Neil</li>
            <li> As advertised and fast delivery</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very close</li>
            <li> and it is funtionally working very well.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Seems somewhat on the pricey side, but its cheaper than replacing the whole shaver.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I placed my order, got the usual fast shipping and my razor is good as new.</li>
            <li> The new head holder was exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li> design is slightly different, not as flexible as original and is a different color than original, but is functional and I get to keep my razor.</li>
            <li> Not the same as the original head holder.</li>
            <li> This replacement made my razor work like brand new!</li>
            <li> So buying this saved me having to buy a whole new razor when the one I have shows no signs of wearing out.  </li>
            <li> This is a quick and simple remove &amp; replace fix-it to the problem.</li>
            <li> OLDER NORELCO.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially convenient that Amazon not only carries products but the materials to maintain them and get the most for your money.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> So far, it has performed very well.  </li>
            <li> Exact replacement for my Philips Speed XL HQ8172 except for the colour.&lt;br /&gt;The replacement unit was black, the original was grey.&lt;br /&gt;Works like new except now the shaver heads don&#x27;t fall out anymore!&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> and it works like new.</li>
            <li> It saved me from having to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I needed a new shaver head</li>
            <li> I had almost forgotten how well the shaver worked when it was brand new.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now buying new shavers instead of new blades.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT A NEW STYLE RAZOR</li>
            <li> It saved me from having to buy an entirely new razor.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> It now works like it is new.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d try this before buying a new one.  </li>
            <li> and it beats buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> My shaver runs as if it were new.</li>
            <li> Either buy it or buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> It was like hasving a new razor.</li>
            <li> While the razor blades did fit in the holes; the whole unit would not fit into the razor.</li>
            <li> Be careful in buying this type of replacement parts though as there are so many different models.</li>
            <li> After several years shaving with the Norelco razor, the head holderfinally broke a small piece that held the rotary blades in place, but I am happy that it lasted so long.  </li>
            <li> This new shaver head made my old shaver work like new.</li>
            <li> Made my old razor new with new blades.</li>
            <li> cheaper than buying a complete new shaver.</li>
            <li> now my 10 year old shaver works like new.</li>
            <li> I was trying to decide whether to spend money on my old razor or buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> Much to my chagrin the new razor lacked several features of my old one</li>
            <li> All the problems have been fixed with my shaver now.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost 8 year old head holder with the blades falling out.</li>
            <li> It saved old reliable to shave another day.</li>
            <li> replace the old one i had.</li>
            <li> I bought these parts and fixed up my old one.  </li>
            <li> It was well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> It has worked just fine for the last year, no problems expected!</li>
            <li> I loved my razor and was unable to find this part locally and ended up buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> You can replace the head and blades for about the same price as a new shaver.</li>
            <li> It is a little tight when trying to unhinge the top from the razor.  </li>
            <li> When this part keep breaking and cost half the price of a totally new shaver, I just ended up buying  the new shaver.</li>
            <li> This is the second time that this part has been replaced for my shaver which is several years old.  </li>
            <li> It works very sufficiently non the less</li>
            <li> With this new head holder, I don&#x27;t have the extreme play in the heads anymore which results, now, in a high-quality shave.  </li>
            <li> It is black instead of chrome immediatedly around the heads, so it makes my razor look like a new one to me.</li>
            <li> Took only a few seconds to pop this piece out and put the new one in.  </li>
            <li> Put it together in no time flat.</li>
            <li> The only drawback was I thought the price was way too high for a small piece of plastic that is manufactured by the hundreds of thousands.  </li>
            <li> This part is not a perfect fit for the one it replaced</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a person to buy a new razor if I don&#x27;t really need it, it&#x27;s not a fashion statement and they&#x27;re expensive.</li>
            <li> I was not aware that there was a replacement for the shaver head holder; this will save me money in the future as I will not have to replace a shaver when the holder breaks.</li>
            <li> The part in question was purchased as an exact replacement for one broken.  </li>
            <li> Although seemingly a non-moving part, it provides the &amp;#34;floating head&amp;#34; feature with plastic components that eventually wear out and pop loose.  </li>
            <li> This little device saved my shaver, and after months of use, allows me to continue to use a shaver that I bought several years ago.</li>
            <li> it was what I expected for the price, it will extend the life of my shaver.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Every thing was as expected.</li>
            <li> I expected a keeper for the shaver heads with the head holder.</li>
            <li> Saved me a lot of money and aggrivation if I had to use a service center.</li>
            <li> This year I&#x27;d found that the head holder was getting a little less stable and was starting to think this might be the end for my razor.</li>
            <li> Was going to get a new unit til I saw I could just replace what was broken.  </li>
            <li> Interestingly enough, your Norelco razor manual suggests replacing the head at least once a year-whether just to make money off of unneccesary replacement or b/c research shows a need for it</li>
            <li> Less expensive than buying a new shaver!</li>
            <li> Amazon sold it for half the price of Norelco Parts.</li>
            <li> The swivel heads are black in a chrome mount head.  </li>
            <li> If your razor has gotten a little on the \\&quot;burning\\&quot; side and you&#x27;ve already replaced the blades, try replacing the head and see what happens.</li>
            <li> The past 3 Norelco shavers that I&#x27;ve owned had a premature death because the shaver head holders broke.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sort of clumsy and after dropping my razor a few times, I ended up damaging the head to the point of failure.  </li>
            <li> The Razor itself it was made for is very questionable since I had 3 shavers sitting in the drawer for the same reason.</li>
            <li> My shaver has been broken for a while</li>
            <li> Wrong one!&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S AN EXPENSIVE PART.</li>
            <li> (Sorry )</li>
            <li> My shaver started dropping one of the plastic pivoting retainer rings that held in the cutting head and guard.</li>
            <li> My disappointment is for $30 it&#x27;s made out of plastic.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness some companies out there carry replacement parts for these exceptionally expensive razors!</li>
            <li> To bad it is not metal.</li>

            <li> I dropped my razor and cracked one of the plastic pieces so that one of the blade units kept popping out.  I could fix it and then hold it when I used it, but it was a pain.  Was going to get a new unit til I saw I could just replace what was broken.  I love fixing things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Showed up in my mailbox really fast too!</li>
            <li> As good as the original!</li>
            <li> It works just like the original part. Amazon sold it for half the price of Norelco Parts.</li>
            <li> I broke one of the blade holders on my shaver and ordered this one to replace it. It fits and works perfectly. Less expensive than buying a new shaver!</li>
            <li> This head replaced the original perfectly. The spring-loaded hinge mechanism, floating head holders and latch work like the original. What more can I say? Thank goodness some companies out there carry replacement parts for these exceptionally expensive razors!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s work but not fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> My shaver started dropping one of the plastic pivoting retainer rings that held in the cutting head and guard. A month later, a second plastic retainer ring started unclipping and falling out while shaving. My dilemma: buy this kinda pricey part, or replace the entire shaver .... well, it HAS been a good shaver over the years, and the battery still keeps a GOOD charge. This replacement piece fixes the problem fine for 1/3 the cost of another shaver. This is a quick and simple remove &amp; replace fix-it to the problem.</li>
            <li> it was what I expected for the price, it will extend the life of my shaver. Good buy. Good part</li>
            <li> I needed a new shaver head so I purchased one on here b/c I know that I&#x27;ll get what I pay for.  I received my product quickly &amp; have used it since.  It has improved the shave and time replacing the head of my shaver.</li>
            <li> My shaver has been broken for a while and I got this and a new retaining plate for my shaver for a really good price.  All the problems have been fixed with my shaver now.</li>
            <li> The part was exactly what I needed and came very quickly. Would order again from them and price was good.</li>
            <li> My old head holder was extremely worn on my 6-year-old Norelco shaver, so this came in very handy.  I had almost forgotten how well the shaver worked when it was brand new.  With this new head holder, I don&#x27;t have the extreme play in the heads anymore which results, now, in a high-quality shave.  I also no longer have to worry about the heads inadvertently popping out of the shaver while I&#x27;m shaving!  Very nice product!</li>
            <li> Exact replacement for the one I dropped and broke.  Snapped right on and I put the old cut heads in it and worked great.</li>
            <li> The part in question was purchased as an exact replacement for one broken.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Head holder was the right fit, but was black on top instead of all silver. Quick service in any case.</li>
            <li> The right part part for the right electric shaver.It came fast.It was packaged well. It was easy to replace and it fit and the shaver works great now..</li>
            <li> The past 3 Norelco shavers that I&#x27;ve owned had a premature death because the shaver head holders broke.  I was not aware that there was a replacement for the shaver head holder; this will save me money in the future as I will not have to replace a shaver when the holder breaks.</li>
            <li> When I dropped my shaver, the latch mechanism broke on my 9100 series shaver. Looking around the internet, I ended up on Amazon. After searching for 9100 series shaver heads, I ordered this one. It does not fit exactly but more than enough for a very good shave. Also, it seems to shave better than the original shaver head that came with my shaver. All in all, I&#x27;m happy and it&#x27;s waaaayyy cheaper than the Norelco website parts.</li>
            <li> This part is just what I needed.   The Razor itself it was made for is very questionable since I had 3 shavers sitting in the drawer for the same reason. When this part keep breaking and cost half the price of a totally new shaver, I just ended up buying  the new shaver. Finally found these at a very cheap price, so I bought a couple.</li>
            <li> So far, it has performed very well.  It fit well, and all cutters went it and held in place admirably.</li>
            <li> One of the heads on my razor kept falling out. I bought this head holder and it fits and works perfectly. Actually, it may work better than the old head holder because I&#x27;ve been getting much closer shaves (go figure!) There is another bonus to this. It is black instead of chrome immediatedly around the heads, so it makes my razor look like a new one to me. Sounds funny, but it really looks nicer now.</li>
            <li> This was as advertised.  After the original broke, this was a great replacement!  It arrived as promised with all parts and assembly instructions.  It works like new:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sort of clumsy and after dropping my razor a few times, I ended up damaging the head to the point of failure.  I ordered a replacement head and it appears to operate and shave smoother than before.  Interestingly enough, your Norelco razor manual suggests replacing the head at least once a year-whether just to make money off of unneccesary replacement or b/c research shows a need for it I can&#x27;t say.  If your razor has gotten a little on the \\&quot;burning\\&quot; side and you&#x27;ve already replaced the blades, try replacing the head and see what happens.</li>
            <li> To bad it is not metal. Plastic always wears out. Norelco saves the customer pays.</li>
            <li> Fit and works as promised... Made my old razor new with new blades.</li>
            <li> Head holder fit perfectly onto the shaver head.  No problem.  Recommend this item to any Norelco Speed-XL electric shaver owner.</li>
            <li> The product came fast and a very good price, but didn&#x27;t work on the shaver had to order direct from company and pay 2.5 times more.</li>
            <li> After several years shaving with the Norelco razor, the head holderfinally broke a small piece that held the rotary blades in place, but I am happy that it lasted so long.  The new head holder is working great.</li>
            <li> As Norelco has hundreds of products/parts, It would make sense to find a way of a more exact description of each item. More and better views also. The distributor does not do this.&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick listing. I ordered a head holder for an \\&quot;XL\\&quot; razor. Wrong one!&lt;br /&gt;From the listing, you would think it fits all \\&quot;XL\\&quot; Models.&lt;br /&gt;Model listings \\&quot;ARE BURIED INSIDE\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy from Amazon Until they \\&quot;get their act together\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement for my Philips Speed XL HQ8172 except for the colour.&lt;br /&gt;The replacement unit was black, the original was grey.&lt;br /&gt;Works like new except now the shaver heads don&#x27;t fall out anymore!&lt;br /&gt;Much cheaper than buying a complete new shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Norelco SpeedXL 8170. I&#x27;ve been having issues with it&#x27;s almost 8 year old head holder with the blades falling out. Installed these new ones and now it&#x27;s as good as new!</li>
            <li> This is the one I needed.  Be careful in buying this type of replacement parts though as there are so many different models.</li>
            <li> Perfict fit...It saved old reliable to shave another day. I get comfortable with certain things. This razor is one of them. I had a mishap in a motel bathroom about a year ago and have been nursing it along ever since. A friend said check Amazon and there it was. It like a glove and was reasonably priced. I&#x27;ve always had good luck with shipping and this product was no different.&lt;br /&gt;Thanx again to all the Amazon family.</li>
            <li> Fit perfect restored my old razor and it works like new.  Shipped in time without any issues. Easy to order.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly. It fit and worked properly. design is slightly different, not as flexible as original and is a different color than original, but is functional and I get to keep my razor.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get better than a factory made part. Put it together in no time flat. It has worked just fine for the last year, no problems expected! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Does not fit perfectly. Appears not an oem part.</li>
            <li> Too expensive. You can replace the head and blades for about the same price as a new shaver. I&#x27;m now buying new shavers instead of new blades. What has this world come to!?</li>
            <li> ITS A PART, IT WORKS !! AND IT&#x27;S AN EXPENSIVE PART. I BOUGHT A NEW STYLE RAZOR THAT WAS NO COMPARISON&lt;br /&gt;THIS OLDER NORELCO. SO I REPLACED THE WORN PART AND I&#x27;M BACK TO GOOD SHAVES !!!</li>
            <li> Great deal and works great. I love the shaver and was glad that I was able to buy a replacement head holder.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Came wrapped very well, for breakage, and perfect fit and exact model ordered and needed for my Norelco</li>
            <li> I would have had to dispose of my razor had it not been for these folks. I feel that it is now better than new! Very fast delivery as well, you &amp;#34;shaved my day. (Sorry )</li>
            <li> Works as good or better than the original</li>
            <li> The Norelco 8150 Shaver is one great little machine. They don&#x27;t make &#x27;em like that anymore.</li>
            <li> My husband reemplace and your machine continue works perfect.  Is Excelent. Important to replace and repaire tahn to throw.</li>
            <li> While the razor blades did fit in the holes; the whole unit would not fit into the razor. So I through it away.</li>
            <li> This product was excellent and fit my razor perfectly. It saved me from having to buy an entirely new razor. The delivery time was fast also, which I appreciated.</li>
            <li> Not the same as the original head holder.Does not lock properly.</li>
            <li> This is fine but doesn&#x27;t fit all razors listed without some minor alterations.</li>
            <li> The swivel heads are black in a chrome mount head.  No retainer spring assembly is included.  Works like new product with smooth operation.  Good to find a quality replacement.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have to replace my razor and thought I&#x27;d try this $25 fix. Worked like a charm - and my razor now works like it did when I bought it. Couldn&#x27;t believe that the head holder could wear out or what a difference it makes to have the blades held in their proper position.</li>
            <li> Thank you for having the product and getting it here ahead of time for my trips.  All is well and shall keep you for more orders as needed.  Ray W</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000FTLI8E Norelco Shaver Speed-XL Head Holder]]      I can not find if this item is the one i will need so can you tell me. Does this item fit HQ9 philishave speed XL. As it does not tell you on the item Thanks Neil</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> As advertised and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Perfect fit on my old shaver</li>
            <li> The product works perfectly with my razor and new blades ordered earlier and provides a like-new shave. This purchase will extend the life of my razor several years. I&#x27;m hooked on the foolproof ordering process as well.</li>
            <li> As described,  the replacement part fit like a glove.</li>
            <li> This is the second time that this part has been replaced for my shaver which is several years old.  The part is a perfect replacement and was shipped as promised.  Therein is a tip for those who use this or any similarly constructed shaver:  Although seemingly a non-moving part, it provides the &amp;#34;floating head&amp;#34; feature with plastic components that eventually wear out and pop loose.  This simple and inexpensive replacement part can lengthen the life of the shaver that is otherwise functional, same as replacing worn heads.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Works as expected. Excellent delivery.</li>
            <li> I was certain that my model was included on the list.  It is not the correct Head for my 8100XL Norelco razor.  Mine needs a flexible type head &amp; blades.  This is a solid Had frame.</li>
            <li> Most excellent. It looks better than the original.</li>
            <li> The new head holder was exactly what was needed. Works just fine.</li>
            <li> does what it was intended. no problems and is essentially a complete knockoff of original. just not chromed around rings</li>
            <li> A perfect replacement.</li>
            <li> This component fitted and worked perfectly and gave my Norelco electric razor new life. It was well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Husband was very pleased with this product and it fit his razor.  It was just what he had ordered.  Thinks the product&lt;br /&gt;is good.</li>
            <li> I recevied the new head holder quickly and it fit my Norelco shaver correctly and got my shaver working again.</li>
            <li> I never knew that there&#x27;s. A replacement for this part which I have been looking for quite sometime. This is a good product to have</li>
            <li> This Head Holder saved my fav razor.  Works great.  East to install.  Way cheaper than buying a new razor. Bye</li>
            <li> the head holder was defective and was of no use.</li>
            <li> This revived a razor that I thought would have to be thrown away.  It now works like it is new.</li>
            <li> I dropped my 8140XL on the tile floor and the head holder cracked so the heads would not stay in place.  I figured I&#x27;d try this before buying a new one.  Took only a few seconds to pop this piece out and put the new one in.  Used this time to replace the heads as well and now my 10 year old shaver works like new.</li>
            <li> This part is not a perfect fit for the one it replaced but it&#x27;s very close and it is funtionally working very well. It is a little tight when trying to unhinge the top from the razor.  It works very sufficiently non the less and it beats buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> This is an original Norelco part. Works well on my shaver. Just as you would expect. Price was good also. Nothing else to say.</li>
            <li> I required a replacement head for my Norelco this was perfect fit great.  After market part but worked great with no problems shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> This replalcement head holder fit perfectly.  My shaver runs as if it were new.</li>
            <li> Every thing was as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Norelco razor for 9 years now, it works great, I get replacement blades regularly from Amazon. I&#x27;m not a person to buy a new razor if I don&#x27;t really need it, it&#x27;s not a fashion statement and they&#x27;re expensive. This year I&#x27;d found that the head holder was getting a little less stable and was starting to think this might be the end for my razor. I checked the products available through Amazon and sure enough they had what I needed. I placed my order, got the usual fast shipping and my razor is good as new. The part was inexpensive and very easy to install. It&#x27;s especially convenient that Amazon not only carries products but the materials to maintain them and get the most for your money.</li>
            <li> This is an exact replacement.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for better.  Much cheaper than a new shaver that was working just fine, and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> The product is a good product. worked fine, fits just like the original that came with razor. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> the head shaver item was excellent and worked well on the shaver.  I ordered two item, head and blades, but they came from two different places and two charges for shipping but one billing from Amazon.  Why two separte shipping charges...should only be one...thanks</li>
            <li> Just what my husband was expecting.</li>
            <li> This works to replace this portion of the shaver if you have to.  One note, you will still need the piece underneath the blades to help keep the blades in place</li>
            <li> My head holder broke after many years.  I am sure it was my fault as I dropped the razor on many occasions over the course of owning it for probably ten years.  This part is just fine and was easy to install.  The only drawback was I thought the price was way too high for a small piece of plastic that is manufactured by the hundreds of thousands.  But what are you going to do?  They have you by the proverbial tennis balls.  Either buy it or buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I wanted a very good quality replacement for a hard to find part, saved me from buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Had to install it for someone else---very, very easy. Just a quick snap on and you&#x27;re done. Nothing to it.</li>
            <li> Fit my shaver perfectly.</li>
            <li> An OEM replacement of the shaver head holder. Does exactly what it is meant to do. Seems somewhat on the pricey side, but its cheaper than replacing the whole shaver.</li>
            <li> I orignally ordered the replacement heads, and found out that was just blades, so I had to order this to get my razor working agian.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  It was received on time.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly, my son is back to shaving!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed after I bumped one blade retainer out if place and lost it during travel. I found the blade and screen, just not the housing. So buying this saved me having to buy a whole new razor when the one I have shows no signs of wearing out.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, good price, delivered on time</li>
            <li> I expected a keeper for the shaver heads with the head holder.</li>
            <li> It work and fit my shaver. My disappointment is for $30 it&#x27;s made out of plastic. If the description it say was made out of plastic I would have pass on this purchase my original one is metal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Norelco Speed-XL electric razor. The original one was so worn out that the shaving heads would sometimes pop out of the holder. This replacement made my razor work like brand new! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> verry good product. replace the old one i had. fits perfect.</li>
            <li> I needed both items and i receibed them and they are great. It was like hasving a new razor. I want to thank you for the time and effoert.</li>
            <li> Could not find this part locally. Easy to install and restored the razor to like new condition. I had forget how well it shaves when working like it should. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I was trying to decide whether to spend money on my old razor or buy a new one.  I bought these parts and fixed up my old one.  Everthing fit and worked great.</li>
            <li> Part fit perfectly and was shipped quickly.  Works great! Saved me a lot of money and aggrivation if I had to use a service center.</li>
