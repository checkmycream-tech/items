            <li>I received this time for free for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is top notch.</li>
            <li>They work like they are supposed to and more.  </li>
            <li>Love these bottles.  </li>

            <li>They&#x27;re the perfect size to carry to and from the gym so that I don&#x27;t have to carry larger bottles with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>these are wonderful bottles but not totally leak proof.  </li>
            <li>I love the 3oz Travel Bottles it is just what I needed.</li>
            <li>Perfectly sized, easy to fill, and the plastic is pliable enough so that you can squeeze out every bit of the liquid inside!</li>
            <li>immediately I knew they were worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>You can get what works best for you in terms of having a set or getting individual bottles rather than having to buy a huge bag of assorted sizes.</li>
            <li>First, the bottles look fantastic, they are charming and cute.</li>
            <li>I loved these so much</li>
            <li>but with the suction cups, it keeps them off the floor &amp; much more accessible when I&#x27;m showering.</li>
            <li>Easy to fill.</li>
            <li>The suction cups easily stick to my bathroom mirror and shower door,</li>
            <li>I like that they are silicone and squishy, so it&#x27;s easy to squeeze product out.</li>
            <li>Yes they are cheaper, but they also leak and break really easy.  </li>
            <li>easy to use and the fact that it is based on silicon so not to worry about breaking the bottle too</li>
            <li>* Flip-top cap for easy dispensing.  </li>
            <li>They seem quite sturdy and the caps unscrew easily.  </li>
            <li>They are so convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li>so pouring is easy to fill them up.  </li>
            <li>They are colorful, which makes it easy to remember which bottle is for which product!  </li>
            <li>I thought my cheaper set was just fine, until I used these...</li>
            <li>They were shipped and received quickly!</li>
            <li>The showers at my gym don&#x27;t have anywhere to put your toiletries so that was a huge plus.</li>
            <li>When offered a set for free to try and review, I said yes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>selection of bottles offered by Dot&amp;Dot is fabulous.</li>
            <li>: I received a free sample for the purposes of writing this review.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with how good they looked.</li>
            <li>These are worth the money!</li>
            <li>have just used them on my first airplane trip and were easy to pack and easy to see what&#x27;s inside.</li>
            <li>We have now used these on two different trips, and I&#x27;m sure they will last through many more because of the good quality.</li>
            <li>They are colorful, flexible and lightweight enough that the suction cup holds them nicely to the shower wall!  </li>
            <li>Nice unexpected addition.</li>
            <li>After taking the precaution to squeeze out air, your tubes will not swell as much at altitude, and the 10% to 20% of slack space will let your tubes expand, without popping its top.</li>
            <li>This set of 4 travel bottles allows you to bring your 3oz of TSA approved liquid without having to spend so much money on travel sizes of your favorite cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>These bottles are soooo much better than my old travel set!!!</li>
            <li>so you can label each bottle appropriately and with the big opening it was easy to fill and will be way easy to clean</li>
            <li>High quality, stylish and functional.</li>
            <li>Great product and will definitely purchase more of them in the future.</li>
            <li>There are two tabs on the white cap that make it real easy.</li>
            <li>The colors are pastels and are very pretty.</li>
            <li>Refilling, because of the wide opening at the top, is very easy.  </li>
            <li>Love my new travel bottles.</li>
            <li>(Tubes are very flexible and easy to squeeze.)</li>
            <li>As a frequent business traveler there are hand down, the best travel bottles - stick &#x27;em to the shower wall and no leaks when packed!</li>
            <li>Thanks Dot Dot!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The opening to fill is nice and wide so that made it easy to load up.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and flexible, so it is easy to squeeze just the right amount of product out of them with one hand in the shower!</li>
            <li>They have a safety system so they won&#x27;t leak and the silicone is nice and squishy so they should last longer.</li>
            <li>Color coding is handy and the white bands have printed names on them indicating contents.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The bag seems to be made of clear PVC and is firmly supportive.</li>
            <li>I have not had such nice travel bottles before.</li>
            <li>very well made and super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>love that it comes in a 311 quart sized clear bag that is much more durable than a regular ziploc bag.</li>
            <li>This is great because it means no more dropping bottles while you shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I first ordered them I really had no idea just how cool these bottles are.  </li>
            <li>The small suction cup on one side is very handy for the gym rats.</li>
            <li>They were super easy to fill, and they held just the right amount of shampoo, conditioner, and lotion for our ten day vacation at the beach!!  </li>
            <li>They are much bigger than I anticipated, the colors are bright and vibrant and they are extremely high quality.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>As usual I received this item free in exchange for a review but despite that kindness I give my absolutely candid feedback</li>
            <li>Just received these and they are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>However, they appear to be very similar to items which sell for more in stores.</li>
            <li>very convenient size for two weeks worth of shampoos, etc.</li>
            <li>and they are TSA approved which really helps when packing for a trip on a plane!</li>
            <li>Second, they have a screw top</li>
            <li>These also have a spin-able plastic ring close to the top of the bottle that have different abbreviations on them, so you will never mix up bottles...if you&#x27;re like me, you always forget what color bottle you put what in...but not anymore.</li>
            <li>I also like that there are different colors so that I can easily identify which products are in each container.  </li>
            <li>The white cap also has pre printed labels on it that you can easily change on each bottle.</li>
            <li>Super easy to fill and the bottles are soft enough to squeeze the contents out - no shaking or banging to coax out your lotion, shampoo, conditioner, etc.</li>
            <li>so they sit nice and tight together.</li>
            <li>The only thing cheap is the zippered case, which could be nicer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, a very well thought out product.  </li>
            <li>More to this sort of thing than I expected</li>
            <li>They seem very leak proof.  </li>
            <li>and I used 1 of the bottles for a face cleanser with a very watery consistency until shaken.</li>
            <li>They work well at high altitudes, if you pack &#x27;em correctly!</li>
            <li>Have not broken any of my Tubes</li>
            <li>Third, there is a suction cup that you can use to stick it to any smooth surface in the shower or on the mirror.  </li>
            <li>These are much easier to squeeze out shampoo and lotion....</li>
            <li>These also have a nice tight seal, and don&#x27;t leak!</li>
            <li>* Wide mouth for easy filling of the bottles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wide mouth makes them easy to refill.  </li>
            <li>The lid unscrews and the bottle has a wide mouth to make filling it and cleaning it easy.  </li>
            <li>the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set came packaged in a clear plastic slide-top bag which was extremely helpful, as the bag is able to be used to keep my toiletries while traveling.</li>
            <li>They are very pliable which makes squeezing out your product very easy unlike the hard plastic bottles.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was a little steep at first, but when they arrived, I understand that these are well worth it.</li>
            <li>I filled it half way with shampoo and tried shaking and stepping on it and not a drop leaked.</li>
            <li>The mouth of the bottle is large enough to fill with the thicker gels or creams.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these little bottles!!  </li>
            <li>These are TSA approved, &amp; come in a clear plastic resealable travel bag.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised with this product.  </li>
            <li>Soft and grippy.</li>
            <li>The plastic is soft and pliable so I won&#x27;t have to worry about it cracking or difficulty getting the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>-yet, even though I frequently drop them, and often toss them 10 or 20 feet, from the shower into the sink, when I am in a hurry to shower, pack, and check out of a hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before closing the tubes , squeeze out as much air as possible.</li>
            <li>I have also so far used my four bottles for shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave this advice in a previous review &amp;#62; If your tubes are leaking after travel by airplane, I recommend trying this: Don&#x27;t fill the tubes completely full.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;sin package .&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li>These travel bottles, though small, serve a huge purpose in my travel process.</li>
            <li>I was able to squeeze it hard enough to spray out some shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Grandchildren live 6 time zones away and my son-in-law likes me enough to want me to visit.</li>
            <li>After taking the 3 - Dot &amp; Dot travel air travel bottles out during a two day sleep over at my sister this weekend  I noticed that the two bottles with the creamy and thick liquids held up fine and did not leak at all.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it, if it lasts.</li>
            <li>However each one seems to be pre set on a specific name (clear &#x3D; lotion)</li>
            <li>These, on the other hand, are really well designed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the bottle with the watery liquid made my ziplock bag slightly wet therefore, these Dot&amp; Dot  bottles hold up really well for thicker products such as creams, lotions, probably gels.</li>
            <li>Just buy the large size and fill these little silicone travel bottles.  </li>

            <li> these are wonderful bottles but not totally leak proof.  </li>
            <li> I love the 3oz Travel Bottles it is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Perfectly sized, easy to fill, and the plastic is pliable enough so that you can squeeze out every bit of the liquid inside!</li>
            <li> immediately I knew they were worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> You can get what works best for you in terms of having a set or getting individual bottles rather than having to buy a huge bag of assorted sizes.</li>
            <li> First, the bottles look fantastic, they are charming and cute.</li>
            <li> I loved these so much</li>
            <li> but with the suction cups, it keeps them off the floor &amp; much more accessible when I&#x27;m showering.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill.</li>
            <li> The suction cups easily stick to my bathroom mirror and shower door,</li>
            <li> I like that they are silicone and squishy, so it&#x27;s easy to squeeze product out.</li>
            <li> Yes they are cheaper, but they also leak and break really easy.  </li>
            <li> easy to use and the fact that it is based on silicon so not to worry about breaking the bottle too</li>
            <li> * Flip-top cap for easy dispensing.  </li>
            <li> They seem quite sturdy and the caps unscrew easily.  </li>
            <li> They are so convenient and easy to use.</li>
            <li> so pouring is easy to fill them up.  </li>
            <li> They are colorful, which makes it easy to remember which bottle is for which product!  </li>
            <li> I thought my cheaper set was just fine, until I used these...</li>
            <li> They were shipped and received quickly!</li>
            <li> The showers at my gym don&#x27;t have anywhere to put your toiletries so that was a huge plus.</li>
            <li> When offered a set for free to try and review, I said yes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> selection of bottles offered by Dot&amp;Dot is fabulous.</li>
            <li> : I received a free sample for the purposes of writing this review.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how good they looked.</li>
            <li> These are worth the money!</li>
            <li> have just used them on my first airplane trip and were easy to pack and easy to see what&#x27;s inside.</li>
            <li> We have now used these on two different trips, and I&#x27;m sure they will last through many more because of the good quality.</li>
            <li> They are colorful, flexible and lightweight enough that the suction cup holds them nicely to the shower wall!  </li>
            <li> Nice unexpected addition.</li>
            <li> After taking the precaution to squeeze out air, your tubes will not swell as much at altitude, and the 10% to 20% of slack space will let your tubes expand, without popping its top.</li>
            <li> This set of 4 travel bottles allows you to bring your 3oz of TSA approved liquid without having to spend so much money on travel sizes of your favorite cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> These bottles are soooo much better than my old travel set!!!</li>
            <li> so you can label each bottle appropriately and with the big opening it was easy to fill and will be way easy to clean</li>
            <li> High quality, stylish and functional.</li>
            <li> Great product and will definitely purchase more of them in the future.</li>
            <li> There are two tabs on the white cap that make it real easy.</li>
            <li> The colors are pastels and are very pretty.</li>
            <li> Refilling, because of the wide opening at the top, is very easy.  </li>
            <li> Love my new travel bottles.</li>
            <li> (Tubes are very flexible and easy to squeeze.)</li>
            <li> As a frequent business traveler there are hand down, the best travel bottles - stick &#x27;em to the shower wall and no leaks when packed!</li>
            <li> Thanks Dot Dot!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The opening to fill is nice and wide so that made it easy to load up.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and flexible, so it is easy to squeeze just the right amount of product out of them with one hand in the shower!</li>
            <li> They have a safety system so they won&#x27;t leak and the silicone is nice and squishy so they should last longer.</li>
            <li> Color coding is handy and the white bands have printed names on them indicating contents.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The bag seems to be made of clear PVC and is firmly supportive.</li>
            <li> I have not had such nice travel bottles before.</li>
            <li> very well made and super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> love that it comes in a 311 quart sized clear bag that is much more durable than a regular ziploc bag.</li>
            <li> This is great because it means no more dropping bottles while you shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I first ordered them I really had no idea just how cool these bottles are.  </li>
            <li> The small suction cup on one side is very handy for the gym rats.</li>
            <li> They were super easy to fill, and they held just the right amount of shampoo, conditioner, and lotion for our ten day vacation at the beach!!  </li>
            <li> They are much bigger than I anticipated, the colors are bright and vibrant and they are extremely high quality.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> As usual I received this item free in exchange for a review but despite that kindness I give my absolutely candid feedback</li>
            <li> Just received these and they are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> However, they appear to be very similar to items which sell for more in stores.</li>
            <li> very convenient size for two weeks worth of shampoos, etc.</li>
            <li> and they are TSA approved which really helps when packing for a trip on a plane!</li>
            <li> Second, they have a screw top</li>
            <li> These also have a spin-able plastic ring close to the top of the bottle that have different abbreviations on them, so you will never mix up bottles...if you&#x27;re like me, you always forget what color bottle you put what in...but not anymore.</li>
            <li> I also like that there are different colors so that I can easily identify which products are in each container.  </li>
            <li> The white cap also has pre printed labels on it that you can easily change on each bottle.</li>
            <li> Super easy to fill and the bottles are soft enough to squeeze the contents out - no shaking or banging to coax out your lotion, shampoo, conditioner, etc.</li>
            <li> so they sit nice and tight together.</li>
            <li> The only thing cheap is the zippered case, which could be nicer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, a very well thought out product.  </li>
            <li> More to this sort of thing than I expected</li>
            <li> They seem very leak proof.  </li>
            <li> and I used 1 of the bottles for a face cleanser with a very watery consistency until shaken.</li>
            <li> They work well at high altitudes, if you pack &#x27;em correctly!</li>
            <li> Have not broken any of my Tubes</li>
            <li> Third, there is a suction cup that you can use to stick it to any smooth surface in the shower or on the mirror.  </li>
            <li> These are much easier to squeeze out shampoo and lotion....</li>
            <li> These also have a nice tight seal, and don&#x27;t leak!</li>
            <li> * Wide mouth for easy filling of the bottles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wide mouth makes them easy to refill.  </li>
            <li> The lid unscrews and the bottle has a wide mouth to make filling it and cleaning it easy.  </li>
            <li> the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set came packaged in a clear plastic slide-top bag which was extremely helpful, as the bag is able to be used to keep my toiletries while traveling.</li>
            <li> They are very pliable which makes squeezing out your product very easy unlike the hard plastic bottles.</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was a little steep at first, but when they arrived, I understand that these are well worth it.</li>
            <li> I filled it half way with shampoo and tried shaking and stepping on it and not a drop leaked.</li>
            <li> The mouth of the bottle is large enough to fill with the thicker gels or creams.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these little bottles!!  </li>
            <li> These are TSA approved, &amp; come in a clear plastic resealable travel bag.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised with this product.  </li>
            <li> Soft and grippy.</li>
            <li> The plastic is soft and pliable so I won&#x27;t have to worry about it cracking or difficulty getting the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> -yet, even though I frequently drop them, and often toss them 10 or 20 feet, from the shower into the sink, when I am in a hurry to shower, pack, and check out of a hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before closing the tubes , squeeze out as much air as possible.</li>
            <li> I have also so far used my four bottles for shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave this advice in a previous review &amp;#62; If your tubes are leaking after travel by airplane, I recommend trying this: Don&#x27;t fill the tubes completely full.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;sin package .&lt;br</li>

            <li> These travel bottles, though small, serve a huge purpose in my travel process.</li>
            <li> I was able to squeeze it hard enough to spray out some shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Grandchildren live 6 time zones away and my son-in-law likes me enough to want me to visit.</li>
            <li> After taking the 3 - Dot &amp; Dot travel air travel bottles out during a two day sleep over at my sister this weekend  I noticed that the two bottles with the creamy and thick liquids held up fine and did not leak at all.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it, if it lasts.</li>
            <li> However each one seems to be pre set on a specific name (clear &#x3D; lotion)</li>
            <li> These, on the other hand, are really well designed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the bottle with the watery liquid made my ziplock bag slightly wet therefore, these Dot&amp; Dot  bottles hold up really well for thicker products such as creams, lotions, probably gels.</li>
            <li> Just buy the large size and fill these little silicone travel bottles.  </li>
            <li> The suction cup seems to be a little too small to carry a filled bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have had trouble with different types of hard plastic bottles in the past, but getting liquids or lotions out of these is extremely easy and that is always appreciated.</li>
            <li> However, for products that have the consistency of water, if there is a lot of pressure on that bottle while it is closed, it can potentially leak.</li>
            <li> What you do is stick it upside down so that the flip open cap is toward the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I used the precaution of filling them to 80-90% capacity and squeezing out the extra air to allow for expansion before air travel (mentioned in a previous review).</li>
            <li> We are now on another trip and one comment my husband made was to make the little label on the cap a different color.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these bottles to other people who travel a lot or need to carry small amounts of liquids on a regular basis.ce travel bottles before.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these bottles to other people who travel a lot or need to carry small amounts of liquids on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> I tested the empty bottles&#x27; suction cups and one worked</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted money before on those little cheap travel bottles from the drug store, and even though they don&#x27;t cost much, they are practically worthless.</li>
            <li> She refuses to use any other bottles.</li>
            <li> well while other fell off the wall immediately.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that the travel bag which contains the bottles appears quite flimsy.</li>
            <li> The mouth was very wide and easly to fill.  </li>
            <li> After filling, I tried squeezing them as hard as I could to see if the caps would pop open</li>
            <li> I have to admit, for someone who did not pack the liquids to use it in the shower, with the label and cap both white, it was hard to read.</li>
            <li> If the raised letters could be black, it would make it easier to read while in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Have you ever opened your toiletry kit and found a leaky mess?  </li>
            <li> I then packed my duffel bag quite tightly.</li>
            <li> I deducted a star after using this for a few days.  </li>
            <li> The silicone material is very tough yet soft and malleable.  </li>
            <li> and I see no easy way to change them around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With hard plastic containers, they don&#x27;t always give when you&#x27;re trying to squeeze.</li>
            <li> I threw in a bottle of lotion in my luggage and that sucker oozed out by the time I got to my room and unpacked.</li>
            <li> When I was contacted about reviewing this product I will admit I was a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li> So in the wrong conditions this would spray shampoo all over your laptop.&lt;br</li>
            <li> though I&#x27;d seen these bottles, always was a bit skeptical.</li>

            <li> Perfect 3 oz travel bottles</li>
            <li> Outstanding silicon bottles. High quality, stylish and functional. The only thing cheap is the zippered case, which could be nicer.</li>
            <li> Love these bottles! Easy to fill. Love the option to label bottles without use of stickers. Great product and will definitely purchase more of them in the future.</li>
            <li> love the product, delivered on time, and works great</li>
            <li> These are very nice bottles! Thanks! Will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Excellent design.  Have you ever opened your toiletry kit and found a leaky mess?  That won&#x27;t happen with these bottles.  The silicone material is very tough yet soft and malleable.  The design of the caps is ingenious and provides an airtight seal, very important when flying.  The suction cups easily stick to my bathroom mirror and shower door, a feature that will come in handy when staying in a hotel room. Refilling, because of the wide opening at the top, is very easy.  These are the nicest travel bottles I&#x27;ve been able to find.  I thought the price was a little steep at first, but when they arrived, I understand that these are well worth it.</li>
            <li> Perfectly sized, easy to fill, and the plastic is pliable enough so that you can squeeze out every bit of the liquid inside!</li>
            <li> These are great - just what I need for my trip!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love these wonderful travel containers!  They are so well made! I&#x27;ve wasted money before on those little cheap travel bottles from the drug store, and even though they don&#x27;t cost much, they are practically worthless. These, on the other hand, are really well designed. They were super easy to fill, and they held just the right amount of shampoo, conditioner, and lotion for our ten day vacation at the beach!!  And best of all, they didn&#x27;t leak on the plane!!  They are very soft and flexible, so it is easy to squeeze just the right amount of product out of them with one hand in the shower! They are colorful, which makes it easy to remember which bottle is for which product!  I loved these so much I bought a 2 oz set for myself for shorter trips and another set for my daughter for when she travels. Very, very pleased!  We have now used these on two different trips, and I&#x27;m sure they will last through many more because of the good quality.</li>
            <li> Never got to use the bottles. Opened the package, opened the zipper and -- boo! -- it came off the track.  Returned the set.</li>
            <li> Great!!! They work like they are supposed to and more. Comes with TSA approved bag. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my fair share of travel containers, and these have to be the best I&#x27;ve used so far. I like that they are silicone and squishy, so it&#x27;s easy to squeeze product out. With hard plastic containers, they don&#x27;t always give when you&#x27;re trying to squeeze. These also have a nice tight seal, and don&#x27;t leak!</li>
            <li> I have always bought the plastic travel bottles before.  Yes they are cheaper, but they also leak and break really easy.  These bottles are great!!  They have a safety system so they won&#x27;t leak and the silicone is nice and squishy so they should last longer.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I think of this?  These Dot&amp;Dot travel bottles are a must for any road warrior.  As a frequent business traveler there are hand down, the best travel bottles - stick &#x27;em to the shower wall and no leaks when packed!</li>
            <li> Sturdy. Convenient. Would order again.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered them I really had no idea just how cool these bottles are.  The caps twist so you can label each bottle appropriately and with the big opening it was easy to fill and will be way easy to clean</li>
            <li> I was really surprised with this product.  I was not expecting the material the bottles are made of, but I love it!  I also like that there are different colors so that I can easily identify which products are in each container.  Very, very satisfied!</li>
            <li> My wife loves these travel bottles.  Super easy to fill and the bottles are soft enough to squeeze the contents out - no shaking or banging to coax out your lotion, shampoo, conditioner, etc. They come in a zip lock travel pouch so they sit nice and tight together. She refuses to use any other bottles.</li>
            <li> easy to use and the fact that it is based on silicon so not to worry about breaking the bottle too</li>
            <li> very well made and super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Great product works as advertised!</li>
            <li> Had I known these bottles exist, I would have bought them years ago! Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about buying smaller containers for my travels but can simply fill from the ones at home. And, most of all: leakages be gone! Great reusable bottles. Very soft. Come in a handy TSA approved transparent pouch.</li>
            <li> I received this time for free for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The silicone bottles are very easy to handle. Soft and grippy. The small suction cup on one side is very handy for the gym rats. The showers at my gym don&#x27;t have anywhere to put your toiletries so that was a huge plus. It sticks well to glass and even mirrors. I had no problems with leaking (yet). After filling, I tried squeezing them as hard as I could to see if the caps would pop open like I read in another review and it did not. It stayed shut and nothing leaked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening to fill is nice and wide so that made it easy to load up. The white cap also has pre printed labels on it that you can easily change on each bottle. Unscrew the cover and pop the cap up. There are two tabs on the white cap that make it real easy. After you pop it off, you can rotate the opening to show what label you want (shamp, cond, soap, lotion, etc). One thing I&#x27;d like to mention is the bottle is one entire silicone piece which makes cleaning them out easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it comes in a 311 quart sized clear bag that is much more durable than a regular ziploc bag. I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to travel yet so I will update my review after my tip in October to see how well these hold up on our next family trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m very impressed with these bottles and look forward to taking them to the gym with me regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 10/17/14: We are now on another trip and one comment my husband made was to make the little label on the cap a different color. I have to admit, for someone who did not pack the liquids to use it in the shower, with the label and cap both white, it was hard to read. If the raised letters could be black, it would make it easier to read while in the shower.  I packed these in my luggage and nothing leaked out. I threw in a bottle of lotion in my luggage and that sucker oozed out by the time I got to my room and unpacked. I wish I had taken a picture of it. This product is top notch.</li>
            <li> These bottles are wonderful! They are much bigger than I anticipated, the colors are bright and vibrant and they are extremely high quality. They thought of everything when they made this product. These are worth the money! Thanks Dot Dot!!</li>
            <li> Great!!! They work like they are supposed to and more.  Comes with TSA approved bag.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as I expected. Very cute colors. Bottles are well made. Not flimsy, seems to be quality made.</li>
            <li> As usual I received this item free in exchange for a review but despite that kindness I give my absolutely candid feedback below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* When I was contacted about reviewing this product I will admit I was a bit skeptical.  What could there possibly be to review?  As it turns out, quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Wide mouth for easy filling of the bottles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Flip-top cap for easy dispensing.  Unfortunately, when submitting this to a crush-test, I was able to spray water all over the kitchen with one hand.  The flip-top cap springs open under pressure.  So in the wrong conditions this would spray shampoo all over your laptop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Suction cup on the side is really a handy thought.  I could imagine this in a hotel room shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Color coding is handy and the white bands have printed names on them indicating contents.  However each one seems to be pre set on a specific name (clear &#x3D; lotion) and I see no easy way to change them around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, a very well thought out product.  More to this sort of thing than I expected but I still wouldn&#x27;t trust it in the same bag with my camera or laptop.</li>
            <li> Just bought them as a gift for my sister-in-law so I have not used them.  They seem quite sturdy and the caps unscrew easily.  I tested the empty bottles&#x27; suction cups and one worked well while other fell off the wall immediately.  I agree with other reviewers that the travel bag which contains the bottles appears quite flimsy.</li>
            <li> I travel a LOT. Grandchildren live 6 time zones away and my son-in-law likes me enough to want me to visit. Often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So though I&#x27;d seen these bottles, always was a bit skeptical. When offered a set for free to try and review, I said yes.&lt;br /&gt;They work. Have been testing by having water in one in a purse (won&#x27;t be end of the world if it popped open and spills. But hasn&#x27;t spilled a drop. Nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, I recommend whole-heartedly.</li>
            <li> Very good quality! I got these to make toothpaste for my kids and they are perfect. I love the suction cups on them! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Non-leaking, easy to use, stick to the shower wall--great for the gym!</li>
            <li> They are great! They don&#x27;t leak and are TSA approved. Will be taking them on my Alaskan Cruise.</li>
            <li> Just received these and they are exactly what I was looking for. The plastic is soft and pliable so I won&#x27;t have to worry about it cracking or difficulty getting the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Just received my travel bottles.  They seem very leak proof.  Just what I was looking for.  I also like the suction cup on the side of the bottle.  Nice unexpected addition.</li>
            <li> I used 2 bottles for a creamy shampoo and a creamy body soap and I used 1 of the bottles for a face cleanser with a very watery consistency until shaken. Just for extra precaution I put the bottle that held the watery facial cleanser in a ziplock bag in case it leaked. I then packed my duffel bag quite tightly. After taking the 3 - Dot &amp; Dot travel air travel bottles out during a two day sleep over at my sister this weekend  I noticed that the two bottles with the creamy and thick liquids held up fine and did not leak at all. However,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the bottle with the watery liquid made my ziplock bag slightly wet therefore, these Dot&amp; Dot  bottles hold up really well for thicker products such as creams, lotions, probably gels. However, for products that have the consistency of water, if there is a lot of pressure on that bottle while it is closed, it can potentially leak. I have had good luck, traveling with these Dot&amp;Dot  tubes . They work well at high altitudes, if you pack &#x27;em correctly! (read further) The suction cups work well, in my experience they stick good to wood and refrigerators . Have not broken any of my Tubes -yet, even though I frequently drop them, and often toss them 10 or 20 feet, from the shower into the sink, when I am in a hurry to shower, pack, and check out of a hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I gave this advice in a previous review &amp;#62; If your tubes are leaking after travel by airplane, I recommend trying this: Don&#x27;t fill the tubes completely full. Fill it only to perhaps 80% to 90% of capacity. Before closing the tubes , squeeze out as much air as possible. (Tubes are very flexible and easy to squeeze.) After taking the precaution to squeeze out air, your tubes will not swell as much at altitude, and the 10% to 20% of slack space will let your tubes expand, without popping its top. Well hope all my testing of this product helps you choose them Courtesy of Dot&amp;Dot and  gave bonus one separately by e-mail to make total of 5 and included thank you card in package .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;sin package .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love these bottles.  They are colorful, flexible and lightweight enough that the suction cup holds them nicely to the shower wall!  The mouth of the bottle is large enough to fill with the thicker gels or creams. These are a must have if you need to take your preferred hair care products (I do!!) when you travel. I plan to pick up another set.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these little bottles!!  Well worth the money.  Wide mouth makes them easy to refill.  They are very pliable which makes squeezing out your product very easy unlike the hard plastic bottles.</li>
            <li> Just received my order so I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the product yet. However, they appear to be very similar to items which sell for more in stores. I especially like the pre-printed labels on the caps</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my travel needs, as well as for my daughter to use in college when traveling with her team!</li>
            <li> Love my new travel bottles. They are so convenient and easy to use. I like how you can choose what is in each bottle from the inserts on the lid - very good idea! So happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> very convenient size for two weeks worth of shampoos, etc.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these, work perfectly and just what I need when traveling and they are TSA approved which really helps when packing for a trip on a plane!</li>
            <li> These products are great! They&#x27;re the perfect size and the stick to the hotel shower wall--which is great since there is rarely room to set them in the shower! They were shipped and received quickly!</li>
            <li> Product came in good condition. Satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Update: I deducted a star after using this for a few days.  The suction cup seems to be a little too small to carry a filled bottle.  My blue bottle fell on the floor and as a result the flip cap hinge broke.  The cap is made of brittle plastic and it got separated from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These silicone bottles are simply wonderful.  My wife loves how you can pour shampoo, conditioner,  liquid soap, lotion, or anything that we may need for travel.  First, the bottles look fantastic, they are charming and cute. Second, they have a screw top so pouring is easy to fill them up.  Third, there is a suction cup that you can use to stick it to any smooth surface in the shower or on the mirror.  What you do is stick it upside down so that the flip open cap is toward the bottom.  When you need to dispense shampoo or soap, just open the flip cap, place your palm at the bottom, and press on the bottle with one finger to let a portion ooze on your palm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just brilliant.  It comes in four different colors so you can color code for shampoo, soap, lotion, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
            <li> These bottles are great for using to transport liquids and gels while traveling or for bringing them in your gym bag to and from the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set came packaged in a clear plastic slide-top bag which was extremely helpful, as the bag is able to be used to keep my toiletries while traveling. The bag seems to be made of clear PVC and is firmly supportive. I have no doubt that it will hold up over countless trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3oz travel bottles are great containers. They&#x27;re made of a squishy plastic material that makes getting the products out a cinch. I have had trouble with different types of hard plastic bottles in the past, but getting liquids or lotions out of these is extremely easy and that is always appreciated. The colors are pastels and are very pretty. I was pleasantly surprised with how good they looked. In addition, the bottles have suction cups so you can attach them to the tile wall of the shower. This is great because it means no more dropping bottles while you shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just used them on my first airplane trip and were easy to pack and easy to see what&#x27;s inside. The bottles are sturdy and durable and don&#x27;t leak. I used the precaution of filling them to 80-90% capacity and squeezing out the extra air to allow for expansion before air travel (mentioned in a previous review). I have also so far used my four bottles for shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The selection of bottles offered by Dot&amp;Dot is fabulous. You can get what works best for you in terms of having a set or getting individual bottles rather than having to buy a huge bag of assorted sizes. I like these so much that when I return from my trip I&#x27;m planning to keep filling these with shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion and tossing them in my gym bag for everyday use. They&#x27;re the perfect size to carry to and from the gym so that I don&#x27;t have to carry larger bottles with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great travel bottles. I have not had such nice travel bottles before. This product has exceeded my expectation and I plan to use them for years to come. I would definitely recommend these bottles to other people who travel a lot or need to carry small amounts of liquids on a regular basis.ce travel bottles before.

            <li> These bottles are a lifesaver. They were waterproof and didn&#x27;t leak at all during my travels through Europe.</li>
            <li> These bottles are soooo much better than my old travel set!!! Not only are they easier to squeeze the last bit of its contents out because of the squishy silicone, but they also have suction cups on the back to keep them on the shower wall when traveling...genius!!! I never knew what to do with mine while on vacation, besides set them on the shower floor...but with the suction cups, it keeps them off the floor &amp; much more accessible when I&#x27;m showering. Once attached to the wall, you can just push on the bottle, &amp; a once 2 handed job becomes a 1 handed one...way more convenient!! These also have a spin-able plastic ring close to the top of the bottle that have different abbreviations on them, so you will never mix up bottles...if you&#x27;re like me, you always forget what color bottle you put what in...but not anymore. 😄 These are TSA approved, &amp; come in a clear plastic resealable travel bag. These travel bottles, though small, serve a huge purpose in my travel process. I thought my cheaper set was just fine, until I used these...immediately I knew they were worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Just received mine and it looks great.  The mouth was very wide and easly to fill.  I filled it half way with shampoo and tried shaking and stepping on it and not a drop leaked. I will see how it does in my suitcase on my next trip.  A little pricey but worth it, if it lasts.</li>
            <li> This set of 4 travel bottles allows you to bring your 3oz of TSA approved liquid without having to spend so much money on travel sizes of your favorite cosmetics.  Just buy the large size and fill these little silicone travel bottles.  Each bottle has a flip lid with a squeeze valve (holds in the liquid until you squeeze the bottles).  The lid unscrews and the bottle has a wide mouth to make filling it and cleaning it easy.  The bottles have tiny labels pre-printed on them (like lotion, conditioner), but you can obviously put whatever you want inside of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one caution - these are wonderful bottles but not totally leak proof.  If you overfill them, they might leak during pressure changes on the plane.  I was able to squeeze it hard enough to spray out some shampoo.  So keep them in a bag as well just so you don&#x27;t get shampoo all over your clothes.  With that caveat, these are excellent travel bottles and recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a free sample for the purposes of writing this review.</li>
            <li> These bottles worked great, no leaks!</li>

            <li> Perfect....just what I was looking for. These are much easier to squeeze out shampoo and lotion....they travel great in their zip bag</li>
