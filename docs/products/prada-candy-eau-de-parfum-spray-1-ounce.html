            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>And we&#x27;ve been living happily ever after ever since.</li>
            <li>Oh my goodness, how I love this scent!!</li>
            <li>Love It , Perfect Size , Came On Time , Good Price</li>
            <li>wife loved it --a bit pricey--but nice---if you want reviews don&#x27;t make people write more than they wish---two more words required!!!</li>
            <li>Good Gift For Any Woman...</li>
            <li>The perfume is smelling great, arrived in a nice package, on time.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this and loved it-I&#x27;ve always liked the smell of benzoin.</li>
            <li>Just really amazing.</li>
            <li>and I gotta admit it smells pretty darn good on her!</li>
            <li>So much better than Candy L&#x27;Heu.</li>
            <li>The price was great and the perfume is real.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume.</li>
            <li>sure looks like you&#x27;d push it, but it doesn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li>I Got a trial size from sephora...fell deeply in love with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing DKNY Be Delicious for several years now, which I really love</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think I could love anything more.</li>
            <li>I love this smell ever since my aunt gave me a sample of it</li>
            <li>and i fell in love</li>
            <li>Other than that, best perfume.</li>
            <li>But honestly when I smelled it at Sephora store and applied it stayed on my skin the whole day and through the night!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet, but in a sexy way.</li>
            <li>I am totally happy with the entire package.</li>
            <li>(in fact, I enjoy it).</li>
            <li>First time ordering by Amazon and all went smoothly!  </li>
            <li>In my experience, that&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>Overall if you have more in the future I will surely order more from you !</li>
            <li>Light yet lasting, with a lovely, non-sweet finish.</li>
            <li>No hole the spray nozzle is evident.</li>
            <li>I first discovered it in a magazine insert, and knew I had to have it.</li>
            <li>However, from the second I smelled Candy, I knew it was my new favorite.</li>
            <li>so you need to reapply (so you can do the whole day but still nothing</li>
            <li>The large black thing on top  </li>
            <li>FYI, if you buy the 1 ounce, the lid just pops off like a normal perfume bottle.</li>
            <li>The scent is sultry and sexy but not at all heavy.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Candy&amp;#34; smells lovely - a sort of powdery floral mixed with caramel and probably vanilla - but it didn&#x27;t last very long at all.</li>
            <li>As Far As Anywhere Else Selling This</li>
            <li>later I can&#x27;t really smell the fragrance where it was sprayed.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t ever expect a scent to last all day, anyway, so that&#x27;s really a non-issue.</li>

            <li> Love It , Perfect Size , Came On Time , Good Price As Far As Anywhere Else Selling This It Was Cheaper Here... Great Buy...Good Gift For Any Woman...</li>
            <li> Light yet lasting, with a lovely, non-sweet finish. So much better than Candy L&#x27;Heu. I wear this every day — it&#x27;s perfect.</li>

            <li> It came a little sooner than expected and was exactly as is showed in the picture. Great gift for your girlfriend! I recommend this if you can wait for the shipping...</li>
            <li> Its just not a potent as I was expecting.  I read other reviews before I purchase and I dont see where the scent is so great.  I wont buy again I will try a different scent.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the fragrace doesn&#x27;t last longer. It smells great in the bottle, and smells great when it&#x27;s applied, but 15 mins. later I can&#x27;t really smell the fragrance where it was sprayed.</li>
            <li> Smells great and product delivery was excellent.  First time ordering by Amazon and all went smoothly!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful! A great bday surprise from the hubby. He actually smelled it in a magazine then bought it for me!</li>
            <li> very happy smells amazing</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. It&#x27;s great. FYI, if you buy the 1 ounce, the lid just pops off like a normal perfume bottle. I&#x27;m not sure why I got so confused, but I had to youtube how to do it (and someone had already made a video, so I wasn&#x27;t alone). Other than that, best perfume.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this and loved it-I&#x27;ve always liked the smell of benzoin. Fond of licorice, too. So I ordered the 1 oz. size at a price $7 lower than Sephora.&lt;br /&gt;It got here yesterday, and I can&#x27;t figure out how to spray it. The large black thing on top  sure looks like you&#x27;d push it, but it doesn&#x27;t budge. No hole the spray nozzle is evident. I gave the fragrance itself 4 stars (I really never give 5) and with a little luck someone will post something on how to deal with the bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance after smelling a sample in a beauty magazine.  &amp;#34;Candy&amp;#34; smells lovely - a sort of powdery floral mixed with caramel and probably vanilla - but it didn&#x27;t last very long at all. I had to touch it up almost hourly.  I thought perhaps it was just my skin, but friends said they had the same issue. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I Got a trial size from sephora...fell deeply in love with it. And we&#x27;ve been living happily ever after ever since.</li>
            <li> wife loved it --a bit pricey--but nice---if you want reviews don&#x27;t make people write more than they wish---two more words required!!!</li>
            <li> The perfume is smelling great, arrived in a nice package, on time. But honestly when I smelled it at Sephora store and applied it stayed on my skin the whole day and through the night! This one I apply in the morning in a couple of hours it disappears so you need to reapply (so you can do the whole day but still nothing you or people around will smell).</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, how I love this scent!! I first discovered it in a magazine insert, and knew I had to have it. I&#x27;ve been wearing DKNY Be Delicious for several years now, which I really love and I didn&#x27;t think I could love anything more. However, from the second I smelled Candy, I knew it was my new favorite. I conned my husband into buying it for me for Christmas (by \\&quot;conned\\&quot; I mean I bought it and handed it to him to wrap!). In the meantime, I bought 5 sample vials on Ebay so that I could wear it until I got my big bottle at Christmas. The scent is sultry and sexy but not at all heavy. It&#x27;s sweet, but in a sexy way. Just really amazing. One of the common complaints about this perfume is that it doesn&#x27;t last. In my experience, that&#x27;s true. I respray midday, which doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least (in fact, I enjoy it). I wouldn&#x27;t ever expect a scent to last all day, anyway, so that&#x27;s really a non-issue. I rate this perfume 10 out of 10, and I hope to continue wearing it for years.</li>
            <li> I love this smell ever since my aunt gave me a sample of it and i fell in love</li>
            <li> Bought this at her request! She LOVES it and I gotta admit it smells pretty darn good on her! Will buy again!!</li>
