            <li>too good to be true</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Looking for more results as I keep using it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff have been using it for over 3 years.</li>
            <li>Let me just say that I LOVE this night cream.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>Love this night cream.  </li>
            <li>Top quality product.</li>

            <li>Love this night cream.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and buy it repeatedly.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this product for a couple of years and am quite pleased with the results that I&#x27;ve had with it.</li>
            <li>Better than most wrinkle creams.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The night cream is more like a drying mask than a cream.</li>
            <li>it is wonderful----who cares if the smell is not the best as long as it works----and</li>
            <li>This is great night cream whether you have dry/oily combination or sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not as strong for my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this from an ambassador who is a huge believer in this product and it&#x27;s ability to generate results.</li>
            <li>After one week I could see a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>The product is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 35 and have always taken great care of my skin, so I didn&#x27;t expect to see big results.</li>
            <li>Theres a reason why these are cheap, people are producing knock offs</li>
            <li>Good results so far.</li>
            <li>so quick and easy to use...</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>As a 70 yr old seeing a difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>Thanks love the night cream.</li>
            <li>I can read a bottle and get a sense for how much product to expect buy this was just the cherry on top in terms of deception.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more excited about my results so far!</li>
            <li>It was a sealed box as stated and delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m glad to have my new bottle of Nerium night cream again.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>30 seconds right  </li>
            <li>The service was prompt and the product was new, sealed in the original box.  </li>
            <li>Exactly  what I wanted</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference fast!</li>
            <li>It was not as good as past Neriums I have purchased/</li>
            <li>Worth the price and came in brand new packaging.</li>
            <li>A little early to notice any results, but seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the way real aloe Vera smells.</li>
            <li>problem is, at $120 a bottle, I can&#x27;t really afford it.</li>
            <li>You can really feel the difference in your skin.</li>
            <li>Over priced network marketing company representatives selling their free supplies to get back their investment because it does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li>By the real product</li>
            <li>I really notice a difference in my skin .</li>
            <li>It feels a bit tingly on my skin and leaves it a bit red, but again that fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nearing 50, and I had laugh lines around my eyes and the giant creases between my eyes from not wearing sunglasses for years.</li>
            <li>The fine lines on my forehead and neck are the same as when I started, my face&#x27;s complexion is the same, as are my pores.</li>
            <li>You live and you learn, I guess.</li>
            <li>and it came in the new packaging.</li>
            <li>By the end of the first month my face was clear and my complexion was even instead of red and blotchy.  </li>
            <li>I get horrible torso itching if I use more than 1 pump per day, but I&#x27;ve had great results by getting my face moist and distributing the 1 pump all over my face.</li>
            <li>So far it has been goof.  </li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and nothing has cleared it up including Proactive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll check in if anything changes once the product is finished, but as of now it&#x27;s not worth the sale price, yet a lone the full price.  </li>
            <li>It looked new &amp; it felt full, but the little hole plug was</li>
            <li>My skin seemed to revert back to the way it was before I first tried the product...is there a different formula for internet products?  </li>
            <li>I feel it tightly my skin right away.</li>
            <li>My son uses it for his complexion and is amazed at the results and clear teen age skin!</li>
            <li>The cream itself is sticky and has a strong, unpleasant smell, but both of that fades quickly.</li>
            <li>Not sure that&#x27;s its worth the price.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think there was even half of a container of this product.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why Nerium gives you a 30 day money back guarantee,  so if you&#x27;re not happy you can get a full refund!  </li>
            <li>Please beware if you have skin that is sensitive and dry that you may have a similar experience to mine.</li>

            <li> Please beware if you have skin that is sensitive and dry that you may have a similar experience to mine.</li>
            <li> The results were amazing but the product is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully for a few days short of a month, and so far I&#x27;m wondering what the big deal is.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting grand results, but the nothing I got instead is a giant disappointment.</li>
            <li> My skin also feels extra dry today although I used my normal moisturizer that usually takes care of my dryness.</li>
            <li> The product is stinky, sticky and didn&#x27;t do a single thing.</li>
            <li> DO YOUR RESEARCH, smells bad and for the money you could buy several other products that work better.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly dropped it once and the container broke revealing a smaller container within it that was half the size.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a month and it was such a bust - not to mention a waste of $100.  </li>
            <li> only been a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past but purchased it from a local sales rep.  </li>
            <li> It works to lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li> It did make my skin look younger, like that of a 15 year old awkward pimply skinned teenager.</li>
            <li> it makes your face feel sticky and hard when it dry&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The Nerium lady in town was so sure the cream would be bad if I bought it on the internet, but it isn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> so I dilute with a little water</li>
            <li> It felt too heavy on my skin and it seemed to make my skin breakout.</li>
            <li> All of my blemishes were dried up and healing.  </li>
            <li> and I have used Nerium for a few years now and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Then I found it on amazon for half the price!</li>
            <li> after doing research on oleander leaf, their main ingredient, I feel like an idiot for ever falling for such bull.</li>
            <li> Absolute junk that smells as bad as it works.</li>
            <li> is old and past its expiration date, or because I just happened to get a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> The pump did not seem to work correctly and when it did hard pieces of product</li>
            <li> I thought I would try to buy it on the internet at a less expensive cost.  </li>
            <li> I was without it for about 5 days and started seeing a difference (not good)</li>
            <li> My wrinkles around my eyes and mouth have decreased 50% since I started using it</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the last Nerium AD night cream that I received.  </li>
            <li> Expensive.</li>
            <li> use sparingly as it is expensive.</li>
            <li> it does if you try it for at least 3 months you will be amazed!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing...</li>
            <li> and I HATE the way it makes my skin feel...</li>
            <li> Hate the smell and the feel of this product!!!!</li>
            <li> And yes it does smell terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> It really makes a difference fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 and use this nightly on face, neck &amp; hands. Don&#x27;t expect overnight miracles but if you use religiously you will see results. People are amazed when I tell them my age. I also have always taken care of my skin. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I know some people don&#x27;t like the smell but I do like it. It reminds me of the way real aloe Vera smells. I try to take care of my skin; it&#x27;s the only one I have. It&#x27;s not miraculous; it does take time to see the results and definitely want to apply it to damp skin. I have rosacea so I dilute with a little water so it&#x27;s not as strong for my skin. Very important to know that if you want the best looking skin you can have it has to also come from the inside. Do your research about foods to eat and foods to avoid for better looking skin as no product, no matter how great, can accomplish this alone.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> The box had the label saying it was night cream, but it was day cream box and product.</li>
            <li> The product is great - I love it!!!  The service was prompt and the product was new, sealed in the original box.  I will use this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Hate the smell and the feel of this product!!!! I may finish this bottle only used it 4 times and I HATE the way it makes my skin feel... I will NEVER buy this product again!!!!</li>
            <li> A little early to notice any results, but seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Great results. I Love it!</li>
            <li> Not sure that&#x27;s its worth the price.</li>
            <li> Can see the difference .</li>
            <li> Amazing night cream! I thought they are all alike ! Not this this one smoother skin and wrinkles diminishing !</li>
            <li> Expensive. Have seen no results</li>
            <li> I had used Nerium before and quit because it was quite costly.  But I did notice that wrinkles soon started to appear, so I bought just the night cream.  So far it has been goof.  Looking for more results as I keep using it.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived as promised, and I loved the item I purchased!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot and would order it again.</li>
            <li> Worth the price and came in brand new packaging.</li>
            <li> It felt too heavy on my skin and it seemed to make my skin breakout. My skin was very smooth between the patches of zits but I would rather not have the break outs. It did make my skin look younger, like that of a 15 year old awkward pimply skinned teenager.</li>
            <li> The best Night Cream I have every used.  You feel a blemish coming on, use cream before bedtime, no blemish in the morning.  Quite remarkable.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff have been using it for over 3 years.</li>
            <li> Thanks love the night cream.</li>
            <li> It looked new &amp; it felt full, but the little hole plug was missing.&lt;br /&gt;The product was untampered with though.</li>
            <li> it is wonderful----who cares if the smell is not the best as long as it works----and it does if you try it for at least 3 months you will be amazed!!!</li>
            <li> The Nerium lady in town was so sure the cream would be bad if I bought it on the internet, but it isn&#x27;t! It&#x27;s the same thing you buy from a dealer, but cheaper. Let me just say that I LOVE this night cream. I get horrible torso itching if I use more than 1 pump per day, but I&#x27;ve had great results by getting my face moist and distributing the 1 pump all over my face. I&#x27;m nearing 50, and I had laugh lines around my eyes and the giant creases between my eyes from not wearing sunglasses for years.</li>
            <li> Amazed at what this product has done for the texture of my skin as well as all the wrinkles that have gone away!  Love it...so quick and easy to use...30 seconds right  before bed and I am done!  My son uses it for his complexion and is amazed at the results and clear teen age skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully for a few days short of a month, and so far I&#x27;m wondering what the big deal is. The fine lines on my forehead and neck are the same as when I started, my face&#x27;s complexion is the same, as are my pores. There&#x27;s not a change I can detect, if any even happened. The cream itself is sticky and has a strong, unpleasant smell, but both of that fades quickly. It feels a bit tingly on my skin and leaves it a bit red, but again that fades quickly. I wouldn&#x27;t mind any of that if the product worked to some degree. I wasn&#x27;t expecting grand results, but the nothing I got instead is a giant disappointment. I&#x27;ll check in if anything changes once the product is finished, but as of now it&#x27;s not worth the sale price, yet a lone the full price.  Edit: after doing research on oleander leaf, their main ingredient, I feel like an idiot for ever falling for such bull. I threw what was left of my bottle away. Oh well. You live and you learn, I guess.</li>
            <li> Love this night cream.  I&#x27;ve seen definite results from using this night cream.</li>
            <li> When I remember to use I can tell it firms. Have to get into the habit.</li>
            <li> Top quality product. Good results so far. Need more than 2 months, but expect to keep using.</li>
            <li> I bought this from an ambassador who is a huge believer in this product and it&#x27;s ability to generate results. I tried it for a month and it was such a bust - not to mention a waste of $100.  The product is stinky, sticky and didn&#x27;t do a single thing. I mistakenly dropped it once and the container broke revealing a smaller container within it that was half the size. I can read a bottle and get a sense for how much product to expect buy this was just the cherry on top in terms of deception. Spend you money on something else. Please.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past but purchased it from a local sales rep.  The results were amazing but the product is very expensive.  I thought I would try to buy it on the internet at a less expensive cost.  Something just wasn&#x27;t the same.  My skin seemed to revert back to the way it was before I first tried the product...is there a different formula for internet products?  Very disappointing...do I dare try a different web site?</li>
            <li> Really good stuff both day &amp; night.  Been using it for a while.</li>
            <li> The product is fabulous. You can feel your skin tightening instantly. And it has changed the texture of my face. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWE-SOME‼️&lt;br /&gt;A friend who sells it gave me a bottle &amp; told me to try it for 5 days. I just loved how it made my skin &amp; lips feel, and it started to erase the shadows that have begun to develop under my eyes. That&#x27;s not what sold me on it though. I&#x27;m 35 and have always taken great care of my skin, so I didn&#x27;t expect to see big results. The big deal was when my mom used it and saw her before and after pics side by side. WOW. So I decided I was going to start using it now as a preventive measure against signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is, at $120 a bottle, I can&#x27;t really afford it. Then I found it on amazon for half the price! What a great deal!!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this stuff- it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this night cream.  You can really feel the difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product and buy it repeatedly.  This seller was great, got the product to me on time, and was packaged well.  No complaints!</li>
            <li> This is great night cream whether you have dry/oily combination or sensitive skin.  It is by far the best ever and I plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  If you want to stay looking younger til your way on up in age....then try this product!</li>
            <li> It was not as good as past Neriums I have purchased/</li>
            <li> Nerium AD is a great product  My wrinkles around my eyes and mouth have decreased 50% since I started using it</li>
            <li> The Nerium AD Night Cream was amazing!  I have adult acne and nothing has cleared it up including Proactive.  After one week I could see a huge improvement.  All of my blemishes were dried up and healing.  By the end of the first month my face was clear and my complexion was even instead of red and blotchy.  I am on my second bottle and I couldn&#x27;t be more excited about my results so far!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. It was a sealed box as stated and delivery was quick. Have been using this product for a couple of years and am quite pleased with the results that I&#x27;ve had with it.</li>
            <li> Exactly  what I wanted</li>
            <li> removes night wrinkles</li>
            <li> Like the product a lot.....but still waiting for the results....only been a few weeks</li>
            <li> Better than most wrinkle creams. I bought for the d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; area and it has diminished the wrinkles at the cleavage area and given a smoother look. Am now using on my face and I feel it&#x27;s helping that also. As a 70 yr old seeing a difference is amazing. I recommend you give it a try.</li>
            <li> Absolute junk that smells as bad as it works. Over priced network marketing company representatives selling their free supplies to get back their investment because it does not work as advertised. Product does not work period DO YOUR RESEARCH, smells bad and for the money you could buy several other products that work better.</li>
            <li> It works to lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li> Great price and it came in the new packaging.</li>
            <li> Buy from a Brand Partners web site or Nerium.com. Theres a reason why these are cheap, people are producing knock offs and this is why people are having issues with the product bought off of eBay and Amazon,  it&#x27;s not priduced by Nerium! That&#x27;s why Nerium gives you a 30 day money back guarantee,  so if you&#x27;re not happy you can get a full refund!  You get what you pay for. If it&lt;br /&gt;sounds too good to be true, it is too good to be true! By the real product and you&#x27;ll be in love with Nerium!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it.... it makes your face feel sticky and hard when it dry&#x27;s. I don&#x27;t like the feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> The pump on the bottle wouldn&#x27;t work so I didn&#x27;t get to try it.  I don&#x27;t know if that is because the product being sold on this site is old and past its expiration date, or because I just happened to get a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 and I have used Nerium for a few years now and wouldn&#x27;t be without it. I was without it for about 5 days and started seeing a difference (not good), I&#x27;m glad to have my new bottle of Nerium night cream again.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the last Nerium AD night cream that I received.  The pump did not seem to work correctly and when it did hard pieces of product came out of it.  I really don&#x27;t think there was even half of a container of this product.</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations</li>
            <li> use sparingly as it is expensive. I feel it tightly my skin right away. I took a selfie before and after a month and I see my skin looks tighter.</li>
            <li> Love it. I really notice a difference in my skin .</li>
            <li> The night cream is more like a drying mask than a cream. It burned and irritated my skin. I tried to leave it on all night but had to get up during the night and rinse it off. When I did it left my skin red and irritated. (I applied it to damp skin as directed.) I do have sensitive, dry skin. Please beware if you have skin that is sensitive and dry that you may have a similar experience to mine. And yes it does smell terrible. My skin also feels extra dry today although I used my normal moisturizer that usually takes care of my dryness. Ugh! Be warned!</li>
            <li> great stuff, came quickly! thank you</li>
