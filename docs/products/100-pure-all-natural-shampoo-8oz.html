            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Honey is great for the scalp and hair, so this is an excellent buy.</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>It smells great while shampooing, but I cannot say it leaves my hair smelling like coconut...</li>
            <li>It smells very nice (like coconut), as well.</li>
            <li>since i often select on the basis of a great-smelling shampoo (NOT the best indicator of a good product) i would wish for more</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo and it smells lovely!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing but good for your hair.</li>
            <li>I have good results w softness and ease of styling.</li>
            <li>It lathers good too.</li>
            <li>This smells great, makes your hair feel nice and arrived on time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have found chemical free products that work!</li>
            <li>I love this amazing product!</li>
            <li>more for the money!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this shampoo (and conditioner too)!</li>
            <li>so I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>My wavy hair likes it and it smells lovely!</li>
            <li>Love the coconut smell!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Try it, you will love it!</li>
            <li>which is kind of a pain considering the design of the shampoo bottle</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m thrilled to have found these.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and works well for my hair-</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t actually liked a lot of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Since using this product, the itchy rashes have gone away, and my hair dresser was impressed by how baby soft my hair had become (again, conditioner too).</li>
            <li>it has no harsh chemicals, animal ingredients and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>You see, there are some ingredients here that are controversial, and I think buyers should know.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this shampoo and how it leaves my hair... smelling super good and feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>I love that everything comes from plant sources and that this doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates -- so it&#x27;s suitable for color-treated</li>
            <li>Hopefully this shampoo will be the answer to my itchy reactions to most shampoos.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo-</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a vey &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; consistency, but it is ok for me.</li>
            <li>everybody is so scared of at all, and they have been used in cosmetic industry for more than 50 years (just in case...</li>
            <li>It runs out of the bottle as soon as you pop the cap so you have to make sure it is tilted upward.  </li>
            <li>but it does have a nice, clean smell which is more than acceptable.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice clean shampoo, no chemicals and harmful stuff, my kids love it</li>
            <li>This is the very best sulfate free shampoo on the market because it actually lathers.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair clean, shiny and never greasy!</li>
            <li>It smells great and it leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>i review about one out of every 25 purchases on amazon - only those that are incredible.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t easily allow for that.</li>
            <li>and I strongly believe they are MSG deritatives .</li>
            <li>I dilute it in some warm water first.  </li>
            <li>(I have fine hair but a lot of it.)</li>
            <li>This is by far the best all natural shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and my hair is silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a rare find: an SLS-free, all-natural shampoo that leaves my hair squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>This combined with the conditioner leaves my hair feeling clean</li>
            <li>Really great for my curly dry hair!</li>
            <li>100% Pure has phenomenal ingredients.</li>
            <li>The most controversial ingredient here is &amp;#34; Lonicera Caprifolium&amp;#34; (Japanese Honeysuckle), which acts like a preservative.</li>
            <li>I found the consistency to be a bit runny, with a pungently sweet smell like the vanilla flavoring you use for baking.</li>
            <li>The shampoo foams up nicely, which you don&#x27;t find with a lot of natural shampoos.</li>
            <li>True to everything it claims to do..</li>
            <li>second time I purchase this product...absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>but it is worth</li>
            <li>I finally found a good shampoo but the cost to me is way too high for this.</li>
            <li>But I like this shampoo a lot, so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t completely write off the whole brand!</li>
            <li>It is a little thinner consistency which is fine, because it is a more natural and organic product and if it&#x27;s thinner that&#x27;s better to me, because it means they are not using toxic thickening agents.</li>
            <li>Pretty bummed to say this</li>
            <li>Thought it was just my hair at first</li>
            <li>but I am starting to really love it.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product, but I have to agree.  </li>
            <li>They are also very easy on you hair, not stripping it dry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably my favorite 100% pure product to date (I&#x27;ve also tried a facial cleanser, a mascara, and a nail polish).</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells amazing and instantly converted my hubby to natural products.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how clean and soft this shampoo was on my hair.</li>
            <li>It does clean the hair and leave it soft, no build up.  </li>
            <li>I have three different &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; from this brand of shampoo and they all smell good enough to eat.  </li>
            <li>It smells divine and leaves my hair soft and full, but my scalp hurts and itches.</li>
            <li>100% pure products are hit or miss for me.</li>
            <li>I really like how my hair behaves after using this.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable</li>
            <li>I have naturally unruly wavy/frizzy hair and using this tends to help calm it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Fast delivery...will not order anything else..</li>
            <li>Seems gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li>I must be sensitive to SOMETHING in this otherwise very pure looking shampoo.</li>
            <li>good - it smells fantastic and there are far less questionable ingredients in it than most.</li>
            <li>Luckily I have short shoulder length hair</li>
            <li>I feel like my hair was quite clean after using this, but this shampoo doesn&#x27;t completely strip all the natural oils out of your hair (perhaps because it contains some natural oils and moisturizers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>oh so very soft!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I look for REALLY pure products because I am really sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li>As for quantity, well, in my opinion, (for the price) you should get a little more product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very well priced, all natural product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a little bit thin in texture, but it lathers wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I had pretty high hopes when purchasing this shampoo, especially after reading all the glowing reviews.</li>
            <li>It smells good but this stupid shampoo is butchering my lovely hair.</li>
            <li>Has a nice subtle scent.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>: Wanted to return to add that I&#x27;ve recently been using this product consistently</li>
            <li>As such, I&#x27;d suggest this if you wash your hair every other day and use a strong conditioner for your hair tips; otherwise I think it could lead to flyaways and dryness over time.</li>
            <li>It does seem to make my hair soft, too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo, cleansing and delicate on the scalp.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t apply them near your breast nor armpits).&lt;br</li>
            <li>The quality of this is kinda spa like to me, but geez going natural shouldn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li>I have fine long hair and other all naturals</li>
            <li>It took only a month to go through this stuff, so save a few bucks where you can because it&#x27;s sooooo worth it.</li>
            <li>about half is grown out now and ALL my hair now feels as soft as the new growth with this shampoo/conditioner combo.  </li>

            <li> The quality of this is kinda spa like to me, but geez going natural shouldn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> I have fine long hair and other all naturals</li>
            <li> It took only a month to go through this stuff, so save a few bucks where you can because it&#x27;s sooooo worth it.</li>
            <li> about half is grown out now and ALL my hair now feels as soft as the new growth with this shampoo/conditioner combo.  </li>
            <li> Only left one star off for the minor annoyance of product defect.</li>
            <li> I have only used the product twice thus far, but my scalp has not broken out in little red bumps like it usually does.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> So it wont last long.</li>
            <li> No harmful ingredients to worry about, and it lasts long as well.</li>
            <li> So you don&#x27;t need a lot to wash even long hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s due to this shampoo, the supplements I recently added, or what in particular</li>
            <li> My scalp use to be itchy and dry but after a week of use with this shampoo that is all gone.</li>
            <li> Both shampoo and conditioner are a little on the thick side, but really it is like having a concentrate....</li>
            <li> Over the past year, I&#x27;ve actively been reducing the number of chemicals in our household and have saved body care for last as I struggle to find things that work as well as mainstream ones.</li>
            <li> bad - While soft, it almost gives my hair too much volume or something?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly scared it will tip and spill, and this stuff is far too expensive to waste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t heavy on my hair, it wasn&#x27;t brittle dry after I</li>
            <li> I have very thick and long hair that I dye regularly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wow! I love this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Works great and I know what all the ingredients are!</li>
            <li> I had pretty high hopes when purchasing this shampoo, especially after reading all the glowing reviews. Over the past year, I&#x27;ve actively been reducing the number of chemicals in our household and have saved body care for last as I struggle to find things that work as well as mainstream ones. Pretty bummed to say this but I&#x27;m adding this to the list of products I&#x27;ve not been a fan of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good - it smells fantastic and there are far less questionable ingredients in it than most. It does seem to make my hair soft, too.&lt;br /&gt;The bad - While soft, it almost gives my hair too much volume or something? (I have fine hair but a lot of it.) Anytime I use it, I end up with all sorts of cowlicks and hair sticking up in odd ways no matter if it&#x27;s styled or air dried. Thought it was just my hair at first but this only happens when using this shampoo. Finally, the bottle that was sent ended up having some weird manufacturing defect where the top wont stay shut. It now has to sit upside down which is kind of a pain considering the design of the shampoo bottle doesn&#x27;t easily allow for that. I&#x27;m constantly scared it will tip and spill, and this stuff is far too expensive to waste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED: Wanted to return to add that I&#x27;ve recently been using this product consistently and my hair has never felt healthier. Maybe it just took some time for my hair to get used to? Not sure if it&#x27;s due to this shampoo, the supplements I recently added, or what in particular but I am starting to really love it. Only left one star off for the minor annoyance of product defect. Fingers crossed that won&#x27;t happen next time.</li>
            <li> So far Horrible!!! It leaves my hair dry and worst of all....it makes my hair fall out like crazy!!!! I was leaving hair everywhere at work today. It smells good but this stupid shampoo is butchering my lovely hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this and loves the smell and it helps get through her tangles and frizz.</li>
            <li> I have only used the product twice thus far, but my scalp has not broken out in little red bumps like it usually does.  Hopefully this shampoo will be the answer to my itchy reactions to most shampoos.</li>
            <li> I must be sensitive to SOMETHING in this otherwise very pure looking shampoo. It smells divine and leaves my hair soft and full, but my scalp hurts and itches.</li>
            <li> This is a very well priced, all natural product.  I really like how my hair behaves after using this.  Both shampoo and conditioner are a little on the thick side, but really it is like having a concentrate.... more for the money!  Just add water and lather.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this shampoo (and conditioner too)! This is the very best sulfate free shampoo on the market because it actually lathers. I have very thick and long hair that I dye regularly. I&#x27;m also allergic to synthetic fragrances. Since using this product, the itchy rashes have gone away, and my hair dresser was impressed by how baby soft my hair had become (again, conditioner too). It took only a month to go through this stuff, so save a few bucks where you can because it&#x27;s sooooo worth it.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt there are (as another review says) questionable agents in this shampoo and I strongly believe they are MSG deritatives . I look for REALLY pure products because I am really sensitive to chemicals. Too bad.</li>
            <li> I have three different &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; from this brand of shampoo and they all smell good enough to eat.  They are also very easy on you hair, not stripping it dry.  And a little bit of this shampoo goes along way.  I dilute it in some warm water first.  It looks like a small tube for the money but it is worth it being so concentrated.</li>
            <li> This product is not natural it has other ingredients in it disguised but its just as bad as&lt;br /&gt;Synthetic products.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo-it has no harsh chemicals, animal ingredients and it smells wonderful. It&#x27;s nothing but good for your hair.The price is reasonable so I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! It smells great and it leaves my hair soft and shiny. My scalp use to be itchy and dry but after a week of use with this shampoo that is all gone. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> i review about one out of every 25 purchases on amazon - only those that are incredible.  i find this conditioner &amp; its matching shampoo to fall into that category.  i try EVERY shampoo looking for &amp;#34;it&amp;#34;.  i quit coloring my hair a year ago when it was like STRAW.  about half is grown out now and ALL my hair now feels as soft as the new growth with this shampoo/conditioner combo.  very little scent - since i often select on the basis of a great-smelling shampoo (NOT the best indicator of a good product) i would wish for more but it does have a nice, clean smell which is more than acceptable.  i&#x27;m thrilled to have found these.  check two things off the list!</li>
            <li> 100% Pure has phenomenal ingredients. Compare them to the crap that passes for &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; cosmetics in the supermarket!  This shampoo smells amazing and instantly converted my hubby to natural products. :)</li>
            <li> Made my head itch---but it&#x27;s probably an allergy to something specific and wouldn&#x27;t bother everyone.</li>
            <li> I have used all of 100% pures shampoos and conditioners and I find this one to be the best smelling and leaves my hair feeling the healthiest. The smell of honey and coconut lingers throughout my hair for the next day or so and my hair is silky and smooth. I have naturally unruly wavy/frizzy hair and using this tends to help calm it. I do use actual honey as a pre conditioner with avocado and coconut oil that I mix up myself before hand, it seems to go well with this shampoo and conditioner. Honey is great for the scalp and hair, so this is an excellent buy. No harmful ingredients to worry about, and it lasts long as well.</li>
            <li> This is a rare find: an SLS-free, all-natural shampoo that leaves my hair squeaky clean! As such, I&#x27;d suggest this if you wash your hair every other day and use a strong conditioner for your hair tips; otherwise I think it could lead to flyaways and dryness over time. I found the consistency to be a bit runny, with a pungently sweet smell like the vanilla flavoring you use for baking.</li>
            <li> I really like it! Smells nice and works well for my hair-I have good results w softness and ease of styling. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Definitely will buy again! I&#x27;m happy to have found chemical free products that work!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, cleansing and delicate on the scalp. My wavy hair likes it and it smells lovely!</li>
            <li> Really great for my curly dry hair!</li>
            <li> Love the coconut smell!  Cleans hair well without striping moisture.  It is a little thinner consistency which is fine, because it is a more natural and organic product and if it&#x27;s thinner that&#x27;s better to me, because it means they are not using toxic thickening agents. Love it!  Thanks</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner!!!! Leaves my hair so soft and silky. The shampoo foams up nicely, which you don&#x27;t find with a lot of natural shampoos. I keep reordering these!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best all natural shampoo I have ever used. I have fine long hair and other all naturals seem to grease it up and weigh it down. This product leaves my hair clean, shiny and never greasy! And it smells great too! I don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner with it! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo and it smells lovely! (I use it along with the conditioner)&lt;br /&gt;It has a vey &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; consistency, but it is ok for me. As for quantity, well, in my opinion, (for the price) you should get a little more product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product claims to be &amp;#34;free of synthetic chemicals, artificial fragrances, chemical preservatives, sulfates, detergents or any other harsh ingredients&amp;#34; and it is the truth.&lt;br /&gt; You see, there are some ingredients here that are controversial, and I think buyers should know. The most controversial ingredient here is &amp;#34; Lonicera Caprifolium&amp;#34; (Japanese Honeysuckle), which acts like a preservative. Its chemical structure is very similar to that of a paraben, and some people even consider it a paraben (though it cannot be, since ALL parabens are synthetic and this one comes from a plant). Basically, it can be considered a &amp;#34;natural paraben&amp;#34; (though this term doesn&#x27;t exist I guess).  Besides, it is almost at the end of the list of ingredients, meaning that the shampoo contains almost nothing of this ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not panic....  there are no scientific proves of parabens being those evil chemical preservatives everybody is so scared of at all, and they have been used in cosmetic industry for more than 50 years (just in case... don&#x27;t apply them near your breast nor armpits).&lt;br /&gt;It is not as bad as you may think (trust me... there are some pretty nasty shampoos out there, that in comparison to this one... this one is heaven),Just be informed before you buy a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that....&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this shampoo and how it leaves my hair... smelling super good and feeling so soft. (4 stars for the price/quantity)&lt;br /&gt; Oh, and I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how clean and soft this shampoo was on my hair. It wasn&#x27;t heavy on my hair, it wasn&#x27;t brittle dry after I shampoo&#x27;d like store bought does. It smells wonderful. I got the Honey $ coconut and it is awesome. This is a stronger smell on my hair than the body wash was on my skin. I finally found a good shampoo but the cost to me is way too high for this. The quality of this is kinda spa like to me, but geez going natural shouldn&#x27;t cost a fortune. Luckily I have short shoulder length hair and I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot. It lathers good too. I just don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this other than what I paid for it. Hopefully this will last a long time. Try it, you will love it! My hair feels like it&#x27;s thanking me for it. There is zilch residue too. Meaning, less build up so less dandruff woo hoo!</li>
            <li> This combined with the conditioner leaves my hair feeling clean and oh so very soft! Has a nice subtle scent.</li>
            <li> This is a nice clean shampoo, no chemicals and harmful stuff, my kids love it</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast delivery...will not order anything else..second time I purchase this product...absolutely love it! True to everything it claims to do..</li>
            <li> I read some comments that this shampoo used to be thicker and they were disappointed.  This is my first time using this product, but I have to agree.  It is too thin.  It runs out of the bottle as soon as you pop the cap so you have to make sure it is tilted upward.  You also have to use quite a bit of it, because it is so thin (I believe).  So it wont last long. It smells great while shampooing, but I cannot say it leaves my hair smelling like coconut...I am using the conditioner as well.  It does clean the hair and leave it soft, no build up.  Seems gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li> This smells great, makes your hair feel nice and arrived on time</li>
            <li> 100% pure products are hit or miss for me. I haven&#x27;t actually liked a lot of the ones I&#x27;ve tried. But I like this shampoo a lot, so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t completely write off the whole brand! (This review is for the honey and coconut scent.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a little bit thin in texture, but it lathers wonderfully. So you don&#x27;t need a lot to wash even long hair. It smells very nice (like coconut), as well. I feel like my hair was quite clean after using this, but this shampoo doesn&#x27;t completely strip all the natural oils out of your hair (perhaps because it contains some natural oils and moisturizers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see the ingredients list if you scroll down the product page. I love that everything comes from plant sources and that this doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates -- so it&#x27;s suitable for color-treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably my favorite 100% pure product to date (I&#x27;ve also tried a facial cleanser, a mascara, and a nail polish).</li>
