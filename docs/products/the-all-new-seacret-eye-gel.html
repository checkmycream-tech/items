            <li>so I could not in good faith use it</li>

            <li>I just love the eye gel.  </li>
            <li>And the prices online are much better than at the mall kiosks.</li>
            <li>I will be sure to keep this on hand &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I would like to see it in a squirt bottle since it would be more sanitary.</li>
            <li>, I had to return to the kiosk at the mall for more hand lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this eye gel.</li>
            <li>It sure beats the prices at the mall.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It makes my eyes feel better</li>
            <li>Love this!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I get many, many compliments about my lack of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It looked like a better version of Botox.</li>
            <li>This gel is very gentle and gives amazing results.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it does anything for the fine lines around the eyes or bags or dark circles, but it&#x27;s awesome at making my skin look clearer.  </li>
            <li>it is super hydrous!</li>
            <li>I use the mud mask once a week and am so excited about how it makes my face look.  </li>
            <li>Seacret Eye Gel works better than any of the large brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.  </li>
            <li>It tightens up the pores and makes my skin look smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li>but that wasn&#x27;t good enough for the sellers.</li>
            <li>It was so soothing and cool.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and the jar lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>This product came quickly.  </li>
            <li>So happy to find it for less.</li>
            <li>This product absorbed into my skin quickly and diminished the appearance of lines and under eye bags.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, temporarily removes fine lines under the eye instantly, you can actually watch the lines disappear!</li>
            <li>It serves the purpose of keeping my eyes feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily absorbed into the skin around the eyes and relaxes the wrinkles that have began to form.</li>
            <li>They said everyone else liked it so they wouldn&#x27;t take it back.</li>
            <li>and it arrived in a timely manner and is in a huge jar, but I have been highly unsatisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>However, sometimes the price is a bit restrictive but I found it on Amazon at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I really hope they work as well for you as they have for me!</li>
            <li>feels smoothly although I did not observe any changes to my dry fine lines yet ..</li>
            <li>I have purchased this gel at the mall for a MUCH higher price than found here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those people that was accosted at a mall kiosk and ended up buying some of this product line because the young woman selling it was a so sweet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55, very fair complected and allergic to everything (and I mean everything!!)  </li>
            <li>I still get carded at the checkout line if Im dressed casually :) gotta love that!</li>
            <li>I bought some body butter and the nail care kit (the nail gizmo really does work by the way).  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Ariel, the manager, sold me more hand lotion and other items including this eye gel which is MIRACULOUS.</li>
            <li>It made my eyes feel drier and look older.</li>
            <li>I love products from the Dead Sea.  </li>
            <li>A friend and I ordered The All NEW Seacret Eye Gel a couple of weeks apart.  </li>
            <li>My eyes are very sensitive to anything oily or having any fragrance.  </li>
            <li>And wow!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little strong.  </li>
            <li>I am now in my 60&#x27;s and have never had a single laugh line again.</li>
            <li>You just need to dot the tip of your little finger in the gel and smooth it around your eye area.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to smells at all, don&#x27;t try the Ocean Mist scented products.  </li>
            <li>I like the product itself, and have found not other product to give me the results I have been given with this.  </li>
            <li>It has gotten more expensive but it doesn&#x27;t take much and lasts several months.</li>
            <li>She ordered hers first and it was half the amount of what I had to pay (I paid $60)</li>
            <li>I am 59 :O and the eye gel makes the tiny lines under my eyes DISAPPEAR.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for correcting dark or sun spots.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend it for correcting dark or sun spots.</li>
            <li> Ever since living in overly sunny SoCal, I developed sun spots on the crest of my cheekbones and have used Clinique&#x27;s Dark Spot Corrector, Perricone Pigment Corrector, a Boots product, and something from an aesthetician that had lactic acid in it.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> ( The other seacret for face was too heavy for my skin &amp; felt greasy to me, sensitive to breakouts)</li>
            <li> I was so encouraged, I started trying other products (from Amazon, of course.</li>
            <li> I have used this for the last 4 years at least.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about two years now, and notice the lines around my eyes seem to be less.</li>
            <li> My eyes swell, I&#x27;m a mess.  </li>
            <li> The salt scrub has gotten rid of all those little bumps on my shoulders and legs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of face and eye creams from Elizabeth Arden, Clinique, Clarins, Perricone MD, Exuviance and Murad (just to name a few).  </li>
            <li> Then one day, I was in a mall and this guy came out of his kiosk to try to get me to come over to buy some skin care from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> I stopped dead in my tracks.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few yrs now &amp; get lots of compliments on my lack of wrinkles!  </li>
            <li> The mall price is ridiculous).  </li>
            <li> (Yes, I&#x27;m a sucker for a sad story.)  </li>
            <li> As usual Seacret has come out with a product that takes away those ugly wrinkles around your eyes.  </li>
            <li> BUY IT, YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> Very expensive!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My eyes are very sensitive to anything oily or having any fragrance.  This gel is very gentle and gives amazing results.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and won&#x27;t use anything else.  The crows feet and tiny lines are gone.  It has gotten more expensive but it doesn&#x27;t take much and lasts several months.</li>
            <li> I just love the eye gel.  I use it day and night.  When I use it I feel I am doing something for myself by looking after the lines around my eyes which the gel softens.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that was accosted at a mall kiosk and ended up buying some of this product line because the young woman selling it was a so sweet. (Yes, I&#x27;m a sucker for a sad story.)  I bought some body butter and the nail care kit (the nail gizmo really does work by the way).  It was way over priced and I didn&#x27;t expect to ever use it.  Boy, am I glad I did!!  I was always embarrassed by the crepe-y looking skin on my arms.  I decided to try the body butter.  My skin just soaks up and looks awesome! It&#x27;s not greasy either.  I was so encouraged, I started trying other products (from Amazon, of course. The mall price is ridiculous).  Over time, I&#x27;ve used the body butter, hand lotion, salt scrub, mud mask and the eye gel.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.  I&#x27;m 55, very fair complected and allergic to everything (and I mean everything!!)  Makeup, creams, lotions.. I can&#x27;t even wear mascara.  But I can use this!  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of face and eye creams from Elizabeth Arden, Clinique, Clarins, Perricone MD, Exuviance and Murad (just to name a few).  Can&#x27;t use them.  My eyes swell, I&#x27;m a mess.  That doesn&#x27;t happen with this stuff.  Extra added bonus...it works! The eye gel is great.  You just need to dot the tip of your little finger in the gel and smooth it around your eye area.  It absorbs quickly and the jar lasts forever.  I use the mud mask once a week and am so excited about how it makes my face look.  It tightens up the pores and makes my skin look smooth and fresh.  The salt scrub has gotten rid of all those little bumps on my shoulders and legs.  It is pricy, but compared to some of the products I&#x27;ve tried and had to toss in a drawer, it&#x27;s a bargain!  If you&#x27;re sensitive to smells at all, don&#x27;t try the Ocean Mist scented products.  They&#x27;re a little strong.  The Milk and Honey scent is very nice and if you can still find the Vanilla, it&#x27;s wonderful.  The Cucumber/Melon body cream is also nice. I plan on continuing to try the products one at a time.  I really hope they work as well for you as they have for me!</li>
            <li> This product is great and it helps my eyes look better.  I use it morning and night..  And the prices online are much better than at the mall kiosks.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, temporarily removes fine lines under the eye instantly, you can actually watch the lines disappear! I will be sure to keep this on hand &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. The product is great and you get a lot of use from it. I would like to see it in a squirt bottle since it would be more sanitary.</li>
            <li> I love products from the Dead Sea.  I tried the Eye Gel and cannot say enough about it.  My eyes feel wonderful and rejuvenated.  The number one reason why I purchase this gel is because it helps me with my eye allergies that I have here living in the desert. They stop itching and takes the redness(on sking)away.   CL</li>
            <li> A friend and I ordered The All NEW Seacret Eye Gel a couple of weeks apart.  She ordered hers first and it was half the amount of what I had to pay (I paid $60) and I used the same distributor she did.  I bought it anyway and it arrived in a timely manner and is in a huge jar, but I have been highly unsatisfied with it.  If anything it accentuates the lines around my eyes and creates \\&quot;bags.\\&quot;  She has also stopped using it.  I would not recommend this product. For the price buy a product you can return if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about two years now, and notice the lines around my eyes seem to be less.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent, it does what is claims to do and is affordable, check it out as it one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> I hesitantly purchased some nail kits, salt scrub and body lotion originally, but have found every product to be wonderful. As my hand lotion was taken by security at the airport recently....(who knows, I might have lotioned somebody to death), I had to return to the kiosk at the mall for more hand lotion. Ariel, the manager, sold me more hand lotion and other items including this eye gel which is MIRACULOUS. I am 59 :O and the eye gel makes the tiny lines under my eyes DISAPPEAR. IT IS THE BEST. BUY IT, YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> Ever since living in overly sunny SoCal, I developed sun spots on the crest of my cheekbones and have used Clinique&#x27;s Dark Spot Corrector, Perricone Pigment Corrector, a Boots product, and something from an aesthetician that had lactic acid in it.  I saw some results, but the one product that took almost all sunspots away is the Seacret Eye Gel.  I don&#x27;t think it does anything for the fine lines around the eyes or bags or dark circles, but it&#x27;s awesome at making my skin look clearer.  I highly recommend it for correcting dark or sun spots.</li>
            <li> I use it alot, in fact I use it everynight.  It serves the purpose of keeping my eyes feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel. It&#x27;s easily absorbed into the skin around the eyes and relaxes the wrinkles that have began to form. I&#x27;ve used this gel before and I loved it then. However, sometimes the price is a bit restrictive but I found it on Amazon at a very reasonable price. It sure beats the prices at the mall.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I do not look my age and I know it is because I have used this eye gel for several years.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this for the last 4 years at least. It is very soothing around my eyes. It makes my eyes feel better</li>
            <li> Seacret Eye Gel works better than any of the large brands I have tried.  I would not want to be without it.  Karen Fnell</li>
            <li> This eye gel is AMAZING! TRY IT, you WILL THANK yourself! Even my husband says he likes the beautiful new brightness in my eyes!</li>
            <li> Good product and the price was right - good value</li>
            <li> Love this!&lt;br /&gt;My skin drinks it in! I use it all over my face and neck. ( The other seacret for face was too heavy for my skin &amp; felt greasy to me, sensitive to breakouts) This product is perfect and I have been using it since I&#x27;ve turned 40, 5 years ago. I still get carded at the checkout line if Im dressed casually :) gotta love that!</li>
            <li> This product came quickly.  I have value for what I paid for.  I like the product itself, and have found not other product to give me the results I have been given with this.  It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years. LOVE it!! I get many, many compliments about my lack of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> it is super hydrous! feels smoothly although I did not observe any changes to my dry fine lines yet ..</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t return it if you don&#x27;t like it. Just know that before you make the purchase. It made my eyes feel drier and look older. I didn&#x27;t like it but that wasn&#x27;t good enough for the sellers. They said everyone else liked it so they wouldn&#x27;t take it back.</li>
            <li> I love it, great use, really feels good on my skin. Use it by my eyes and it does work.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since it came out several years ago. At the time I was keeping my appointment for my Botox shots. Very expensive! Then one day, I was in a mall and this guy came out of his kiosk to try to get me to come over to buy some skin care from the Dead Sea. I was in a hurry and brushed him off and kept on walking. He hurriedly ran after me with a jar in his hand and asked me if he could just put some gel on my eyes. And wow! It was so soothing and cool. I stopped dead in my tracks. He put it on over makeup, then put a mirror up to my face. It looked like a better version of Botox. I am now in my 60&#x27;s and have never had a single laugh line again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this gel at the mall for a MUCH higher price than found here. So happy to find it for less. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> As usual Seacret has come out with a product that takes away those ugly wrinkles around your eyes.  I have told my friends about it!!</li>
            <li> This product absorbed into my skin quickly and diminished the appearance of lines and under eye bags. A great product!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few yrs now &amp; get lots of compliments on my lack of wrinkles!  And I&#x27;m over 60,</li>
            <li> Excelente opción. Muy producto.</li>
            <li> The eye cream was opened so I had to throw it away.  It was not sealed so I could not in good faith use it</li>
