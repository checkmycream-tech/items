            <li>Good quality and price.</li>
            <li>and I had to figure out whether that was a good thing.</li>
            <li>I have been using Cartier fragrances for a good while.</li>
            <li>it is light and very pleasant.</li>
            <li>It shipped out quickly and the packaging was great!</li>
            <li>Better yet, ok, here&#x27;s the perfect way for ME to describe it.</li>

            <li>br /&gt;It smells AMAZING</li>
            <li>I like the darker fragrances, and I liked this one.</li>
            <li>I liked the scent</li>
            <li>But, in my opinion, Cartier really makes the best EDT and it lasts almost all day if not all day</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li>As someone mentioned, I agree, this is like a rose with thorns.</li>
            <li>I love this product, he is really good, better than I imagined</li>
            <li>But, it could easily pass for a woman&#x27;s perfume as well!</li>
            <li>but this is the original classic and to me the best smelling one, it is unbelieavable</li>
            <li>he gets so many compliments on the scent.</li>
            <li>Not only the product is awesome, the fragrance is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>it has gotten me many phone numbers.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years</li>
            <li>and I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I will be keep using this for many years to come.</li>
            <li>i love this fragrance</li>
            <li>I love to smell this on my husband and it lasts</li>
            <li>and this is his favorite perfume</li>
            <li>many years, we use to buy this every 6 months.</li>
            <li>Has always been my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>This is one of his favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>and this is his favorite perfume</li>
            <li>many years, we use to buy this every 6 months.</li>
            <li>some days I love it...</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell great on him, it was the best price for mens cologne, especially Cartier, that I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>Very citrusy, but in a good way.</li>
            <li>it came in right in time!! :</li>
            <li>I was sure that I ordered original Cartier made in France.</li>
            <li>I was sure that I ordered original Cartier made in France.</li>
            <li>I think this could easily be a unisex fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mature and sophisticated scent, good for the office or an evening out.</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s smell too strong, distinctive and lasts almost anything once you use it.</li>
            <li>i love it, can not believe it arrived this quick.</li>
            <li>Very good fragrance, was not what expected from Cartiers, because I have had other colonies of this house and they have been excellent, however, it is not bad.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap is</li>
            <li>and it is suave on him and really enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>Nice cologne ,i bough it for my brother and smells really nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>saw it had great reviews but either this batch is bogus or else I simply don&#x27;t agree with the masses.</li>
            <li>it looks and smell like the original.</li>
            <li>and it makes one feel special when asked what you are wearing</li>
            <li>I love it so much thank you</li>
            <li>This is a sweet cologne.  </li>
            <li>Again it&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it goes through several stages before it totally wears off and some stages are more pleasant than others.</li>
            <li>I think this will work well on most men save the very young who want a &#x27;club&#x27; scent.  </li>
            <li>Its light so you dont need to put on too much.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite colognes, and I own and have sampled quite a few.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I didn&#x27;t like my initial whiff of it and didn&#x27;t think I would use it.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t know already, Eau du Parfum has more natural oils in it from whatever the fragrance is made from  ie.,</li>
            <li>well worth it .</li>
            <li>I would always get a very good complement on my cologne, from men and women, young and mature, classic and contemporary groups of people.</li>
            <li>Beautiful, long lasting men&#x27;s EDT with a woody, sweet scent.  </li>
            <li>This seriously smells soooo good!</li>
            <li>The odor of this perfume leave very fast, I don&#x27;t recomend buy perfume online.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this fragrance from a Birchbox for Men sample.</li>
            <li>First I recieved Declaration By Cartier in 1998 and since than I am in Love!!!!!!!![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>it smells really good and has that distinct scent different to the lesser priced item.</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves this fragrance - we will be ordering again!</li>
            <li>When I first sprayed this fragrance I immediately wanted to bathe in it.</li>
            <li>Unique and classy.</li>
            <li>Smells good but doesnt last long</li>
            <li>this is the real deal no fake thanks for the fast arrival.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>Meaning this is definitely a bottle of roses, but the thorns make it more masculine.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the thing though, for me after a few minutes, the rose reemerges</li>
            <li>(pretty sure the scent had a little bit to do with it)</li>
            <li>Other than that, love this scent.</li>
            <li>It was both soft AND crisp.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s original, I recommend it, also came in a short time considering I live in the Dominican Republic.</li>
            <li>Characteristic of a cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>A classic</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>the amount of compliments I get from women and sometimes men, of course I prefer the women ones, I can go to a nightclub and pick chicks up just cause of the way I smell, now who dont like that, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This perfume is far from being the real &amp;#34;Catier Declaration&amp;#34; that I&#x27;ve ever met.</li>
            <li>, I thought the bottle would be smaller, I think it will last me about 5 years, and its scent is genuine</li>
            <li>As I write this, I sprayed it again just to ensure my description is vivid and</li>
            <li>It smells softly spicy and aromatic and maybe just a touch of sweetness in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s really the only reason to buy cologne.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper, but the same version as what you find at the department stores or on line at &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; stores</li>
            <li>Never once did I think the smell carried a masculine scent.</li>
            <li>It smells like a man that was wearing a decent smelling cologne hugged his wife just after she sprayed her perfume and it mixed with his cologne.</li>
            <li>And apparently from experience men like wemon to wear it also!!</li>
            <li>It lasts all day on him and truly you can only smell it on classy men!</li>
            <li>Apparently it is fully a mens designed cologne.  </li>
            <li>In one moment I&#x27;m reminded of an older church lady, then a few seconds later I picture an older man...</li>

            <li> the amount of compliments I get from women and sometimes men, of course I prefer the women ones, I can go to a nightclub and pick chicks up just cause of the way I smell, now who dont like that, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This perfume is far from being the real &amp;#34;Catier Declaration&amp;#34; that I&#x27;ve ever met.</li>
            <li> , I thought the bottle would be smaller, I think it will last me about 5 years, and its scent is genuine</li>
            <li> As I write this, I sprayed it again just to ensure my description is vivid and</li>
            <li> It smells softly spicy and aromatic and maybe just a touch of sweetness in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s really the only reason to buy cologne.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper, but the same version as what you find at the department stores or on line at &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; stores</li>
            <li> Never once did I think the smell carried a masculine scent.</li>
            <li> It smells like a man that was wearing a decent smelling cologne hugged his wife just after she sprayed her perfume and it mixed with his cologne.</li>
            <li> And apparently from experience men like wemon to wear it also!!</li>
            <li> It lasts all day on him and truly you can only smell it on classy men!</li>
            <li> Apparently it is fully a mens designed cologne.  </li>
            <li> In one moment I&#x27;m reminded of an older church lady, then a few seconds later I picture an older man...</li>
            <li> But it is a fake, not the same smell as original and it stays on body only first few seconds.</li>
            <li> But it is a fake, not the same smell as original and it stays on body only first few seconds.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting and flattering.</li>
            <li> Long lasting too.</li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t as long lasting as others have stated.</li>
            <li> Also, does not last too long.</li>
            <li> It could just be me, but it does not last as long as I would like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;EDT has less oils and is therefore less expensive and more diluted than Eau Du Parfum  </li>
            <li> I would concider myself to be a serious lady, however I was laughing out loud when I found that this toilet spray was mens cologne...  </li>
            <li> It takes a common feminine element and adds a masculine flair.</li>
            <li> Once I smelled my wrist again a few minutes later, the scent and my opinion did a 180.</li>
            <li> I started using Cartier Declaration since 1999, and since then I have never chosen any other brand to replace it.</li>
            <li> i bought this based on the review of other buyers as a gift to my husband.</li>
            <li> It is not very strong and lasts longer than any other Cartier perfume for men.</li>
            <li> Be VERY CAREFUL buying fragrances online!</li>
            <li> This is not a original perfume, i don&#x27;t recomend it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy anything from this seller, I swear it&#x27;s not original Cartier at all, my husband</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy anything from this seller, I swear it&#x27;s not original Cartier at all, my husband</li>

            <li> He loves how it smells and wore it everyday while I visit with him.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve worn it a few times, I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star.</li>
            <li> This scent is quite paradoxical to say the least.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed, it was Christmas present from me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed, it was Christmas present from me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i purchased this as gift for my son. he gets so many compliments on the scent. it is light and very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I started using Cartier Declaration since 1999, and since then I have never chosen any other brand to replace it. The scent last all day and it makes one feel special when asked what you are wearing and it smells great!.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product from Sephora. I like the darker fragrances, and I liked this one. Then I realized it was men&#x27;s cologne. Whoopsies. But, it could easily pass for a woman&#x27;s perfume as well! I liked the scent but it has poor staying power. I also wouldn&#x27;t want my husband wearing something that smells like ladies&#x27; perfume. I&#x27;m just sayin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> My brother introduced this cologne to my husband and he loves it ever since. It lasts all day on him and truly you can only smell it on classy men!</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this fragrance from a Birchbox for Men sample. To be honest, I didn&#x27;t like my initial whiff of it and didn&#x27;t think I would use it. Once I smelled my wrist again a few minutes later, the scent and my opinion did a 180. I loved it. It&#x27;s a mature and sophisticated scent, good for the office or an evening out.</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesnt last long</li>
            <li> This is not a original perfume, i don&#x27;t recomend it. The odor of this perfume leave very fast, I don&#x27;t recomend buy perfume online.</li>
            <li> This perfume is far from being the real &amp;#34;Catier Declaration&amp;#34; that I&#x27;ve ever met. This one&#x27;s smell too strong, distinctive and lasts almost anything once you use it. Characteristic of a cheap perfume. I am very disappointed with this purchase. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This scent for men is heavenly. Was recommended by someone. Got it for my husband. Would definitely get it again. Love it!!! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love it so much thank you</li>
            <li> This is an exquisite fragrance.  I&#x27;m reviewing the product not the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just such a refined fragrance.  It smells softly spicy and aromatic and maybe just a touch of sweetness in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do you describe a smell??  I think this could easily be a unisex fragrance.  I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from both men and women.  They all say,  &amp;#34;MMMM,  you smell good.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Cartier makes the best EDT out there.  If you don&#x27;t know already, Eau du Parfum has more natural oils in it from whatever the fragrance is made from  ie., Bergamot, Vanilla, Floral, spices, whatever, like Tom Ford, or Creed and is therefore more expensive but they are richer fragrances and they last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDT has less oils and is therefore less expensive and more diluted than Eau Du Parfum  But, in my opinion, Cartier really makes the best EDT and it lasts almost all day if not all day and this one is a very sophisticated fragrance, refined, it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap is what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Chistmas by mistake, but when he put it on..... It is one of our favorites on him!!! Very sexy smell.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the fragrance at all</li>
            <li> Not only the product is awesome, the fragrance is phenomenal. Long lasting and flattering. The delivery was amazing as well. Recommend for sure and keep purchasing!!</li>
            <li> I would always get a very good complement on my cologne, from men and women, young and mature, classic and contemporary groups of people.</li>
            <li> Fifth bottle I have owned, cartier makes a few versions of declaration but this is the original classic and to me the best smelling one, it is unbelieavable the amount of compliments I get from women and sometimes men, of course I prefer the women ones, I can go to a nightclub and pick chicks up just cause of the way I smell, now who dont like that, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Thsi product is sold by Amazon and is a fake. I have only used Declaration By CARTIER since 1999 and know the smell, my wife, my mother , my family and friends know how i smelled and have been asking me why I change.&lt;br /&gt;Fake</li>
            <li> This cologne is for men that want to seperate themselves from the rest ... I get multiple compliments everytime I wear it ... it has gotten me many phone numbers. (pretty sure the scent had a little bit to do with it)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell the best.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and I love the smell of it. I will be keep using this for many years to come.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I think it is fake. The box is different that I saw once. but still smells good</li>
            <li> I bought for my friend he loves it and it is suave on him and really enjoy the smell. very good</li>
            <li> an excellent gift for any men , it has a very good price and i got it perfectly on time</li>
            <li> i love this fragrance</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad who didn&#x27;t know where to find this in stores. Not only does it smell great on him, it was the best price for mens cologne, especially Cartier, that I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance, excellent aroma, I thought the bottle would be smaller, I think it will last me about 5 years, and its scent is genuine, it&#x27;s original, I recommend it, also came in a short time considering I live in the Dominican Republic.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne as a Valentine gift.  He loves how it smells and wore it everyday while I visit with him.</li>
            <li> First I recieved Declaration By Cartier in 1998 and since than I am in Love!!!!!!!![[ASIN:B000CNKC62 Declaration By Cartier For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 Oz.]]</li>
            <li> Great perfume at great price. I greatly recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> i bought this based on the review of other buyers as a gift to my husband. it smells really good and has that distinct scent different to the lesser priced item. well worth it .</li>
            <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE!!!!</li>
            <li> love this, smells great</li>
            <li> My husband loved it üëç</li>
            <li> excelente fragancia la mejor para mi.</li>
            <li> I love to smell this on my husband and it lasts</li>
            <li> This is a sweet cologne.  Its light so you dont need to put on too much.  Great with suits, nights out, on a date, or wherever you want to bring some of that \\&quot;je ne sais qua\\&quot; with you.</li>
            <li> Nice cologne ,i bough it for my brother and smells really nice.&lt;br /&gt;the price was very good and i got it on time as the seller promise.</li>
            <li> The best fragrance to date. Unique and classy. Long lasting too. A must have.</li>
            <li> My perfume!  ... and a smuth transaction.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just about every woman I walk by complements this cologne. And that&#x27;s really the only reason to buy cologne.</li>
            <li> it looks and smell like the original. so they also send me a test of another perfume. i like it</li>
            <li> My favorite at a great price. Will  always order here. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, long lasting men&#x27;s EDT with a woody, sweet scent.  One of my favorite colognes, and I own and have sampled quite a few.  I think this will work well on most men save the very young who want a &#x27;club&#x27; scent.  It is not dated at all, and I think even women could pull this off, although it is not womanly...it is manly.&lt;br /&gt;And like all things Cartier, it gives of an air of Class.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy anything from this seller, I swear it&#x27;s not original Cartier at all, my husband italian and this is his favorite perfume many years, we use to buy this every 6 months. I was sure that I ordered original Cartier made in France. But it is a fake, not the same smell as original and it stays on body only first few seconds. I&#x27;m so disappointed, it was Christmas present from me. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> This seriously smells soooo good! My husband has gotten tons of compliments, it&#x27;s just the perfect scent! We are very happy.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated this purchase by ( 1 star ) because I received my perfume broken, so I have never seen a bad deal like this  with Amazon.com LLC. I am very sorry about that :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li> it is a great perfume. A classic</li>
            <li> Has always been my favorite scent.  The price is great too allows me to buy and not have to wait for a gift from someone</li>
            <li> I got for my man i am so happy with it....he smells so good now that i cannot keep my hands away from him! haahhhaa</li>
            <li> this is the real deal no fake thanks for the fast arrival.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his after shave and perfume. He just can&#x27;t get enough. This is one of his favorite colognes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy anything from this seller, I swear it&#x27;s not original Cartier at all, my husband italian and this is his favorite perfume many years, we use to buy this every 6 months. I was sure that I ordered original Cartier made in France. But it is a fake, not the same smell as original and it stays on body only first few seconds.  I&#x27;m so disappointed, it was Christmas present from me. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I bought it hoping it&#x27;s the same cologne that I had, but this turned out to be different and Amazon.com has a no return policy on fragrances. Be VERY CAREFUL buying fragrances online!</li>
            <li> Good quality and price.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast it came in right in time!! :)&lt;br /&gt;It smells AMAZING I absolutly love it!</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very good fragrance, was not what expected from Cartiers, because I have had other colonies of this house and they have been excellent, however, it is not bad. I recommend it for daily use.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper, but the same version as what you find at the department stores or on line at &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; stores</li>
            <li> Great product, price is amazing and delivered on time as promised.</li>
            <li> I would concider myself to be a serious lady, however I was laughing out loud when I found that this toilet spray was mens cologne...  I however have been wearing it as a gift for a year and have gotten complemented almost every time when wearing.  Never once did I think the smell carried a masculine scent. Apparently it is fully a mens designed cologne.  I however, the feminine, love it!!!  And apparently from experience men like wemon to wear it also!!</li>
            <li> Awesome! My husband absolutely loves this fragrance - we will be ordering again! It shipped out quickly and the packaging was great!</li>
            <li> As someone mentioned, I agree, this is like a rose with thorns. Meaning this is definitely a bottle of roses, but the thorns make it more masculine. When I first sprayed this fragrance I immediately wanted to bathe in it. It was both soft AND crisp. This scent is quite paradoxical to say the least. It takes a common feminine element and adds a masculine flair. Here&#x27;s the thing though, for me after a few minutes, the rose reemerges and I had to figure out whether that was a good thing. And for me... I&#x27;m still on the fence. In one moment I&#x27;m reminded of an older church lady, then a few seconds later I picture an older man... Better yet, ok, here&#x27;s the perfect way for ME to describe it. It smells like a man that was wearing a decent smelling cologne hugged his wife just after she sprayed her perfume and it mixed with his cologne. If I would&#x27;ve written this review as soon as I opened the box I would&#x27;ve written a raving 5 star review. Now that I&#x27;ve worn it a few times, I&#x27;m giving it a 4 star. It also isn&#x27;t as long lasting as others have stated. Each time I wear this I have to reapply it at some point in order to make it through the day. This is a scent I wouldn&#x27;t break my neck to buy again if it was getting low. I would probably spray this on my bed linen after its been washed. Again it&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it goes through several stages before it totally wears off and some stages are more pleasant than others. As I write this, I sprayed it again just to ensure my description is vivid and some days I love it... Others... Not so much.</li>
            <li> This stuff is garbage ! Not a pleasing scent nor does it last .I saw it had great reviews but either this batch is bogus or else I simply don&#x27;t agree with the masses.</li>
            <li> Very good..!! No words best option ever</li>
            <li> It is the best cologne Cartier ever made. It is not very strong and lasts longer than any other Cartier perfume for men. I have been using Cartier fragrances for a good while. This is my two cents.</li>
            <li> my experience was very good, everything is perfect with this seller and this product, i recommended it, it is really good</li>
            <li> excellent for the price</li>
            <li> I love this product, he is really good, better than I imagined, I introduce to you now, hope you also like!</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne. Very citrusy, but in a good way. I love this scent! Only reason it gets 4 stars is that it doesn&#x27;t project well so others can not smell it except for immediately after you spray it. Also, does not last too long. It could just be me, but it does not last as long as I would like. Other than that, love this scent. Just the way it smells is great.</li>
            <li> i love it, can not believe it arrived this quick. i think this fragrence is what ive b lookin for</li>
            <li> El producto es igual a la presentaci&amp;oacute;n, botella muy elegante, la fragancia es de excelente gusto, trasmite mucha tranquilidad, totalmente recomendable</li>
