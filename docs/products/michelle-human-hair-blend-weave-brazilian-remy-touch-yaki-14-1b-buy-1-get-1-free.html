            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about going with the ocean wave one nxt time if this hair looks amazing</li>
            <li>I would go for a more expressive brand of hair tracks at the top and closure so that there the hair paced on the track is thicker making out easier to keep the layers of the track under it more concealed.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t extremly happy with this hair because it wouldnt curl and it got knotted quickly.  </li>
            <li>is a good quality and stays smooth when washed.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Really satisfied with this hair.</li>

            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Hair is nice and smooth easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>I make wigs and this was a very good quality stock of human blend hair.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this hair, I just wish that they had it available in lighter shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the tracks are exposed easily.</li>
            <li>I was able to curl it (I did big Farrah Fawcett curls) and it looks GREAT.</li>
            <li>but it is exactly the kind of hair</li>
            <li>maybe ok if u doing a quick weave or need to save money.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal but not a long term hair do.</li>
            <li>it was really cheap</li>
            <li>I add blue hair to this to blend in with my curls and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>see why it was buy one get one free.</li>
            <li>My clients that like bone straight hair is very satisfied with it straight.  </li>
            <li>Maybe something quick for prom or something like that.</li>
            <li>and it tangled really quick..</li>
            <li>importantly it tangles way too much.</li>
            <li>on the bright side, I got 4 packs with the purchase of 2 14&amp;#34;1B as was advertised and received my hair sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use this hair for added length in the back, but I would not apply this hair near the crown of the head</li>
            <li>When I first bought the hair I was kinda of nervous that it wouldnt be what I wanted</li>
            <li>Its exactly what I like</li>
            <li>You Can&#x27;t beat the buy 1 get 1 free deal either, I have seen vendors selling completely synthetic hair for over $25 a pack.</li>
            <li>I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really bothered by that.</li>
            <li>But you can tell the blend is more synthetic hair than human by far.</li>
            <li>It sheds a little but more</li>
            <li>I probably will only use it for the back of my head for the length, but use a different brand for the top so that tracks will not show or expose bc</li>
            <li>It did look natural and matched my hair texture.</li>
            <li>Not as much tangling as I expected.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised the curls held as long as they did</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I make wigs and this was a very good quality stock of human blend hair.  It does not tangle or shed. I really expected it not to hold a curl but it does.  My clients that like bone straight hair is very satisfied with it straight.  I holds up to curls and does not lose its shine.  It is not very shiny like other human blend products.  Really satisfied with this hair.</li>
            <li> This hair was HORRIBLE Could not curl kept getting tangled felt like plastic</li>
            <li> Not what I expected!!!!! It&#x27;s way way to thin It sheds a little but more importantly it tangles way too much. My advice pass on this hair for sew ins maybe ok if u doing a quick weave or need to save money.....on the bright side, I got 4 packs with the purchase of 2 14&amp;#34;1B as was advertised and received my hair sooner than expected. Happy with that part.😄</li>
            <li> I want never buy this hair again it was really cheap looking it didn&#x27;t curl it look just like some doll hair waste of money</li>
            <li> Feels like remi. But you can tell the blend is more synthetic hair than human by far. Had that tell tell shine. I used a youtube trick and used a lil baby powder. after curling flat ironing for a week the ends are dry n frizzy. I got my money&#x27;s worth. Not as much tangling as I expected.</li>
            <li> It looks good and feels good, but when it come to styling I have a lot of hair that falls out. And I&#x27;m not talking about a few strands because that is expected but I mean like clumps of hair sometimes. It&#x27;s a great deal but not a long term hair do. Maybe something quick for prom or something like that.</li>
            <li> This hair tangles like crazy did not even last for two weeks :( I used this hair for my wedding day what a mistake</li>
            <li> It was not the human hair that I thought it was by the description that was given. I will not use this anymore.</li>
            <li> Got this hair before and all I can say is you can curl it it&#x27;s real human hair don&#x27;t dye it at all I add blue hair to this to blend in with my curls and it&#x27;s great. you have to take good care of this hair it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> The hair isn&#x27;t real, its very dry, it tangles really bad. BAD!!!!! hair product. I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I put this hair in my mom hair and had to take it out because it was so bad within three days</li>
            <li> it could not curl .......... it sheddded really hard....................... and it tangled really quick.. i dont believe it was human hair</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again!</li>
            <li> Wats the best way to keep from getin nappty an wats the best hair yall have</li>
            <li> Hair is wonderful when you FIRST purchase it .. Once You Apply Heat By Curling Or Straightening It ? Forget About It .. It Damages , Becomes Dry &amp; Tangled A lot , Dont Think I Would Purchase Again .. Probably Lasts You About 2-3 weeks If That</li>
            <li> When I first bought the hair I was kinda of nervous that it wouldnt be what I wanted but it is exactly the kind of hair I go for note that you cannot curl this hair however you can bumb and flat iron it. Its exactly what I like it gets tangled like most hair. I am definitely going to buy this hair again....</li>
            <li> I thought this hair was gonna be great but instead it gets tangled up and is hard to curl&lt;br /&gt;I see why it was buy one get one free. Its a hassle it s beautiful for about a week and best worn sttraight</li>
            <li> Hair is nice and smooth easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;Hair is a good quality and stays smooth when washed.&lt;br /&gt;This it the third time I have purchase it will also purchase more soon.</li>
            <li> I love this hair n so did my client I put it in her hair a lil over 2 months ago she still has it in n it holds curls amazing I was very surprised the curls held as long as they did I love the fact that the tracks are thin and not as thick as a lot of weaves so when I do my hair it dnt look bulky n noticable I have very thin hair and it makes my hair fuller I absalutley love it.  I will definitly be buying more I&#x27;m thinking about going with the ocean wave one nxt time if this hair looks amazing I can imagine what the ocean wave will look like</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t extremly happy with this hair because it wouldnt curl and it got knotted quickly.  It did look natural and matched my hair texture.</li>
            <li> The hair if very soft, but the hair is very thinly distributed on the track. It&#x27;s great to use this hair for added length in the back, but I would not apply this hair near the crown of the head bc the tracks are exposed easily. I would go for a more expressive brand of hair tracks at the top and closure so that there the hair paced on the track is thicker making out easier to keep the layers of the track under it more concealed. This hair is okay, but it did not meet my expectations. I probably will only use it for the back of my head for the length, but use a different brand for the top so that tracks will not show or expose bc I&#x27;m really bothered by that. And look in the mirror often to make sure the tracks are not exposed.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair EVER I bout one 16 and one 18 and before I could get to install it was nappy and tangled up It&#x27;s just sitting in my cabinet</li>
            <li> The texture definitely feels like Demi I just can&#x27;t keep my hands off of it. I can&#x27;t wait to put it in :-)</li>
            <li> I looked around at reviews for days before buying this hair,and some were terrible. Let me just say this,It says HUMAN HAIR BLEND  so I don&#x27;t understand why everyone keeps complaining about it not being 100 % human hair. I installed this hair an hour ago and I love it. I was able to curl it (I did big Farrah Fawcett curls) and it looks GREAT. I will be buying more of this hair, I just wish that they had it available in lighter shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps....You Can&#x27;t beat the buy 1 get 1 free deal either, I have seen vendors selling completely synthetic hair for over $25 a pack.</li>
