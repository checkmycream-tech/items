            <li>Good as always.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s as good as ever.</li>
            <li>iT IS A GOOD WAY OF DISPENCING TOOTHPASTE</li>
            <li>all six received in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Buying this way is a good deal for me for a product that I respect.</li>
            <li>This is just as good as Mentadent</li>
            <li>Use this product all the time, so it was a good deal, which is why I purchased it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s still a good value</li>
            <li>You have a wonderful fresh taste after using this product.   </li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed this toothpaste and was happy to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the taste and the way it aids in cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>I have used Mentadent for years and was so happy to find it on Amazon because it is not sold in many stores.  </li>
            <li>My husband goes through one about every 3 to 4 weeks - so nice to have an ample supply on hand for him at a good price.</li>
            <li>It gets teeth very clean and tastes great.</li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>A couple of years ago I added a Sonicare toothbrush to my arsenal and since then my teeth have gotten 2 more shades whiter!  </li>
            <li>so having it sold on Amazon keeps me well supplied in my favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping and a very good toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>To find the Mentadent available on Amazon was great and the automatic shipments also are helpful.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d get from anywhere else (which is amazing).</li>
            <li>I always liked the way it was packaged (in a pump, rather than a tube) and liked the flavor of the product.</li>
            <li>Although this may have been effective as a whitening toothpaste, we didn&#x27;t care for the taste</li>
            <li>BUT we have stayed with it because of the nice taste of the product and trust it lives up to the advertising of whitening with fluoride as a bonus.</li>
            <li>Nice and compact at the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>I bought every kind there was to stop it.  </li>
            <li>Now that that has happened, they pick and choose what they will carry, and this fine toothpaste (great and safe for dogs, too) has been dropped.  </li>
            <li>It would be great, however, if the company redesigned their dispensing unit to be more earth friendly, while keeping the functionality.</li>
            <li>and I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for such a great price!</li>
            <li>Has a good taste and my teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li>We have used this toothpaste for 10+ years and it is still the favorite of my daughters and myself.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Customer service was helpful and totally respectful.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was able to supply what I could not get around my home.</li>
            <li>I have used this paste for many years</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE FRESHNESS</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased with Mentadent</li>
            <li>Again whats not to LOVE, been using it for 10 years</li>
            <li>This is just the most convenient way to dispense toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Surely it can be done.</li>
            <li>I reuse, repair, recycle and compost in many cases, so</li>
            <li>and it is our favorite.</li>
            <li>I think too many words required in answer.</li>
            <li>ALL OK.</li>
            <li>I could not find this tooth paste in any stores I just love how it cleans my teeth, If you tried this you love it too.</li>
            <li>Love It...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this outlet</li>
            <li>Delivery time was short and the product arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>AND HOPE I WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THEM.</li>
            <li>I love the dispenser.</li>
            <li>We have been using this product for many years and now a lot of the stores are not carrying it.</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS.</li>
            <li>Great product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I have used Mentadent for over almost 2 decades and it&#x27;s still my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have been using Mentadent toothpaste for many years.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll be changing refills more often.</li>
            <li>/&gt;According to my research, at $19.30 (Subscribe and Save) for a pack of 6, I got a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty darned good tooth paste, too.</li>
            <li>The pump dispenser is really great -- no messy countertop!</li>
            <li>Clean teeth and breath that doesn&#x27;t smell like an Army boot!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon makes this product available.</li>
            <li>and it easy to used</li>
            <li>I like the packaging as it is easy to use when I am sleepy in the morning.</li>
            <li>Great product and the pump dispenser is great, no more \\&quot;squeeze in the middle\\&quot; tubes!</li>
            <li>My wife wants to kiss me more too!</li>
            <li>Tastes amazing and keeps your teeth bright and white and your breath fresh.</li>
            <li>The convenience of the dispenser was the primary reason that we beban using Metadent</li>
            <li>but it felt strangely light in my hand.</li>
            <li>Our dentist always comments on how clean our teeth are.  </li>
            <li>..seems to clean my teeth well.</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste, whitening is a plus - definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>BUT they are clean and are surrounded with a minty after taste.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s the same good product.</li>
            <li>Standard used throughout the house at a fair price.</li>
            <li>The reviews about Amazon - as the only place to buy economical supplies of this great toothpaste - are right.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand that because it is a great toothpaste, and the convenience of using the pump style dispenser makes it a breeze to use and doesn&#x27;t clutter up your counter like a big large tube of toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>Mentadent leaves a clean and fresh finish to the mouth.  </li>
            <li>thing that brought me to and has kept me loyal to Mentadent is the delivery system&#x27;s one-handed operation.</li>
            <li>The taste is refreshing and it is a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>like it very much!</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is the only one that I would use for several reasons: 1) the great taste and how it makes your mouth feel after using it; 2) it has the combination of the essential elements in great toothpaste which are baking soda and Peroxide; and 3) the dispenser is still far better than the squeeze-only toothpaste tubes.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making it available Amazon.</li>
            <li>The taste is not overpowering and yet leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>On the rare occasion I use something else, I wake up with a mouth tasting like the inside of a track shoe.</li>
            <li>worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the way this product works and keeps my teeth white and my gums disease free.</li>
            <li>But apparently it&#x27;s a rare find.</li>
            <li>It keeps my teeth nice and white, is convenient to use and protects against cavities.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>This WILL NOT work for me as after 2 wks of use the advanced whitening makes my teeth very sensitive!</li>
            <li>I love this brand and the only place I can consistently find it is on amazon-thanks!</li>
            <li>Not available in most stores, so glad I can buy in bulk here.</li>
            <li>I love having toothpaste in a pump as opposed to a tube...doesn&#x27;t look messy on vanity top.</li>
            <li>and unfortunately it is not availabe in my area any longer.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I immediately signed up for automatic shipments of 6 refills at a time, as I am no longer able to find it in my local stores.    </li>
            <li>As I always do when searching for things out there I go to Amazon.com first.</li>
            <li>only the taste of the tooth paste is acceptable, I would be glad to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re still on the lookout for a toothpaste that can better offset daily tea and coffee stains.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using Mentadent and only Mentadent for more than a decade, but in the last couple of years many stores stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li>The vendor needs to restock more often and in smaller quantities</li>
            <li>The cost of these is $0.94/oz which is significantly higher that some of the 5.25oz options offered by Amazon.  </li>
            <li>, make it a point to do as much shopping here as possible, buy in bulk, get a better deal than ever, and I can even skip the sales tax (for now).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made several purchases off of this site and it&#x27;s safe and very dependable.  </li>
            <li>Nothing keeps my teeth white and clean like Mentadent!</li>
            <li>The refill is only about 1/4 full!</li>
            <li>I chose this toothpaste purely for the way it dispenses.  </li>
            <li>From all the toopastes in the market this one really gives a feel of cleaning in the teeth.</li>
            <li>(  They tried to be helpful and suggested that I replace this auto ship/S&amp;S item with an \\&quot;advanced whitening\\&quot; item of a similar price.</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>Thanks for the shipment</li>
            <li>My husband likes the flavor, and it really freshens his breath, too.</li>
            <li>Ordering off Amazon makes life so much easier anyways.</li>
            <li>Thanks for giving me a chace to buy it.</li>
            <li>My husband isn&#x27;t picky, but really likes this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to receive at home .</li>
            <li>Just need to read the label more carefully.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it for traveling, as the dispenser takes up a fair chunk of space in a toiletries kit, but other than that it&#x27;s my regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>My husband threw away the bottom half of the dispenser, so I couldn&#x27;t just buy the refills (which I unknowingly did last time--if you&#x27;re a first time buyer, be sure to buy a full version.)  </li>
            <li>As you push down on the top, both sides come out of the spout.  </li>
            <li>You just push down on the top to dispense.</li>
            <li>I missed that part when ordering - not a huge deal obviously, but good to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Stand Up Tooth Paste container, that you can peel off the unsightly decals for a plain white dispenser, or decorate with your own to match your bath room, never search for the cap that rolled of the sink and  behind the toilet, Plus great working toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Seriously, if they want to be helpful and show that they appreciate all the years that I have been a loyal customer of this and MANY other items from them they should reinstate the S&amp;S option for the Advanced Cleaning formula that I had been buying.</li>
            <li>It had been hard to locate the toothpaste that I like, but I got a long term supply at a great price.</li>
            <li>These are the 3.5 oz refills,not the normal 5.25 oz.  </li>
            <li>I use it with my Oral-B electric toothbrush and have not had a new cavity in years, so something must be working.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for it at a discounted price, and want it brand new, I&#x27;d recommend this web site.  </li>
            <li>I like the tooth paste, however was expecting 2 refills for this price - received refill and new holder.  </li>
            <li>received promply and  in good order.it is hard to  buy local.</li>
            <li>It comes in a unique 2 part dispenser that has the gel in one tube and the paste in the other.  </li>
            <li>I have depended on Amazon for several years since I became aware that they alone carry Mentadent.  </li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and product was as expected.  </li>
            <li>In spite of a shipping snag, where only one item was sent instead of six, I received my entire order quickly.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll be a little more choosey next time.</li>
            <li>Mentadent is my familys favorite toothpaste but it is so hard to find in stores now.</li>
            <li>Still my favorite but hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li>We love this toothpaste but find it hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this toothpaste for a long time, but it is becoming harder to find in the retail market.  </li>
            <li>Why anyone would need 6 bases isn&#x27;t clear to me.</li>
            <li>For years, after brushing my teeth, I would have stingy tissue in my mouth even from the sensitive toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I began using it when it first came on the market and will continue to do so for as long as I can get it.  </li>
            <li>My 76-year old remaining chompers may not glisten and sparkle</li>
            <li>When both start coming out you have to be certain to press evenly on the container, or you will have too much of one side or the other.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping to get the clear blue gel peroxide and white paste Mentadent.</li>
            <li>I am SO bummed--and actually a little angry--that Amazon has suddenly decided to drop the Subscribe &amp; Save option on another Mentadent item (Advanced Cleaning) that I had been buying from them for years.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that pictured are the refill boxes when what was delivered was not refills but each box had a new pump.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really found a great deal of difference in toothpastes in terms of taste or performance (except the weird kids&#x27; flavors like watermelon, bubblegum, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite tooth paste and at times it&#x27;s very hard to find .</li>
            <li>I tried mentadent, and was shocked at how great it made my mouth feel and how fast/thoroughly it removed stains.</li>
            <li>&gt;:o</li>
            <li>&gt;:o</li>
            <li>This the only toothpaste I have found makes no mess and virtually all of the product gets used.  </li>
            <li>A review a product is essential for other s who are interested is buying it.</li>
            <li>Suddenly they won&#x27;t even offer this formulaof Mentadent at all? :o</li>
            <li>Not sure if regular toothpaste tubes are any better, but Mentadent probably isn&#x27;t a green choice.</li>
            <li>It seems that the choice is now only limited to Colgate or Aquafresh, but my gums are too sensitive after using their products.</li>

            <li> A couple of years ago I added a Sonicare toothbrush to my arsenal and since then my teeth have gotten 2 more shades whiter!  </li>
            <li> so having it sold on Amazon keeps me well supplied in my favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping and a very good toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> To find the Mentadent available on Amazon was great and the automatic shipments also are helpful.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d get from anywhere else (which is amazing).</li>
            <li> I always liked the way it was packaged (in a pump, rather than a tube) and liked the flavor of the product.</li>
            <li> Although this may have been effective as a whitening toothpaste, we didn&#x27;t care for the taste</li>
            <li> BUT we have stayed with it because of the nice taste of the product and trust it lives up to the advertising of whitening with fluoride as a bonus.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact at the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> I bought every kind there was to stop it.  </li>
            <li> Now that that has happened, they pick and choose what they will carry, and this fine toothpaste (great and safe for dogs, too) has been dropped.  </li>
            <li> It would be great, however, if the company redesigned their dispensing unit to be more earth friendly, while keeping the functionality.</li>
            <li> and I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for such a great price!</li>
            <li> Has a good taste and my teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li> We have used this toothpaste for 10+ years and it is still the favorite of my daughters and myself.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Customer service was helpful and totally respectful.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was able to supply what I could not get around my home.</li>
            <li> I have used this paste for many years</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE FRESHNESS</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased with Mentadent</li>
            <li> Again whats not to LOVE, been using it for 10 years</li>
            <li> This is just the most convenient way to dispense toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Surely it can be done.</li>
            <li> I reuse, repair, recycle and compost in many cases, so</li>
            <li> and it is our favorite.</li>
            <li> I think too many words required in answer.</li>
            <li> ALL OK.</li>
            <li> I could not find this tooth paste in any stores I just love how it cleans my teeth, If you tried this you love it too.</li>
            <li> Love It...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this outlet</li>
            <li> Delivery time was short and the product arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> AND HOPE I WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THEM.</li>
            <li> I love the dispenser.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for many years and now a lot of the stores are not carrying it.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS.</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I have used Mentadent for over almost 2 decades and it&#x27;s still my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mentadent toothpaste for many years.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll be changing refills more often.</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to my research, at $19.30 (Subscribe and Save) for a pack of 6, I got a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty darned good tooth paste, too.</li>
            <li> The pump dispenser is really great -- no messy countertop!</li>
            <li> Clean teeth and breath that doesn&#x27;t smell like an Army boot!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon makes this product available.</li>
            <li> and it easy to used</li>
            <li> I like the packaging as it is easy to use when I am sleepy in the morning.</li>
            <li> Great product and the pump dispenser is great, no more \\&quot;squeeze in the middle\\&quot; tubes!</li>
            <li> My wife wants to kiss me more too!</li>
            <li> Tastes amazing and keeps your teeth bright and white and your breath fresh.</li>
            <li> The convenience of the dispenser was the primary reason that we beban using Metadent</li>
            <li> but it felt strangely light in my hand.</li>
            <li> Our dentist always comments on how clean our teeth are.  </li>
            <li> ..seems to clean my teeth well.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste, whitening is a plus - definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> BUT they are clean and are surrounded with a minty after taste.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s the same good product.</li>
            <li> Standard used throughout the house at a fair price.</li>
            <li> The reviews about Amazon - as the only place to buy economical supplies of this great toothpaste - are right.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand that because it is a great toothpaste, and the convenience of using the pump style dispenser makes it a breeze to use and doesn&#x27;t clutter up your counter like a big large tube of toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> Mentadent leaves a clean and fresh finish to the mouth.  </li>
            <li> thing that brought me to and has kept me loyal to Mentadent is the delivery system&#x27;s one-handed operation.</li>
            <li> The taste is refreshing and it is a high quality product.  </li>
            <li> like it very much!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is the only one that I would use for several reasons: 1) the great taste and how it makes your mouth feel after using it; 2) it has the combination of the essential elements in great toothpaste which are baking soda and Peroxide; and 3) the dispenser is still far better than the squeeze-only toothpaste tubes.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making it available Amazon.</li>
            <li> The taste is not overpowering and yet leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> On the rare occasion I use something else, I wake up with a mouth tasting like the inside of a track shoe.</li>
            <li> worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the way this product works and keeps my teeth white and my gums disease free.</li>
            <li> But apparently it&#x27;s a rare find.</li>
            <li> It keeps my teeth nice and white, is convenient to use and protects against cavities.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> This WILL NOT work for me as after 2 wks of use the advanced whitening makes my teeth very sensitive!</li>
            <li> I love this brand and the only place I can consistently find it is on amazon-thanks!</li>
            <li> Not available in most stores, so glad I can buy in bulk here.</li>
            <li> I love having toothpaste in a pump as opposed to a tube...doesn&#x27;t look messy on vanity top.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately it is not availabe in my area any longer.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I immediately signed up for automatic shipments of 6 refills at a time, as I am no longer able to find it in my local stores.    </li>
            <li> As I always do when searching for things out there I go to Amazon.com first.</li>
            <li> only the taste of the tooth paste is acceptable, I would be glad to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re still on the lookout for a toothpaste that can better offset daily tea and coffee stains.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Mentadent and only Mentadent for more than a decade, but in the last couple of years many stores stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> The vendor needs to restock more often and in smaller quantities</li>
            <li> The cost of these is $0.94/oz which is significantly higher that some of the 5.25oz options offered by Amazon.  </li>
            <li> , make it a point to do as much shopping here as possible, buy in bulk, get a better deal than ever, and I can even skip the sales tax (for now).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made several purchases off of this site and it&#x27;s safe and very dependable.  </li>
            <li> Nothing keeps my teeth white and clean like Mentadent!</li>
            <li> The refill is only about 1/4 full!</li>
            <li> I chose this toothpaste purely for the way it dispenses.  </li>
            <li> From all the toopastes in the market this one really gives a feel of cleaning in the teeth.</li>
            <li> (  They tried to be helpful and suggested that I replace this auto ship/S&amp;S item with an \\&quot;advanced whitening\\&quot; item of a similar price.</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> Thanks for the shipment</li>
            <li> My husband likes the flavor, and it really freshens his breath, too.</li>
            <li> Ordering off Amazon makes life so much easier anyways.</li>
            <li> Thanks for giving me a chace to buy it.</li>
            <li> My husband isn&#x27;t picky, but really likes this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to receive at home .</li>
            <li> Just need to read the label more carefully.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for traveling, as the dispenser takes up a fair chunk of space in a toiletries kit, but other than that it&#x27;s my regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> My husband threw away the bottom half of the dispenser, so I couldn&#x27;t just buy the refills (which I unknowingly did last time--if you&#x27;re a first time buyer, be sure to buy a full version.)  </li>
            <li> As you push down on the top, both sides come out of the spout.  </li>
            <li> You just push down on the top to dispense.</li>
            <li> I missed that part when ordering - not a huge deal obviously, but good to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Stand Up Tooth Paste container, that you can peel off the unsightly decals for a plain white dispenser, or decorate with your own to match your bath room, never search for the cap that rolled of the sink and  behind the toilet, Plus great working toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Seriously, if they want to be helpful and show that they appreciate all the years that I have been a loyal customer of this and MANY other items from them they should reinstate the S&amp;S option for the Advanced Cleaning formula that I had been buying.</li>
            <li> It had been hard to locate the toothpaste that I like, but I got a long term supply at a great price.</li>
            <li> These are the 3.5 oz refills,not the normal 5.25 oz.  </li>
            <li> I use it with my Oral-B electric toothbrush and have not had a new cavity in years, so something must be working.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for it at a discounted price, and want it brand new, I&#x27;d recommend this web site.  </li>
            <li> I like the tooth paste, however was expecting 2 refills for this price - received refill and new holder.  </li>
            <li> received promply and  in good order.it is hard to  buy local.</li>
            <li> It comes in a unique 2 part dispenser that has the gel in one tube and the paste in the other.  </li>
            <li> I have depended on Amazon for several years since I became aware that they alone carry Mentadent.  </li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and product was as expected.  </li>
            <li> In spite of a shipping snag, where only one item was sent instead of six, I received my entire order quickly.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be a little more choosey next time.</li>
            <li> Mentadent is my familys favorite toothpaste but it is so hard to find in stores now.</li>
            <li> Still my favorite but hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> We love this toothpaste but find it hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for a long time, but it is becoming harder to find in the retail market.  </li>
            <li> Why anyone would need 6 bases isn&#x27;t clear to me.</li>
            <li> For years, after brushing my teeth, I would have stingy tissue in my mouth even from the sensitive toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I began using it when it first came on the market and will continue to do so for as long as I can get it.  </li>
            <li> My 76-year old remaining chompers may not glisten and sparkle</li>
            <li> When both start coming out you have to be certain to press evenly on the container, or you will have too much of one side or the other.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping to get the clear blue gel peroxide and white paste Mentadent.</li>
            <li> I am SO bummed--and actually a little angry--that Amazon has suddenly decided to drop the Subscribe &amp; Save option on another Mentadent item (Advanced Cleaning) that I had been buying from them for years.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that pictured are the refill boxes when what was delivered was not refills but each box had a new pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really found a great deal of difference in toothpastes in terms of taste or performance (except the weird kids&#x27; flavors like watermelon, bubblegum, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite tooth paste and at times it&#x27;s very hard to find .</li>
            <li> I tried mentadent, and was shocked at how great it made my mouth feel and how fast/thoroughly it removed stains.</li>
            <li> &gt;:o</li>
            <li> &gt;:o</li>
            <li> This the only toothpaste I have found makes no mess and virtually all of the product gets used.  </li>
            <li> A review a product is essential for other s who are interested is buying it.</li>
            <li> Suddenly they won&#x27;t even offer this formulaof Mentadent at all? :o</li>
            <li> Not sure if regular toothpaste tubes are any better, but Mentadent probably isn&#x27;t a green choice.</li>
            <li> It seems that the choice is now only limited to Colgate or Aquafresh, but my gums are too sensitive after using their products.</li>
            <li> Neither does any of the major retailer chains like Walmart or Target, not even the single dispensers.</li>
            <li> I may need to sell 3 of them as they last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste had been on the shelf too long and had harden.  </li>
            <li> I love Mentadent toothpaste and it is almost impossible to find it locally.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had luck with crest or colgate, they leave my mouth dry and don&#x27;t help whiten my teeth any.</li>
            <li> If it did, I would be most disappointed about the form factor since they&#x27;re the only ones with that type and would hope that some other competitors would come out with a similar design.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually believe a simple brush can white teeth, so there was no anticipation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothpaste does not come out of the container evenly for 5-6 tries.  </li>
            <li> Be careful.  </li>
            <li> It is getting harder to find in stores</li>
            <li> Then I carefully read the label.</li>
            <li> Investigating my prior orders, I found I had received the same amount of toothpaste, for less money, and each with its own base unit!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have use any other whitening products as this gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is the third item I&#x27;ve found on Amazon that is no available anywhere else!</li>
            <li> I know some other companies now offer push button dispensers, but I&#x27;ve found I needed to pick those up to use.</li>
            <li> I have used other tooth pastes when I have run out and they just do not seem to compare with the freshy feeling that my mouth always feel.</li>
            <li> do feel bad about it in terms of the environment, but I recycle, compost, and avoid many products that create loads of plastic waste,</li>
            <li> walgreen is the only store that carry it walmart does not they used too it hard to found i like it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is hard to locate refills these days, only on line.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> only negative:</li>
            <li> The description should make it clear either the complete unit [base with refill] or only refills is being sold.</li>
            <li> I think the peroxide helps to cut down on the canker sores I get from time to time.</li>
            <li> to whitening, we noticed a slight whitening.  </li>
            <li> Six refills for less than $20...</li>
            <li> Sad to say I can&#x27;t find it where I live now.  </li>
            <li> We like buying the refills (less waste and so on)</li>
            <li> I was a little befuddled when this package arrived today, and I found six units with the bases.  </li>
            <li> keeps it from being messy.</li>
            <li> Mentadent is one of the few that I can use without a problem.  </li>
            <li> I like the minty taste not strong but</li>
            <li> Therefore, I do not recommend this container for small children or the elderly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was expensive compared to regular but my gums didn&#x27;t hurt and no stringy tissue.  </li>
            <li> I hate that it&#x27;s slowly starting to disappear from the local retail stores and hopefully won&#x27;t go away forever.</li>
            <li> Mentadent dispensers have an hinged, attached cap, although we don&#x27;t find any negative effects from just leaving it flipped</li>
            <li> i was very surprised to find out that each came with a base.</li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD DEAL</li>
            <li> Just in case, get the 6-pack with the dispensers and save them, then if they become unavailable, you can at least order the refills!</li>
            <li> The mentadent is sold a base with a refill or only refills.  </li>
            <li> Which meant I didn&#x27;t have to keep reusing my old base!  </li>
            <li> So now I can skip the evil chain store (which isn&#x27;t local anyhow)</li>
            <li> It is difficult finding Mentadent in the stores in my area</li>
            <li> My husband refuses to use anything but Mentadent and it has become increasingly difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it is difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> It has been increasingly difficult to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is impossible to find in the stores these days, but I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel too bad about my Mentadent habit.</li>
            <li> The base is reusable as you CAN get the refills here too.</li>
            <li> THE BASE  to match your bathroom.</li>
            <li> When I got them in the mail I unboxed one and put it in the base</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve stopped carrying it, or want a outrageous amount for it.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel too awful about using Mentadent.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The mentadent is sold a base with a refill or only refills.  We have used Mentadent for some time so we have multiple Bases and only wanted the refills.  The description should make it clear either the complete unit [base with refill] or only refills is being sold.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and the only place I can consistently find it is on amazon-thanks!</li>
            <li> Amazon is now the only place I can find Mentadent.  I don&#x27;t understand that because it is a great toothpaste, and the convenience of using the pump style dispenser makes it a breeze to use and doesn&#x27;t clutter up your counter like a big large tube of toothpaste.  Amazon, please don&#x27;t stop selling this!!!</li>
            <li> Nothing keeps my teeth white and clean like Mentadent! In my area they stopped carrying and I found it here so I jumped at the chance to always have it. The taste is not overpowering and yet leaves my mouth feeling fresh. I don&#x27;t have use any other whitening products as this gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Mentadent is my familys favorite toothpaste but it is so hard to find in stores now. This was a great deal!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste refreshens the mouth and the pump container keeps it from being messy. This is my 2nd purchase of this item from amazon and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Product arrived timely, and intact. No damage. Good as always.</li>
            <li> I gave up shopping local department stores for this toothpaste.  They&#x27;ve stopped carrying it, or want a outrageous amount for it.  I ordered a supply last year, and received six refills.  I was a little befuddled when this package arrived today, and I found six units with the bases.  Investigating my prior orders, I found I had received the same amount of toothpaste, for less money, and each with its own base unit!  Which meant I didn&#x27;t have to keep reusing my old base!  They preach at us to shop local.  This is a prime example of why you just can&#x27;t shop local anymore.  Wall-Department-Mart showed up, and drove the locals out of town.  Now that that has happened, they pick and choose what they will carry, and this fine toothpaste (great and safe for dogs, too) has been dropped.  So now I can skip the evil chain store (which isn&#x27;t local anyhow), make it a point to do as much shopping here as possible, buy in bulk, get a better deal than ever, and I can even skip the sales tax (for now).</li>
            <li> I buy it for the convenience of not having to deal with a tube of paste.  Great design.</li>
            <li> We have used this toothpaste for 10+ years and it is still the favorite of my daughters and myself. We all tend to get mouth \\&quot;ulcers\\&quot; and this shortens the duration and keeps us from getting them so often. It is a must have for us.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. From all the toopastes in the market this one really gives a feel of cleaning in the teeth.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have used this for years.  Our dentist always comments on how clean our teeth are.  We had to go to ordering through Amazon because we could not find locally.  We love it!</li>
            <li> In spite of a shipping snag, where only one item was sent instead of six, I received my entire order quickly.  Customer service was helpful and totally respectful.  Amazon was able to supply what I could not get around my home. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> excellent for my family.</li>
            <li> walgreen is the only store that carry it walmart does not they used too it hard to found i like it and it easy to used</li>
            <li> I have used this paste for many years and unfortunately it is not availabe in my area any longer.  You have a wonderful fresh taste after using this product.   Amazon&#x27;s shipping process was wonderful and I had it in 3 days.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for many years. Still my favorite but hard to find in the stores. Thanks for making it available Amazon.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE FRESHNESS IT PROVIDES.  GREAT CLEANER</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for a long time, but it is becoming harder to find in the retail market.  It comes in a unique 2 part dispenser that has the gel in one tube and the paste in the other.  As you push down on the top, both sides come out of the spout.  The taste is refreshing and it is a high quality product.  I use it with my Oral-B electric toothbrush and have not had a new cavity in years, so something must be working. I give it a 5 star rating!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had luck with crest or colgate, they leave my mouth dry and don&#x27;t help whiten my teeth any. I tried mentadent, and was shocked at how great it made my mouth feel and how fast/thoroughly it removed stains.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase the 12-pack of Mentadent in Sam&#x27;s Club however they don&#x27;t carry it anymore.  Neither does any of the major retailer chains like Walmart or Target, not even the single dispensers. So once again, I typed this in the search here and voila, I&#x27;m back in business! Thanks Amazon! I will add this to my automatic replenishment! This is the third item I&#x27;ve found on Amazon that is no available anywhere else! You guys rule!!!  PS: Just in case, get the 6-pack with the dispensers and save them, then if they become unavailable, you can at least order the refills! Great product and the pump dispenser is great, no more \\&quot;squeeze in the middle\\&quot; tubes!</li>
            <li> I have used Mentadent ever since it came on the market. I always liked the way it was packaged (in a pump, rather than a tube) and liked the flavor of the product. I always thought that it was doing a great job cleaning and protecting my teeth and eliminating tartar, and my feelings were validated when my dentist asked me \\&quot;How come you dont have any tartar this time??\\&quot; (I had been using Mentadent for approx. 8 months at that point)  I told him what I was using and he just sort of nodded and said \\&quot;well, something is working!\\&quot; At my next checkup it was the same story---little to no tartar! He could not believe it and remarked that it was also whitening my teeth---1 shade whiter in about a year of use! (Mentadent contains peroxide)  A couple of years ago I added a Sonicare toothbrush to my arsenal and since then my teeth have gotten 2 more shades whiter!  I could not be more pleased with Mentadent and I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for such a great price! I immediately signed up for automatic shipments of 6 refills at a time, as I am no longer able to find it in my local stores.    UPDATE - MAY 2011: I am SO bummed--and actually a little angry--that Amazon has suddenly decided to drop the Subscribe &amp; Save option on another Mentadent item (Advanced Cleaning) that I had been buying from them for years. &gt;:o(  They tried to be helpful and suggested that I replace this auto ship/S&amp;S item with an \\&quot;advanced whitening\\&quot; item of a similar price. This WILL NOT work for me as after 2 wks of use the advanced whitening makes my teeth very sensitive! Seriously, if they want to be helpful and show that they appreciate all the years that I have been a loyal customer of this and MANY other items from them they should reinstate the S&amp;S option for the Advanced Cleaning formula that I had been buying. &gt;:o(  (note that they still sell that item I had been buying, they jsut stopped offering the Subscribe and Save option on it)    What&#x27;s next? Suddenly they won&#x27;t even offer this formulaof Mentadent at all? :o(   Stock up, Mentadent lovers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years, and can&#x27;t imagine ever switching back to &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; toothpaste again.  I don&#x27;t use it for traveling, as the dispenser takes up a fair chunk of space in a toiletries kit, but other than that it&#x27;s my regular toothpaste.  On the rare occasion I use something else, I wake up with a mouth tasting like the inside of a track shoe.</li>
            <li> As I always do when searching for things out there I go to Amazon.com first. I had gone to several stores including the bulk warehouse stores,Cosco&#x27;s and B J&#x27;s and could not find my Mentadent toothpaste.  Both of the big name stores said that this product had been discontinued for some time &amp; that&#x27;s why I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I took my chances and searched Amazon.com and low &amp; behold, there it was.  If you&#x27;re looking for it at a discounted price, and want it brand new, I&#x27;d recommend this web site.  It&#x27;s awsome.  I&#x27;ve made several purchases off of this site and it&#x27;s safe and very dependable.  Thanks again Amazon, you&#x27;re the best.</li>
            <li> Great product and good deal</li>
            <li> This is great for the pump styling, and we like the toothpaste also. Not available in most stores, so glad I can buy in bulk here.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. Tastes amazing and keeps your teeth bright and white and your breath fresh. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed this toothpaste and was happy to find it on Amazon.  Thanks for the shipment it&#x27;s as good as ever.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually believe a simple brush can white teeth, so there was no anticipation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only the taste of the tooth paste is acceptable, I would be glad to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to locate refills these days, only on line.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste does not come out of the container evenly for 5-6 tries.  When both start coming out you have to be certain to press evenly on the container, or you will have too much of one side or the other.  Therefore, I do not recommend this container for small children or the elderly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to whitening, we noticed a slight whitening.  We&#x27;re still on the lookout for a toothpaste that can better offset daily tea and coffee stains.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 15+ years!&lt;br /&gt;My husband &amp; I stand by this  toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;Best price over the Internet</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Mentadent and only Mentadent for more than a decade, but in the last couple of years many stores stopped carrying it. It seems that the choice is now only limited to Colgate or Aquafresh, but my gums are too sensitive after using their products. Today, I could not find Mentadent at the last store that used to carry it. I can still buy it here. Thank you, Amazon.</li>
            <li> The addition of baking soda is great for cleaning power, and peroxide is good for the gums. My husband likes the flavor, and it really freshens his breath, too.</li>
            <li> I love having toothpaste in a pump as opposed to a tube...doesn&#x27;t look messy on vanity top. A shame this seems to be discontinued...?</li>
            <li> Stand Up Tooth Paste container, that you can peel off the unsightly decals for a plain white dispenser, or decorate with your own to match your bath room, never search for the cap that rolled of the sink and  behind the toilet, Plus great working toothpaste! Again whats not to LOVE, been using it for 10 years</li>
            <li> We love this toothpaste but find it hard to find in stores.  Thank goodness for Amazon!  Good price, fast shipping and a very good toothpaste.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Although this may have been effective as a whitening toothpaste, we didn&#x27;t care for the taste so I will not order again.</li>
            <li> This is just the most convenient way to dispense toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. The unit stands up on the counter and can be operated with one hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel bad about it in terms of the environment, but I recycle, compost, and avoid many products that create loads of plastic waste, so I don&#x27;t feel too awful about using Mentadent. It would be great, however, if the company redesigned their dispensing unit to be more earth friendly, while keeping the functionality. Surely it can be done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really found a great deal of difference in toothpastes in terms of taste or performance (except the weird kids&#x27; flavors like watermelon, bubblegum, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that brought me to and has kept me loyal to Mentadent is the delivery system&#x27;s one-handed operation. You just push down on the top to dispense. I know some other companies now offer push button dispensers, but I&#x27;ve found I needed to pick those up to use. Not the end of the world, I know, but worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I forget if you can or need to recap them, but if so, I believe you have to replace the cap to do so. Mentadent dispensers have an hinged, attached cap, although we don&#x27;t find any negative effects from just leaving it flipped up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to my research, at $19.30 (Subscribe and Save) for a pack of 6, I got a pretty good deal. My husband threw away the bottom half of the dispenser, so I couldn&#x27;t just buy the refills (which I unknowingly did last time--if you&#x27;re a first time buyer, be sure to buy a full version.)  It seems that my local stores have stopped carrying Mentadent, so I hope I can continue to get it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative: A lot of plastic. Not sure if regular toothpaste tubes are any better, but Mentadent probably isn&#x27;t a green choice. I reuse, repair, recycle and compost in many cases, so I don&#x27;t feel too bad about my Mentadent habit.</li>
            <li> So glad I can buy this in quantity on Amazon, as it is getting difficult to find in local stores and it is our favorite.</li>
            <li> great price..........love the product</li>
            <li> received promply and  in good order.it is hard to  buy local. would  recommend it. I think too many words required in answer.</li>
            <li> AS DESCRIBED...ALL OK.</li>
            <li> My mouth is efferfeshent! Like wowsers! Clean teeth and breath that doesn&#x27;t smell like an Army boot! Who knew? My joy and ecstasy know no bounds! Huzzah!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s pretty darned good tooth paste, too.</li>
            <li> The product arrived before schedule. The image presented described the toothpaste perfectly which included size and amount. It is difficult finding Mentadent in the stores in my area so having it sold on Amazon keeps me well supplied in my favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li> My husband refuses to use anything but Mentadent and it has become increasingly difficult to find in stores. Ordering off Amazon makes life so much easier anyways. The only downside is that pictured are the refill boxes when what was delivered was not refills but each box had a new pump. We like buying the refills (less waste and so on) so I&#x27;ll be a little more choosey next time.</li>
            <li> Has a good taste and my teeth feel clean.  I like the packaging as it is easy to use when I am sleepy in the morning.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste had been on the shelf too long and had harden.  The vendor needs to restock more often and in smaller quantities</li>
            <li> Be careful.  These are the 3.5 oz refills,not the normal 5.25 oz.  The cost of these is $0.94/oz which is significantly higher that some of the 5.25oz options offered by Amazon.  Otherwise it&#x27;s the same good product.</li>
            <li> I have used this toothpaste for over 15 years and it is the only one than I use. I am very pleased with the taste and the way it aids in cleaning my teeth. I have used other tooth pastes when I have run out and they just do not seem to compare with the freshy feeling that my mouth always feel.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste and it&#x27;s difficult to find refills in any store.  These are great and I&#x27;ve continued to buy them from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I like the tooth paste, however was expecting 2 refills for this price - received refill and new holder.  NOT A GOOD DEAL AT ALL!</li>
            <li> I could not find this tooth paste in any stores I just love how it cleans my teeth, If you tried this you love it too. Thanks for giving me a chace to buy it. Love It...</li>
            <li> I love the way this product works and keeps my teeth white and my gums disease free. Used to buy it locally but never can find it in stores anymore because they are almost always sold out. I&#x27;m glad I found this outlet so I can keep some on the shelf. Delivery time was short and the product arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Been getting these in multiple packs for quite some time. This is my husband&#x27;s favorite toothpaste and it had gotten so difficult to find it in our local grocery stores that I opted to shop for it here on Amazon. My husband goes through one about every 3 to 4 weeks - so nice to have an ample supply on hand for him at a good price.</li>
            <li> I like this. ..seems to clean my teeth well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mentadent for years and I can see the difference in how white my teeth are. My wife wants to kiss me more too! I think the peroxide helps to cut down on the canker sores I get from time to time.</li>
            <li> IVE BEEN USING THESE PRODUCTS SINCE THEY WERE FIIRST ON THE MARKET AND HOPE I WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THEM.</li>
            <li> Mentadent is our toothpaste of choice and these came as described. Will be reordering when needed. Came packaged very nicely.</li>
            <li> I love the dispenser.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to get the clear blue gel peroxide and white paste Mentadent. But apparently it&#x27;s a rare find. But I still Like Mentadent in any flavor</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for many years and now a lot of the stores are not carrying it.</li>
            <li> It had been hard to locate the toothpaste that I like, but I got a long term supply at a great price.</li>
            <li> My husband isn&#x27;t picky, but really likes this toothpaste. It is getting harder to find in stores and I&#x27;m happy to have found it here.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is impossible to find in the stores these days, but I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. It keeps my teeth nice and white, is convenient to use and protects against cavities. I highly recommend it. I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon makes this product available.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS. iT IS A GOOD WAY OF DISPENCING TOOTHPASTE</li>
            <li> all six received in good condition.  I may need to sell 3 of them as they last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The convenience of the dispenser was the primary reason that we beban using Metadent BUT we have stayed with it because of the nice taste of the product and trust it lives up to the advertising of whitening with fluoride as a bonus. We always get goo reports from our dentist so it is obviously working well.</li>
            <li> I love Mentadent toothpaste and it is almost impossible to find it locally.  For some reason Colgate &amp; Crest toothpastes cause a reaction in my mouth so that I cannot use those.  Mentadent is one of the few that I can use without a problem.  To find the Mentadent available on Amazon was great and the automatic shipments also are helpful.</li>
            <li> Our Publix grocery store here in the Keys USED to carry METADENT. WE&#x27;VE BEEN A USER FOR 25 years.... Nice and compact at the bathroom sink. The base is reusable as you CAN get the refills here too. You can even decorate , paint, stickers - for the kids- THE BASE  to match your bathroom. Amazon rocks the best deals.</li>
            <li> This is the smaller size, 3.5 oz, not the larger 5.2 oz refill, which you can find for the same price!</li>
            <li> Very convenient to receive at home . It&#x27;s my favorite tooth paste and at times it&#x27;s very hard to find .</li>
            <li> For years, after brushing my teeth, I would have stingy tissue in my mouth even from the sensitive toothpaste.  I bought every kind there was to stop it.  This was recommended to me.  It was expensive compared to regular but my gums didn&#x27;t hurt and no stringy tissue.  My gums healed and I was happy.  Sad to say I can&#x27;t find it where I live now.  My daughter sent it to me from Texas but I found it here cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price.  Used to buy at Sam&#x27;s and they stopped stocking.  Then bought at Walmart and they stopped stocking.  This the only toothpaste I have found makes no mess and virtually all of the product gets used.  I&#x27;ve got it on my automatic shipping schedule.</li>
            <li> The reviews about Amazon - as the only place to buy economical supplies of this great toothpaste - are right.  I have depended on Amazon for several years since I became aware that they alone carry Mentadent.  This toothpaste is the only one that I would use for several reasons: 1) the great taste and how it makes your mouth feel after using it; 2) it has the combination of the essential elements in great toothpaste which are baking soda and Peroxide; and 3) the dispenser is still far better than the squeeze-only toothpaste tubes.  Why the big retailers like Sam&#x27;s and Costco don&#x27;t carry this is beyond me.  So I will continue to depend on Amazon for my tootpaste.</li>
            <li> A review a product is essential for other s who are interested is buying it. It does help with the process.But there is a limit. this is an item that I trust anyone who would purchase it knows what it does. Is an in-depth review necessary. Come on Amazon filter it so that reviews apply to a product that could actually benefit from one!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it is difficult to find in stores. Buying this way is a good deal for me for a product that I respect.</li>
            <li> I have used Mentadent for years and was so happy to find it on Amazon because it is not sold in many stores.  Great toothpaste, whitening is a plus - definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Mentadent leaves a clean and fresh finish to the mouth.  The pump dispenser is really great -- no messy countertop!</li>
            <li> I have used Mentadent for over almost 2 decades and it&#x27;s still my favorite. Not only the convenient pump but taste as well. I hate that it&#x27;s slowly starting to disappear from the local retail stores and hopefully won&#x27;t go away forever. If it did, I would be most disappointed about the form factor since they&#x27;re the only ones with that type and would hope that some other competitors would come out with a similar design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another win for Amazon for providing my needs. My only gripe (2 star removal) is that there is no date on the product so I have no idea if it&#x27;s expired.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for a number of years. Hard to find locally. I like the minty taste not strong but just right</li>
            <li> I chose this toothpaste purely for the way it dispenses.  Does it whiten?  No idea.  But I&#x27;ve never noticed a toothpaste actually whiten.  So if you&#x27;re over fiddling with traditional tubes give this a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time. It has been increasingly difficult to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;I like it very much!</li>
            <li> Caveat emptor: this is a 6 pack of individual pumps (with bases), not refills. Why anyone would need 6 bases isn&#x27;t clear to me. Unless you like wasting plastic, opt for something that is explicitly REFILLS.</li>
            <li> Everything from the shipping box to the flavor is excellent!</li>
            <li> i was very surprised to find out that each came with a base. it was great price for the quality and quantity of the toothpaste</li>
            <li> I have been using Mentadent toothpaste for many years.  I began using it when it first came on the market and will continue to do so for as long as I can get it.  It gets teeth very clean and tastes great.</li>
            <li> My 76-year old remaining chompers may not glisten and sparkle BUT they are clean and are surrounded with a minty after taste.</li>
            <li> This is not the refills, this is the full-on dispenser with product included. I missed that part when ordering - not a huge deal obviously, but good to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that - if you&#x27;re ordering toothpaste from Amazon by the six-pack, you already know how awesome Mentadent is. This is just as good as Mentadent you&#x27;d get from anywhere else (which is amazing).</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase!  Use this product all the time, so it was a good deal, which is why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I always used Mentadent when I could get it from Sam&#x27;s so when they stopped carrying it I started ordering from Amazon. Then I saw this product. Six refills for less than $20...wow! Great value! When I got them in the mail I unboxed one and put it in the base but it felt strangely light in my hand. So I held it up to try to see through it. The refill is only about 1/4 full! Then I carefully read the label. This is not the same refill I got at Sam&#x27;s. It&#x27;s only 3.5oz per refill. Still six refills is 21oz so it&#x27;s still a good value but I&#x27;ll be changing refills more often. Just need to read the label more carefully. As I said, still a great value!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and product was as expected.  I recommend this product.  Standard used throughout the house at a fair price.</li>
