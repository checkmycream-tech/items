            <li> Fast delivery! Great product!</li>

            <li> This was exactly as advertised.  It was not expired and feels great on my skin!</li>
            <li> I like both of these products, however, I can&#x27;t use them in conjunction with each other.  If I wash my face with the cleanser and then put on the moisturizer it makes my face look oily.  If I wash my wash with a regular bar of soap and then use the moisturizer it works great, or, if I wash with the cleanser and not use the moisturizer it works okay.  I just can&#x27;t use them together.</li>
            <li> All arrived as stated and using daily.</li>
            <li> ALways a great product</li>
            <li> Timely moisturizer and cleanser.</li>
            <li> The only facial lotion I have come across that takes away the dry flakes. I need to stock up again!</li>
            <li> process was fast and the product is great</li>
            <li> I think all the creams work the same way, and its just good marketing and psychological effects that make some seem &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS MY FAVORITE PRODUCT.  CAME AS DESCRIBED.</li>
            <li> Its ok but not what I expected. I used a few samples, ordered some then realized It was not agreeing with my skin. I broje out and it irritated me, I am 56 how can I have pimples. Not happy with it, I did not open it, can you please tell me how and where I can return and get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;Joanne Vollmoeller</li>
            <li> Have been using MK for a while and love this cleanser.  Works great without drying out skin or leaving an oily feeling!</li>
            <li> I like these products. My skin looks a better and I like that there is no fragrance.</li>
