            <li>It dose look cheap.</li>
            <li>Its great, I give it 3 stars simply because the brush type and the nail glue is whack</li>
            <li>great set but the nails i got were all size five not much i can do with all these nails</li>
            <li>FYI to the people who said the tips where not tips and they where full nails they are not you have to cut off the rest of the nail.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>

            <li>I got it early and everything was there that was promised.</li>
            <li>but they are only half way full as the bottoms come up high.</li>
            <li>Cheap and messy!</li>
            <li>however, I have only tried the clear acrylic nail powder so far</li>
            <li>Everything came thrown in one big clear bag..</li>
            <li>my whole house smelled deff not worth the money</li>

            <li> Cheap and messy!</li>
            <li> however, I have only tried the clear acrylic nail powder so far</li>
            <li> Everything came thrown in one big clear bag..</li>
            <li> my whole house smelled deff not worth the money</li>
            <li> Nail quality was poor cracks easy didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought</li>
            <li> The powder drys very fast and is hard to shape once you lay it on the nail.</li>
            <li> Everything came as expected and earlier then planned !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not surprised, it was twenty dollars.</li>
            <li> it soaks the nails off in the tub if you&#x27;re in it for a long period of time..</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected delivery date and included everything that is in description.</li>
            <li> it dried too fast and was hard to spread.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money and I will never order again.</li>
            <li> I ordered two and one wasnt quite as the other one</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying the other two powders though</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the colored acrylics suck.</li>
            <li> ·i bought like 19.00 i want my money back ·that is not look like a photo and deliver too late</li>
            <li> And Half Of Everything Was Gone.</li>
            <li> Everything was in place and sealed tight so nothing spilled out.</li>
            <li> It was good at first but after a bit the stuff gums up and can&#x27;t use very disappointed  :-(</li>
            <li> There was powder on everything in the bag some of the items were missing.</li>
            <li> I have powder all over everything what a mess!</li>
            <li> The brush gets clumpy,and there is nothing to pick the rhinestones up with, the acrylic containers are too small.</li>
            <li> Also the acrylic was packaged together in a bag along with the 3 powders and the acrylic cap was loose and spilled all over the 3 powders melting the plastic containers together  rendering the powders useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed it wasn&#x27;t correct especially since I paid to have it in two days.</li>
            <li> very bad and look cheap·!i cant not open that powder bottle three of them</li>
            <li> Very disappointed overall with this product, will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Broken products!  </li>
            <li> The worst part is the actual powders and the brushes.</li>
            <li> The acrylic powder is sticky and difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> It also stunk really bad</li>
            <li> a on time·:(</li>
            <li> Damaged very badly.</li>
            <li> And the products is terrible, the powders do not set correctly.</li>

            <li> Damaged very badly. Couldn&#x27;t use most of it.</li>
            <li> Everything came thrown in one big clear bag.. There was powder on everything in the bag some of the items were missing. The glue is garbage  does not adhere the nail and the clear nail are full nails not tips...Save your money!</li>
            <li> This was junk none of it worked and the glitter was almost all dumped out in the box. It also stunk really bad my whole house smelled deff not worth the money</li>
            <li> The brush gets clumpy,and there is nothing to pick the rhinestones up with, the acrylic containers are too small.There wasn&#x27;t much  acrylic</li>

            <li> Excellent...fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Quick delivery. Only complaint is the colored acrylics suck.</li>
            <li> it has everything you need to get started. more than makes up for going to a nail salon in fact the cost of going to a salon would b more than this kit alone. really happy with my purchase. everything came neat and organized. no spills. thank you! be sure to order more brushes separately.</li>
            <li> Everything was in place and sealed tight so nothing spilled out.</li>
            <li> very bad and look cheap·!i cant not open that powder bottle three of them ·i bought like 19.00 i want my money back ·that is not look like a photo and deliver too late too·not a on time·:(</li>
            <li> Only problem I had was in the description it says you get 50 nail tips, and only got 10 (white and transparent tips). Also the transparent ones where not tips, the where actual transparent nails.</li>
            <li> FYI to the people who said the tips where not tips and they where full nails they are not you have to cut off the rest of the nail. it is like that so you can choose the perfect size tip for your liking</li>
            <li> A giant rip off for the money. The containers are decent size but they are only half way full as the bottoms come up high. And the products is terrible, the powders do not set correctly. The sets at Walmart are alot better in quality and cheaper. This was a total waste of money and I will never order again.</li>
            <li> The products are ok for the amount of money you spend. The powder drys very fast and is hard to shape once you lay it on the nail. The nail file is more like a buffer tool so I had to use my own.  The worst part is the actual powders and the brushes.</li>
            <li> Cheap and messy! Do not buy. The acrylic powder is sticky and difficult to work with. Powder was everywhere inside the envelope when I received this package.</li>
            <li> Nail quality was poor cracks easy didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought so it&#x27;s just sitting in my beauty cabinet.</li>
            <li> I love this kit and have recommended to a friend.</li>
            <li> Everything came except for the acrylic brush. It dose look cheap. The powder was everywhere in the plastic bag. I just wish I would have received my brush.</li>
            <li> Is really good and good price too. Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner at doing my own nails and this was the perfect starter. I had nothing spill like a lot of the reviews I just never received the brush</li>
            <li> Everything came as expected and earlier then planned !</li>
            <li> Cheap, low quality products. I&#x27;m not surprised, it was twenty dollars. The glitter and rhinestones are cute. If you purchase this product, don&#x27;t have high expectations for it..  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Mines arrived in a big ziploc bag everything was there and I really liked it got to me fast everything was in the bag only thing is I wish they had instructions in there for the craving powders cause I have no idea how to use them Lol but other than that it was perfect for the price..</li>
            <li> Instead of getting UV gel, I got a UV gel primer....everything else was correct. I&#x27;m disappointed it wasn&#x27;t correct especially since I paid to have it in two days. I&#x27;ll see how everything else works. Ugh!</li>
            <li> Its great, I give it 3 stars simply because the brush type and the nail glue is whack it soaks the nails off in the tub if you&#x27;re in it for a long period of time.. Poor glue quality Excellent Products.. You will definitely need to order more nails. I ordered two and one wasnt quite as the other one</li>
            <li> excellent products and great delivery time highly recommended love it my nails look amazing great kit for beginners</li>
            <li> This nail kit is great. I got it early and everything was there that was promised. however, I have only tried the clear acrylic nail powder so far and it was really crappy. it dried too fast and was hard to spread. I look forward to trying the other two powders though</li>
            <li> Great.......came on time</li>
            <li> The kit came with everything you see in the picture! Everything by worked well and I love it! Also, the kit came before the expected delivery date, which makes it even better!!!</li>
            <li> When it arrived the uv gel and the acrylic liquid  was all over my package and melted the rest if the products everything els is really cheap but for beginner&#x27;s its okay</li>
            <li> I should have read...all this wonderful product but it didn&#x27;t come with nail primer.... other than that I love it</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The items are smaller than in the picture and one the acrylic colors spilled all over the packet. Overall everything is fine I guess.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping everything was there and fine</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive any acrylic powders or glitters, no model hand, no dish for liquid.</li>
            <li> Some Stuff Spilled. Wasn&#x27;t Any Nail Glue. And Half Of Everything Was Gone. Only One Time Use.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected delivery date and included everything that is in description.</li>
            <li> The liquid and powers where all over the package but over all its a nice kit to own.</li>
            <li> nice kit, items were as expected.</li>
            <li> Package arrived with everything pictured, however actual products are much smaller than they appear in the image. Also the acrylic was packaged together in a bag along with the 3 powders and the acrylic cap was loose and spilled all over the 3 powders melting the plastic containers together  rendering the powders useless. Very disappointed overall with this product, will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my cousin she love it! Very good product!</li>
            <li> Acrylic liquid burst in package.</li>
