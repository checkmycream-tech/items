            <li>Good purchase, I will buy it again or will try other C&amp;E hand creams.</li>
            <li>This lotion isn&#x27;t sticky like some can be-it soaks right in and immediately softens my hands.  </li>
            <li>-I put it on right before I go to bed and</li>

            <li>After I used the first tube I reordered.  </li>
            <li>but it is exactly like my friend&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>Since she loved the lotion so much, we decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble to return it.</li>
            <li>Several times the person who has received this as a gift from me has said that they love</li>
            <li>The product seems decent enough but I mostly wanted to purchase it for a gift.</li>
            <li>i found this in a shop that I thought was asking too much, so I tried Amazon and of course they had it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing and not oily.</li>
            <li>and u don&#x27;t need to use much of it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the feeling, but the fragrance gives me a migraine headache.  I cannot use this product, I&#x27;m sorry to say.</li>
            <li> Loved La Source and Rosewater so I went ahead and tried this. Scent is too strong and people didn&#x27;t really like it. If you like pomegranate scent and want to keep your hands moistured, this would work for you</li>
            <li> It is fine but I like the original better. It&#x27;s new and I had to try it. Moisturizes hands better than most.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it does not take a lot and for the price going along way matters!!!</li>
            <li> This is just a wonderful clean, bright, fruity scent. If you like C&amp;E you will love this. I bought this as part of a sampler and would buy this one again in a minute. Their products are completely worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, not overpowering. Absorbs quickly without any greasy feeling.  A small dab is enough so even though tube seems small, this lasts 4-6 weeks.  Hands feels soft and silky.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Great quality lotion (as always) just not a fan of the scent. Took a gamble in the fragrance but it just isnt for me, I guess.</li>
            <li> This hand cream not only feels great on  your hands - it smells heavenly!  Just wish it were not so expensive.</li>
            <li> i found this in a shop that I thought was asking too much, so I tried Amazon and of course they had it. A very light pleasant fragrance for me. Softens my hands asit says.</li>
            <li> This product protects the hands, renews the skins and smells terrific!  It&#x27;s worth every penny and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This hand therapy is absolutely one of the best lotions out there.  It will soften the hardest callouses and moisturize the driest skin without leaving a heavy greasy feeling.  It is a little more expensive than other lotions but it is worth the price because IT WORKS!  :o)</li>
            <li> I really love this hand lotion from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn.  The smell is so inviting and calming.  I use this every night and in the morning. It always puts me in a good mood!!  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I bought this to add to my Mother In-Law&#x27;s gift basket, along with her soaps and such. It smells wonderful, and she&#x27;s always applying lotion to her poor hands. I think the consistency is nice. The packaging is cute. Great lotion for the handbag or counter. She&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I used the product a couple of times and it works just fine. leaves the skin soft for a long time BUT I assumed I will receive a sealed tube because that is normally the case with beauty products. The package I received was not sealed, the tube wasn&#x27;t sealed either and the tube was a little more than half full. not acceptable for the money paid.</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I used to use the 0.9 oz one and since it&#x27;s almost used up I decided to order the bigger one. It is much bigger than I expected but I love the packaging. It looks fancy but not over the top. It&#x27;s also very moisturizing and not oily. It&#x27;s for sure worth the price.</li>
            <li> The product seems decent enough but I mostly wanted to purchase it for a gift. The name is well known and the reviews were excellent. I was disappointed to see the condition of the box it came in. It looked like it was hanging around for a while. quite a few dents etc. I wondered if it was old merchandise. I wanted it for a gift so I hesitate to give it now as I don&#x27;t want her to think it&#x27;s a regift. I don&#x27;t feel good about giving this as a christmas gift ..... which was my intension. The fragrance is fine...nothing to get excited over. I&#x27;ve had better hand creams that weren&#x27;t this expensive.</li>
            <li> I love Crabtree &amp; Evelyn&#x27;s hand moisturizers. Gardeners and La Source have always been my go-to scents but this time I decided to try something different and I am soooooo glad I chose this scent. It is my favorite C&amp;E fragrance ever. I only wish I ordered the bigger size. I&#x27;ll be coming back for more !!!!!</li>
            <li> I was amazed and delighted by how good this smells. The scent is really lovely and must have taken quite a refined recipe to make. It goes on beautifully and lasts many hours - I love putting it on because it smells so wonderful, and my hands love it because it is a high quality skin lotion that lasts all day. I was happily surprised by the quality of this product. I think Crabtree &amp; Evelyn must have scent and skin scientists on staff. This is the loveliest lotion I&#x27;ve ever had (next to the Crabtree &amp; Evelyn Gardener&#x27;s Therapy hand lotion!) and I plan to give it as a gift to several friends as well as replenish when I run out!</li>
            <li> This creme is THE best, it makes our hands so soft... If only there were a candle this smell.  I&#x27;ll wait...</li>
            <li> Soft and gentle fragrance, works well with other scents and perfumes. Very impressed, I have ordered more than once and love the high quality of the lotion and lush feeling it leaves on my skin....I use this everyday after my  shower.</li>
            <li> I received this lotion from my daughter for Christmas.  After I used the first tube I reordered.  This lotion isn&#x27;t sticky like some can be-it soaks right in and immediately softens my hands.  I really love the fragrance-I put it on right before I go to bed and every time my hands are near my face I can smell it-it&#x27;s very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion,it goes on nice as it is thick and u don&#x27;t need to use much of it. Love how it makes my hands feel.</li>
            <li> This hand cream has a delicious scent, and smoothes my skin beautifully.  Recommend to all who love lots of fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream there is!!!  And the pomegranate argan and grapeseed smells so good - people always comment on it.</li>
            <li> A friend has this item and I had to get it because of the great smell it had. Was skeptical to buy it online since it could be fake but it is exactly like my friend&#x27;s. I&#x27;m so excited to use it in the spring and summer.. Sucha fun scent to have! :] also very moisturizing without being too thick</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion! I last so long and keeps my skin hydrated! The gentle smell is not over powering nor does it fade.</li>
            <li> This PomEgranAte hand theraphy goes on silky with no sticky resedue.  I purchased one for a friend and she liked it a lot.  I seriously doubt that Crabtree &amp; Evelyn make any products that are not great.  I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious, non-greasy and absorbs quickly without leaving any sticky layer on your hands. Good purchase, I will buy it again or will try other C&amp;E hand creams.</li>
            <li> The product is great, however the tube looked squished on the sides like it had been used. Yhe description said it was new. My wife wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with that. Since she loved the lotion so much, we decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the trouble to return it. Not sure if I would buy from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> Soaks into your skin right away without leaving a greasy film. The sent is long lasting and smells divine. It&#x27;s prefect. This has been my favorite scent, it&#x27;s more feminine than most of the others.</li>
            <li> Several times the person who has received this as a gift from me has said that they love it.&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it smell good but the scent does linger.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I had  used this product 2 years ago. Like the new tube much better. My hands get very rough and cracked and  this works very well.</li>
            <li> I love this fragance. Excellent product</li>
            <li> I love Crabtree &amp; Evelyn hand lotions. It softens my hand and scent smells so nice and not overpowering. Best hand lotion!</li>
            <li> one of my favorite hand cream.</li>
            <li> I like Crabtree &amp; Evelyn above all for hand creams.  Just wish that the lavendar was still available, although this is a nice&lt;br /&gt;scent.</li>
            <li> It is beyond my expectation!!!  My hands and nails have improved, plus the scent of the product, too, is lovely.</li>
