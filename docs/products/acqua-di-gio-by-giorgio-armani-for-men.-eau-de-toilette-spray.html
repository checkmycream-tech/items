            <li>I had no idea what to kind to buy so</li>
            <li>This cologne will be around for a while and well deserving of the price paid.</li>
            <li>A nice light pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good, strong smell but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>it is a nice smelling Cologne however there are others out there that are better and cheaper.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing and costs a lot more at Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I had a great trust on Amazon as a large reliable company.</li>

            <li>ok i just take a risk and ordered 1 Armani acqua di gio for me and 1 Ralph loren Romance for my girl friend..</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s mostly for myself though.</li>
            <li>I love when my husband puts this on.</li>
            <li>My now husband wore this cologne when we dated, it still makes me swoon when he wears it, hence I bought more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about 10-15 bucks cheaper than most department stores, and this colonge never seems to go on sale.</li>
            <li>It would be a tool in a mans tool belt if he sprayed this one before a date :)</li>
            <li>Acqua Di Gio is a favorite by many for a reason.</li>
            <li>The price was fantastic!  </li>
            <li>This is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>This has always been my favorite cologne because every woman I&#x27;ve ever met dies for this stuff.</li>
            <li>most will say this is all you want from a cologne.</li>
            <li>Great product but very pricey</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Also, PE seems to have slightly better longevity and projection.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>this is my husbands favorite cologne</li>
            <li>But he doesn&#x27;t like to share, he wants all the girls lol.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne from Armani.</li>
            <li>very versatile, projection and longevity are great.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li>But I still like Armani Code better.</li>

            <li>Husband accidentally broke the top off the bottle, but that&#x27;s his fault.  </li>
            <li>I remembered it smelling better at the store.</li>
            <li>My son loves it and will be glad to get it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh very sweet smell, really pleasant.</li>
            <li>Nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and clean....</li>
            <li>Im super pleased with everything!  </li>
            <li>Actual Di Gio by Giorgio Armani for men is amazing!!</li>
            <li>Favorite cologne; easy delivery</li>
            <li>Nice and fresh..</li>
            <li>It came very quickly, the box was wrapped and the cologne bottle matched the serial number on the box.  </li>
            <li>Received very quickly and product was legitimate.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this particular cologne.</li>
            <li>strong, yet not overbearing.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong</li>
            <li>I used this perfume before, so i know the degree of strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it and the grandsons liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>The first one was given to me as a gift, and I really liked the  scent.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it - it smells nice and masculine but not over powering like many cologne&#x27;s are!!</li>
            <li>I think it will be fine and smell just fine.</li>
            <li>We are happy with this cologne, and the smell is not overpowering but strong enough to be detected all day.</li>
            <li>Very mild, cannot be original.</li>
            <li>It has such a great sceat.</li>
            <li>This smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Thank you Giorgio for an aroma that is perfect..Not too strong and not too sweet.</li>
            <li>A classic and favorite of most men.</li>
            <li>exactly what you expect from ol georgio... been one of my favorites for 10 plus years.. still love it ...</li>
            <li>It smells great and the smell lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>It was original.</li>
            <li>Because of this, though not as good of a deal I will admit as the larger sizes, I bought the 1.7 oz and hoped that it would be genuine.  </li>
            <li>Soapy, clean, and aquatic.</li>
            <li>I buy my partner and bottle every year or for a special occasion.</li>
            <li>This is a very reasonable price for such a great product.</li>
            <li>Cologne smells good but the fragrance does not last.</li>
            <li>He loved it and so do I. Not an overbearing scent, but very romantic .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad in moderation.  </li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift, and it arrived quickly, was packaged well for safe transportation and was a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It is fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;m a Prime Member thought your shipping would go out quickly</li>
            <li>And got it at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>It is definitely genuine and smells exactly like the bottle I bought at the department</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure this is not the real Aqua Di Gio.</li>
            <li>The smell is very classy :)))</li>
            <li>He probably has two bottles already, but you can never have enough of a favorite cologne!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not mad.</li>
            <li>It has a great subtle scent that is not too overpowering or strong.</li>
            <li>It is so far my favorite.   </li>
            <li>the scent stays true as when it was first applied.</li>
            <li>This is such a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>she informed me there was nothing she could do for me and simply told me HAVE A NICE DAY</li>
            <li>and it made it to my doorstep undamaged and fresh.</li>
            <li>(in a good way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and buy from \\&quot;Amazon.com\\&quot; and not one of the other resellers,</li>
            <li>One of my younger co-workers happened to mention that she loved this cologne and highly recommended it as she always bought it for her boyfriends when she was dating.  </li>
            <li>Was packaged just right.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to strong smells, and this cologne is not over powering or \\&quot;brutish\\&quot;, it is a quality spray that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>but, it was light and natural!!</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>I switched from CK One after using it for more than 15 years and now I wish I&#x27;d switched earlier..</li>
            <li>and I got exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li>I cant believe how fast i got this!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not exactly the results I was looking for, but I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this cologne for years and know exactly how it smells.</li>
            <li>On second thought! : )</li>
            <li>Great cologne subtle scent, even when first applied, does not fade too quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>the smell is great but subtle.</li>
            <li>What can i say, This is my favorite Cologne by Armani, its priced decent and one spray on each side of my neck last me all day.</li>
            <li>love the smell of this cologne and lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li>Husband really likes this cologne.</li>
            <li>The delivery come so fast.</li>
            <li>I compared the thing with the real one..  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>very manly and musk.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not strong when you first put it on very mild and stays mild all day a must buy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much safer bet to buy this from a department store.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s never smelled it before but he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>that way you&#x27;ll get the real deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks J.P.</li>
            <li>This and D&amp;G Light Blue are my go to summer colognes.  </li>
            <li>Real product.</li>
            <li>Fast shopping.</li>
            <li>This is the real stuff.  </li>
            <li>I think this is not the real product.</li>
            <li>at a very affordable price would continue to purchase this and suggest to others as well.</li>
            <li>just a subtle hint of a pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic scent I&#x27;ll always go for.  </li>
            <li>, she said it was standard 3 to 5 days,, which should&#x27;ve meant I would have by Christmas, but no such luck, Sooo sadly my goofy to this person couldn&#x27;t be given on day</li>
            <li>I much prefer the picture of the brunette on the box of the women&#x27;s over the picture on the men&#x27;s and considering they both smell the same I think that I would prefer the women&#x27;s to keep the box of the chick ;-)   </li>
            <li>Not so sure if this will last if you have dry skin though.</li>
            <li>Smells good but scent didn&#x27;t last as long as expected.</li>
            <li>....wish it was a little more masculine tho....</li>
            <li>Smell so good and REAL, i don&#x27;t know why everyone is saying its FAKE???</li>
            <li>I consistently have women ask me what I am wearing only to compliment me on the scent.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m an old guy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So just be conscious on where you&#x27;re buying and always ensure it&#x27;s from Amazon!  </li>
            <li>EXACTLY THE SAME AS I HAVE BEEN BUYING IN THE DEPT STAORES FOR EYARS.</li>
            <li>The women love it especially when I walk by a retirement home and they coming chasing me down the street...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got several other colognes that don&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours, this on the other hand still smells nice at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li>The bottle (1.7 ounce) isn&#x27;t huge, as expected, but will definitely last a while.</li>
            <li>Came in clear plastic and all</li>
            <li>Pulls off the masculine scent without smelling like a neanderthal, I prefer noticeable fragrances that aren&#x27;t screaming at everyone and this delivers</li>
            <li>I read some old reviews concerning this but thought it had been resolved.</li>
            <li>I surprised him this time.</li>
            <li>This will never grow old, and it doesn&#x27;t matter how old you are.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m starting to think of changing, but my girlfriend really doesn&#x27;t want me to.</li>
            <li>My brother wears this cologne and I really can never get enough of being around him just to smell this!</li>
            <li>It just smells good, without being too complicated.</li>
            <li>Very small, but I love this scent.</li>
            <li>Wifey bought this for me; however, the first bottle that she purchased was the women&#x27;s and actually, I think they both smell the same.</li>
            <li>However, Perry Ellis 360 Red smells almost EXACTLY the same.</li>
            <li>This is such a classic scent for all men.  </li>
            <li>Lasts on my skin at least 8-10 hours easy.</li>
            <li>He is very hard to please in the scent department, so I was pleased.</li>
            <li>The only differences between AdG and Perry Ellis 360 Red are that PE has a slightly stronger cinnamon scent, which I actually enjoy.</li>
            <li>Paco Rabanne&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;One million stays the whole day and every single female passed me stopped and asked me what i&#x27;m wearing, i was utterly surprised, it works.</li>
            <li>This cologne is my favorite men&#x27;s smell, I buy it for my other half for every holiday!</li>
            <li>not really as expected, and the fragrance disappears after minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with my favorites &#x27;Japur from boucheron&#x27; and &#x27;one million from</li>
            <li>This is a must have product if you like a flowery yet professional fragrance that has given me countless compliments from both men and women.</li>
            <li>Why would you make something out of glass that has a high center of gravity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell like the real deal it has a slight lemon smell to it to me.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Really draws you in to get a little closer.</li>

            <li> Another nice scent from Armani.  </li>

            <li> I had no idea what to kind to buy so</li>
            <li> This cologne will be around for a while and well deserving of the price paid.</li>
            <li> A nice light pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good, strong smell but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> it is a nice smelling Cologne however there are others out there that are better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and costs a lot more at Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I had a great trust on Amazon as a large reliable company.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and we both love it.</li>

            <li> ok i just take a risk and ordered 1 Armani acqua di gio for me and 1 Ralph loren Romance for my girl friend..</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s mostly for myself though.</li>
            <li> I love when my husband puts this on.</li>
            <li> My now husband wore this cologne when we dated, it still makes me swoon when he wears it, hence I bought more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about 10-15 bucks cheaper than most department stores, and this colonge never seems to go on sale.</li>
            <li> It would be a tool in a mans tool belt if he sprayed this one before a date :)</li>
            <li> Acqua Di Gio is a favorite by many for a reason.</li>
            <li> The price was fantastic!  </li>
            <li> This is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> This has always been my favorite cologne because every woman I&#x27;ve ever met dies for this stuff.</li>
            <li> most will say this is all you want from a cologne.</li>
            <li> Great product but very pricey</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Also, PE seems to have slightly better longevity and projection.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> this is my husbands favorite cologne</li>
            <li> But he doesn&#x27;t like to share, he wants all the girls lol.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne from Armani.</li>
            <li> very versatile, projection and longevity are great.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> I love the smell of this cologne.</li>

            <li> Husband accidentally broke the top off the bottle, but that&#x27;s his fault.  </li>
            <li> I remembered it smelling better at the store.</li>
            <li> My son loves it and will be glad to get it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fresh very sweet smell, really pleasant.</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and clean....</li>
            <li> Im super pleased with everything!  </li>
            <li> Actual Di Gio by Giorgio Armani for men is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Favorite cologne; easy delivery</li>
            <li> Nice and fresh..</li>
            <li> It came very quickly, the box was wrapped and the cologne bottle matched the serial number on the box.  </li>
            <li> Received very quickly and product was legitimate.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this particular cologne.</li>
            <li> strong, yet not overbearing.</li>
            <li> It is not too strong</li>
            <li> I used this perfume before, so i know the degree of strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it and the grandsons liked it very much.  </li>
            <li> The first one was given to me as a gift, and I really liked the  scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it - it smells nice and masculine but not over powering like many cologne&#x27;s are!!</li>
            <li> I think it will be fine and smell just fine.</li>
            <li> We are happy with this cologne, and the smell is not overpowering but strong enough to be detected all day.</li>
            <li> Very mild, cannot be original.</li>
            <li> It has such a great sceat.</li>
            <li> This smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Thank you Giorgio for an aroma that is perfect..Not too strong and not too sweet.</li>
            <li> A classic and favorite of most men.</li>
            <li> exactly what you expect from ol georgio... been one of my favorites for 10 plus years.. still love it ...</li>
            <li> It smells great and the smell lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It was original.</li>
            <li> Because of this, though not as good of a deal I will admit as the larger sizes, I bought the 1.7 oz and hoped that it would be genuine.  </li>
            <li> Soapy, clean, and aquatic.</li>
            <li> I buy my partner and bottle every year or for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> This is a very reasonable price for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Cologne smells good but the fragrance does not last.</li>
            <li> He loved it and so do I. Not an overbearing scent, but very romantic .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad in moderation.  </li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift, and it arrived quickly, was packaged well for safe transportation and was a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> It is fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m a Prime Member thought your shipping would go out quickly</li>
            <li> And got it at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> It is definitely genuine and smells exactly like the bottle I bought at the department</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure this is not the real Aqua Di Gio.</li>
            <li> The smell is very classy :)))</li>
            <li> He probably has two bottles already, but you can never have enough of a favorite cologne!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not mad.</li>
            <li> It has a great subtle scent that is not too overpowering or strong.</li>
            <li> It is so far my favorite.   </li>
            <li> the scent stays true as when it was first applied.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li> she informed me there was nothing she could do for me and simply told me HAVE A NICE DAY</li>
            <li> and it made it to my doorstep undamaged and fresh.</li>
            <li> (in a good way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and buy from \\&quot;Amazon.com\\&quot; and not one of the other resellers,</li>
            <li> One of my younger co-workers happened to mention that she loved this cologne and highly recommended it as she always bought it for her boyfriends when she was dating.  </li>
            <li> Was packaged just right.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to strong smells, and this cologne is not over powering or \\&quot;brutish\\&quot;, it is a quality spray that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> but, it was light and natural!!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> I switched from CK One after using it for more than 15 years and now I wish I&#x27;d switched earlier..</li>
            <li> and I got exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I cant believe how fast i got this!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not exactly the results I was looking for, but I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this cologne for years and know exactly how it smells.</li>
            <li> On second thought! : )</li>
            <li> Great cologne subtle scent, even when first applied, does not fade too quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> the smell is great but subtle.</li>
            <li> What can i say, This is my favorite Cologne by Armani, its priced decent and one spray on each side of my neck last me all day.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this cologne and lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> Husband really likes this cologne.</li>
            <li> The delivery come so fast.</li>
            <li> I compared the thing with the real one..  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> very manly and musk.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not strong when you first put it on very mild and stays mild all day a must buy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much safer bet to buy this from a department store.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s never smelled it before but he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> that way you&#x27;ll get the real deal.</li>
            <li> Thanks J.P.</li>
            <li> This and D&amp;G Light Blue are my go to summer colognes.  </li>
            <li> Real product.</li>
            <li> Fast shopping.</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff.  </li>
            <li> I think this is not the real product.</li>
            <li> at a very affordable price would continue to purchase this and suggest to others as well.</li>
            <li> just a subtle hint of a pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a classic scent I&#x27;ll always go for.  </li>
            <li> , she said it was standard 3 to 5 days,, which should&#x27;ve meant I would have by Christmas, but no such luck, Sooo sadly my goofy to this person couldn&#x27;t be given on day</li>
            <li> I much prefer the picture of the brunette on the box of the women&#x27;s over the picture on the men&#x27;s and considering they both smell the same I think that I would prefer the women&#x27;s to keep the box of the chick ;-)   </li>
            <li> Not so sure if this will last if you have dry skin though.</li>
            <li> Smells good but scent didn&#x27;t last as long as expected.</li>
            <li> ....wish it was a little more masculine tho....</li>
            <li> Smell so good and REAL, i don&#x27;t know why everyone is saying its FAKE???</li>
            <li> I consistently have women ask me what I am wearing only to compliment me on the scent.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m an old guy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;So just be conscious on where you&#x27;re buying and always ensure it&#x27;s from Amazon!  </li>
            <li> EXACTLY THE SAME AS I HAVE BEEN BUYING IN THE DEPT STAORES FOR EYARS.</li>
            <li> The women love it especially when I walk by a retirement home and they coming chasing me down the street...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got several other colognes that don&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours, this on the other hand still smells nice at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> The bottle (1.7 ounce) isn&#x27;t huge, as expected, but will definitely last a while.</li>
            <li> Came in clear plastic and all</li>
            <li> Pulls off the masculine scent without smelling like a neanderthal, I prefer noticeable fragrances that aren&#x27;t screaming at everyone and this delivers</li>
            <li> I read some old reviews concerning this but thought it had been resolved.</li>
            <li> I surprised him this time.</li>
            <li> This will never grow old, and it doesn&#x27;t matter how old you are.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m starting to think of changing, but my girlfriend really doesn&#x27;t want me to.</li>
            <li> My brother wears this cologne and I really can never get enough of being around him just to smell this!</li>
            <li> It just smells good, without being too complicated.</li>
            <li> Very small, but I love this scent.</li>
            <li> Wifey bought this for me; however, the first bottle that she purchased was the women&#x27;s and actually, I think they both smell the same.</li>
            <li> However, Perry Ellis 360 Red smells almost EXACTLY the same.</li>
            <li> This is such a classic scent for all men.  </li>
            <li> Lasts on my skin at least 8-10 hours easy.</li>
            <li> He is very hard to please in the scent department, so I was pleased.</li>
            <li> The only differences between AdG and Perry Ellis 360 Red are that PE has a slightly stronger cinnamon scent, which I actually enjoy.</li>
            <li> Paco Rabanne&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;One million stays the whole day and every single female passed me stopped and asked me what i&#x27;m wearing, i was utterly surprised, it works.</li>
            <li> This cologne is my favorite men&#x27;s smell, I buy it for my other half for every holiday!</li>
            <li> not really as expected, and the fragrance disappears after minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with my favorites &#x27;Japur from boucheron&#x27; and &#x27;one million from</li>
            <li> This is a must have product if you like a flowery yet professional fragrance that has given me countless compliments from both men and women.</li>
            <li> Why would you make something out of glass that has a high center of gravity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell like the real deal it has a slight lemon smell to it to me.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Really draws you in to get a little closer.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all 2 hours 3 at max</li>
            <li> BUT DOESN&#x27;T SEEM TO LAST VERY LONG.</li>
            <li> I know that there are many reviews on this item, as well as other colognes and perfumes, about it being fake.</li>
            <li> it has something in the fragrance that surely wants you to smell your man a little closer..or use an occasional spray when your missing him.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve never been more unhappy with costumer service as I was that day,I told her I thought I had prime 2 day</li>
            <li> It almost got me a few dates, but apparently my personality got in the way.</li>
            <li> If you belive them you just loose your money like me...</li>
            <li> Lastly, PE can be had for half the price of AdG.</li>
            <li> But if you would like to save a few bucks, I would recommend Perry Ellis 360 Red.</li>
            <li> This came in faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Its not fake its just tooooo much fake</li>
            <li> I get compliments on some of the other fragrances I wear.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend other people buying it.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy any other scent.</li>
            <li> It has some sort of small sticker in Chinese writing</li>
            <li> For everyone suspecting they have received fakes and can not tell by scent alone, [...] can help you distinguish between real product and fake using indicators on packaging and bottle.</li>
            <li> A small spray goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I had little problem with the spray mechanism.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday perfume..</li>
            <li> I just waste my $$.</li>
            <li> Got this from amazon few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> a few &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that</li>
            <li> The scent stays for few minutes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on body sprays...</li>
            <li> bad reviews are REAL</li>
            <li> To small</li>
            <li> I also  keep a small bottle of it in the car to use after the gym.  </li>
            <li> I usually just go to the mall &amp; buy but thought my husband won&#x27;t know about it since I was ordering for Valentine&#x27;s day so decided to order online.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to put this</li>
            <li> I heard cheep counterfits can copy the scent but is lacking the expensive oil that makes it last.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this can go bad or be old</li>
            <li> Father loves the smell, and is hard to buy for.</li>
            <li> liquid.&amp;#34; NOT PLEASED!</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s seriously good.&lt;br /&gt;Unmistakable</li>
            <li> The number on the bottle does not match the box, and the scent is very weak - fading after just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> but disappointed at the same time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t trust it&#x27;s all fake</li>
            <li> #34;Hey, is it weird to tell another man he smells good?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so worried now that I have read all the reviews about fake Aqua Di Gio.</li>
            <li> But you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on Dec 17, thinking it would be here in time for Christmas, but sadly it didn&#x27;t come, when I called Amazon to see what happened</li>
            <li> so it HAS TO BE FAKE</li>
            <li> He was skeptical at first,one-day</li>
            <li> - I hate PE bottles - they are tall and thin.</li>
            <li> I smell expensive !</li>
            <li> Very expensive but managed to find it cheaper on amazon.</li>
            <li> , It  is  bad  </li>
            <li> am shocked.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Smells great but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all 2 hours 3 at max</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and we both love it. It smells absolutely amazing. The bottle (1.7 ounce) isn&#x27;t huge, as expected, but will definitely last a while. Will buy again :)</li>
            <li> Are there Giorgio Armani products which are not 5 stars? I don&#x27;t think so!</li>
            <li> Five stars all the way. I have always loved this particular cologne. One of my all time favorites.</li>

            <li> This is a great cologne for the discerning man. I am very sensitive to strong smells, and this cologne is not over powering or \\&quot;brutish\\&quot;, it is a quality spray that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This bottle of cologne is very nice.  I have had it before so I bought it again.  Came in clear plastic and all and it seems to be legit.</li>

            <li> To small but it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Smells good, does what its suppose to.</li>
            <li> My son loved it. It has a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday perfume.. I always buy perfume from Macys. 1of my friend told me there have a online store name (PERFUMANIA)they sell perfume in good price.. ok i just take a risk and ordered 1 Armani acqua di gio for me and 1 Ralph loren Romance for my girl friend.. The delivery come so fast. You dont belive when i opened the box of acqua di gio am shocked. And think how can people cheat like this. Its not fake its just tooooo much fake the box the material ohhh GOD i cant explain..!! I just waste my $$. Its like a perfume of 4 to 5 bucks.. I compared the thing with the real one..  Big different.. Dont belive this company.. If you belive them you just loose your money like me... Thats it..........</li>
            <li> Great. Communication had some delivery problems but they have been working with me. They keep u updated amazon also keeps u updated on what is going on with product</li>
            <li> Flawless transaction, Wonderful fragrance. Everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered ,PERFECT!</li>
            <li> Got this from amazon few weeks ago.  It&#x27;s a classic scent I&#x27;ll always go for.  And got it at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li> This scent should come with a warning label: WARNING MAY ENVOKE INSTANT SEDUCTION. I would consider it catnip for us ladies.     On another note, it should not to be worn by attached man.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne for my husband to wear! I buy this for him every Christmas. I think it&#x27;s mostly for myself though.</li>
            <li> I brought this cologne for my husband. It has a great subtle scent that is not too overpowering or strong. I love when my husband puts this on. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> My now husband wore this cologne when we dated, it still makes me swoon when he wears it, hence I bought more.</li>
            <li> This cologne is my favorite men&#x27;s smell, I buy it for my other half for every holiday! It&#x27;s a fresh very sweet smell, really pleasant. I always recommend it, and the price on amazon is awesome! It&#x27;s about 10-15 bucks cheaper than most department stores, and this colonge never seems to go on sale. lol</li>
            <li> I switched from CK One after using it for more than 15 years and now I wish I&#x27;d switched earlier..</li>
            <li> Favorite cologne; easy delivery</li>
            <li> Wife loves it.  It would be a tool in a mans tool belt if he sprayed this one before a date :)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and I got exactly what I paid for. Can&#x27;t complain at all. Acqua Di Gio is a favorite by many for a reason.</li>
            <li> I cant believe how fast i got this!  My bf is going to love it!  The price was fantastic!  Im super pleased with everything!  Thank You!</li>
            <li> The smell is very classy :)))</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t trust it&#x27;s all fake</li>
            <li> smells great. delivered on time.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells amazing!!  This is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne.  Very expensive but managed to find it cheaper on amazon.</li>
            <li> I sprayed this on myself one day before work and it smelled awesome.  I was hoping to have all of the females flinging themselves at me but I&#x27;m standing there during a morning meeting and the dude next to me goes, &amp;#34;Hey, is it weird to tell another man he smells good?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m like, &amp;#34;No...?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He goes, &amp;#34;Okay, well you smell awesome, man.  It&#x27;s been a pleasure standing next to you.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not exactly the results I was looking for, but I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
            <li> It showed up a couple days ago. This has always been my favorite cologne because every woman I&#x27;ve ever met dies for this stuff. It smells great and lasts quite awhile. No need to over the dosage! A small spray goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Very small, but I love this scent. It is fresh and clean. I even purchased the fragrance for women!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.I bought two bottles of GIO and very happy of price and condition the paskage</li>
            <li> Perfume is very good. I had little problem with the spray mechanism.It didn&#x27;t work for some days but finally it worked.</li>
            <li> Wifey bought this for me; however, the first bottle that she purchased was the women&#x27;s and actually, I think they both smell the same. I much prefer the picture of the brunette on the box of the women&#x27;s over the picture on the men&#x27;s and considering they both smell the same I think that I would prefer the women&#x27;s to keep the box of the chick ;-)   I told wifey that and she just chuckled...</li>
            <li> the smell is great but subtle. most will say this is all you want from a cologne. I purchased thinking it was an alternative for pheromones. I get compliments on some of the other fragrances I wear. have not had one compliment with this yet. I do like the smell. very manly and musk. somewhat of what I think bond might where around money penny. but disappointed at the same time. as to no one has even said one comment. and yes close enough to smell.</li>
            <li> Great product but very pricey</li>
            <li> This will now be a second bottle of this cologne I have owned.  The first one was given to me as a gift, and I really liked the  scent. It is so far my favorite.   But. I would not recommend other people buying it.  Why? Because it&#x27;s my scent, and I don&#x27;t want others wearing it. :)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful scent. Without a doubt. 5 star. However, Perry Ellis 360 Red smells almost EXACTLY the same. The only differences between AdG and Perry Ellis 360 Red are that PE has a slightly stronger cinnamon scent, which I actually enjoy. Also, PE seems to have slightly better longevity and projection. Lastly, PE can be had for half the price of AdG. The only advantage AdG has is with the bottle - I hate PE bottles - they are tall and thin. Why would you make something out of glass that has a high center of gravity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this stuff is awesome. But if you would like to save a few bucks, I would recommend Perry Ellis 360 Red.</li>
            <li> strong, yet not overbearing. Pulls off the masculine scent without smelling like a neanderthal, I prefer noticeable fragrances that aren&#x27;t screaming at everyone and this delivers</li>
            <li> Like so many others, I fear that the cologne delivered to me is fake. The number on the bottle does not match the box, and the scent is very weak - fading after just a few minutes. I should have listened.</li>
            <li> Very happy with how fast I received item as well as cost..smells great! My fiance loved it anf it will last along time.</li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s not strong when you first put it on very mild and stays mild all day a must buy</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my great-granddaughters boyfriend.  I think it will be fine and smell just fine. It looked just as advertised.</li>
            <li> bought for my son and he loves it  smells great</li>
            <li> Father loves the smell, and is hard to buy for. He probably has two bottles already, but you can never have enough of a favorite cologne!</li>
            <li> this is my husbands favorite cologne</li>
            <li> Best smell a man can have :)&lt;br /&gt;great price and quick delivery. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Cologne smells good but the fragrance does not last. Concerned about what might be in this product as it is not legitimate. Buyer Beware. I read some old reviews concerning this but thought it had been resolved. Hopefully, this will not happen to others. I gave this as a gift to my husband for his birthday. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great....reminds me of being 15 again.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before it is a very good smelling cologne.  I received the purchase on time and my husband loved it as well.</li>
            <li> That is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; cologne!</li>
            <li> Thank you Giorgio for an aroma that is perfect..Not too strong and not too sweet. Really draws you in to get a little closer.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas. He loved it and so do I. Not an overbearing scent, but very romantic .</li>
            <li> I brought this cologne for my husband.</li>
            <li> My son, Dilon, loves Gio. I surprised him this time. It has such a great sceat. Its perfect its not too strong and not too light. My son says its a &amp;#34;chic magnet&amp;#34; lol. All his friends ask him for some. But he doesn&#x27;t like to share, he wants all the girls lol.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne from Armani. It is not overpowering and I get tons of compliments on it from people one would wat compliments from.  Excellent!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no secret.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a reason everyone wears it. Because it&#x27;s seriously good.&lt;br /&gt;Unmistakable in a good way like Lauder for Men (my formal scent)&lt;br /&gt;Less formal, but still confident.&lt;br /&gt;Confidence to know you smell damn good.&lt;br /&gt;Makes women take notice and captures there attention.&lt;br /&gt;You too can be the guy who always smells good.</li>
            <li> The perfect summer and/or spring frag. This will never grow old, and it doesn&#x27;t matter how old you are. very versatile, projection and longevity are great. Lasts on my skin at least 8-10 hours easy. Not so sure if this will last if you have dry skin though.</li>
            <li> This came in faster than expected. Love it. It&#x27;s the real deal. Was packaged just right. Was able to wrap it just like it came.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Husband for our 5th Wedding Anniversary. He did use the Acqua Di Gio before and I love it when he wears it.</li>
            <li> Smell so good and REAL, i don&#x27;t know why everyone is saying its FAKE???</li>
            <li> The smell is gone after five minutes.  I&#x27;ve had this cologne before and that was never the case.  It&#x27;s a much safer bet to buy this from a department store.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 17 year son and he loves it</li>
            <li> Great deal. Arrived earlier than advertised</li>
            <li> Chicks dig it... Need I say more?</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this cologne for a number of years and I still feel it is one of the best on the market.  I consistently have women ask me what I am wearing only to compliment me on the scent.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I purchased this for my husband and I love it on him.</li>
            <li> Smells good but scent didn&#x27;t last as long as expected.</li>
            <li> My husband had never tried GIO before and wanted to try it.  He is very hard to please in the scent department, so I was pleased.</li>
            <li> It has a great refreshing smell.  I also  keep a small bottle of it in the car to use after the gym.  I have even gotten a few &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that your wearing&amp;#34;comments...and I&#x27;m an old guy!</li>
            <li> Great cologne subtle scent, even when first applied, does not fade too quickly&lt;br /&gt;and the scent stays true as when it was first applied.</li>
            <li> Acqua Di Gio is the most popular best selling men&#x27;s cologne in the world and I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The  perfume  last  only  minutes,  disapears  too  soon, It  is  bad  quality  product.will  not  buy  again  it  is  piece  of  garbage</li>
            <li> This is the good stuff.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about 2 years now and I&#x27;m starting to think of changing, but my girlfriend really doesn&#x27;t want me to.</li>
            <li> Great product and great seller!</li>
            <li> This perfume is my favorite knight, buy gift to my husband and will charm is citrusy, strong, ideal for any occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;give the seller time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so worried now that I have read all the reviews about fake Aqua Di Gio. I usually just go to the mall &amp; buy but thought my husband won&#x27;t know about it since I was ordering for Valentine&#x27;s day so decided to order online. Also I&#x27;m a Prime Member thought your shipping would go out quickly but I guess not</li>
            <li> Great fragrance for men!</li>
            <li> Love this smell! Bought it for my boyfried for his birthday and he loves it as well! Amazon had a great price!</li>
            <li> I know that there are many reviews on this item, as well as other colognes and perfumes, about it being fake. I was worried about this when I ordered this cologne.  I read that if you do decide to buy online from Amazon, ensure that the item is sold and shipped by Amazon and not a 3rd party seller through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cologne in the 1.7 oz was sold and shipped by Amazon.  The larger sizes were not.  Because of this, though not as good of a deal I will admit as the larger sizes, I bought the 1.7 oz and hoped that it would be genuine.  It came very quickly, the box was wrapped and the cologne bottle matched the serial number on the box.  It is definitely genuine and smells exactly like the bottle I bought at the department store!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just be conscious on where you&#x27;re buying and always ensure it&#x27;s from Amazon!  Your chances of getting a genuine bottle increases greatly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to get our two teenage grandsons for Christmas.  One of my younger co-workers happened to mention that she loved this cologne and highly recommended it as she always bought it for her boyfriends when she was dating.  I ordered it and the grandsons liked it very much.  It is not too strong just a subtle hint of a pleasant fragrance.  One of the boys is dating and he said his girl friend liked it.</li>
            <li> it is a nice smelling Cologne however there are others out there that are better and cheaper. But you can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Great smell. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Love the Smell, but it was cheaper elsewhere</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent. It&#x27;s a good, strong smell but not overpowering. I can&#x27;t stop sniffing him. &#x3D;) He&#x27;s never smelled it before but he absolutely loves it. Packaging was very good. Lots of bubble wrap to protect the bottle from damage during shipment.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne. It almost got me a few dates, but apparently my personality got in the way.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy any other scent.</li>
            <li> Another nice scent from Armani.  But I still like Armani Code better.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this cologne and lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift.  It was the perfect gift.</li>
            <li> This is such a classic scent for all men.  I buy my partner and bottle every year or for a special occasion.</li>
            <li> What else can I say about Acqua Di Gio that hasn&#x27;t already been said? One of the best men&#x27;s fragrances ever made, period. Soapy, clean, and aquatic. It just smells good, without being too complicated. Wish it lasted longer, but not a big deal. Amazon has the most affordable price for this premium cologne.</li>
            <li> GREAT SENT BUT DOESN&#x27;T SEEM TO LAST VERY LONG.</li>
            <li> I had never worn cologne, and a lady friend recommended this to me. I get compliments on it. Two sprays is usually enough. One day I did three and someone asked \\&quot;What are you wearing?\\&quot; (in a good way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and buy from \\&quot;Amazon.com\\&quot; and not one of the other resellers, that way you&#x27;ll get the real deal.</li>
            <li> good as I am&lt;br /&gt; Thanks J.P.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this fragrance for years and I just had to have it again.  Women really love it!!!</li>
            <li> exactly what you expect from ol georgio... been one of my favorites for 10 plus years.. still love it ...</li>
            <li> not really as expected, and the fragrance disappears after minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with my favorites &#x27;Japur from boucheron&#x27; and &#x27;one million from Paco Rabanne&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;One million stays the whole day and every single female passed me stopped and asked me what i&#x27;m wearing, i was utterly surprised, it works.</li>
            <li> Love love love the smell and so does the girls 😉</li>
            <li> This is such a nice fragrance.  I love when hubby wears this.  Simply happiness</li>
            <li> This smells fantastic. I purchased it for my husband. He loves it. Very, very awesome. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> luv this Cologne its one of my favorite . . . very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great for nights out. I got compliments from many strangers. Genuine product, no doubt!</li>
            <li> I purchased this on Dec 17, thinking it would be here in time for Christmas, but sadly it didn&#x27;t come, when I called Amazon to see what happened she informed me there was nothing she could do for me and simply told me HAVE A NICE DAY, I&#x27;ve never been more unhappy with costumer service as I was that day,I told her I thought I had prime 2 day, she said it was standard 3 to 5 days,, which should&#x27;ve meant I would have by Christmas, but no such luck, Sooo sadly my goofy to this person couldn&#x27;t be given on day it was bought for and I can&#x27;t tell you if its nice cuz its not here</li>
            <li> Got this for my son for Christmas and he loves it!  I had no idea what to kind to buy so, I went by the reviews and it&#x27;s a great choice.  Not sure how to put this but, it was light and natural!!</li>
            <li> It was what I wanted. Delivery time was great.</li>
            <li> Every time I have this on I get a compliment on the scent.  A nice light pleasant scent.  This and D&amp;G Light Blue are my go to summer colognes.  Nice light smell that is not overbearing.</li>
            <li> I WILL NEVER BUY THIS ANYWHERE BUT AMAZON. EXACTLY THE SAME AS I HAVE BEEN BUYING IN THE DEPT STAORES FOR EYARS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying it for years now. An ex girlfriend of mine bought me one back in 2006 and I&#x27;ve been buying it since then. It smells great and the smell lasts for a long time. I&#x27;ve got several other colognes that don&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours, this on the other hand still smells nice at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> A man and his armani.. Nice and fresh.. The scent is an oldie but goodie for a reason and I&#x27;m not mad. My wife bought it and I like it....wish it was a little more masculine tho....</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husbands he loves this perfume!!</li>
            <li> Amazon should be asemed of selling this type knock off product by themself. I had a great trust on Amazon as a large reliable company. The scent stays for few minutes. Very mild, cannot be original. I used this perfume before, so i know the degree of strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;I still use the Armani Diamond bought from Amazon. It was original. But not this one.</li>
            <li> My favorite!! Smells so sexy on my man mmmm</li>
            <li> I buy this every year for my son</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  Love the scent. Real product. Happy hubby.</li>
            <li> It has some sort of small sticker in Chinese writing so it HAS TO BE FAKE it doesn&#x27;t smell like the real deal it has a slight lemon smell to it to me.&lt;br /&gt;The bad reviews are REAL</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes my boyfriend wears. What a great fragrance and he loves it too. What a great gift.</li>
            <li> Great Service and item</li>
            <li> i love . smells amazing and my wife loves for me to wear it. i get people asking me what im wearing so they can buy it for their husbands... ill definitely be buying more..</li>
            <li> Why wouldn&#x27;t you want to smell Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Best the cologne. Fast shopping. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and clean....</li>
            <li> They all name Macy&#x27;s when they bad-mouth this product.  Well, guess what?  This is the real stuff.  Smells the same as the bottle I already have that&#x27;s allllllmost gone.  They&#x27;re just plugging Macy&#x27;s.  ...poorly.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure this is not the real Aqua Di Gio. I have been wearing this cologne for years and know exactly how it smells. This does not smell the same and doesn&#x27;t last. The only thing that makes me question it is that it was sold and distributed by Amazon. Amazon does not offer returns on this product because it is considered a &amp;#34;flammable liquid.&amp;#34; NOT PLEASED!</li>
            <li> We are happy with this cologne, and the smell is not overpowering but strong enough to be detected all day.</li>
            <li> Love this smell and I want to let every guy know... This &amp;#34;GIO&amp;#34; is a good way to catch her attention and will build your confidence. Two sprays then you&#x27;re all set... Don&#x27;t waste your time on body sprays... You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I think this is not the real product. I can spray a generous amout and the scent evaperates in 15 minutes, gone. I heard cheep counterfits can copy the scent but is lacking the expensive oil that makes it last.</li>
            <li> Actual Di Gio by Giorgio Armani for men is amazing!! It&#x27;s not musky...which I prefer a lighter scent yet it has something in the fragrance that surely wants you to smell your man a little closer..or use an occasional spray when your missing him. I think it&#x27;s totally affordable for anyone. Definitely a favorite of mine and now my husband also. He was skeptical at first,one-day and he loves it! If you like a sensual smelling man for date night or big meeting.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance and at a very affordable price would continue to purchase this and suggest to others as well.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, I&#x27;m glad I got it for my son.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Makes me feel fancy!</li>
            <li> Great cologne!! I purchased this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it - it smells nice and masculine but not over powering like many cologne&#x27;s are!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and costs a lot more at Macy&#x27;s.  Husband accidentally broke the top off the bottle, but that&#x27;s his fault.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> I remembered it smelling better at the store. I am not sure if this can go bad or be old but it seems to be different.</li>
            <li> This is a very reasonable price for such a great product. My son loves it and will be glad to get it.</li>
            <li> A classic and favorite of most men. This cologne will be around for a while and well deserving of the price paid.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne.</li>
            <li> I smell expensive ! Saved 15-20$ by buying it here!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift, and it arrived quickly, was packaged well for safe transportation and was a reasonable price.  I&#x27;m happy with the service.</li>
            <li> It had no scent whatever.</li>
            <li> My brother wears this cologne and I really can never get enough of being around him just to smell this! For valentine&#x27;s day, I am buying this for my boyfriend; I hope he doesn&#x27;t take offense but I want him to smell good too. My only concern is I will probably have to swat some women away from him now... On second thought! : )</li>
            <li> It is a strong smell.  It&#x27;s not bad in moderation.  It has that Abercrombie potency.</li>
            <li> What can i say, This is my favorite Cologne by Armani, its priced decent and one spray on each side of my neck last me all day.</li>
            <li> Product was shipped and sold by Amazon LLC. Received very quickly and product was legitimate. For everyone suspecting they have received fakes and can not tell by scent alone, [...] can help you distinguish between real product and fake using indicators on packaging and bottle.</li>
            <li> I wish i ordered a bigger one. This is my fav. and yes i got it on time. thank you.</li>
            <li> LOVE it! My college freshman son loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a must have product if you like a flowery yet professional fragrance that has given me countless compliments from both men and women. Great for the day to day or a night on the town!</li>
            <li> Love this scent! Purchased for my husband and it spells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Got this product as a gift but I know that it smells great and it made it to my doorstep undamaged and fresh.</li>
