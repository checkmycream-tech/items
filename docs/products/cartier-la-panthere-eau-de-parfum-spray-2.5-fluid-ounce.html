            <li>because I wanted to love it the fragrance, I really loved the bottle.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d love this, but at best on a good day I could only say it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, purchased it as a gift for my mother in law because she loves it also.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this perfume.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on it, from both men and women.</li>
            <li>One of my doctors even asked me what it was and said he would love to get some for his wife.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I love the fragrance</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Another excellent product from Cartier very feminine, fresh and sensual fragrance that stays for hours.</li>
            <li>It is an original fragance, for a refined Woman!</li>
            <li>With so many names available, you think they could find something more differantiable than the one letter.</li>
            <li>is that arrived just in time for a very special b-day gift.</li>
            <li>Easy decision on which one to buy.  </li>
            <li>My lady smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>But I was introduced to the Cartier La Panthere perfume with a free sample sent to me by Nordstroms.  </li>
            <li>I loved the soft floral and musky scent immediately and saw that Amazon sold it</li>
            <li>Loved it even more when it came and have totally switched scents.  </li>
            <li>I checked the web high and low and this is the best I could find.</li>
            <li>I think is the original one</li>
            <li>Delivery and product sold from this vendor was real, unlike some other places that send imitations and the best part</li>
            <li>Love the perfume and appreciated the speed of shipping.</li>
            <li>The whole shop was vey satisfying.</li>
            <li>sure at some point I will wear it, but be warned one spray is more than enough of the perfume!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying Panthere De Cartier for my wife for many years, and we both love it; but this one changed to Cartier La Panthere is different.</li>
            <li>It overpowers me, my whole presence, by being so strong.</li>
            <li>Very nice perfume, a little on the sweet side but not overly so, and</li>
            <li>Sensitive, fresh, feminine, sexy...</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the woman who said she thought it was cheap and old lady smelling ...</li>
            <li>It has a delicate aroma, trés chic, striking, and suitable for colder seasons.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t like it as much, and what we don&#x27;t like even more, is the obviously intentional deception.</li>
            <li>Thanks and</li>
            <li>Fast shipping will shop again.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sweet, it&#x27;s drier and striking.</li>
            <li>this chic, high end fragrance is nothing like that.</li>
            <li>It is not a light scent, but has a sophisticated allure.</li>
            <li>I barely used any and that was too much.</li>
            <li>and I suddenly smell like a 90 year old woman who long ago lost her sense of smell.</li>

            <li> I love this perfume, purchased it as a gift for my mother in law because she loves it also. Had a little mix up on the shipping but perfume rush worked really hard to address the problem and got it all straightened out! Thanks and I look forward doing business with you guys again!</li>
            <li> Great price.  Went to a local retailer and all they had was a 1 oz bottle for the same price as this 2.5 oz bottle.  Easy decision on which one to buy.  My lady smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Love the perfume and appreciated the speed of shipping.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this perfume. I have worn Oscar de la Renta for years and  thought it was my perfume for life. But I was introduced to the Cartier La Panthere perfume with a free sample sent to me by Nordstroms.  I loved the soft floral and musky scent immediately and saw that Amazon sold it so I ordered some. Loved it even more when it came and have totally switched scents.  I get so many compliments on it, from both men and women. People are always telling me I smell so good and ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. One of my doctors even asked me what it was and said he would love to get some for his wife.  I don&#x27;t understand the woman who said she thought it was cheap and old lady smelling ... this chic, high end fragrance is nothing like that. Maybe she is not used to expensive brands  I have ordered this again and will happily continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I think is the original one</li>
            <li> My husband and I love the fragrance</li>
            <li> For me, it was poor. I barely used any and that was too much. It overpowers me, my whole presence, by being so strong. It doesn&#x27;t fade, the scent I applied is the scent that stayed. I haven&#x27;t received any compliments, sadly the opposite from gentle co-workers and friends requesting what I already knew, don&#x27;t wear that again.&lt;br /&gt;Sad, because I wanted to love it the fragrance, I really loved the bottle. But, it does not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> It is an original fragance, for a refined Woman!</li>
            <li> this is my fav - light and beautiful...</li>
            <li> The best perfume I have ever had!!! Love it! So different to all the previous. Sensitive, fresh, feminine, sexy...</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d love this, but at best on a good day I could only say it&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very heavy, certainly not suitable for day time use. It gave me a horrible headache and I had to wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell reminded me of my mom getting dressed up fancy for business dinners with my dad in the 1980&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure at some point I will wear it, but be warned one spray is more than enough of the perfume!</li>
            <li> This perfume is horrible. I tried it out as a sample I received. I scrubbed my wrists for 20 minutes trying to get the scent off. 1 spray and I suddenly smell like a 90 year old woman who long ago lost her sense of smell. Yuck!</li>
            <li> Love it !!! The whole shop was vey satisfying.</li>
            <li> Great gift for my mother! She loves it. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this scent..</li>
            <li> I love the warm spicy fragrance of this parfum spray!  It is not a light scent, but has a sophisticated allure.</li>
            <li> The name of this product is misleading. I&#x27;ve been buying Panthere De Cartier for my wife for many years, and we both love it; but this one changed to Cartier La Panthere is different. We don&#x27;t like it as much, and what we don&#x27;t like even more, is the obviously intentional deception. With so many names available, you think they could find something more differantiable than the one letter.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance. Bought it for a friend and for myself! Recommend it!</li>
            <li> Item just as described. Fast shipping will shop again.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. I hace a good service from you. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance.Expensive fragrance left in mailbox .Delivery person did not ring bell.</li>
            <li> Very nice perfume, a little on the sweet side but not overly so, and I can still get whiffs of it after 12 hours. Very fast shipping and the best price ever, anywhere. I checked the web high and low and this is the best I could find. Very happy, I might get another one soon.</li>
            <li> Another excellent product from Cartier very feminine, fresh and sensual fragrance that stays for hours. Delivery and product sold from this vendor was real, unlike some other places that send imitations and the best part is that arrived just in time for a very special b-day gift. I will definitely buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Un perfume del mas alto y lujoso nivel</li>
            <li> The perfume is wonderful!!!! It has a delicate aroma, trés chic, striking, and suitable for colder seasons. It&#x27;s not sweet, it&#x27;s drier and striking.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much I got the package thank you very much</li>
            <li> Smell different  from  the  sammple another  word  smell  bad like the old people</li>
