            <li>Love this product for my daughter-really controls the dandruff.  </li>
            <li>:) 5 stars</li>
            <li>/&gt;i thought this would have more of a tingling sensation; it doesn&#x27;t feel refreshing.</li>
            <li>Love this product&lt;br /&gt;Worth the expence</li>
            <li>It smells nice just nothing special.</li>
            <li>Just received this two piece product today and was excited to try it!  </li>
            <li>I will say the smell is strong, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Plus they smell great and my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and leaves my hair very soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>I like the product,, I wish the shampoo bottle could be like the aconditioner bottle easy to pump out.</li>
            <li>The tea tree was not that strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent is so incredibly strong, I couldn&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li>I like that the smell stays for a while, just not this smell and not this strong.</li>
            <li>Works well, but the conditioner has too strong a scent for me.</li>
            <li>I was looking for new shampoo and conditioner and the ratings on this seemed to be good</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is fine but feels synthetic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a better product, and that&#x27;s exactly what this is.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is fine as well and smells lovey</li>
            <li>I will enjoy using these on my hair.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Not at Genuine Product Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li>My daughter LOVES the smell and it leaves her hair shiny and smooth...</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft  shiny and smelling good</li>
            <li>absolutely love this stuff smells amazing leaves hair clean and soft</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and silky and wonderfully lavender scented, with no tangles or static in our dry Wisconsin winters.  </li>
            <li>and I had originally purchased it from a student at the Paul Mitchell School.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try out this duo.</li>
            <li>really isn&#x27;t any better than the 99 cent brands.</li>
            <li>Tremendously.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, the conditioner is smoothing, but the shampoo ruins the experience for me.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not sensitive to scents, I&#x27;d say this would be a good buy for you, otherwise, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I actually like the &amp;#34;chill&amp;#34; of the original better, but this is fabulous.</li>
            <li>the smell was to strong, the lavander and mint clashed to much.</li>
            <li>I bought some from the salon (which is a Paul Mitchell/Redken salon) and after the first use I could tell it made a difference!</li>
            <li>But the products are very soothing to a dry itchy scalp, so I use them happily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now, and I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>it is definitely a gender neutral smell and is very strong.</li>
            <li>Smelled nice but made my hair feel dry and brittle...</li>
            <li>Very much hydrating</li>
            <li>Just be aware 10.1 ounces is about the size of a soda can.</li>
            <li>Would love a different earthy scent</li>
            <li>, that would be a bit more womanly</li>
            <li>I had tried the organix line and my hair felt dry, ratty and knotted very easily.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this for any men interested in taking better care of themselves, it can certainly be a bit pricier, but you&#x27;ll see and feel a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many that always leave my hair feeling oily and flat.</li>
            <li>i have pretty healthy hair, but it would actually look worse (fly aways) after using the conditioner.</li>
            <li>but it is a little more accessible to me which prompted the switch.  </li>
            <li>I have had trouble getting the perfect conditioner that is just right, not to heavy to leave greasy but not too light to feel like I need a major de-tangler.</li>
            <li>smells relaxing and makes my hair feel super clean without it feeling too dry.</li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo, plus conditioner of course, that actually leaves my scalp AND hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Disliked the strong smell and it gave no tingly feeling as the original Tea Tree.</li>
            <li>Hope that the same deal is available when I need a refill.</li>
            <li>I really like the shampoo, it is adds a lot of volume.  </li>
            <li>My gf uses this stuff and it works really well.</li>
            <li>cleans and conditions very well.</li>
            <li>too much money for the size.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even have this much dryness when using drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not real crazy about the scent, pretty overpowering, but I can live with it for a healthier scalp.</li>
            <li>I have much better result with other brands.</li>
            <li>Smells good tho but not good for my hair.</li>
            <li>After blow drying it after the first use it felt SO soft and</li>
            <li>I have a new scalp!</li>
            <li>Jack Black may be a better value (never thought I could write that).</li>
            <li>I found a Sports Clips and ended up trying this particular product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone</li>
            <li>bought shampoos and conditioners and high quality ones.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, but I felt little to no &amp;#34;tingleing&amp;#34; sensation.</li>
            <li>It was so strong that I washed my hair with other shampoo three times before it went away.</li>
            <li>This worked really well and made my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Really makes my hair feel soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo and conditioner I will buy, and am pleased to see that Amazon offers the gigantic refill sizes for future orders.</li>
            <li>I wish I could return this because I completely wasted $30 that could have been put towards a better product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shampoo, but not great.</li>
            <li>So, when my husband and I moved and I had to switch salons, my new hairdresser recommended the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree line.</li>
            <li>I never spend this much on shampoo and conditioner but this stuff is well worth the price, can&#x27;t imagine using any other shampoo or conditioner now.</li>
            <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because it&#x27;s pretty pricey.  </li>
            <li>I returned it because it made my hair get super dry and tangled!</li>
            <li>At the end of the day I don&#x27;t feel like it does any more or less than the American Crew did</li>
            <li>after 3 or 4 uses my scalp is almost healed completely.</li>
            <li>this seemed old.</li>
            <li>this shampoo makes the body of my hair really soft-</li>
            <li>I was going back and forth between Dove Intense Repair and Matrix moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just shampoo, Not the old Tea Tree that you can feel the tingle.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, there it was and slightly cheaper!  </li>
            <li>The only negative comment I have is that I was hoping it would be better at dandruff control.  </li>
            <li>Left hair very soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely short, but seems as soft as if I&#x27;ve used Pantene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, not great like I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>I have a very dry and thick hair and it makes my hair very soft and smooth, which remains like that throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Small, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This shampoo/conditioner did a much better job than the previous shampoos I&#x27;ve used, but the smell was really strong and... just smelled bad.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered from dry scalp/dandruff for a while now and my old hairdresser recommended head and shoulders which didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Took my hair a little bit to get used to it, but now my hair is soft and it&#x27;s one of the only shampoos that my hair will still stay soft with after a bottle!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now, and I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> it is definitely a gender neutral smell and is very strong.</li>
            <li> Smelled nice but made my hair feel dry and brittle...</li>
            <li> Very much hydrating</li>
            <li> Just be aware 10.1 ounces is about the size of a soda can.</li>
            <li> Would love a different earthy scent</li>
            <li> , that would be a bit more womanly</li>
            <li> I had tried the organix line and my hair felt dry, ratty and knotted very easily.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this for any men interested in taking better care of themselves, it can certainly be a bit pricier, but you&#x27;ll see and feel a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many that always leave my hair feeling oily and flat.</li>
            <li> i have pretty healthy hair, but it would actually look worse (fly aways) after using the conditioner.</li>
            <li> but it is a little more accessible to me which prompted the switch.  </li>
            <li> I have had trouble getting the perfect conditioner that is just right, not to heavy to leave greasy but not too light to feel like I need a major de-tangler.</li>
            <li> smells relaxing and makes my hair feel super clean without it feeling too dry.</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo, plus conditioner of course, that actually leaves my scalp AND hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Disliked the strong smell and it gave no tingly feeling as the original Tea Tree.</li>
            <li> Hope that the same deal is available when I need a refill.</li>
            <li> I really like the shampoo, it is adds a lot of volume.  </li>
            <li> My gf uses this stuff and it works really well.</li>
            <li> cleans and conditions very well.</li>
            <li> too much money for the size.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have this much dryness when using drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not real crazy about the scent, pretty overpowering, but I can live with it for a healthier scalp.</li>
            <li> I have much better result with other brands.</li>
            <li> Smells good tho but not good for my hair.</li>
            <li> After blow drying it after the first use it felt SO soft and</li>
            <li> I have a new scalp!</li>
            <li> Jack Black may be a better value (never thought I could write that).</li>
            <li> I found a Sports Clips and ended up trying this particular product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone</li>
            <li> bought shampoos and conditioners and high quality ones.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, but I felt little to no &amp;#34;tingleing&amp;#34; sensation.</li>
            <li> It was so strong that I washed my hair with other shampoo three times before it went away.</li>
            <li> This worked really well and made my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Really makes my hair feel soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner I will buy, and am pleased to see that Amazon offers the gigantic refill sizes for future orders.</li>
            <li> I wish I could return this because I completely wasted $30 that could have been put towards a better product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shampoo, but not great.</li>
            <li> So, when my husband and I moved and I had to switch salons, my new hairdresser recommended the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree line.</li>
            <li> I never spend this much on shampoo and conditioner but this stuff is well worth the price, can&#x27;t imagine using any other shampoo or conditioner now.</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because it&#x27;s pretty pricey.  </li>
            <li> I returned it because it made my hair get super dry and tangled!</li>
            <li> At the end of the day I don&#x27;t feel like it does any more or less than the American Crew did</li>
            <li> after 3 or 4 uses my scalp is almost healed completely.</li>
            <li> this seemed old.</li>
            <li> this shampoo makes the body of my hair really soft-</li>
            <li> I was going back and forth between Dove Intense Repair and Matrix moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just shampoo, Not the old Tea Tree that you can feel the tingle.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, there it was and slightly cheaper!  </li>
            <li> The only negative comment I have is that I was hoping it would be better at dandruff control.  </li>
            <li> Left hair very soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely short, but seems as soft as if I&#x27;ve used Pantene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, not great like I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> I have a very dry and thick hair and it makes my hair very soft and smooth, which remains like that throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Small, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner did a much better job than the previous shampoos I&#x27;ve used, but the smell was really strong and... just smelled bad.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from dry scalp/dandruff for a while now and my old hairdresser recommended head and shoulders which didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Took my hair a little bit to get used to it, but now my hair is soft and it&#x27;s one of the only shampoos that my hair will still stay soft with after a bottle!</li>
            <li> Read the fine print, these look like the big bottles sold in salon, but in fact are very small and not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend for the dry scalp/dandruff sufferers.</li>
            <li> My hair usually goes through a bottle of shampoo and conditioner being soft then as soon as I start the second bottle</li>
            <li> I have had itchy dry scaly scalp almost forever.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a single flake.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the price, it&#x27;s the same quality as a $4 drugstore bottle.</li>
            <li> For those people who are wary of buying it I would say buy the smaller bottle first.</li>
            <li> I have problem scalp, very dry and itchy and flakey.....</li>
            <li> I also have thick, curly hair and this leaves my curls soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair felt like straw after, and I had to add extra oil to it just to tame it.</li>
            <li> with that said, I don&#x27;t know how it affects other hair types.</li>
            <li> I found out there were other versions I decided to give Lavender Mint a try.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with itchy scalp or allergies to other hair  products.</li>
            <li> I could have picked this up at the store, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from other shampoo.</li>
            <li> If Paul Mitchell could find a way to tone down the lavender smell, I would consider repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I typically like Paul Mitchel products</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair everyday so even though my ends are a little damaged</li>
            <li> Everything I tried would either do nothing for my scalp, or help with my scalp but destroy my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it one star for the way it dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Also my scalp got really dried out and flaky.</li>
            <li> So it could be possible I received an outdated product.</li>
            <li> This lavendar scented version is milder than the plain tea tree version.  </li>
            <li> for 2 small bottles, it&#x27;s not worth trying!</li>
            <li> I ORDER A SMALL SIZE</li>
            <li> I bought this small pack</li>
            <li> feeling that mint usually leaves...</li>
            <li> and I used Paul Mitchell products in the past.</li>
            <li> It is not relaxing at all like lavender usually is.</li>
            <li> The bottles are small</li>
            <li> i know, i am completely lazy :</li>
            <li> AT LEAST I</li>
            <li> I do have lots and lots of hair, and it&#x27;s thick...</li>
            <li> ...too expensive and not worth it......</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that it is difficult to tame.  </li>
            <li> not a good shampoo for your hair.  </li>
            <li> Once again this is a product which is very hard to find where I&#x27;m located.</li>
            <li> and it is almost broken</li>
            <li> and I was tired of my dove shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> i snot bad compared to other online outlets</li>
            <li> Expensive though.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> And although it may seem silly, for the price I paid</li>
            <li> No tingling, smells weird and not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the ingredients, stupidly, and failed to see that there are sulfates in the shampoo.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m already feeling like it was a bad decision.....</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both agree that this is the WORST smelling shampoo ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was looking for this product for quite sometime. Great to find it here at this price.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo, plus conditioner of course, that actually leaves my scalp AND hair feeling clean. I&#x27;ve tried so many that always leave my hair feeling oily and flat. I do have lots and lots of hair, and it&#x27;s thick... with that said, I don&#x27;t know how it affects other hair types.</li>
            <li> I loved the original Tea Tree Mint products from Paul Mitchell. From the smell to the tingle in the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;When I found out there were other versions I decided to give Lavender Mint a try. I was a bit disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fine but feels synthetic. There is no tingle or cooling of the scalp which is my biggest issue.&lt;br /&gt;I buy the originals for the cooling effect since I do have a skin/scalp condition.&lt;br /&gt;So based on those two issues alone I feel like I&#x27;m using a product I could find at the local store for under $10 that I&#x27;m paying $30 for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Paul Mitchell&#x27;s credit, the bottle does say it is only guaranteed when bought from select saloon dealers. So it could be possible I received an outdated product.</li>
            <li> I love the combination of tea tree and lavender in the summer. I will enjoy using these on my hair.</li>
            <li> Read the fine print, these look like the big bottles sold in salon, but in fact are very small and not worth the price.  The product is great, but I thought I was getting the large bottles for this price!</li>
            <li> It smells great, makes your hair feel like silk, and repairs and moisturizes without leaving your hair greasy. I definitely recommend this for all hair types.</li>
            <li> not a good shampoo for your hair.  try something else.  I have much better result with other brands.</li>
            <li> Great scent! Expensive though. Jack Black may be a better value (never thought I could write that).</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. ONLY TOOK AWAY 1 STAR BECAUSE THE CONDITIONER LEAKED DURING TRANSIT.</li>
            <li> I never spend this much on shampoo and conditioner but this stuff is well worth the price, can&#x27;t imagine using any other shampoo or conditioner now.</li>
            <li> Exceeds my expectations,. Leaves my hair soft  shiny and smelling good</li>
            <li> This worked really well and made my hair soft and shiny.  The only negative comment I have is that I was hoping it would be better at dandruff control.  For me personally this didn&#x27;t work in that area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I was actually looking for tea tree only. It smells nice just nothing special.</li>
            <li> Disliked the strong smell and it gave no tingly feeling as the original Tea Tree.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this stuff smells amazing leaves hair clean and soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, not great like I was expecting.  It doesn&#x27;t make my scalp tingle or anything.  It&#x27;s a good shampoo, but not great.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this shampoo.  It does an excellent job, and makes my hair look and feel great.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because it&#x27;s pretty pricey.  I used to just use your basic off the shelf shampoo and was of the impression that shampoo is shampoo.  I was wrong.  I don&#x27;t mind paying more for a better product, and that&#x27;s exactly what this is.  Cheers.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. The bottles were smaller than I thought they&#x27;d be but it&#x27;s a great hair product that smells so calming.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both agree that this is the WORST smelling shampoo ever. It leaves my hair smelling like mildew--supposed to pass for lavender I guess. I typically like Paul Mitchel products but I can&#x27;t stand how this makes my hair smell.</li>
            <li> Love these products! They are great for my hair and the scent wonderful and very relaxing.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Just received this two piece product today and was excited to try it!  However, I&#x27;m already feeling like it was a bad decision.....the cardboard band that holds the two products together states that the duo is &amp;#34;2 for $20&amp;#34; ......so why was I charged $25.99???  I feel ripped-off!</li>
            <li> I have had itchy dry scaly scalp almost forever. With one shampoo (and conditioner) the scales started disappearing. after 3 or 4 uses my scalp is almost healed completely. I&#x27;m not real crazy about the scent, pretty overpowering, but I can live with it for a healthier scalp. I would recommend this product to anyone with itchy scalp or allergies to other hair  products.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Smells great. Feels great. You should buy this! Just be aware 10.1 ounces is about the size of a soda can. Small, but worth every penny. I was struggling with dandruff. Bought Nizoral, which I use every 3 days, combined with this shampoo and conditioner and the results are amazing. I have a new scalp! Plus they smell great and my hair is so soft. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I just purchased the Lavender shampoo and conditioner and the hair and body moisturizer on Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the scents and seems to do a gees job cleaning my hair.  My hair is extremely short, but seems as soft as if I&#x27;ve used Pantene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will know more after longer use</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  It leaves my hair soft and shinny and I love the smell !!!!  I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> Not at Genuine Product Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> I felt immediate results after one use...my hair and scalp felt moisturized.  The scent isn&#x27;t overpowering either - even my husband likes it.</li>
            <li> loved it!!!! smells relaxing and makes my hair feel super clean without it feeling too dry. i love the smell of lavender!!!</li>
            <li> The tea tree was not that strong. I have used this product before and it was much better this seemed old.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars, because it works as shampoo and conditioner should. I use the Lemon Sage version of this, and it is phenomenal. I decided to try this one out. It&#x27;s scent is so incredibly strong, I couldn&#x27;t stand it. It was so strong that I washed my hair with other shampoo three times before it went away. The lemon sage version&#x27;s conditioner works much better as well. I will not order this again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has worked well for me and I had originally purchased it from a student at the Paul Mitchell School.  When I ran out I thought I&#x27;d see if I could find it on Amazon.  Sure enough, there it was and slightly cheaper!  This makes it convenient for me.</li>
            <li> This is the highest quality shampoo and conditioner I have ever found.  Absolutely love it.  Leaves my hair soft and silky and wonderfully lavender scented, with no tangles or static in our dry Wisconsin winters.  This is the only shampoo and conditioner I will buy, and am pleased to see that Amazon offers the gigantic refill sizes for future orders.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry and thick hair and it makes my hair very soft and smooth, which remains like that throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Very much hydrating and it adds shine to my hair. It has  a lovely lavender smell. Highly recommended to anyone</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good &amp; works so good.  I love Paul Mitchell.  :)</li>
            <li> I was hoping for larger bottles.  I was trying to judge the size off of the ones I already had at home.  I wanted to buy the liter size but none of them qualified for prime.</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels. It is so shiny and manageable. Would definitely recommend this shampoo and conditioner to anyone. Hair smells good too.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!! IT SMEILL AWESOME!! I ORDER A SMALL SIZE AND I WISH I ORDERED A LARGER ONE!! AT LEAST I I KNOW WHERE TO ORDER MORE :)</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are delicious.  I was introduced to them at my hair dressers and bought some myself.  I have had trouble getting the perfect conditioner that is just right, not to heavy to leave greasy but not too light to feel like I need a major de-tangler. These smell great and feel great on.  I just ordered another duo and will repurchase in the future.  Safe for hair that is colored!!!! Ahhhhh....</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dry scalp/dandruff for a while now and my old hairdresser recommended head and shoulders which didn&#x27;t work. So, when my husband and I moved and I had to switch salons, my new hairdresser recommended the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree line. I bought some from the salon (which is a Paul Mitchell/Redken salon) and after the first use I could tell it made a difference! I also have thick, curly hair and this leaves my curls soft and manageable. I love the smell as well! Would definitely recommend for the dry scalp/dandruff sufferers.</li>
            <li> I like the product,, I wish the shampoo bottle could be like the aconditioner bottle easy to pump out. I have to squize it and it is almost broken</li>
            <li> When I was in the Navy, I got my haircut at a salon one time simply because nothing else was around where I was stationed.  In conversing with one of the stylists we got to talking about hair and she educated me on the difference between low quality store bought shampoos and conditioners and high quality ones.  I picked up some American Crew brand name shampoo and conditioner and never looked back, it felt amazing on my scalp and got rid of the buildup from lower quality products.  I used American Crew for years until I recently moved to Maryland.  I found a Sports Clips and ended up trying this particular product.  At the end of the day I don&#x27;t feel like it does any more or less than the American Crew did but it is a little more accessible to me which prompted the switch.  I definitely recommend this for any men interested in taking better care of themselves, it can certainly be a bit pricier, but you&#x27;ll see and feel a difference.</li>
            <li> Really makes my hair feel soft and conditioned. Love the shampoo and conditioner, but the scent seems a bit manly. Would love a different earthy scent, that would be a bit more womanly</li>
            <li> Took my hair a little bit to get used to it, but now my hair is soft and it&#x27;s one of the only shampoos that my hair will still stay soft with after a bottle! My hair usually goes through a bottle of shampoo and conditioner being soft then as soon as I start the second bottle my hair gets yucky again. I straighten my hair everyday so even though my ends are a little damaged this shampoo makes the body of my hair really soft- I love it! I bought this small pack so I can take it with me when I travel and leave my giant bottles at home!</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time... However, the lids were not properly fastened therefore had shampoo and conditioner everywhere when I opened it. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed and wanted and at a great price. Hope that the same deal is available when I need a refill.</li>
            <li> I really like the shampoo, it is adds a lot of volume.  The conditioner is fine as well and smells lovey but if I had to choose one it would be the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  What I don&#x27;t like is the shipping charges that are attached when ordering online.</li>
            <li> Always loved it. This is the third time I buy this set of shampoo and conditioner. Never regretted.</li>
            <li> My daughter LOVES the smell and it leaves her hair shiny and smooth...all while hopefully keeping those pesky school lice out!!!</li>
            <li> feeling that mint usually leaves...and it&#x27;s a bit pricey. i understand it&#x27;s paul mitchell but i recommend just getting the generic version from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This was not that great.....did not smell very good, have smelled better shampoes and they were  alot cheaper...too expensive and not worth it......</li>
            <li> Comes quickly and makes my hair feel and smell so good!!</li>
            <li> I bought this one because I couldn&#x27;t find the mint tea tree. I thought it would still have a minty smell. But the lavender smell is so dominant I cannot smell the mint at all and it leaves me smelling like lavender all day. If Paul Mitchell could find a way to tone down the lavender smell, I would consider repurchasing. Until then, I am going to stick to the tea tree mint.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!!! Clean fragrance at a great price!!! Tea tree and lavender has a soothing and calming effect on the senses!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great. I have problem scalp, very dry and itchy and flakey.....this shampoo helps. Tremendously. Thank you. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My gf uses this stuff and it works really well. Her hair is very healthy and shiny and smells great too.</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of this product. Left hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I was looking for new shampoo and conditioner and the ratings on this seemed to be good and I used Paul Mitchell products in the past. I was going back and forth between Dove Intense Repair and Matrix moisturizing. I like this product a lot and the smell has definitely grown on me. it is definitely a gender neutral smell and is very strong. I think some people probably won&#x27;t like it because it is so different from the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; scented shampoos and conditioners. For those people who are wary of buying it I would say buy the smaller bottle first.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my daughter-really controls the dandruff.  This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve bought it.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that it is difficult to tame.  This shampoo/conditioner did a much better job than the previous shampoos I&#x27;ve used, but the smell was really strong and... just smelled bad.  It bothered me all day and aggravated my allergies.  If you&#x27;re not sensitive to scents, I&#x27;d say this would be a good buy for you, otherwise, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Smelled nice but made my hair feel dry and brittle...wouldn&#x27;t reorder</li>
            <li> this is a really great product!  cleans and conditions very well.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. I returned it because it made my hair get super dry and tangled! Didn&#x27;t mosturize at all! Smells good tho but not good for my hair.</li>
            <li> really isn&#x27;t any better than the 99 cent brands.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this product. I feel like I am just leaving the spa after I use it! :) 5 stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an itchy, scaly, flaky scalp for years and tried everything under the sun to treat it, including prescription shampoos with no luck. Everything I tried would either do nothing for my scalp, or help with my scalp but destroy my hair. Until now! This shampoo and conditioner is the answer to my prayers. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now, and I noticed a difference right away. My scalp feels so much better, flakes have diminished significantly, and my hair looks and feels smooth and beautiful. It also smells wonderful, fresh and clean. Not overpowering, just really nice. I will not be using anything else on my hair!! Thank you Paul Mitchell!</li>
            <li> I could have picked this up at the store, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from other shampoo.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and leaves my hair very soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I was recently on a shampoo hunt. I have long, thick hair and I was tired of my dove shampoo/conditioner. I had tried the organix line and my hair felt dry, ratty and knotted very easily. I read good things about this on some forum online and decided to try it out. I will say the smell is strong, but I love it. And my hair? After blow drying it after the first use it felt SO soft and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping - the bottles leaked. I know that it why they packaged it in a saran wrap type but it still leaked. And although it may seem silly, for the price I paid I don&#x27;t want to lose an ounce of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price - the price here i snot bad compared to other online outlets but now that I know I like it I will buy the bigger quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a hair makeover, try this out!</li>
            <li> I have a flaky scalp...even in the summer.  I&#x27;ve tried every &amp;#34;dandruff&amp;#34; shampoo until now.  I don&#x27;t have a single flake.  This lavendar scented version is milder than the plain tea tree version.  I actually like the &amp;#34;chill&amp;#34; of the original better, but this is fabulous.</li>
            <li> The shampoo makes my hair feel nice, but the lavender is a bit overwhelming....gives me a headache...I&#x27;m sitting here typing this smelling the scent of lavender surrounding me. I like that the smell stays for a while, just not this smell and not this strong. It is not relaxing at all like lavender usually is.</li>
            <li> Works well, but the conditioner has too strong a scent for me. But the products are very soothing to a dry itchy scalp, so I use them happily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just shampoo, Not the old Tea Tree that you can feel the tingle. I guess it&#x27;s time to move on.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it seems to add volume to my heair, and I like the fragrence, it is different.</li>
            <li> Once again this is a product which is very hard to find where I&#x27;m located. I love Paul Mitchell&#x27;s line of prducts and your prices are great!</li>
            <li> too much money for the size. The bottles are small</li>
            <li> I wanted something that made your head tingle. This isn&#x27;t it!!! No tingling, smells weird and not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> running out of shampoo/conditioner i decided to order this on a whim. with amazon prime i can get anything in a couple days and it beat a trip to the drugstore. i know, i am completely lazy :-/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i thought this would have more of a tingling sensation; it doesn&#x27;t feel refreshing. moreover, it does NOT moisturize my hair. AT ALL. i have pretty healthy hair, but it would actually look worse (fly aways) after using the conditioner. the scent took me a while to get used to - i felt i smelled like a man. for 2 small bottles, it&#x27;s not worth trying!</li>
            <li> the smell was to strong, the lavander and mint clashed to much. i could smell it through the package before opening the package. i did return it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try out this duo. I love Paul Mitchell&#x27;s line and for the first time since using his products for 6 years I&#x27;m incredibly disappointed. I didn&#x27;t read the ingredients, stupidly, and failed to see that there are sulfates in the shampoo. Any girl knows that sulfates are like moisture vacuums for your hair. Though the shampoo claims to be moisturizing, it is just the opposite. I didn&#x27;t even have this much dryness when using drugstore brands. The smell is great, the conditioner is smoothing, but the shampoo ruins the experience for me. It&#x27;s not worth the price, it&#x27;s the same quality as a $4 drugstore bottle. I wish I could return this because I completely wasted $30 that could have been put towards a better product. 10/10 would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product&lt;br /&gt;Worth the expence</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but I felt little to no &amp;#34;tingleing&amp;#34; sensation. I&#x27;m giving it one star for the way it dried out my hair. My hair felt like straw after, and I had to add extra oil to it just to tame it. Also my scalp got really dried out and flaky. Not impressed. My daughter used it and her scalp got flaky from it too.</li>
