            <li>If you want your polish to stay on longer this is the best product on the market...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>It is the best!!</li>
            <li>It would be perfect for you if you used darker polish</li>
            <li>It works great to prevent chipping.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>love it!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li>Creative makes some of the best polishes today.  </li>
            <li>OPI Bond Aid a good alternative</li>
            <li>Good luck all.</li>
            <li>Makes doing your nails at home as good as going to the salon.  </li>
            <li>Thought I would test this out with all of the good reviews it got.  </li>
            <li>and if you sandwich it, even without a top coat it lasts for 5 days without chips!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>My manicure has lasted more than a week!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I am, again, impressed at how smooth, shiny, long-lasting, and strong my nail polish has been since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>It lasted quite nicely for over a week.  </li>
            <li>As someone who does her own nails all the time, I swear by the stuff.</li>
            <li>altho i haven&#x27;t tried sandwiching AND top coat, so results might be even better!  </li>
            <li>Try to apply your nail polish while stickey is still drying, it adheres to the nail polish more effectively.  </li>
            <li>Stickey used to be a great product, but then they changed the bottles and I am 100% certain, the formula.</li>
            <li>However it did not work for my fingernails, under two coats of polish, and one coat of top coat.  </li>
            <li>I get the most compliments</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 2 years and love it.</li>
            <li>and i like having top coat to make the polish shinier.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried Stickey.  </li>
            <li>them laid out on a towel, and hope for the best when I wake up the next day.  </li>
            <li>With this product and the CND Shiney Top Coat, I don&#x27;t wake up with \\&quot;bed</li>
            <li>I ordered it on line because I could not find it in the stores any more.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love, love, love CND products.</li>
            <li>I love it and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>Save your money, there are better basecoats out there.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Came through the mail so much faster than I thought it would - safely packaged and sent - great product.</li>
            <li>Love this polish</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d still buy this again if I don&#x27;t come across anything even better.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll probably have better results.</li>
            <li>This combined with the top coat</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty good on my toenails, because I&#x27;m in the water a lot.  </li>
            <li>Great for undercoat on natural nails</li>
            <li>it is so good and my polish stays on much longer</li>
            <li>As for CND Stickey, I don&#x27;t like the brush, and the tips of my polish rubbed off very quickly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so easy to just touch up.</li>
            <li>It works fine as a basecoat.</li>
            <li>I have not tried Stickey with another brand of top coat--just the Super Shiney.  </li>
            <li>I give it as Christmas gifts and every woman who&#x27;s tried it, loves it and says Stickey makes a huge difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>relatively cheap</li>
            <li>Fabulous products.  </li>
            <li>I discovered CND when I was given a free sample of their polish.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, not base coat can survive dishpan soaked hands.</li>
            <li>great product works better than expected</li>
            <li>First screen and search screen is for Sticky Basecoat by Creative,</li>
            <li>Apply one coat of Stickey to clean nails.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of basic coats and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>In combination with the creative nail UV topcoat (which doesn&#x27;t really need UV to cure), this extends my pedicure to a week without any chips.  </li>
            <li>This really does help to maintain your nail polish for a week or more.  </li>
            <li>My nail polish stayed on for 7 full days two weeks in a row.  </li>
            <li>Gave what was left of my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; bottle to a friend who I&#x27;m sure will love it.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly &amp; was packaged well.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>after I freshly painted my nails.  </li>
            <li>You will have to apply a clear top coat to seal it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Six days ago I got a manicure and it still looks fresh.  </li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t worth the time and hassle.</li>
            <li>knowing the right hand always chips first.</li>
            <li>This really makes the polish stick!</li>
            <li>Like really stick on!</li>
            <li>in fact, my polish chips within three days, consistently.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It also REALLY works the way it says it will!</li>
            <li>I used the same top coat on each.</li>
            <li>Very misleading product display!  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t dry, it smells very strong and the polish you put on to cover it won&#x27;t stick and leaves uncovered spots on your nail.  </li>
            <li>when I wear, let&#x27;s say, Bright Yellow, and I&#x27;m wearing No yellow.</li>
            <li>and this is the only one that I can get at least 5 days of flawless looking nails.</li>
            <li>I used my old favorite on my left hand and this on my right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty hard on my hands (I&#x27;m a radiologic technologist), so for me, a week is good.  </li>
            <li>(The best is China Glaze Strong Adhesion Base Coat.)</li>
            <li>My nails chip very quickly, so I&#x27;m always looking for the best base coat I can to help remedy that.</li>
            <li>I am using this in conjunction with CND&#x27;s Super Shiney Top Coat, which a lot of people don&#x27;t seem to like--but it works great for me with CND Stickey Base Coat.    </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and makes my polish last.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>This product really, really helps.    </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just how much my polish have been chipping.  </li>
            <li>I expected it to hold the tips of the nail polish better</li>
            <li>Stickey works just as it says it will and really does keep polish from chipping.  </li>
            <li>I was actually going to give up polishing them except for special occasions.</li>
            <li>No matter what top coat I tried, they would just bubble, wear off easily, not dry quickly enough, etc.  </li>
            <li>It even lasts this long with cheap nail polish and wearing sandals or going bare-foot every day.</li>
            <li>The gal that gave specific direction for the application of stickey was correct, those direction were true to a tee.  </li>
            <li>But when I gave my manicurist the Stickey Base coat to use along with the Opi top coat, the salon polish lasted perfectly for an entire week.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for YEARS for this particular product.  </li>
            <li>This little blue bottle is full of magic.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>But when it&#x27;s time to start fresh, let your nails \\&quot;breathe\\&quot; for a couple days, naked, with nothing on them.</li>
            <li>after you get so far along in the purchase, at the end, you see this different looking package and think it must be a new package because it says Creative Sticky and this bottle shows the big C at the end of purchase.  </li>
            <li>My manicure with the new bottle purchased here, I cannot claim similar success...</li>
            <li>the right hand out lasted the left by 2 days.</li>
            <li>My new trick is to just repair, remove polish, start over, with just the one or two nails at a time that are showing signs of chipping/wearing.</li>
            <li>I need to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>When my nails DO \\&quot;chip\\&quot;, it&#x27;s like a whole big section wants to peel off.</li>
            <li>I gave only 4 stars because I use light polish, and often there is a blue cast from the Stickey.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely the best base coat I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>My first manicure using &#x27;stickey&#x27; lasted 8 days before I noticed two tiny chips.  </li>
            <li>I polished my nails this past Friday and have been touching them up since.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s clear and dries really fast, so by the time you get to the end of painting your second hand, you&#x27;re ready to start putting on the polish.</li>
            <li>It keeps your polish on for way longer than any other basecoast, dries quickly, and keeps polish from bleeding into my nails.</li>
            <li>For anybody who isn&#x27;t hard on their nails, this would probably work much better for them.</li>
            <li>I discovered this when I had my nails professionally manicured.</li>
            <li>Mind you, I am a very ungraceful lady and slap around my nails against every surface possible</li>
            <li>I have finger nails so soft that the nails bend and</li>
            <li>This product is the only one on the market that really works to protect your nails and help your polish stay on.</li>
            <li>I noticed the bottle was different from my old Creative Stickey bottle and because it&#x27;s the same name and same company, I assumed it was the same product.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the CND Stickey Base, along with their tip coat and have been very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Best base coat ever.</li>
            <li>I got hooked on using Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat because it not only dried my nails in under two minutes it kept my polish for about 5-6 days w/o chipping.  </li>
            <li>Another trick for chipping nails is extending your manicure life by applying red or black Shatter Polish or fine Glitter Polish over your original color for a few days</li>
            <li>Out of all the base coat products I have tried, CND Stickey is second best.</li>
            <li>Also, my favorite OPI Bubble Bath takes on a silvery, strange kind of color when using Stickey base coat.    </li>
            <li>The base coat does go on smoothly and since I generally average ONE day for having great nails without any chips</li>
            <li>Maybe the next type of polish I use will work under this Nail Stickey because right now, I feel like I wasted my money on something that should work because it cost so high.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not careful in using my hands, so I blamed it on that.</li>
            <li>I am most unhappy about this because I need to find the large bottle to purchase.  </li>
            <li>Put a coat of clear on that morning, same thing the next morning.</li>
            <li>this base coat is good in that it really DOES help with longer lasting nail polishes.</li>
            <li>It makes your polish stay on much, much longer, with less chipping, and two of my friends say it&#x27;s also made their nails stronger, and their nails are the longest they&#x27;ve ever been.</li>

            <li> I am using this in conjunction with CND&#x27;s Super Shiney Top Coat, which a lot of people don&#x27;t seem to like--but it works great for me with CND Stickey Base Coat.    </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and makes my polish last.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> This product really, really helps.    </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just how much my polish have been chipping.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to hold the tips of the nail polish better</li>
            <li> Stickey works just as it says it will and really does keep polish from chipping.  </li>
            <li> I was actually going to give up polishing them except for special occasions.</li>
            <li> No matter what top coat I tried, they would just bubble, wear off easily, not dry quickly enough, etc.  </li>
            <li> It even lasts this long with cheap nail polish and wearing sandals or going bare-foot every day.</li>
            <li> The gal that gave specific direction for the application of stickey was correct, those direction were true to a tee.  </li>
            <li> But when I gave my manicurist the Stickey Base coat to use along with the Opi top coat, the salon polish lasted perfectly for an entire week.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for YEARS for this particular product.  </li>
            <li> This little blue bottle is full of magic.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> But when it&#x27;s time to start fresh, let your nails \\&quot;breathe\\&quot; for a couple days, naked, with nothing on them.</li>
            <li> after you get so far along in the purchase, at the end, you see this different looking package and think it must be a new package because it says Creative Sticky and this bottle shows the big C at the end of purchase.  </li>
            <li> My manicure with the new bottle purchased here, I cannot claim similar success...</li>
            <li> the right hand out lasted the left by 2 days.</li>
            <li> My new trick is to just repair, remove polish, start over, with just the one or two nails at a time that are showing signs of chipping/wearing.</li>
            <li> I need to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> When my nails DO \\&quot;chip\\&quot;, it&#x27;s like a whole big section wants to peel off.</li>
            <li> I gave only 4 stars because I use light polish, and often there is a blue cast from the Stickey.  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely the best base coat I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> My first manicure using &#x27;stickey&#x27; lasted 8 days before I noticed two tiny chips.  </li>
            <li> I polished my nails this past Friday and have been touching them up since.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s clear and dries really fast, so by the time you get to the end of painting your second hand, you&#x27;re ready to start putting on the polish.</li>
            <li> It keeps your polish on for way longer than any other basecoast, dries quickly, and keeps polish from bleeding into my nails.</li>
            <li> For anybody who isn&#x27;t hard on their nails, this would probably work much better for them.</li>
            <li> I discovered this when I had my nails professionally manicured.</li>
            <li> Mind you, I am a very ungraceful lady and slap around my nails against every surface possible</li>
            <li> I have finger nails so soft that the nails bend and</li>
            <li> This product is the only one on the market that really works to protect your nails and help your polish stay on.</li>
            <li> I noticed the bottle was different from my old Creative Stickey bottle and because it&#x27;s the same name and same company, I assumed it was the same product.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the CND Stickey Base, along with their tip coat and have been very happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Best base coat ever.</li>
            <li> I got hooked on using Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat because it not only dried my nails in under two minutes it kept my polish for about 5-6 days w/o chipping.  </li>
            <li> Another trick for chipping nails is extending your manicure life by applying red or black Shatter Polish or fine Glitter Polish over your original color for a few days</li>
            <li> Out of all the base coat products I have tried, CND Stickey is second best.</li>
            <li> Also, my favorite OPI Bubble Bath takes on a silvery, strange kind of color when using Stickey base coat.    </li>
            <li> The base coat does go on smoothly and since I generally average ONE day for having great nails without any chips</li>
            <li> Maybe the next type of polish I use will work under this Nail Stickey because right now, I feel like I wasted my money on something that should work because it cost so high.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not careful in using my hands, so I blamed it on that.</li>
            <li> I am most unhappy about this because I need to find the large bottle to purchase.  </li>
            <li> Put a coat of clear on that morning, same thing the next morning.</li>
            <li> this base coat is good in that it really DOES help with longer lasting nail polishes.</li>
            <li> It makes your polish stay on much, much longer, with less chipping, and two of my friends say it&#x27;s also made their nails stronger, and their nails are the longest they&#x27;ve ever been.</li>
            <li> Creative Nail Design Stickey base coat really works!  </li>
            <li> the next day from nails that didn&#x27;t dry quickly enough.    </li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t last quite as long.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised when I took it out of the packaging because it is not the bottle you see here.  </li>
            <li> I compared what little bit I had left from my former purchase, which I purchased from a local retailer in town about a year ago, and my manicure did not budge for over a week - and that was the norm I had come to expect from this product.  </li>
            <li> and I used this a lot for a long time.</li>
            <li> but if you are a rough person like I am, it will still chip within 3/4 days, especially if you have longer nails.</li>
            <li> That fad didn&#x27;t last too long seeing that my Seche Vite is thicker than usual and my polish will peel either the same day or two days later.  </li>
            <li> I usually use gel polish, but the colors are so limited, and I had some new OPI polish to try.  </li>
            <li> I did my nails in the morning, so they had all day to dry.</li>
            <li> even a professional manicure usually lasts just a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many different base coats and this is the only one that keeps the nail polish on my nails.  </li>
            <li> Although it wasn&#x27;t a miracle cure to my nail chipping (I&#x27;m not sure if anything will ever be), it did help in preventing major chips.</li>
            <li> Great base coat!!</li>
            <li> so my nails get lots of rough treatment.</li>
            <li> usually with a normal OPI base coat, my nail polish chips within 2 days after 2 layers and an essie top coat.</li>
            <li> so I was on the look for something that would make it harder for them to peel.</li>
            <li> Nice base coat.</li>
            <li> Based on other Amazon reviews, I bought a little bottle of this product at my local Ulta.  </li>
            <li> Having a thin base is key to a nice application and long lasting wear.</li>
            <li> Nail polishes that had frustrated me previously have gone on smoothly, lasted a week (!).      </li>
            <li> Makes my nail polish job last at least twice as long!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I would NOT buy this product again due to cost.  </li>
            <li> I can only believe the product has changed and I am not pleased.  </li>
            <li> After color has mostly dried, I apply one coat of CND Air Dry topcoat.</li>
            <li> I typically do my nails before bed, let them dry a little, fall asleep with</li>
            <li> and I expect my polish to at least last 5 days w/o it chipping.  </li>
            <li> Joanie Rivers was my favorite base coat before I discovered stickey.</li>
            <li> I used the cnd base coat, then two coats of OPI, and then a top coat.  </li>
            <li> Love this base coat.  </li>
            <li> however i don&#x27;t usually do that because it takes longer to dry</li>
            <li> Does my manicure last a ridiculous length of time?</li>
            <li> This is important--while the Stickey is still slightly tacky, apply nail color (this helps it grab the polish)&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Nail polish stays on well past all of the other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this base coat.</li>
            <li> I always have had issues with my manicure chipping a day or two (or even a few hours)</li>
            <li> I had trouble with staining, ridges and chipping.</li>
            <li> I have tried OPI and Sally Hansen and with both I get chips in my polish after a few days.  </li>
            <li> I had a few nail polishes that would bubble and chip no matter what I did, even though they were from \\&quot;good\\&quot; polish companies like OPI.  </li>
            <li> I use my hands a lot; when I used my hands the way I do everyday, not a chip in sight.  </li>
            <li> It is a very odd shaped narrow bottle.</li>
            <li> It grabs your polish and hold on tight!</li>
            <li> Typically after just 1 or 2 coats of color, my finger nails have a thick goopy layer of nail product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the company has altered this formula, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as it used to.  </li>
            <li> It extends my manicure by a few days at least.</li>
            <li> It is not Creative Sticky Basecoat when you receive it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I dropped it and could not finish out what I waited for so long.  </li>
            <li> This base coat allowed polish to stay on my brittle nails for 6 days without chipping - Really unheard of in my little world!</li>
            <li> If you have kids in the house, there&#x27;s hardly time to keep one&#x27;s nails polished.  </li>
            <li> Never had a manicure stay so long!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> That aspect of this product is unbelievable!    </li>
            <li> Sadly, it fell out of my car the other day and broke so</li>
            <li> I like the thin consistency of this product, especially compared to my usual OPI base coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy about this at all.</li>
            <li> Next, I decided to try the Stickey base coat.</li>
            <li> My nail polish does last longer if I use this base coat</li>
            <li> When I had shorter nails, this base did allow my nail polish to last about a week without chipping</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t see how it makes it any &amp;#34;stickier&amp;#34; than other base coats out there.</li>
            <li> The price is way to expensive for the quantity.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m in the process of teaching myself how to do acrylic nails and my nail beds are a bit damaged</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the nail supply companies in my area don&#x27;t stock it.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> I was so sick of polish chipping off an hour after applying that I was doing research on investing in a uv dryer and soak off gel polishes.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> One thing is that it does not prevent the yellowing of nails &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> Sticky Base Coat.</li>
            <li> I use this base coat every time I apply my polish.  </li>
            <li> The stickey base coat is a dream for an at home manicure.  </li>
            <li> Because the polish is all stuck to the base coat?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every base coat on the market.</li>
            <li> This base coat has solved all those problems.</li>
            <li> to sandwich, you put this stickey base, then a layer of nail polish, then another layer of stickey base, then another layer of nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I start with one coat of a hydrating base and follow with the Stickey Base Coat, then apply my color.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every base coat on the market and nothing has worked.  </li>
            <li> I found this sticky base coat and decided to give it a chance.  </li>
            <li> The manicurist used Stickey Base Coat, an OPI nail color and an OPI topcoat.  </li>
            <li> The base coat helps to hold the polish and prevents chipping.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base coat, then a couple of coats of polish.</li>
            <li> I have been using Stickey Base Coat for a number of years.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended Stickey Base Coat to all of my friends.  </li>
            <li> It does the job as a base coat.</li>
            <li> I loooooove this base coat!</li>
            <li> This sticky base coat has lengthened my manicure and pedicure by twice the time I used to get before I started using it!  </li>
            <li> Worst ever basecoat.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this on my toenails and fingernails.  It worked pretty good on my toenails, because I&#x27;m in the water a lot.  However it did not work for my fingernails, under two coats of polish, and one coat of top coat.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Does my manicure last a ridiculous length of time? YES!! That aspect of this product is unbelievable!    Drawback:  polish never dries! I did my nails in the morning, so they had all day to dry. The next morning, marks in the polish. Put a coat of clear on that morning, same thing the next morning. Even several days later, you can still leave dents/creases if something presses into your nail. Also, my favorite OPI Bubble Bath takes on a silvery, strange kind of color when using Stickey base coat.    Worth a try. OPI Bond Aid a good alternative, doesn&#x27;t last quite as long.</li>
            <li> As for CND Stickey, I don&#x27;t like the brush, and the tips of my polish rubbed off very quickly. Out of all the base coat products I have tried, CND Stickey is second best. (The best is China Glaze Strong Adhesion Base Coat.)</li>
            <li> In combination with the creative nail UV topcoat (which doesn&#x27;t really need UV to cure), this extends my pedicure to a week without any chips.  It even lasts this long with cheap nail polish and wearing sandals or going bare-foot every day.</li>
            <li> Sticky Base Coat. This is the best basecoat ever, your polish WILL NOT peel or chip. It grabs your polish and hold on tight!</li>
            <li> I use this base coat every time I apply my polish.  It works great to prevent chipping.</li>
            <li> The stickey base coat is a dream for an at home manicure.  I always have had issues with my manicure chipping a day or two (or even a few hours) after I freshly painted my nails.  Creative Nail Design Stickey base coat really works!  I am going on day 5 and still no chips to be seen!</li>
            <li> I purchased the CND Stickey Base, along with their tip coat and have been very happy with my purchase.  It goes on smoothly and makes my polish last.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Polish just don&#x27;t stay without this...</li>
            <li> This little blue bottle is full of magic.  My first manicure using &#x27;stickey&#x27; lasted 8 days before I noticed two tiny chips.  Joanie Rivers was my favorite base coat before I discovered stickey. The gal that gave specific direction for the application of stickey was correct, those direction were true to a tee.  Try to apply your nail polish while stickey is still drying, it adheres to the nail polish more effectively.  Good luck all.</li>
            <li> yes, it works, but now that I&#x27;ve used it for a while, I&#x27;ve noticed something. When my nails DO \\&quot;chip\\&quot;, it&#x27;s like a whole big section wants to peel off. Because the polish is all stuck to the base coat? annnd.....take it off with a polish remover because if you chew bits and pieces off, you are left with gnarly looking nails. My new trick is to just repair, remove polish, start over, with just the one or two nails at a time that are showing signs of chipping/wearing. Instead of starting all over and doing ALL my nails when only a couple are chipped. And your color doesn&#x27;t have to match your clothes. I get the most compliments when I wear, let&#x27;s say, Bright Yellow, and I&#x27;m wearing No yellow. Another trick for chipping nails is extending your manicure life by applying red or black Shatter Polish or fine Glitter Polish over your original color for a few days so you don&#x27;t have to start all over. You will have to apply a clear top coat to seal it. But when it&#x27;s time to start fresh, let your nails \\&quot;breathe\\&quot; for a couple days, naked, with nothing on them. Rub some halved grapes over nails/cuticles. or maybe some olive oil, just before bed. Erase the ridges with an emery board. Polish them up with the \\&quot;shine\\&quot; option on your 4-way nail board.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every base coat on the market. I discovered this when I had my nails professionally manicured. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 years and love it. I had trouble with staining, ridges and chipping. This base coat has solved all those problems. I work retail so my nails get lots of rough treatment.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for YEARS for this particular product.  It&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; if you will, that keeps my nail polish from rubbing off or even chipping!  Gave what was left of my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; bottle to a friend who I&#x27;m sure will love it.  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> this base coat is good in that it really DOES help with longer lasting nail polishes. usually with a normal OPI base coat, my nail polish chips within 2 days after 2 layers and an essie top coat. however, this helps it up to 5 days! and if you sandwich it, even without a top coat it lasts for 5 days without chips!  to sandwich, you put this stickey base, then a layer of nail polish, then another layer of stickey base, then another layer of nail polish.  however i don&#x27;t usually do that because it takes longer to dry i think. and i like having top coat to make the polish shinier. altho i haven&#x27;t tried sandwiching AND top coat, so results might be even better!  relatively cheap and i&#x27;ve only seen it sold on amazon and salons.  One thing is that it does not prevent the yellowing of nails &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried Stickey.  I have tried OPI and Sally Hansen and with both I get chips in my polish after a few days.  my manicures now last 5-10 days!!!  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Creative makes some of the best polishes today.  Whether it be a basecoat, color or topcoat you cannot go wrong with Creative.</li>
            <li> I had a few nail polishes that would bubble and chip no matter what I did, even though they were from \\&quot;good\\&quot; polish companies like OPI.  No matter what top coat I tried, they would just bubble, wear off easily, not dry quickly enough, etc.  Based on other Amazon reviews, I bought a little bottle of this product at my local Ulta.  It is wonderful!  Nail polishes that had frustrated me previously have gone on smoothly, lasted a week (!).      NOTE:   1. I am using this in conjunction with CND&#x27;s Super Shiney Top Coat, which a lot of people don&#x27;t seem to like--but it works great for me with CND Stickey Base Coat.    2. I have not tried Stickey with another brand of top coat--just the Super Shiney.  3. I typically do my nails before bed, let them dry a little, fall asleep with them laid out on a towel, and hope for the best when I wake up the next day.  With this product and the CND Shiney Top Coat, I don&#x27;t wake up with \\&quot;bed nails\\&quot; (term stolen from another reviewer) the next day from nails that didn&#x27;t dry quickly enough.    4. I have not done any research into the ingredients.    If you have kids in the house, there&#x27;s hardly time to keep one&#x27;s nails polished.  This product really, really helps.    I am, again, impressed at how smooth, shiny, long-lasting, and strong my nail polish has been since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Does not keep polish on any longer.</li>
            <li> I tried this because of the Amazon reviews.  I usually use gel polish, but the colors are so limited, and I had some new OPI polish to try.  I used the cnd base coat, then two coats of OPI, and then a top coat.  It lasted quite nicely for over a week.  I&#x27;m pretty hard on my hands (I&#x27;m a radiologic technologist), so for me, a week is good.  If your job isn&#x27;t too demanding on your nails, it might last even longer.</li>
            <li> This really does help to maintain your nail polish for a week or more.  I start with one coat of a hydrating base and follow with the Stickey Base Coat, then apply my color.  Everything looks perfect with no chipping for up to 2 weeks, at which time you can start to notice your nail growing out.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have tried every base coat on the market and nothing has worked.  I was so sick of polish chipping off an hour after applying that I was doing research on investing in a uv dryer and soak off gel polishes.  I found this sticky base coat and decided to give it a chance.  Amazing.  My nail polish stayed on for 7 full days two weeks in a row.  Even after putting up a x-mas tree and decorating the house.  Not a chip to be seen.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time.  I ordered it on line because I could not find it in the stores any more.  I am most unhappy about this because I need to find the large bottle to purchase.  I would NOT buy this product again due to cost.  The price is way to expensive for the quantity.</li>
            <li> Six days ago I got a manicure and it still looks fresh.  The manicurist used Stickey Base Coat, an OPI nail color and an OPI topcoat.  Fabulous products.  Never had a manicure stay so long!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised when I took it out of the packaging because it is not the bottle you see here.  It is a very odd shaped narrow bottle. It works fine as a basecoat.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff. Makes my nail polish job last at least twice as long!</li>
            <li> Makes doing your nails at home as good as going to the salon.  I would definitely recommend this product!!  Both my daughter and daughter-in-law are hooked too.  :)</li>
            <li> Great base coat!! Polish doesn&#x27;t chip off anymore</li>
            <li> I loooooove this base coat! As someone who does her own nails all the time, I swear by the stuff. It keeps your polish on for way longer than any other basecoast, dries quickly, and keeps polish from bleeding into my nails. Sadly, it fell out of my car the other day and broke so I need to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t keep my nails from chipping.  Day 2 they chipped.</li>
            <li> I got hooked on using Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat because it not only dried my nails in under two minutes it kept my polish for about 5-6 days w/o chipping.  That fad didn&#x27;t last too long seeing that my Seche Vite is thicker than usual and my polish will peel either the same day or two days later.  Without using the Seche Vite my polish will last about 5 days without chipping.  Unfortunately I&#x27;m in the process of teaching myself how to do acrylic nails and my nail beds are a bit damaged so none of the polishes I use for my nails will stay on my nails w/o chipping for about 2 days.  I needed another alternative so I read up on this CND Nail Stickey and the reviews it came with.  I purchased 4 bottles from eBay and this is my second time using this and the polishes I used this time(Wet-n-Wild and Milani) don&#x27;t agree with this Nail Stickey.  I polished my nails this past Friday and have been touching them up since.  That&#x27;s just how much my polish have been chipping.  I&#x27;m not happy about this at all. I polish my nails every week and post the tutorials on Youtube and I expect my polish to at least last 5 days w/o it chipping.  Maybe the next type of polish I use will work under this Nail Stickey because right now, I feel like I wasted my money on something that should work because it cost so high.</li>
            <li> I discovered CND when I was given a free sample of their polish. I was hooked. Next, I decided to try the Stickey base coat. I love it! I *never* used to do my nails because they would end up chipping after 3 days. It just wasn&#x27;t worth the time and hassle. Now that I have discovered Stickey and CND, I do my nails about once every 10 days or so. The base coat helps to hold the polish and prevents chipping. After about 4-5 days, I may have a tiny, tiny chip on the end of a nail but it&#x27;s so easy to just touch up. Here&#x27;s how I use Stickey:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Buff my nails to remove ridges.&lt;br /&gt;2) Apply one coat of Stickey to clean nails.&lt;br /&gt;3) This is important--while the Stickey is still slightly tacky, apply nail color (this helps it grab the polish)&lt;br /&gt;4) After color has mostly dried, I apply one coat of CND Air Dry topcoat. I start with my thumb and by the time I reach my pinky, the thumb is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it and my nails look great! Love, love, love CND products. I now use this brand over OPI.</li>
            <li> This is a WONDERFUL product. It makes your polish stay on much, much longer, with less chipping, and two of my friends say it&#x27;s also made their nails stronger, and their nails are the longest they&#x27;ve ever been. I use it as a base coat, then a couple of coats of polish. I give it as Christmas gifts and every woman who&#x27;s tried it, loves it and says Stickey makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s clear and dries really fast, so by the time you get to the end of painting your second hand, you&#x27;re ready to start putting on the polish.</li>
            <li> great product works better than expected</li>
            <li> I tend to peel and pick my nail polish so I was on the look for something that would make it harder for them to peel. This really makes the polish stick! Like really stick on! I do one layer of this on one finger then immediately before it dries I do the color coat on that finger!</li>
            <li> This base coat allowed polish to stay on my brittle nails for 6 days without chipping - Really unheard of in my little world!</li>
            <li> I have been using Stickey Base Coat for a number of years.  Unfortunately, the nail supply companies in my area don&#x27;t stock it.  I don&#x27;t know why.  I love it and won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as sticky as I thought</li>
            <li> If you want your polish to stay on longer this is the best product on the market...love it!! Thank you</li>
            <li> Stickey used to be a great product, but then they changed the bottles and I am 100% certain, the formula. It just has none of the sticking power it used to have and I used this a lot for a long time. Save your money, there are better basecoats out there.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different base coats and this is the only one that keeps the nail polish on my nails.  I absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> I noticed the bottle was different from my old Creative Stickey bottle and because it&#x27;s the same name and same company, I assumed it was the same product.  I&#x27;m not sure if the company has altered this formula, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as it used to.  I compared what little bit I had left from my former purchase, which I purchased from a local retailer in town about a year ago, and my manicure did not budge for over a week - and that was the norm I had come to expect from this product.  My manicure with the new bottle purchased here, I cannot claim similar success... in fact, my polish chips within three days, consistently.  I&#x27;m not doing anything differently than I used to, so I can only believe the product has changed and I am not pleased.  I won&#x27;t buy it again and will try another brand.</li>
            <li> Thought I would test this out with all of the good reviews it got.  Put it on my nails and the polish stayed on for about 3 days, but that&#x27;s because I wash the dishes without gloves by that time.  I use my hands a lot; when I used my hands the way I do everyday, not a chip in sight.  Unfortunately, not base coat can survive dishpan soaked hands. You will have to use gloves (which I don&#x27;t like) when washing dishes in order to keep your polish on.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Best base coat ever. It keeps my polsh on and keeps my nails from yellowing when polish is removed</li>
            <li> Came through the mail so much faster than I thought it would - safely packaged and sent - great product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this polish it is so good and my polish stays on much longer</li>
            <li> Nice base coat. My nails chip very quickly, so I&#x27;m always looking for the best base coat I can to help remedy that. Although it wasn&#x27;t a miracle cure to my nail chipping (I&#x27;m not sure if anything will ever be), it did help in preventing major chips. For anybody who isn&#x27;t hard on their nails, this would probably work much better for them.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly &amp; was packaged well. It also REALLY works the way it says it will! I have been having problems with my manicure chipping 1 or 2 days after I polish my nails. I&#x27;m not careful in using my hands, so I blamed it on that. I was actually going to give up polishing them except for special occasions. Then I heard about Stickey &amp; decided to give it a try. My manicure has lasted more than a week! It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of basic coats and this is by far the best. I&#x27;ve used it on the corner of my nails over my polish as well.</li>
            <li> I used my old favorite on my left hand and this on my right. knowing the right hand always chips first. I used the same top coat on each. the right hand out lasted the left by 2 days. I&#x27;m, sold!</li>
            <li> My nail polish does last longer if I use this base coat but if you are a rough person like I am, it will still chip within 3/4 days, especially if you have longer nails. The base coat does go on smoothly and since I generally average ONE day for having great nails without any chips, I&#x27;d still buy this again if I don&#x27;t come across anything even better. When I had shorter nails, this base did allow my nail polish to last about a week without chipping so it&#x27;s not too bad. Mind you, I am a very ungraceful lady and slap around my nails against every surface possible so you&#x27;ll probably have better results.</li>
            <li> I have finger nails so soft that the nails bend and even a professional manicure usually lasts just a couple of days.  But when I gave my manicurist the Stickey Base coat to use along with the Opi top coat, the salon polish lasted perfectly for an entire week.  For me, this is unheard of.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Love this base coat.  This combined with the top coat makes my nail polish last for over a week.  No chips.  Recommend seller and item.</li>
            <li> This is a great base coat to use . .  It extends my manicure by a few days at least.</li>
            <li> This sticky base coat has lengthened my manicure and pedicure by twice the time I used to get before I started using it!  I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Great for undercoat on natural nails</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I expected it to hold the tips of the nail polish better but it did&#x27;nt hold the rest for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this base coat. I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every brand out there and this is the only one that I can get at least 5 days of flawless looking nails. It is the best!!</li>
            <li> This product is the only one on the market that really works to protect your nails and help your polish stay on.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Unfortunately, I dropped it and could not finish out what I waited for so long.  I will reorder and make another attempt.</li>
            <li> Stickey works just as it says it will and really does keep polish from chipping.  I gave only 4 stars because I use light polish, and often there is a blue cast from the Stickey.  It would be perfect for you if you used darker polish</li>
            <li> I like the thin consistency of this product, especially compared to my usual OPI base coat. Typically after just 1 or 2 coats of color, my finger nails have a thick goopy layer of nail product. Having a thin base is key to a nice application and long lasting wear. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have recommended Stickey Base Coat to all of my friends.  It is absolutely the best base coat I have ever used.  Nail polish stays on well past all of the other products.</li>
            <li> Very misleading product display!  First screen and search screen is for Sticky Basecoat by Creative, after you get so far along in the purchase, at the end, you see this different looking package and think it must be a new package because it says Creative Sticky and this bottle shows the big C at the end of purchase.  It is not Creative Sticky Basecoat when you receive it.  It won&#x27;t dry, it smells very strong and the polish you put on to cover it won&#x27;t stick and leaves uncovered spots on your nail.  Worst ever basecoat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. It does the job as a base coat. But I don&#x27;t see how it makes it any &amp;#34;stickier&amp;#34; than other base coats out there. Probably won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
