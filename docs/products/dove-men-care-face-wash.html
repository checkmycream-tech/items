            <li>Another good one from Dove!</li>
            <li>This is a great face wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed his skin looking clearer and brighter, and I think they&#x27;ve done great things for his skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also works great as a shaving cream substitute.  </li>
            <li>Foams up and lathers well to get a good scrub on face.  </li>
            <li>Husband uses this product and the price was good</li>
            <li>He was just never into anything but the good ol&#x27; St Ives Apricot scrub which works wonders for me, but did nothing for his skin.</li>
            <li>Good value&lt;</li>
            <li>The price is a good value, and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>It may smell wonderful, but it really isn&#x27;t all that great in the long-run.</li>
            <li>Smells nice</li>
            <li>and I liked it</li>
            <li>Light fragrance that is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, has a nice creamy texture that doesn&#x27;t over-dry the skin, and is allegedly suitable for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced the watery consistency I did that first purchase since</li>
            <li>He was just happy that he could use a face wash for sensitive skin without breaking out from it, and he is also very pleased with the smell of it.</li>
            <li>Men&#x27;s skin care products do not carry so many of those foo-foo words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this product</li>
            <li>but nothing worked and many things broke me out</li>
            <li>I am sure to get this one again when I run out of face soap.</li>
            <li>All in all, a satisfying product.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s lots to love about this face wash from Dove.</li>
            <li>He said that it also has a very clean fragrance too.</li>
            <li>This product seems pretty good.</li>
            <li>Your mileage may vary, but it seems pretty good to me.</li>
            <li>It seems great for his sensitive skin, and I like how clearer and better his skin is looking.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a great product for guys looking for sensitive face wash.</li>
            <li>I am still stuck with it but haven&#x27;t experienced it for awhile now since using the Sensitive + line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my husband&#x27;s face feeling silky smooth before and after he&#x27;s shaved and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>He also says that shaving has become more comfortable as well.  </li>
            <li>As mentioned this has a very mild scent that disappears after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sensitive + seems perfect for those who have sensitive skin or reactions to overly strong scents.</li>
            <li>I wish Dove could find a way to incorporate the Sensitive line with the Hydrate line, because if this cleanser wasn&#x27;t so drying, it would be perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>A great men&#x27;s facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>it was dirt cheap.</li>
            <li>My fiance loves this, not only great for his face, but makes his beard softer too.</li>
            <li>scent is light</li>
            <li>I would have preferred something with deep cleaning additives (beads, etc), but this is great for face wash.</li>
            <li>This product is sensitive on my skin, moisturizing and has a pleasant clean (not over powering) smell.</li>
            <li>There is a nice masculine fragrance added into the product that smells quite refreshing.</li>
            <li>- they are so exciting about this face wash!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin which dries out very easy, this soap does a great job of cleaning my blackheads and does not dry out my face or scratch my face.</li>
            <li>It will clean your face without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Leaves you refreshed and feeling clean all day.</li>
            <li>Just the smell of clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different face washes and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>and it felt clean, hydrated, and revived.</li>
            <li>: If you have great skin already and would like a cleanser that is simple, will make your skin feel refreshed, won&#x27;t turn your skin red, and smells wonderful, I can definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li>I also used many things and my face would be very shiny.</li>
            <li>far as this cleanser alone goes, it has a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My skin is somewhat sensitive, more so in that it easily dries out, but not in the rash/allergy phase.  </li>
            <li>It has a light lather and rinses right off.</li>
            <li>it is a good product , cleans well , last for a good long time.</li>
            <li>Lathers well and rinses clean, leaving a fresh hydrated feeling.</li>
            <li>my face feels clean and fresh  </li>
            <li>it was a miracle after a couple of months I got bold and decided to try a razor.  </li>
            <li>It has a mild scent as well.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy that the sensitive products do not use as many additives.  </li>
            <li>The Sensitive + face wash feels great on my face and has a barely noticeable scent that disappears after I wash</li>
            <li>It is gentle, moisturizing, and has a very mild scent.</li>
            <li>It is primarily a hydrater but is refreshing enough as  face wash.  </li>
            <li>It has a bit more lather than the Sensitive + face wash.</li>
            <li>product is okay so far</li>
            <li>hydrate variety is good too, however it was a bit too wet for me.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase</li>
            <li>Strong fragrance will disagree with folks who have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>When he tried this Dove face wash, he said that it really made his face feel clean, but most importantly, he didn&#x27;t break out from it like he has with other brand name face wash.</li>
            <li>This face wash is both effective and gentle especially if you accidentally get it in your eyes.  </li>
            <li>and I have to give Dove for Men a high rating for making a facial cleanser that works great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was going to try the more hydrating one, but this moisturizes enough along with that lotion.</li>
            <li>It also left my face drier than most washes.</li>
            <li>, it does not stick around very long or smell very strongly which is how I prefer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively gentle (I have sensitive skin), and seems to hydrate fine.</li>
            <li>While this product claims to moisturize, he felt that he got better much hydration with an actual moisturizer or lotion.</li>
            <li>I liked the entire line of sensitive skin from post shave to shaving cream to this face wash.</li>
            <li>While this cleanser is good for sensitive skin as far as not causing any irritation, it did leave the skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li>I bought the whole line, even the Scalp</li>
            <li>It is gentile but also cleans very well.  </li>
            <li>Like a lot of Dove products it is gentle on your skin and works as an added moisturizer as it is clinically proven to fight skin dryness.</li>
            <li>really like both.</li>
            <li>I really like this Dove mens face wash.</li>
            <li>I really like the face wash.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it is a good basic cleanser.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong, but it doesn&#x27;t stay for a long while.  </li>
            <li>The skin feels soft and smooth at first, but after a short time, the skin becomes somewhat \\&quot;tight\\&quot; feeling and begs for moisture.</li>
            <li>The product goes on smooth, gently cleanses, then washes completely off leaving behind smooth and clean skin.</li>
            <li>The Hydrate + seems to create a bit more lather and the sensitive + feels a bit better after a tough shave.</li>
            <li>The sensitive was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>usually a little soap and water is good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This does not foam up a lot which can seem a bit strange, but it did leave my face feeling clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I do wish it would lather a little better , but it does the job.</li>
            <li>I find the sensitive variety of this product is both gentle and soothing.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle on my skin from a performance standpoint so far.</li>
            <li>A relatively small amount is good enough for a face wash.</li>
            <li>While he really liked the post-shave products, he was not thrilled with this face wash.  </li>
            <li>I was using a new product name bump patrol and it was realling helping me with the shaving bumps</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t help much with pimples or blackheads, but instead is just a basic gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not need to use much of this stuff to wash your whole face, so one tube should last you quite a while.</li>
            <li>but I have such a pet peeve that every time I open it in the shower, it pours out of the bottle so quickly that it&#x27;s as if I put water in it.</li>
            <li>My skin requires me to use sensitive products.</li>
            <li>I chose the sensitive version because my face is acne prone.</li>
            <li>Completely stopped and I Had this condition since I was 19 years old.</li>
            <li>changed it all, along with the Dove Men+ Sensitive lotion.</li>
            <li>Dove Men+ Care Sensitive + Face Wash]] is no exception.  </li>
            <li>The soap is white and creamy, just like dove soap (which should not be too much of a surprise).  </li>
            <li>It reminds me a bit of the old Clearasil.</li>
            <li>Once I started using the sensitive skin face wash and then using the bump patrol</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>He also has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using the Dove Men+Care line of hair/body wash for several months now, and really likes it.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, if you have acne-prone skin or don&#x27;t like to use moisturizer or dislike having to splash water on your face for over a minute to wash all the soap off, I don&#x27;t think this cleanser is a good idea.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try especially if your have sensitive or dry skin.</li>
            <li>and if the opening were smaller or had that newer mouth (like the newer bottles of Hines ketchup where you have to actually push out the contents) then this would be higher.</li>
            <li>(I guess a creamy white looks more natural than a florescent green or blue).  </li>
            <li>I generally like nearly all Dove Men+ products and this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helped out my dry skin</li>
            <li>Dove Men Care Sensitive Face Wash is a face wash especially designed for men with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I got this for my teenage son, who has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This says sensitive skin, but it left my face irritated.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s really not all that much one can say about it.</li>
            <li>I saw Vine offered this same line in facial care products for men, I jumped on all four products for sensitive skin for my husband.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did not dry out my face as some harsher cleaners do which was</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this face wash and finds that it helps with dry itchy skin a lot, without irritating, and with a nice subtle masculine type scent.</li>
            <li>Most other face wash products are either a little too &amp;#34;lotion-y&amp;#34; in that they leave your skin feeling coated or can be too irritating but this face wash hits right in the goldilocks balance spot.</li>

            <li> usually a little soap and water is good enough for me.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This does not foam up a lot which can seem a bit strange, but it did leave my face feeling clean and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I do wish it would lather a little better , but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I find the sensitive variety of this product is both gentle and soothing.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle on my skin from a performance standpoint so far.</li>
            <li> A relatively small amount is good enough for a face wash.</li>
            <li> While he really liked the post-shave products, he was not thrilled with this face wash.  </li>
            <li> I was using a new product name bump patrol and it was realling helping me with the shaving bumps</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t help much with pimples or blackheads, but instead is just a basic gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not need to use much of this stuff to wash your whole face, so one tube should last you quite a while.</li>
            <li> but I have such a pet peeve that every time I open it in the shower, it pours out of the bottle so quickly that it&#x27;s as if I put water in it.</li>
            <li> My skin requires me to use sensitive products.</li>
            <li> I chose the sensitive version because my face is acne prone.</li>
            <li> Completely stopped and I Had this condition since I was 19 years old.</li>
            <li> changed it all, along with the Dove Men+ Sensitive lotion.</li>
            <li> Dove Men+ Care Sensitive + Face Wash]] is no exception.  </li>
            <li> The soap is white and creamy, just like dove soap (which should not be too much of a surprise).  </li>
            <li> It reminds me a bit of the old Clearasil.</li>
            <li> Once I started using the sensitive skin face wash and then using the bump patrol</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> He also has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using the Dove Men+Care line of hair/body wash for several months now, and really likes it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, if you have acne-prone skin or don&#x27;t like to use moisturizer or dislike having to splash water on your face for over a minute to wash all the soap off, I don&#x27;t think this cleanser is a good idea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try especially if your have sensitive or dry skin.</li>
            <li> and if the opening were smaller or had that newer mouth (like the newer bottles of Hines ketchup where you have to actually push out the contents) then this would be higher.</li>
            <li> (I guess a creamy white looks more natural than a florescent green or blue).  </li>
            <li> I generally like nearly all Dove Men+ products and this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helped out my dry skin</li>
            <li> Dove Men Care Sensitive Face Wash is a face wash especially designed for men with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage son, who has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This says sensitive skin, but it left my face irritated.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s really not all that much one can say about it.</li>
            <li> I saw Vine offered this same line in facial care products for men, I jumped on all four products for sensitive skin for my husband.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did not dry out my face as some harsher cleaners do which was</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this face wash and finds that it helps with dry itchy skin a lot, without irritating, and with a nice subtle masculine type scent.</li>
            <li> Most other face wash products are either a little too &amp;#34;lotion-y&amp;#34; in that they leave your skin feeling coated or can be too irritating but this face wash hits right in the goldilocks balance spot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dove products for hair and skin for a while because they are gentle and tend to have fewer of the harsh chemicals that dry out and otherwise irritate.</li>
            <li> He felt that it didn&#x27;t cleanse as well as other products (he has a \\&quot;dirty job\\&quot;, he needs an effective cleanser).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much on skin care products and personal care items.</li>

            <li> have extremely dry and flaky skin.</li>
            <li> It works and does not leave the face dry after using it.</li>

            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry up your skin.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with dry skin and my face likes to flake</li>
            <li> While my first purchase was frustrating, I gave this product another chance because of how it performed over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed changes too, like his hair is smoother and he no longer gets dry patches of skin on his hands and elbows or any other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use this I feel my face more bad</li>
            <li> It can be difficult to find products to help with skin dryness for men, as so much of what is out there is fruity or flowery and not necessarily designed for them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent maybe $1500-2000 on stuff that I never finish using over the years.</li>
            <li> Sensitive Face Wash comes in an upside down container with the usual Dove Men + Care colors.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face or feeling  harsh after using for a week.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to go out to places and eat or actually eat at work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would have to scrub my dead skin off my face every day or 2 to help prevent my flaky face from happening without opening my mouth wide.</li>
            <li> To summarize, it does its job, but it doesn&#x27;t make me jump up and down with excitement</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been getting less razor burn, he has had less breakouts, and he hasn&#x27;t had any sort of negative reaction to any of the facial care products from Dove.  </li>
            <li> Other face washes (even those with moisturizers) still dried my face out after shaving.</li>
            <li> My eye lids started to slightly burn.</li>

            <li> My husband has said it cleanses well, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too harsh.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a little difficult getting him to use facial care products at all, as he&#x27;s definitely not the \\&quot;metrosexual\\&quot; type, but I think the decrease in razor burn and the other benefits he&#x27;s seeing has convinced him that maybe a decent skincare regimen wouldn&#x27;t be the worst thing in the world.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Shiseido Beneficence and Lar Mer foam cleanser to pamper my face + to get rid of the makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well he notices his skin, but I notice.  </li>
            <li> Until this is changed I will just continue to be annoyed that I bought two bottles of the stuff based on my experience with other Dove for Men products.</li>
            <li> It feels a little less artificial than other face soaps</li>
            <li> Thick creamy texture is hard to wash away.</li>

            <li> There&#x27;s also some down sides, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle but distinguished and noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped his face clear up (though he still gets ingrown hairs from shaving, he doesn&#x27;t get the insane blackheads covering everything else) and he feels less... &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; using it.</li>
            <li> I use if after shaving so it soothes my face after tough shaves like when I have not shaved over the weekend.</li>
            <li> I am getting tired of those expansive makeup counter cleansers that vary from $35-$75.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My skin requires me to use sensitive products. This product is sensitive on my skin, moisturizing and has a pleasant clean (not over powering) smell. I think this is a great product for guys looking for sensitive face wash.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best face wash I have ever used. I chose the sensitive version because my face is acne prone. There is a nice masculine fragrance added into the product that smells quite refreshing. Its very thick; I found that a pea-sized dot will cover my entire face and some of my lower neck. I will be purchasing this product again the next go-around. 5/5</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin which dries out very easy, this soap does a great job of cleaning my blackheads and does not dry out my face or scratch my face.</li>
            <li> Awesome cleanser for my face.  I am getting tired of those expansive makeup counter cleansers that vary from $35-$75.  I usually use Shiseido Beneficence and Lar Mer foam cleanser to pamper my face + to get rid of the makeup leftovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am getting tired of paying such a pristine price for a facial cleanser.  I talked to myself + let&#x27;s check and see see how a $5-$7 cleanser works.  To my surprise,it works WONDERBAR!  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face or feeling  harsh after using for a week.  It is written for Men but what the heck?  If it works - it works.  We, women, are usually blinded by those fancy marketing words: soothing, deep cleaning, moisturizing, hydrating, lifting, wrinkle minimizing.  Men&#x27;s skin care products do not carry so many of those foo-foo words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and I&#x27;ve introduced this to all my chickies in my inner circle - they are so exciting about this face wash!</li>
            <li> A great men&#x27;s facial cleanser.  Light fragrance that is pleasant.  Foams up and lathers well to get a good scrub on face.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It will clean your face without drying it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all I use. Ever. It&#x27;s impossible to find in stores so I am thankful I can find it on amazon. Leaves you refreshed and feeling clean all day.</li>
            <li> Husband uses this product and the price was good</li>
            <li> it is a good product , cleans well , last for a good long time. I do wish it would lather a little better , but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get my husband to use a facial scrub for YEARS. He was just never into anything but the good ol&#x27; St Ives Apricot scrub which works wonders for me, but did nothing for his skin. We decided to try this since with a coupon and Subscribe &amp; Save it was dirt cheap. Lo and Behold, he LOVES it. It&#x27;s helped his face clear up (though he still gets ingrown hairs from shaving, he doesn&#x27;t get the insane blackheads covering everything else) and he feels less... &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; using it. (Let&#x27;s face it. Apricot scrub does smell kinda girly).</li>
            <li> Use this I feel my face more bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent maybe $1500-2000 on stuff that I never finish using over the years. I am now 30.5 years old.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing helped at all and I felt like I was stuck with this skin condition forever. I am still stuck with it but haven&#x27;t experienced it for awhile now since using the Sensitive + line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry and flaky skin. It would be oily, but also flakes. It&#x27;s hard to go out to places and eat or actually eat at work. I have to be careful not to open my mouth too far, else you&#x27;ll see my skin cracking and wanting to peel... I also used many things and my face would be very shiny. I have used things that try not to make it shiny, also used stuff that is similar to this as a wash but nothing worked and many things broke me out extremely quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have to scrub my dead skin off my face every day or 2 to help prevent my flaky face from happening without opening my mouth wide. (I would get it if I ate like a hamburger though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since using this, it stopped... Completely stopped and I Had this condition since I was 19 years old. I am 30 now.&lt;br /&gt;This changed it all, along with the Dove Men+ Sensitive lotion. I bought the whole line, even the Scalp Fortifying.&lt;br /&gt;It was like I had dandruff on my face along with my scalp. And using the shampoo, I haven&#x27;t had flaky skin up there either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to try the more hydrating one, but this moisturizes enough along with that lotion.</li>
            <li> This says sensitive skin, but it left my face irritated. My eye lids started to slightly burn. It also left my face drier than most washes. Definitely use a skin moisturizer after this product.</li>
            <li> I generally like nearly all Dove Men+ products and this [[ASIN:B00A0J09G6 Dove Men+ Care Sensitive + Face Wash]] is no exception.  I find the sensitive variety of this product is both gentle and soothing.  This face wash is both effective and gentle especially if you accidentally get it in your eyes.  The product goes on smooth, gently cleanses, then washes completely off leaving behind smooth and clean skin.</li>
            <li> Lathers well and rinses clean, leaving a fresh hydrated feeling. Could use in the shower or at the sink. A convient size  for traveling or for your gym bag. Dove makes the best products!</li>
            <li> The soap is white and creamy, just like dove soap (which should not be too much of a surprise).  It feels a little less artificial than other face soaps (I guess a creamy white looks more natural than a florescent green or blue).  It is gentile but also cleans very well.  I am sure to get this one again when I run out of face soap.</li>
            <li> While this cleanser is good for sensitive skin as far as not causing any irritation, it did leave the skin feeling dry. You definitely need a moisturizer afterwards. Other than that, it is a good basic cleanser. It won&#x27;t help much with pimples or blackheads, but instead is just a basic gentle cleanser. It has a light lather and rinses right off. The skin feels soft and smooth at first, but after a short time, the skin becomes somewhat \\&quot;tight\\&quot; feeling and begs for moisture. I wish Dove could find a way to incorporate the Sensitive line with the Hydrate line, because if this cleanser wasn&#x27;t so drying, it would be perfect for sensitive skin. If you already use a facial moisturizer daily, this may not bother you though.</li>
            <li> My fiance loves this, not only great for his face, but makes his beard softer too. Which makes me happy!!</li>
            <li> The 5oz Dove Men + Care Sensitive Face Wash comes in an upside down container with the usual Dove Men + Care colors. A relatively small amount is good enough for a face wash. It works and does not leave the face dry after using it. I haven&#x27;t had any side effects or issues after using it for a few weeks. It reminds me a bit of the old Clearasil. I haven&#x27;t used Clearasil in recent years, so I don&#x27;t know if they changed it since. The smell, the closest thing I can think of is that it smells like a dermatologist&#x27;s office. The smell is when you smell the open container, not after you use it. To summarize, it does its job, but it doesn&#x27;t make me jump up and down with excitement (it is a face wash after all!)</li>
            <li> This product seems pretty good. I mean, it&#x27;s face wash, so there&#x27;s really not all that much one can say about it. It&#x27;s relatively gentle (I have sensitive skin), and seems to hydrate fine. Your mileage may vary, but it seems pretty good to me.</li>
            <li> I recently gave my husband the Dove Men Care Face Wash, along with 3 other Dove Men Care products.  While he really liked the post-shave products, he was not thrilled with this face wash.  He felt that it didn&#x27;t cleanse as well as other products (he has a \\&quot;dirty job\\&quot;, he needs an effective cleanser).  While this product claims to moisturize, he felt that he got better much hydration with an actual moisturizer or lotion.</li>
            <li> Comparing this with similar products, it stands up well.  It is primarily a hydrater but is refreshing enough as  face wash.  The scent is strong, but it doesn&#x27;t stay for a long while.  All in all, a satisfying product.</li>
            <li> This face wash made a beliver out of me that men need to take care of there skin I am a Black man and I suffer with pusoflixulitus I know spelled wrong, you try it.  I was using a new product name bump patrol and it was realling helping me with the shaving bumps but I was still using clipper could never use a razor.  Once I started using the sensitive skin face wash and then using the bump patrol it was a miracle after a couple of months I got bold and decided to try a razor.  End result I don&#x27;t use clipper anymore all I can say is Men start taking car of your skin you wil be amazed</li>
            <li> Dove Men Care Sensitive Face Wash is a face wash especially designed for men with sensitive skin. Like a lot of Dove products it is gentle on your skin and works as an added moisturizer as it is clinically proven to fight skin dryness. It leaves my husband&#x27;s face feeling silky smooth before and after he&#x27;s shaved and I absolutely love it. Although the face wash hydrates and moisturizes your skin it will not last all day/night so I would recommend using with Dove Face lotion as well. It&#x27;s worth a try especially if your have sensitive or dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great face wash. The Sensitive + face wash feels great on my face and has a barely noticeable scent that disappears after I wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans my face and moisturizes it as well. I use if after shaving so it soothes my face after tough shaves like when I have not shaved over the weekend. Also, a little of this goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sensitive + seems perfect for those who have sensitive skin or reactions to overly strong scents. As mentioned this has a very mild scent that disappears after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have tried the Hydrate + face wash. It has a mild scent as well. It has a bit more lather than the Sensitive + face wash. It feels about the same on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like both. The Hydrate + seems to create a bit more lather and the sensitive + feels a bit better after a tough shave.</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage son, who has very sensitive skin. When he tried this Dove face wash, he said that it really made his face feel clean, but most importantly, he didn&#x27;t break out from it like he has with other brand name face wash. He said that it also has a very clean fragrance too. He doesn&#x27;t have dry skin, so the hydrating factor wasn&#x27;t an issue for him. He was just happy that he could use a face wash for sensitive skin without breaking out from it, and he is also very pleased with the smell of it. I will be buying this for him from now on.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s lots to love about this face wash from Dove. It smells wonderful, has a nice creamy texture that doesn&#x27;t over-dry the skin, and is allegedly suitable for sensitive skin. There&#x27;s also some down sides, unfortunately. Here&#x27;s my PROS V. CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;- Not over-drying&lt;br /&gt;- Good value&lt;br /&gt;- No harsh chemicals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Strong fragrance will disagree with folks who have very sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;- Will need to use with a moisturizer (although it&#x27;s not overly-drying, your skin will still feel taut without a moisturizer)&lt;br /&gt;- No ingredients to prevent acne&lt;br /&gt;- Thick creamy texture is hard to wash away. You&#x27;ll need to wash your face VERY thoroughly to get it all off (which is harsh on the skin, but if you don&#x27;t wash thoroughly you&#x27;ll break out)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: If you have great skin already and would like a cleanser that is simple, will make your skin feel refreshed, won&#x27;t turn your skin red, and smells wonderful, I can definitely recommend this. Unfortunately, if you have acne-prone skin or don&#x27;t like to use moisturizer or dislike having to splash water on your face for over a minute to wash all the soap off, I don&#x27;t think this cleanser is a good idea. It may smell wonderful, but it really isn&#x27;t all that great in the long-run.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! doesn&#x27;t dry up your skin.</li>
            <li> While my first purchase was frustrating, I gave this product another chance because of how it performed over time. I haven&#x27;t experienced the watery consistency I did that first purchase since and I have to give Dove for Men a high rating for making a facial cleanser that works great for sensitive skin. Most other face wash products are either a little too &amp;#34;lotion-y&amp;#34; in that they leave your skin feeling coated or can be too irritating but this face wash hits right in the goldilocks balance spot. And as a men&#x27;s product, there is no flowery scent. Just the smell of clean. I&#x27;ve shopped around ALOT and this is the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Original review on April 27, 2014&lt;br /&gt;Way too watery for the design of the opening of the bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is okay so far but I have such a pet peeve that every time I open it in the shower, it pours out of the bottle so quickly that it&#x27;s as if I put water in it. From the start it has been like that and if the opening were smaller or had that newer mouth (like the newer bottles of Hines ketchup where you have to actually push out the contents) then this would be higher. Until this is changed I will just continue to be annoyed that I bought two bottles of the stuff based on my experience with other Dove for Men products. It is gentle on my skin from a performance standpoint so far.</li>
            <li> My husband is 30, and he has thick, quick-growing hair.  His facial hair is no exception.  He also has sensitive skin.  He&#x27;s been using the Dove Men+Care line of hair/body wash for several months now, and really likes it.  I&#x27;ve also noticed changes too, like his hair is smoother and he no longer gets dry patches of skin on his hands and elbows or any other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw Vine offered this same line in facial care products for men, I jumped on all four products for sensitive skin for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them have been no exception to the excellence of the Dove for Men product line.  He&#x27;s been getting less razor burn, he has had less breakouts, and he hasn&#x27;t had any sort of negative reaction to any of the facial care products from Dove.  He also says that shaving has become more comfortable as well.  I&#x27;m not sure how well he notices his skin, but I notice.  I&#x27;ve noticed his skin looking clearer and brighter, and I think they&#x27;ve done great things for his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a little difficult getting him to use facial care products at all, as he&#x27;s definitely not the \\&quot;metrosexual\\&quot; type, but I think the decrease in razor burn and the other benefits he&#x27;s seeing has convinced him that maybe a decent skincare regimen wouldn&#x27;t be the worst thing in the world.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as this cleanser alone goes, it has a nice fragrance.  My husband has said it cleanses well, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too harsh.  It seems great for his sensitive skin, and I like how clearer and better his skin is looking.  It&#x27;s just another great Dove for Men product to help keep him looking his best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dove products for hair and skin for a while because they are gentle and tend to have fewer of the harsh chemicals that dry out and otherwise irritate. This wash is no exception to my expectations. It is gentle, moisturizing, and has a very mild scent. Another good one from Dove!</li>
            <li> This does not foam up a lot which can seem a bit strange, but it did leave my face feeling clean and hydrated. It did not dry out my face as some harsher cleaners do which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and I liked it, it does not stick around very long or smell very strongly which is how I prefer it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not need to use much of this stuff to wash your whole face, so one tube should last you quite a while.</li>
            <li> It can be difficult to find products to help with skin dryness for men, as so much of what is out there is fruity or flowery and not necessarily designed for them. My husband really likes this face wash and finds that it helps with dry itchy skin a lot, without irritating, and with a nice subtle masculine type scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different face washes and this is by far the best. Other face washes (even those with moisturizers) still dried my face out after shaving. This face wash didn&#x27;t affect my skin at all and it felt clean, hydrated, and revived. Great product!</li>
            <li> I really like this Dove mens face wash. I have a problem with dry skin and my face likes to flake so when I saw Dove had a mens line of products I tried them out. I liked the entire line of sensitive skin from post shave to shaving cream to this face wash. It&#x27;s really helped out my dry skin and I&#x27;m a believer of these products now. I would recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They hydrate variety is good too, however it was a bit too wet for me. Sort of made a mess all over. The sensitive was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My skin is somewhat sensitive, more so in that it easily dries out, but not in the rash/allergy phase.  I also enjoy that the sensitive products do not use as many additives.  The scent is subtle but distinguished and noticeable.  The price is a good value, and does a good job.  I would have preferred something with deep cleaning additives (beads, etc), but this is great for face wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much on skin care products and personal care items. usually a little soap and water is good enough for me.  I really like the face wash.  my face feels clean and fresh  Also works great as a shaving cream substitute.  Definitely worth the purchase</li>
