            <li>This conditioner leaves your hair feeling silky and smelling delicious .</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>Great for damaged hair</li>
            <li>It works great and gets the pool smell out</li>
            <li>This product smells great.</li>
            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>This is honestly a miracle product!</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair looking good throughout the day, as well, so I use it regardless of whether or not I swim.</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>I use it before and after swimming, and sometimes during the day just cause it smells so good.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>&quot;  What that means is that it has a pleasant light coconut scent that reminds me of sunshine and tanning oil.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li>love this leaves hair feeling nice</li>
            <li>This leave-in conditioner has a pleasant aroma that is balanced (not too strong), and a light consistency.  </li>
            <li>After an hour of swimming, she was able to EASILY brush out her hair!  </li>
            <li>It makes you wish you could swim more often so you could have a reason to apply it.</li>
            <li>Would like to use it a bit more before i committed to saying, &amp;#34;I love it!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>i love using this for my hair.</li>
            <li>so I am glad I am using it.</li>
            <li>(Note:  This product may be purchased at a much better price at Sally Beauty.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>had my hair cut yesterday, and my hairdresser remarked that my hair is definitely in better condition than it has been.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s vegan.</li>
            <li>It smells like coconut which made my daughter love it even more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for people who also style their hair a lot with hot tools.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t even good as a leave in conditioner it did not leave the hair soft just crusty.</li>
            <li>Super product for swimmers.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it works great.</li>
            <li>The pump applicator produces a mist-like spray, not a sloppy gel-like substance, so it is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>and we are using this the same number of times, need to buy more!</li>
            <li>We are using this on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it works great after the UltraSwim Shampoo/Conditioner, I can&#x27;t believe the change this product has made on her hair with just a few uses, she swims 2-3 times per week</li>
            <li>A nice, big size too!</li>
            <li>but I guess it&#x27;s better than just leaving my hair bare..</li>
            <li>so it is easy for me to evenly coat my hair completely in about 5-7 sprays.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>my hair definitely feels better when I spray it after my swim</li>
            <li>I have used different spray on conditioners but this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Good for my daughters long hair and son&#x27;s short hair-</li>
            <li>I work as a swim instructor in a very chlorinated pool.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I use it even when I haven&#x27;t been swimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>leave in saves time in the locker room shower-which at least at my pool is a good thing.</li>
            <li>She put her hair into two French braids, soaked her hair with fresh water, and then sprayed a decent amount of this on her hair.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not so sure how much it lasts, because I swim for an hour at least..</li>
            <li>Live this leaving , helps to stop frizzy hair and leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li>It kept my hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li>and I still have quarter of a bottle left) and smells decent too.</li>
            <li>I swim several times a week at a club pool that is highly chlorinated.  </li>
            <li>A quick brushing after the hair has dried eliminates the stiffness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pool has really made his hair rough-</li>
            <li>Turned my daughter&#x27;s straw like hair back to its soft manageable form...</li>
            <li>I was able to tell a dramatic difference when I used it.</li>

            <li> I was able to tell a dramatic difference when I used it.</li>
            <li> but again I&#x27;m not sure how much it rehydrates</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner does wonders to my hair, especially the ends, which are often lifeless and dry after a day in the water and sun.</li>
            <li> Ion smooths my hair, and tames the dry flyaway ends.  </li>
            <li> Since my hair is on the fragile side, I have been looking for post-swim treatment that does not leave it looking greasy or weighted down.  </li>
            <li> I apply it and then start from my house/workplace so by the time I reach the center, my hair is dry again.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner during a recent trip, swimming in the ocean everyday.</li>
            <li> This product has been extremely helpful with my 8yo.  </li>
            <li> It had no effect on green in my hair and left my hair stiff and unimaginable.  </li>
            <li> other reviewers commented that Ion Conditioner leaves the hair feeling stiff or crunchy.  </li>
            <li> I neither see any green hair myself nor has somebody told me about a greenish tinge</li>
            <li> hair is not prone to turning green, so I can&#x27;t comment on how well Ion Conditioner works in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She always gets green hair, I tried to use this every time before she swam</li>
            <li> and it did not prevent the green from returning.  </li>
            <li> (it was taking a half hour each time)!  </li>
            <li> I live in Boston so we have our share of cold and snow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find products to protect &amp; treat hair that is getting damaged from chlorine &amp; salt water.</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this product every day since February, I attribute that improvement to (at least in part)</li>
            <li> Way too expensive just to make my hair look bad.</li>
            <li> ; Silly!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be impossible to find vegan swimmer-friendly shampoo and conditioner, but here it is in all its glory.</li>
            <li> It was virtually impossible to brush out</li>
            <li> It was very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because my daughter&#x27;s medium length blond hair was getting horribly tangled and MATTED (like dread locks) while swimming.</li>

            <li> Super product for swimmers. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find products to protect &amp; treat hair that is getting damaged from chlorine &amp; salt water. This spray-on, easy-to-use leave in conditioner is used BEFORE you swim. It smells like Summer, the price is excellent. A nice, big size too!</li>
            <li> This product has been extremely helpful with my 8yo.  She would wake up with &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; hair... this helps out a ton!</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner has a pleasant aroma that is balanced (not too strong), and a light consistency.  The pump applicator produces a mist-like spray, not a sloppy gel-like substance, so it is easy to apply.  It keeps my hair looking good throughout the day, as well, so I use it regardless of whether or not I swim.</li>
            <li> Noticed no benefit in using before AND after swimming. Color faded, and hair texture like cotton candy.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves your hair feeling silky and smelling delicious . It makes you wish you could swim more often so you could have a reason to apply it.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Works good. I use it before and after swimming, and sometimes during the day just cause it smells so good. Reminds me of the beach.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it does feel like it protects my hair at the beginning but I&#x27;m not so sure how much it lasts, because I swim for an hour at least.. my hair definitely feels better when I spray it after my swim but again I&#x27;m not sure how much it rehydrates but I guess it&#x27;s better than just leaving my hair bare..</li>
            <li> Good product.  Would like to use it a bit more before i committed to saying, &amp;#34;I love it!&amp;#34; Silly!</li>
            <li> This is a must have for my bleach blonde head in the summertime!</li>
            <li> i love using this for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used different spray on conditioners but this one is my favorite.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it works great.</li>
            <li> Good for my daughters long hair and son&#x27;s short hair- pool has really made his hair rough- so this definately softens it up!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
            <li> love this leaves hair feeling nice</li>
            <li> I work as a swim instructor in a very chlorinated pool. This leave in conditioner does wonders to my hair, especially the ends, which are often lifeless and dry after a day in the water and sun. This is honestly a miracle product! It&#x27;s good for people who also style their hair a lot with hot tools. Great for damaged hair</li>
            <li> I started swimming regularly about 6 months ago and use this product everytime. I have short hair so it is easy for me to evenly coat my hair completely in about 5-7 sprays. I apply it and then start from my house/workplace so by the time I reach the center, my hair is dry again. I neither see any green hair myself nor has somebody told me about a greenish tinge so I am glad I am using it. One thing though..I swim in an indoor pool and haven&#x27;t experimented it in sunny weather yet so can&#x27;t comment in that regard. I live in Boston so we have our share of cold and snow. I had once left my swimbag in the car while at work and when I returned in the evening, the contents were still a liquid. The quantity is quite reasonable(I have used it generously for about 5 months and I still have quarter of a bottle left) and smells decent too. I use this before the swim and after my swim, use a citrous shampoo and bodywash for the chlorine so it all complements well. I like it and will be buying it again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Turned my daughter&#x27;s straw like hair back to its soft manageable form...</li>
            <li> It had no effect on green in my hair and left my hair stiff and unimaginable.  I stopped using it after 10 uses.  Way too expensive just to make my hair look bad.</li>
            <li> I swim several times a week at a club pool that is highly chlorinated.  Since my hair is on the fragile side, I have been looking for post-swim treatment that does not leave it looking greasy or weighted down.  Ion Conditioner seems to be working terrifically well for me.  Ion smooths my hair, and tames the dry flyaway ends.  I like it so much that I use it even when I haven&#x27;t been swimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have stated that it \\&quot;smells like summer.\\&quot;  What that means is that it has a pleasant light coconut scent that reminds me of sunshine and tanning oil.  (If you don&#x27;t like coconut, you might not like it.)  The scent is not overpowering, and fades as the conditioner dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other reviewers commented that Ion Conditioner leaves the hair feeling stiff or crunchy.  In my experience, that only happens if you saturate your hair with it.  A quick brushing after the hair has dried eliminates the stiffness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not prone to turning green, so I can&#x27;t comment on how well Ion Conditioner works in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this stuff!!  Definitely recommended. (Note:  This product may be purchased at a much better price at Sally Beauty.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, April 2014:&lt;br /&gt;I had my hair cut yesterday, and my hairdresser remarked that my hair is definitely in better condition than it has been.  Since I have been using this product every day since February, I attribute that improvement to (at least in part) the use of this product.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner during a recent trip, swimming in the ocean everyday. It kept my hair soft and managable. I was able to tell a dramatic difference when I used it.</li>
            <li> This leave in treatment did not help at all with my daughters blonde hair.  In the summer she swims daily multiple times a day.  She always gets green hair, I tried to use this every time before she swam and it did not prevent the green from returning.  It was very disappointing.  It wasn&#x27;t even good as a leave in conditioner it did not leave the hair soft just crusty.</li>
            <li> When I was on the swim team when I was younger, my hair turned slightly green and was really brittle from 8 hours a week practices. After taking some years off, I started swimming again about a year ago and this time I&#x27;ve been using this and the matching Ion products, and my hair is softer than ever and no color changes. It works great and gets the pool smell out and I love that it&#x27;s vegan. You&#x27;d think it&#x27;d be impossible to find vegan swimmer-friendly shampoo and conditioner, but here it is in all its glory. I can&#x27;t imagine not using this stuff now.</li>
            <li> This just came in the mail today.  I bought it because my daughter&#x27;s medium length blond hair was getting horribly tangled and MATTED (like dread locks) while swimming. It was virtually impossible to brush out (it was taking a half hour each time)!  She put her hair into two French braids, soaked her hair with fresh water, and then sprayed a decent amount of this on her hair.  After an hour of swimming, she was able to EASILY brush out her hair!  Yippeeee!  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> This product smells great. It smells like coconut which made my daughter love it even more.</li>
            <li> We are using this on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it works great after the UltraSwim Shampoo/Conditioner, I can&#x27;t believe the change this product has made on her hair with just a few uses, she swims 2-3 times per week and we are using this the same number of times, need to buy more!</li>
            <li> I use this every time I go to the pool.</li>
            <li> Live this leaving , helps to stop frizzy hair and leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> leave in saves time in the locker room shower-which at least at my pool is a good thing. it doesn&#x27;t seem to overcoat my hair or leave a dulling film</li>
    </ol>
