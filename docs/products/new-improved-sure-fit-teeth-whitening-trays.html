    <ol>
            <li>wonderful product that I will use continuously.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it because its very good.</li>
            <li>I use them for nighttime anti grind bite guards and they work great</li>
            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>They dealt  fairly  with me.</li>
            <li>good in a pinch</li>
            <li>but i went to dentist to get the custom ones after i tried these, but the price was good.</li>
            <li>Not 9a good product</li>
            <li>I tried to make my own</li>
            <li>The distributers of this product sent this in a personalized care package and this was nice.</li>
            <li>Good product :)</li>
            <li>Heat them up with hot water, form them to your mouth and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li>a good Fit at</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t get a good fit on lower teeth.</li>
            <li>good just wait for water to cool</li>
            <li>The picture shows four trays and because of the reviews I was under the impression that I would get more than two trays, but that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
            <li>I will need to find a better tray for the whitening gel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They would work better.</li>
            <li>Once set to your teeth shape, do not remove to try to set it better.</li>
            <li>so it can mold better around your teeth</li>
            <li>I found it a bit challenging to use my tooth bleaching gel with them.</li>
            <li>, okay, they got my 5 bucks.</li>
            <li>I am glad</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it and you will love it too.</li>
            <li>They can also easily be trimmed to fit.</li>
            <li>So both trays are fine now, and will work for what they&#x27;re intended to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and now they fit just fine.</li>
            <li>The fit isn&#x27;t dentist quality</li>
            <li>and i could not get them to fit in my mouth.</li>
            <li>So today I tried it, because I actually felt like I could be brave</li>
            <li>Of course I read all reviews and most were very positive.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>It worked great and wasn&#x27;t a super tight fit, but it&#x27;s fine for what I need it for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>More than reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>(gheesh, I really need to push my boundaries more), and put a pot of water on the stove to boil.</li>
            <li>Very large and too rigid!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit right</li>
            <li>easy to apply you have to be quick when you place them in hot water.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the quick service</li>
            <li>Delievered quickly.  </li>
            <li>but it still cuts into my gums (I have normal healthy gums).</li>
            <li>I put them in for 10 second, and that worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>If you are expecting a professional molded result from a dentists office then you better pass but for me i wanted something quick and \\&quot;easy\\&quot; on the wallet that would get the job done and for me these do just that.</li>
            <li>So i was very glad this came with two sets because i totally messed up the first pair :</li>
            <li>/&gt;they hug right to your teeth.</li>
            <li>SO I took the third one and placed it in the water for 2 seconds and put it directly in my mouth and it somewhat has a good fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They will turn soft very quick and stick together</li>
            <li>First time tried to use it with no luck.</li>
            <li>First off, I bought 2 sets of mouth trays.</li>
            <li>I put the first tray in for 10 seconds and it collapsed into itself.</li>
            <li>First of all, it is not two sets but just one.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of teeth trays.</li>
            <li>The trays are exactly as pictured and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Can make molds correctly even after you dip them in hot water.</li>
            <li>These work and are exactly what you would expect.  </li>
            <li>After placing trays in hot water than putting them in my mouth to mold them.  </li>
            <li>Product exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping these would fit to my teeth just a little better.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t complain too much ;-)</li>
            <li>This was easy to use as it formed to my teeth after following the directions included in the envelope it cam in.  </li>
            <li>second tray got smooshed down and flattened where my molars are LOL</li>
            <li>They are very bulky, but mold easily and work well enough.</li>
            <li>Overall I am not super pleased but more \\&quot;content \\&quot; with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Do not use--too cheap to send back.</li>
            <li>They really did not form that well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for offering this.</li>
            <li>The molds go from being too big or melted in a split second when following the instructions and attempted to warm then dip it to make the correct size won&#x27;t be warm enough to mold to the teeth.  </li>
            <li>After trying  many types  of these it was cheaper  in the  long run to go to the dentist  and have new trays made.</li>
            <li>After three seconds in boiling water these things turned into a caterpillar like mush, twisted out of useful shape and so resolutely unredeemable as to wonder why the manufacturer does not include a more credible instruction set.</li>
            <li>They make a decent impression for your teeth</li>
            <li>and they got soft much quicker than I anticipated</li>
            <li>but I got it right on the second try.</li>
            <li>w/a second hand), take them out right away and stick them in your mouth.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t even fit properly, meaning that they are to big if you want to use them for whitening your teeth.</li>
            <li>these trays are big and dont form well to the mouth after they are placed in hot water.</li>
            <li>In this case more is definitely not better SOOO follow directions as written.</li>
            <li>Rec&#x27;d order quickly, was what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Completely melted even after 5 seconds in the water.</li>
            <li>so it was completely destroyed immediately.</li>
            <li>My teeth are way whiter and just as white or more than what I paid a dentist to do for me a few years ago...</li>
            <li>Wait a minute while they cool down</li>
            <li>Not really sure fit</li>
            <li>I hate to say that because the product itself might be very good</li>
            <li>but I ended up ruining three of the trays because the directions aren&#x27;t clear enough.</li>
            <li>I was pretty weirded out by the reviews that stated how difficult these are to fit.</li>
            <li>Even if they fit they are too hard to work well!  </li>
            <li>too big and not a good fit</li>
            <li>The trays are not long enough.</li>
            <li>these will not mold to your teeth so much that they actually catch every detail, but they do shrink down enough that they&#x27;ll keep whitening gel inside of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heat them too little and they won&#x27;t mold, heat them too much</li>

            <li> I had to end up cutting to fit</li>
            <li> I thought these were so much harder to use than</li>
            <li> Still in their packages,  the way the tooth whitener comes&lt;br /&gt;you really do not need..</li>
            <li> Total waste money.</li>
            <li> I gave 5 stars due to no fault of company  nor there product.</li>
            <li> They are not worth your time.</li>
            <li> This is not worth even a $1.</li>
            <li> They give you two in case you mess up.</li>
            <li> but they are a little less quality than what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And when you dip them, grab the little handle with a pair of tongs, and count the seconds out (unless you have a clock or watch</li>
            <li> I had to trim mine down a lot b/c I have a very little mouth.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> They are not easy to use.</li>
            <li> The first tray wasn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> When i put them in my mouth, I immediately noticed they were bulky (or i have an extremely small mouth)</li>
            <li> No more than a sports mouthy guard.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to receive item as I purchased another brand.</li>
            <li> Instructions are wrong - 15 secs in boiling water is way too long for molding and will disenegrate the trays.</li>
            <li> Tray felt too thick as I have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> Hard to mold around teeth for whitening purposes.</li>
            <li> They are horrible for whitening and to make fit your mouth.</li>
            <li> Very annoying and doesn&#x27;t fit at all.</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not great for whitening.</li>
            <li> but I was unable to make it work.</li>
            <li> and it just seems useless.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> These are terrible.</li>
            <li> They are just terrible and had  to throw them out.</li>
            <li> These ones are horrible!</li>
            <li> Worst trays ever!</li>

            <li> good just wait for water to cool don&#x27;t be overzealous it will melt believe me</li>
            <li> These are terrible. I wish I could give 0 stars. They are not easy to use. Completely melted even after 5 seconds in the water. The sides collapsed. They are just terrible and had  to throw them out.</li>
            <li> First time tried to use it with no luck.</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d order quickly, was what I expected.  Would order again if item is needed. Thank you for the quick service</li>
            <li> I thought these were so much harder to use than if I just used my retainer that my doctor gave me.  They are horrible for whitening and to make fit your mouth.</li>
            <li> I have used trays before so I had in idea what to expect and how to mold them. These ones are horrible! Heat them too little and they won&#x27;t mold, heat them too much and they fall apart. Maybe if I had 10 pairs to experiment with I might have ended up with sort of usable trays , but I didn&#x27;t . The picture shows four trays and because of the reviews I was under the impression that I would get more than two trays, but that&#x27;s what I got. Quantity is two trays, not two sets.</li>
            <li> The trays were almost impossible to fit and were very flimsy. I hate to say that because the product itself might be very good but I was unable to make it work. I will need to find a better tray for the whitening gel.</li>
            <li> Very annoying and doesn&#x27;t fit at all. I followed the directions to a T twice and it just seems useless.</li>
            <li> BULKY,&lt;br /&gt;NOt a good Fit at all&lt;br /&gt;WOuld not recommend&lt;br /&gt;I would rather pay 400 for a custom set.&lt;br /&gt;They would work better.</li>
            <li> First off, I bought 2 sets of mouth trays. Which &#x3D; 4 individual trays, and I received 3 trays. Amazon would not send me the tray they left out because it did not cost over $25. Secondly, the instructions say to place the trays in boiling water for 5-15 seconds.. I put the first tray in for 10 seconds and it collapsed into itself. It adhered to itself as well so it was completely destroyed immediately. The second one I placed in the water for 5 seconds and the tray softened up too much..and was too gelatin to support itself when trying to put in my mouth. SO I took the third one and placed it in the water for 2 seconds and put it directly in my mouth and it somewhat has a good fit.&lt;br /&gt;These are basically the cheapest quality mouth guards your going to find anywhere. They are not worth your time. Do not buy these.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit right no matter what I did. I had to end up cutting to fit but it still cuts into my gums (I have normal healthy gums). the gel didn&#x27;t stay bc there were gaps so I eventually threw this all away</li>
            <li> The fit isn&#x27;t dentist quality but they work for i needed them for.</li>
            <li> Do not use--too cheap to send back. Still in their packages,  the way the tooth whitener comes&lt;br /&gt;you really do not need..</li>
            <li> The product was excaltly as stated. But bleaching  trays  they  are not. After trying  many types  of these it was cheaper  in the  long run to go to the dentist  and have new trays made. I gave 5 stars due to no fault of company  nor there product. They dealt  fairly  with me.</li>
            <li> these trays are big and dont form well to the mouth after they are placed in hot water. good in a pinch but i went to dentist to get the custom ones after i tried these, but the price was good.</li>
            <li> This was easy to use as it formed to my teeth after following the directions included in the envelope it cam in.  DO NOT over boil as they WILL shrink as it explains in the directions.  In this case more is definitely not better SOOO follow directions as written.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and popped them in boiling water, and about 10 seconds later they melted. I didn&#x27;t even leave them in for a minute. Ugh. This is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> too big and not a good fit</li>
            <li> First of all, it is not two sets but just one. I followed the instructions but they still melted. Very poor quality!</li>
            <li> I will not buy these again</li>
            <li> Worst trays ever! Please don&#x27;t waste your money they are bulky doesn&#x27;t even fit properly, meaning that they are to big if you want to use them for whitening your teeth. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Geez.  After three seconds in boiling water these things turned into a caterpillar like mush, twisted out of useful shape and so resolutely unredeemable as to wonder why the manufacturer does not include a more credible instruction set.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of teeth trays. No experience with them what so ever... So i was very glad this came with two sets because i totally messed up the first pair :-\ I dipped them in boiling water and molded them to my teeth, upper and then lower and they got soft much quicker than I anticipated but I got it right on the second try. When i put them in my mouth, I immediately noticed they were bulky (or i have an extremely small mouth) BUT i cut and shortened them a bit and now they fit just fine. They do the job! If you are expecting a professional molded result from a dentists office then you better pass but for me i wanted something quick and \\&quot;easy\\&quot; on the wallet that would get the job done and for me these do just that. Overall I am not super pleased but more \\&quot;content \\&quot; with my purchase. My teeth are getting whiter by using them so I can&#x27;t complain too much ;-)</li>
            <li> I was hoping these would fit to my teeth just a little better. They make a decent impression for your teeth but they are a little less quality than what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> No more than a sports mouthy guard. Did not form to front of teeth, only bite.</li>
            <li> I tried to make my own but I ended up ruining three of the trays because the directions aren&#x27;t clear enough.</li>
            <li> The trays are exactly as pictured and exactly as described. Heat them up with hot water, form them to your mouth and you&#x27;re good to go! They can also easily be trimmed to fit.</li>
            <li> I do like them but you have to be patient. Once set to your teeth shape, do not remove to try to set it better. Messes it up. They give you two in case you mess up. I had to trim mine down a lot b/c I have a very little mouth. But it worked after that.</li>
            <li> Very large and too rigid!  Threw them out!  Total waste money. Even if they fit they are too hard to work well!  Save your money.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Nothing special. Just a standard mouthguard. Not great for whitening.</li>
            <li> Can make molds correctly even after you dip them in hot water. You try to cut around the gum part and they get ruined. Not 9a good product</li>
            <li> These work and are exactly what you would expect.  But finding the right boiling time can be hard.  I put them in for 10 second, and that worked pretty good.</li>
            <li> it worked... just to leave it in the water for too long or it will shrink. i wish they were a bit thinner so it can mold better around your teeth</li>
            <li> The molds go from being too big or melted in a split second when following the instructions and attempted to warm then dip it to make the correct size won&#x27;t be warm enough to mold to the teeth.  This is not worth even a $1.</li>
            <li> The trays are not long enough.</li>
            <li> easy to apply you have to be quick when you place them in hot water. They will turn soft very quick and stick together</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work out for me</li>
            <li> Very nice product. I strongly recommend it and you will love it too. I am very happy with it because its very good.</li>
            <li> Not really sure fit and you would have to use&lt;br /&gt;a lot of whitening product to cover your teeth&lt;br /&gt;as these are loose-fitting.  Just use strips,&lt;br /&gt;they hug right to your teeth.</li>
            <li> After placing trays in hot water than putting them in my mouth to mold them.  They really did not form that well.  I found it a bit challenging to use my tooth bleaching gel with them.</li>
            <li> Hard to mold around teeth for whitening purposes. Instructions are wrong - 15 secs in boiling water is way too long for molding and will disenegrate the trays. Need to dip for 5 secs maximum.</li>
            <li> The distributers of this product sent this in a personalized care package and this was nice. My teeth are way whiter and just as white or more than what I paid a dentist to do for me a few years ago... But hundreds of dollars cheaper. Good product :)</li>
            <li> Delievered quickly.  Product exactly as described.  More than reasonable price.  I use them for nighttime anti grind bite guards and they work great</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time. Don&#x27;t bother. Really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, okay, they got my 5 bucks. I am glad, that is how business is ran.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions given with product ordered. The instructions where to boil water and place tray in for 10 to 15 seconds. When i did this the tray melted instantly. Would not recommend this product for buying.</li>
            <li> I recieved one set of trays in this order.  They are very bulky, but mold easily and work well enough.</li>
            <li> These trays SUCK!!!!!. As soon as i place them in  water they melted and i could not get them to fit in my mouth. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to receive item as I purchased another brand. I actually preferred the other brand. Couldn&#x27;t get a good fit on lower teeth. Tray felt too thick as I have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> wonderful product that I will use continuously. Thanks for offering this. Of course I read all reviews and most were very positive.</li>
            <li> I was pretty weirded out by the reviews that stated how difficult these are to fit. I had them in a drawer for a couple of weeks and didn&#x27;t want to try it!!! So today I tried it, because I actually felt like I could be brave (gheesh, I really need to push my boundaries more), and put a pot of water on the stove to boil. Then I dunked them in for 7 seconds each. The first tray wasn&#x27;t so bad. It worked great and wasn&#x27;t a super tight fit, but it&#x27;s fine for what I need it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second tray got smooshed down and flattened where my molars are LOL and I had to actually get an X-Acto knife to cut the fused pieces together. Then I re-dipped it in boiling water and it worked. I actually had to press the squashed side to my teeth with my tongue while it cooled while it molded to my teeth again. So both trays are fine now, and will work for what they&#x27;re intended to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So these will not mold to your teeth so much that they actually catch every detail, but they do shrink down enough that they&#x27;ll keep whitening gel inside of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when you dip them, grab the little handle with a pair of tongs, and count the seconds out (unless you have a clock or watch w/a second hand), take them out right away and stick them in your mouth. Wait a minute while they cool down and you&#x27;re all set.</li>
