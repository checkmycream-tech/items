            <li>gets me through the day ! :)</li>
            <li>I have tried my other products but these work the best.</li>
            <li>These clean up very easily and quickly each night.</li>
            <li>Product works fine for me.</li>
            <li>They are quick, clean and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Sea Bond\\&quot; denture pads are a unique product.</li>
            <li>so it is not as nice as I hope it will be later on.  </li>
            <li>They were put in right after the surgery and just kept falling out.  </li>
            <li>Very much needed this product!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoying</li>
            <li>Who the heck ever came up with the 15 pack in the first place?</li>
            <li>I am a much happier woman now!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>They actually love their upper dentures and use nothing to keep them in and eat just about anything they want.   </li>
            <li>could have sent it in a larger box of 30 or more.</li>
            <li>Finally I cut an vertical slit in bottom edge to get a better fit at the back.</li>
            <li>For me, the best way to do this was to fold the sheet in half then trim a half inch around the edges.</li>
            <li>I found these can be &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; in certain ways to make them into lowers too.  </li>
            <li>Large so must be cut down for smaller mouths.&lt;br /&gt;Perforation lines for different sizes would have been nice, so have a scissors handy.</li>
            <li>recomend it very highly.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that you need to cut them to fit because they are made sooooo</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in a hurry it takes up too much time.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it, and it was a real life saver.</li>

            <li>Would be even better if they offered the 30 packs at alittle less than double the price.</li>

            <li>As a new user, I found it took a couple of weeks to get used to having this extra layer of thickness in your mouth, but that slight reorientation is worth it when you consider the benefits.  </li>

            <li> However, dentures are not cheap and this product serves as a stop-gap measure until a new denture or reline can be done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried everything...from sticky strips to gooey adhesives that were difficult to clean or remove.  </li>
            <li> My upper denture had been moving around a few mm here and there and would not stay up and solid to my palate.  </li>
            <li> No more gumming soft food.  </li>
            <li> They are not only soft and comfortable but there is NO oozing,which I hate.</li>
            <li> Sheets need careful trimming.</li>
            <li> all the time would not have it any other way</li>
            <li> no less attempted to eat!&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical when I happened upon this product in a local drug store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am looking forward to hearing from Sea Bond users who experience this same situation and how you use it to fit tight enough for food not to get trapped underneath which is a terrible problem outside.</li>
            <li> I had a really hard time using traditional denture adhesive, as it either ended up oozing from under the dentures and made me physically ill, or I had to use so little that my brand new custom dentures would simply fall out each time I spoke,</li>
            <li> I would rather have my patients get a remake or reline of their dentures if the dentures fit so bad that they need a product like this.</li>
            <li> I am male in my late fifties.  </li>
            <li> these keep the denture secured to the roof of my mouth and keep food particles from getting trapped in between , i flip mine upside down on a waffer  and trace a line a round the denture , trim with sissors , get it wet then apply it pink side down.....</li>
            <li> The price could be less also.</li>
            <li> It arrived with half the count that I thought..</li>
            <li> The oozing pastes are a mess.</li>
            <li> A little overlapping at the gums helps to hold the sheet in place.</li>
            <li> When I take them out I just rock the plate a little</li>
            <li> I have a low tolerance of things that taste poorly or ooze in my mouth.</li>
            <li> so she brought me a few to try.  </li>
            <li> This is the only way I can tolerate my false teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was having serious problems that I did not realize were serious until after I purchased this product (Sea-Bond Upper Wafers Adhesive Denture)!!!!  </li>
            <li> This is time consuming if you have a small mouth.</li>
            <li> No more throwing up, no more not talking, no more not eating.</li>
            <li> Need to be sold at least 60 in a box.</li>
            <li> Too thick for some people</li>
            <li> Alas, I&#x27;ll probably have to wait till the standing inventory of 15 packs is exhausted.</li>
            <li> and I would get sore - then taking them out and having to get rid of the yucky elastic like stuff all on the roof of my mouth was frustrating.   </li>

            <li> Sheets need careful trimming. For me, the best way to do this was to fold the sheet in half then trim a half inch around the edges. Finally I cut an vertical slit in bottom edge to get a better fit at the back. A little overlapping at the gums helps to hold the sheet in place. My dentures wouldn&#x27;t work without these things.</li>
            <li> I use these every day and they are the best. They are not only soft and comfortable but there is NO oozing,which I hate. The only drawback is that you need to cut them to fit because they are made sooooo HUGE!&lt;br /&gt;Try them....I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like them.</li>
            <li> Large so must be cut down for smaller mouths.&lt;br /&gt;Perforation lines for different sizes would have been nice, so have a scissors handy.</li>
            <li> When my upper denture got a painful chip, I first priced a replacenebt then decided to try the Sea-Bond pad and liked so much I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received 4 shipment&#x27;s of these through the auto ship deal. They are great. Would be even better if they offered the 30 packs at alittle less than double the price. Alas, I&#x27;ll probably have to wait till the standing inventory of 15 packs is exhausted. Who the heck ever came up with the 15 pack in the first place? 12 months in a year. . .DUH  steve</li>
            <li> When I got my dentures ten years ago Sea Bond was suggested to me by an aunt and mother because of it&#x27;s unique way to hold without oozing.  My problem is they only come in one size. I suppose so you can customize them for the best fit. This is time consuming if you have a small mouth. If you&#x27;re in a hurry it takes up too much time.  Why don&#x27;t they come in small, medium and regular (which is large?) It would be very helpful if any one other than me has this problem.  I&#x27;m am looking forward to hearing from Sea Bond users who experience this same situation and how you use it to fit tight enough for food not to get trapped underneath which is a terrible problem outside. I am looking forward to some advise. Thank you, Janis   my email is:  faithmjj@gmail.com</li>
            <li> Forget the dentists and their relining at an exhorbitant cost - the Sea Bond liners still provide a cushion and an adhesive.  I have used the uppers for 10 years after a few mishaps with other products and I would recommend them to anyone - new denture, old denture - I have never had mine relined and I can eat corn, steak, you name it.  Excellent product - low cost.</li>
            <li> Great service and the price.  Also by far the best denture adhesive I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Sea Bond\\&quot; denture pads are a unique product. Instead of being a paste, gel, or powder, the adhesive is impregnated into a pad that rests on the inner surface of the denture. As a dentist, I hestitantly recommend it only for those dentures that do not fit very well and have air space between the denture and the surface of the gum tissue. In this case, the Sea Bond pad fills in in the gap and helps seal the denture. I would rather have my patients get a remake or reline of their dentures if the dentures fit so bad that they need a product like this. However, dentures are not cheap and this product serves as a stop-gap measure until a new denture or reline can be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim \\&quot;Konedog\\&quot; Koenig, DDS</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, as she can&#x27;t stand the more popular products out there for keeping your dentures in.  She says she likes this product much more...and it holds her dentures in perfectly.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable and effective. Need to be sold at least 60 in a box.The price could be less also.</li>
            <li> Too thick for some people</li>
            <li> SEA BOND IS A GREAT ADHESIVE, EASY TO APPLY BUT A MORE EXPENSIVE BRAND THAT DOES THE SAME JOB AS THE TOP RATED FIXEDENT.  I WILL BUY A CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li> Sea Bond products have always been great and so is this one and the vendor seems to be very good in functioning as advertised I would be glad to use their service again</li>
            <li> About a year ago I got my dentures placed. I have a low tolerance of things that taste poorly or ooze in my mouth. I had a really hard time using traditional denture adhesive, as it either ended up oozing from under the dentures and made me physically ill, or I had to use so little that my brand new custom dentures would simply fall out each time I spoke, no less attempted to eat!&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical when I happened upon this product in a local drug store. I purchased it, and it was a real life saver. No more throwing up, no more not talking, no more not eating. I am a much happier woman now!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I ordered.  I found these can be &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; in certain ways to make them into lowers too.  I have a lot of them to play with.  At the moment my mouth is &amp;#34;rejecting&amp;#34; the dentures so it is not as nice as I hope it will be later on.  Just what I ordered.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I thought after having my upper teeth extracted I would have a denture that fit like my cousin and his wife.  They actually love their upper dentures and use nothing to keep them in and eat just about anything they want.   I have had nothing but problems keeping them in.  They were put in right after the surgery and just kept falling out.  Finally after healing a little more I bought some PoliGrip to use.  My dentures would rock from side to side and I would get sore - then taking them out and having to get rid of the yucky elastic like stuff all on the roof of my mouth was frustrating.   I did research on reviews to see what was the favorite of denture wearers and I also saw the ad for Sea Bond on TV.  My cousin had a friend who tried Sea Bond and didn&#x27;t like it (I don&#x27;t know why) so she brought me a few to try.  I absolutely love it.  This morning at 7:00 AM, I put the \\&quot;wafer\\&quot; on my denture and put them into my mouth.  It is now 8:30 PM and I have eaten breakfast, lunch and supper with no problem.  When I take them out I just rock the plate a little and it comes out.  The \\&quot;wafer\\&quot; so far has come right off the plate and I just peel it off the roof of my mouth and there is no residue left on.  My days of staying home and not using my dentures are over.  No more gumming soft food.  I am thrilled that I tried this as I have had nothing but a wonderful experience with the Sea Bond.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I got my first complete set of uppers a year and a half ago.  I am male in my late fifties.  I was having serious problems that I did not realize were serious until after I purchased this product (Sea-Bond Upper Wafers Adhesive Denture)!!!!  I have used them for only two days and they have changed my life completely.  My upper denture had been moving around a few mm here and there and would not stay up and solid to my palate.  I tried paste before but never these wafers.  They not only hold all day but my speech  and hence my over all confidence has increased back to almost  like when I have my original teeth. I can chew on anything without any movement. A+ Thank You Sea-Bond for changing my life.  The oozing pastes are a mess. These clean up very easily and quickly each night.</li>
            <li> never had a problem using this product. recomend it very highly. I buy several packs at a time. mybe you can make it a 30 pack. purchased product through Amazon.com</li>
            <li> As a new user, I found it took a couple of weeks to get used to having this extra layer of thickness in your mouth, but that slight reorientation is worth it when you consider the benefits.  The hold is sure and firm, and the pad seems to even out the tiny mismatches between my dentures and my gums. I use these in conjunction with a small amount of powder, which also helps to give me the feeling of a complete and tight fit at all times.</li>
            <li> i love it will order som more i use this all the time would not have it any other way</li>
            <li> I like it because it keeps my upper denture in place.  Also it feels very comfortable.  Yes, I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> delivery was fast and the product works as advertised, at a discounted price with no hassle. Wish I didn&#x27;t need it but that is life. lol</li>
            <li> could have sent it in a larger box of 30 or more. Probably this is all they had. Product works fine for me.</li>
            <li> I thought I was shopping product for product. It arrived with half the count that I thought.. Be sure and check out the quantity...Didn&#x27;t save me any money..</li>
            <li> I use these pads all the time for my teeth.  They work great.  This is the only way I can tolerate my false teeth.  I have tried my other products but these work the best.</li>
            <li> I need to have mine refitted but i still dont like it when a piece of food gets under the denture , these keep the denture secured to the roof of my mouth and keep food particles from getting trapped in between , i flip mine upside down on a waffer  and trace a line a round the denture , trim with sissors , get it wet then apply it pink side down.....gets me through the day ! :)</li>
            <li> I tried everything...from sticky strips to gooey adhesives that were difficult to clean or remove.  Sea bond strips work great for both my uppers and lowers. They are quick, clean and easy to use.  I will always use these now.</li>
            <li> Very much needed this product!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoying it much.</li>
