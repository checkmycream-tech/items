            <li> Pouches arrived 2/7/2015 as promised.  100% satisfied with product and seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different types of ostomy pouches and have found these to work best for me.  They are easy to apply and easy to empty and rinse.  The only problem is the clip and I cover this so it is not uncomfortable.  Recommend this pouch for anyone with an illeostomy.</li>
            <li> WORKS 4 ME......JUST LIKE THE ONES I USED TO USE(HOLLESTER) BUT STAYS ON ABOUT A DAY LONGER WITHOUT ANY LEAKAGE...I PUT 2&amp;#34; SPORTS TAPE AROUND THE OUTER EDGES TO HELP WITH  SKIN TO STAY IN PLACE.....HARD TO GET USETO  THE CLEAR VIEW...BUT WORKS FOR ME &amp; ABOUT 1/2 THE PRICE OF HOLLESTER BRAND</li>
            <li> I buy them because my grandpa needs them. He is comfortable to use them.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and works so well</li>
            <li> Easy to use- fast delivery- would order again if I still had to use them.</li>

            <li> Great  product  ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüëçüëç</li>
            <li> These are just what I needed.  Would recommend.  This saved me some money and the service was better than I have had.</li>
            <li> Son items were defective son stop working somewhere ripened and not good quality did notreturned any though no time but chap</li>
            <li> Product good.. delivery was a little off</li>
            <li> This one piece ileostomy appliance works, at least for me, the best for me. One piece ileostomy appliances have advantages over the two pieces and the Convatec 22771 is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> The new extra fasting around the outside of the wafer is great.</li>
