            <li> My hair is extremely easy to curl, so this isn&#x27;t usual for me.</li>
            <li> I have to do very small strands in order to really curl my hair.</li>
            <li> and you have to leave it on each hair strand for a long time to even get a very loose curl.</li>
            <li> Just the tool she wanted and works as she expected.</li>
            <li> The glove that comes with is a little thin but feels soft.</li>
            <li> For those who complain the wave is too subtle - curl smaller sections and crank up the heat.</li>
            <li> It takes some time getting use to wearing the glove and curling your hair in one hand while holding the wand on the other, but after you&#x27;re use to it, it cuts your hair time in half!</li>
            <li> , My hair is ridiculously thick, and this just makes me stay in front of the mirror longer to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> At least on my hair because its thick.</li>

            <li> Works great for long thick hair! Better wave than that created with a tapered barrel. For those who complain the wave is too subtle - curl smaller sections and crank up the heat.</li>
            <li> Great size for big wavy curls. The glove that comes with is a little thin but feels soft.</li>
            <li> My hair will not curl for anything until now!!! Im soo stoked, could not be happier with this product</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as I need it to. I have to do very small strands in order to really curl my hair. My hair is extremely easy to curl, so this isn&#x27;t usual for me.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron! Heats up quickly and creates great waves!&lt;br /&gt;My hair never holds curl but it does with this curling iron!&lt;br /&gt;It takes a couple times to get used to it, if you&#x27;ve never used a flipperless iron, but so worth it.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for big curls/waves, heats quickly and stays hot, do not like the stand my hair gets caught in it!!</li>
            <li> Works so well! Perfect curls every time. Just be careful not to burn yourself because the tool does get very hot. Practice makes perfect!</li>
            <li> Wand advertises that it gets up to 450 degrees but it doesn&#x27;t curl that well and you have to leave it on each hair strand for a long time to even get a very loose curl. Curl did not hold up well.</li>
            <li> I love my new wand.  I needed a wider barrel after growing my hair out and this is the perfect size.  It heats up quickly and stays hot.  I also love that the on/off switch is not located in the spot where you naturally rest your thumb on the handle (like most other curling irons).  I used to accidentally turn curling irons off and have to wait for it to heat up again, but that&#x27;s not a problem with this wand.</li>
            <li> The item was good, it just did not fit me right, My hair is ridiculously thick, and this just makes me stay in front of the mirror longer to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron!! It makes nice big waves on my long dark hair. I get compliments all the time!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the glove they sent with it it looks like a a body scrub glove.  Kind of awkward to use because the way weight is distributed. doesn&#x27;t seem to be as hot as it says it is. The curls are pretty, but can only take a small piece of hair at a time or doesnt take.  At least on my hair because its thick.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> my first time using a wand type hair curler and it works great! It takes some time getting use to wearing the glove and curling your hair in one hand while holding the wand on the other, but after you&#x27;re use to it, it cuts your hair time in half! For me it does anyways. Be sure to ALWAYS use a heat protector spray since some users complain it doesn&#x27;t hold the curl well.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my daughter. Just the tool she wanted and works as she expected. She highly recommends it.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of great reviews on this, but I completely forgot that it would take forever for me to do my hair, since I have thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as a gift, she loves it and uses it very often. It works very good.</li>
