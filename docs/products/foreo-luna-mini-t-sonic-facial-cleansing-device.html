            <li>The good part is if you travel with it you won&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally pressing it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY easy (I recommend watching a Youtube video if you want to see how others are using it) and my face feels great afterwards.  </li>

            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I will still use my Clarisonic periodically I am sure, but the Luna Mini is a keeper!</li>
            <li>Why people said it is faked???&lt;br /&gt;It is authentic!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to continue to use the Luna and look forward to more pleasant surprises to come in my quest for the fountain of youth.  </li>
            <li>but this thing is AMAZING for traveling.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product at a discount for my honest review.</li>
            <li>Absolutely loved it :)</li>
            <li>The plastic case it came with can be used as storage and travel but would have liked to see a carrying case.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it cleaned my face as well as I would have liked it to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(*I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review)</li>
            <li>However, my opinion is honest and unbiased.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The full size is great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I was able to give an honest review in exchange for a discounted on the price.</li>
            <li>I love the compact design as well - very easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>My face is very smooth and feels refreshed after using the Foreo Luna Mini.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t charge for more than one use, and it&#x27;s not waterproof.  </li>
            <li>Quite the contrary, I love it and have been using it ever since I got it.  </li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in the size of my pores for the better!</li>
            <li>my skin feels TIGHTER after use of the Luna  4) soap residue rinses more thoroughly from face  5)</li>
            <li>I was able to register this product for the 2 yr warranty, and I have attached pictures of the product</li>
            <li>size (Love the size, love how there&#x27;s no moving</li>
            <li>I assume this would work ok with a foaming face wash.</li>
            <li>Its cute and all, but I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I enjoyed it while it lasted which was about a week.</li>
            <li>I ordered one from the seller VCI Group and it appears to be authentic</li>
            <li>(i.e. I was able to register it on the Foreo website with the included authenticity card).  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s more dripping than I like to tolerate</li>
            <li>Through BzzAgent I was able to get this product in a discounted price.</li>
            <li>have been really enjoying my Luna mini.</li>
            <li>, I think FOREO is better for  sensetive skin and</li>
            <li>Love It！</li>
            <li>This is the best invention to come along in a long time.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s fully waterproof and easy to rinse off after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a Philips Pure Radiance already, and I love that thing.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product at a discount through Bzzagent and after trying it I would have paid full price for it!</li>
            <li>Honestly i dont use it as much as i should</li>
            <li>However, this product is extremely gentle, but effectively cleans your skin.  </li>
            <li>it &#x27;s so cheap on snagshout.</li>
            <li>This product works great, the one-time charge allows you to use for several times (I think 100) before you have to recharge it.  </li>
            <li>FABULOUS</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another feature that I enjoy is that it pulses and tells you when to move from one area to another.</li>
            <li>I use it more than Clarnosinc right now.</li>
            <li>There is no dry flakes on my face and my moisturizer seems to be more effective as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First I&#x27;d like to state that I did receive an authentic Foreo Luna Mini.</li>
            <li>but my face didn&#x27;t feel as clean afterwards as I do with my Philip&#x27;s brush.</li>
            <li>, the Foreo Luna is gentle on the skin and in my opinion does a better job in cleaning the face.</li>
            <li>Got a big discount at snagshout, good price.</li>
            <li>I believe the full size Luna has the &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; setting which the mini doesn&#x27;t, but as a girl in her mid-20s, this product seems to serve me quite well.</li>
            <li>I use this in the morning and night to clean and mildly exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li>It gave my skin a more matte finish (I have a very oily T-zone)</li>
            <li>It also feels more gentle on my skin than the brush cleaner things.</li>
            <li>; vibration serves as a very good facial massage while it is doing the cleaning)&lt;br /&gt;-Product Appearance (Very sleek, very modern looking, like the colors that are offered)&lt;br</li>
            <li>or I felt like it wasn&#x27;t doing anything other than giving me a great massage.</li>
            <li>Luckily u can use any adapter that takes a usb, I just used my phone charger adapter)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and very portable.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is amazing - it&#x27;s supposed to last 300 uses per charge.  </li>
            <li>After some of the reviews, I expected to not like it or have good results and have to return it.  </li>
            <li>This is a fun product</li>
            <li>LOVED the Mini Luna but was very upset that it only worked for 4 days and hasn&#x27;t worked since.</li>
            <li>Another wonderful feature is that it is very sterile and carries far less bacteria because it is made of silicone.  </li>
            <li>and it is very gentle on it.  </li>
            <li>If you have acne, this is very gentle on your skin and it won’t hurt your face.</li>
            <li>What I love is that it leaves my face feeling very clean, while removing all dead cells and impurities.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s more gentle on my skin, cleanses just as well, and cheaper in the long run because I don&#x27;t need to buy a new brush every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I add a picture which others buy a real one, I think everyone can tell the difference!</li>
            <li>First, I wet my face with warm water, and then put some cleanser on it using a circular motion throughout my face.</li>
            <li>It has definitely changed my cleansing routine for the better.</li>
            <li>I have use a Nutra Sonic facial brush for many years.</li>
            <li>Not a fake one as many have left reviews stating.</li>
            <li>I was scared to order it at first because of all the &amp;#34;1 star&amp;#34; reviews.</li>
            <li>I used a makeup wipe to remove my makeup first and then used the Luna</li>
            <li>First-</li>
            <li>, I felt that it cleaned my skin a lot better than only with my hands.</li>
            <li>I have been using Luna Mini for a month and hasn&#x27;t had to charge it again (since the first charge).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin who is looking for something to help clean their face!  </li>
            <li>but at the same time gets my skin clean!  </li>
            <li>i think this one is a real one not a fake one.</li>
            <li>Also, you can use it before you remove your makeup, because this will clean the entire residue in your pores better than a simple cleanser.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with oily skin, acne, or large pores; you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li>The vibrating was actually very intense on the high speed.</li>
            <li>but if you want to save a few bucks, the mini is amazing too.</li>
            <li>love my luna mini in petal pink.</li>
            <li>Really upset.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It is real one</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and everything arrived great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will be much easier to take when I travel</li>
            <li>and it seems to be a real one.</li>
            <li>(Shape itself is cute, but not very practical when you get to the nose area and around eyes.</li>
            <li>so I could really get into the sides of the nose around my nostrils.</li>
            <li>If you decide to buy this device I would recommend purchasing it from a retail store with a *very* liberal return</li>
            <li>It is really a glorified face massager.</li>
            <li>Luna Mini is so gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much softer to the touch than it was even after just one use.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference in the size of my pores and my face felt so tight, fresh and baby soft just after the first use!  </li>
            <li>love the concept and the look of this product, but when it comes down to it, would I purchase again or do I think it warrants the price tag?</li>
            <li>I would use the higher speed all over my face except my delicate eye area, where I use the more gentle speed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>:- ❧ HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>3 year old also really likes it, but after 3 days of use (no soap just water)</li>
            <li>(Love that its silicone, and doesn&#x27;t have a brush u have to replace every few months.</li>
            <li>was skeptical that the t-sonic action would do more than washing with a washcloth does, but my skin does seem more exfoliated than using a washcloth.  </li>
            <li>Once they determine the device is defective then they will ship you a new one.</li>
            <li>Even though I used the most gentle brush, delicate, my skin would just feel irritated after using it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have a history of eczema</li>
            <li>but my skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>I highly recommend anyone who has sensitive skin to try this.</li>
            <li>This is the first sonic facial cleanser I used.  </li>
            <li>as i expected and more.. although its soft but provide deep cleansing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if everyone who left a review here purchased theirs from this particular link, but mine said &amp;#34;by Foreo fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#34;, and it was authentic.</li>
            <li>both front and back are soft, but the unit itself is very hard)&lt;br</li>
            <li>far as the actual product goes, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Buy direct from the foreo</li>
            <li>and I felt that even the sensitive brush head was too abrasive for me.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not harsh on my skin</li>
            <li>This has completely changed the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li>But the seller had addressed the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; issue and said there are a lot of imitations on Amazon and only the one that says &amp;#34;Foreo fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#34; is the real one</li>
            <li>as of 2/20/2015 Amazon is not an authorized seller of the Foreo Luna mini, thus all purchases are from third-parties and the third-party selling the item changes frequently.  </li>
            <li>Because the third-party seller changes frequently you are taking a risk when ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;ll allow her to try it again only on the gently mode to see if it happens again.  </li>
            <li>I had never thought that I had a sensitive skin until I started using my Mia.</li>
            <li>For reference she&#x27;s a fair skinned red head and has the stereotypical sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Really pissed off that when I first received it, it was open and was clearly used due to damage on the silicone and just flat out looked used.</li>
            <li>have sensitive dry skin and used this with my normal face clenser at night last night and again this morning</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin (eczema and minor acne)</li>
            <li>No worries about brining a charger with you and when youre in a rush- just dry it off with a towel and its bone dry, ready to go back in your luggage.</li>
            <li>There are two speeds, high and low and the high was a little rough.</li>
            <li>My pimples are going down, it&#x27;s so soft, and even my hubby noticed a change!!</li>

            <li> LOVED the Mini Luna but was very upset that it only worked for 4 days and hasn&#x27;t worked since.</li>
            <li> Another wonderful feature is that it is very sterile and carries far less bacteria because it is made of silicone.  </li>
            <li> and it is very gentle on it.  </li>
            <li> If you have acne, this is very gentle on your skin and it won’t hurt your face.</li>
            <li> What I love is that it leaves my face feeling very clean, while removing all dead cells and impurities.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s more gentle on my skin, cleanses just as well, and cheaper in the long run because I don&#x27;t need to buy a new brush every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I add a picture which others buy a real one, I think everyone can tell the difference!</li>
            <li> First, I wet my face with warm water, and then put some cleanser on it using a circular motion throughout my face.</li>
            <li> It has definitely changed my cleansing routine for the better.</li>
            <li> I have use a Nutra Sonic facial brush for many years.</li>
            <li> Not a fake one as many have left reviews stating.</li>
            <li> I was scared to order it at first because of all the &amp;#34;1 star&amp;#34; reviews.</li>
            <li> I used a makeup wipe to remove my makeup first and then used the Luna</li>
            <li> First-</li>
            <li> , I felt that it cleaned my skin a lot better than only with my hands.</li>
            <li> I have been using Luna Mini for a month and hasn&#x27;t had to charge it again (since the first charge).</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin who is looking for something to help clean their face!  </li>
            <li> but at the same time gets my skin clean!  </li>
            <li> i think this one is a real one not a fake one.</li>
            <li> Also, you can use it before you remove your makeup, because this will clean the entire residue in your pores better than a simple cleanser.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with oily skin, acne, or large pores; you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> The vibrating was actually very intense on the high speed.</li>
            <li> but if you want to save a few bucks, the mini is amazing too.</li>
            <li> love my luna mini in petal pink.</li>
            <li> Really upset.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It is real one</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and everything arrived great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will be much easier to take when I travel</li>
            <li> and it seems to be a real one.</li>
            <li> (Shape itself is cute, but not very practical when you get to the nose area and around eyes.</li>
            <li> so I could really get into the sides of the nose around my nostrils.</li>
            <li> If you decide to buy this device I would recommend purchasing it from a retail store with a *very* liberal return</li>
            <li> It is really a glorified face massager.</li>
            <li> Luna Mini is so gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much softer to the touch than it was even after just one use.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference in the size of my pores and my face felt so tight, fresh and baby soft just after the first use!  </li>
            <li> love the concept and the look of this product, but when it comes down to it, would I purchase again or do I think it warrants the price tag?</li>
            <li> I would use the higher speed all over my face except my delicate eye area, where I use the more gentle speed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> :- ❧ HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> 3 year old also really likes it, but after 3 days of use (no soap just water)</li>
            <li> (Love that its silicone, and doesn&#x27;t have a brush u have to replace every few months.</li>
            <li> was skeptical that the t-sonic action would do more than washing with a washcloth does, but my skin does seem more exfoliated than using a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> Once they determine the device is defective then they will ship you a new one.</li>
            <li> Even though I used the most gentle brush, delicate, my skin would just feel irritated after using it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have a history of eczema</li>
            <li> but my skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> I highly recommend anyone who has sensitive skin to try this.</li>
            <li> This is the first sonic facial cleanser I used.  </li>
            <li> as i expected and more.. although its soft but provide deep cleansing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if everyone who left a review here purchased theirs from this particular link, but mine said &amp;#34;by Foreo fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#34;, and it was authentic.</li>
            <li> both front and back are soft, but the unit itself is very hard)&lt;br</li>
            <li> far as the actual product goes, I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Buy direct from the foreo</li>
            <li> and I felt that even the sensitive brush head was too abrasive for me.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not harsh on my skin</li>
            <li> This has completely changed the quality of my skin.</li>
            <li> But the seller had addressed the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; issue and said there are a lot of imitations on Amazon and only the one that says &amp;#34;Foreo fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#34; is the real one</li>
            <li> as of 2/20/2015 Amazon is not an authorized seller of the Foreo Luna mini, thus all purchases are from third-parties and the third-party selling the item changes frequently.  </li>
            <li> Because the third-party seller changes frequently you are taking a risk when ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;ll allow her to try it again only on the gently mode to see if it happens again.  </li>
            <li> I had never thought that I had a sensitive skin until I started using my Mia.</li>
            <li> For reference she&#x27;s a fair skinned red head and has the stereotypical sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Really pissed off that when I first received it, it was open and was clearly used due to damage on the silicone and just flat out looked used.</li>
            <li> have sensitive dry skin and used this with my normal face clenser at night last night and again this morning</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin (eczema and minor acne)</li>
            <li> No worries about brining a charger with you and when youre in a rush- just dry it off with a towel and its bone dry, ready to go back in your luggage.</li>
            <li> There are two speeds, high and low and the high was a little rough.</li>
            <li> My pimples are going down, it&#x27;s so soft, and even my hubby noticed a change!!</li>
            <li> This has helped my pores become less clogged and noticeable, reduced the amount of breakouts and dry patches, and has helped to exfoliate my skin gently to make it look brighter and feel smoother.</li>
            <li> No warranty number, different colors compared with the real one and the picture which display on the web site, the surface is not smooth!</li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;ve only been using it once per day and after 3 days have begun feeling some tightness in the more delicate areas of my face, so I&#x27;m going to adjust the intensity down in those areas for a few days and see if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is to be used with your normal face cleanser and in the past, I&#x27;ve only washed my face manually</li>
            <li> This is a reasonable process if I had the device for a few months but after a week I shouldn&#x27;t be expected to pay this fee.</li>
            <li> With the luna, I remove my makeup with a wipe, wet the luna, put soap directly on the luna, wash for 1 minute, wipe off the soap with a wet rag</li>
            <li> Who knows how long this will take?!</li>
            <li> Plus, I really dislike working with cold water directly on my face, especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> (This is just a solid round unit.</li>
            <li> This is not a cheap product to invest in and I don&#x27;t think the actual cleaning &amp;#34;function&amp;#34; lives up to the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dry flakey skin around my nose and t-zone, gone after two uses!!</li>
            <li> I was at first skeptical about using this product.  </li>
            <li> I had to use one hand to push my nose to the other side</li>
            <li> I find that there&#x27;s significantly less dripping water doing this than any other washing method I&#x27;ve tried and it takes me less time because of the built in timer (I realize I could use a timer myself, but</li>
            <li> Comparison between the two - 1) the mini times the cleaning zones for rotation (like a sonic toothbrush)  2) no splash mess (</li>
            <li> It simply does not get the sides of the nose well, and its too hard to get into small areas)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I thought it cleaned my skin well, I disliked the MESS (water and soap splashing from the brush rotation) and need to replace brush head as an added expense.  </li>
            <li> so I thought I will do a little comparison.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wasted money.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing out on.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Luna Mini a few times now.  </li>
            <li> I subsequently ordered another at a cheaper price from another seller and the seal on the outershell was broken and there was no authenticity card at all, so I&#x27;m returning it.  </li>
            <li> It felt harsh on my skin though.</li>
            <li> I normally do not rave over a product and especially in less than a week, but I must say this product is THE BOMB!  </li>
            <li> so I usually skip it.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time cleaning the sides of my nose with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m horrible with remembering to wash my face, but with this little dude I am stoked to take my make up off and really get in there.</li>
            <li> so I was afraid of using something too rough on my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also like to note that the &amp;#34;button&amp;#34; that you press to turn on and to switch between speeds isreally hard!</li>
            <li> This little baby here is aaaaamazing!!!</li>
            <li> It was a fake; slowly fell apart in 6 weeks</li>
            <li> You should definitely try the Luna, I promise you will not be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> The little pin at the base are rusting.  </li>
            <li> The goods received very bad, simply is not authentic, quality is not good, cheated, I hope you don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I hate washing my face because I hate water dripping down my face/arms and even with a washcloth</li>
            <li> It is a fake one!</li>
            <li> I try to check if it&#x27;s real or fake</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed that I waisted my money and was cheated with this crap.</li>
            <li> Its fake!!!!</li>
            <li> WORST MISTAKE.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Buy direct from the foreo website!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my luna mini in petal pink. Honestly i dont use it as much as i should but this thing is AMAZING for traveling. No worries about brining a charger with you and when youre in a rush- just dry it off with a towel and its bone dry, ready to go back in your luggage. I never find myself worrying about accumulating germs or smells. An all around intelligent buy.</li>
            <li> It is a fake one! No warranty number, different colors compared with the real one and the picture which display on the web site, the surface is not smooth! I add a picture which others buy a real one, I think everyone can tell the difference!</li>
            <li> The goods received very bad, simply is not authentic, quality is not good, cheated, I hope you don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> thank you&lt;br /&gt;very goooooood</li>
            <li> It was a fake; slowly fell apart in 6 weeks I&#x27;ve used it.  It doesn&#x27;t charge for more than one use, and it&#x27;s not waterproof.  The little pin at the base are rusting.  Wasted money.  Really upset.</li>
            <li> hope use it ,it is good.too</li>
            <li> I was at first skeptical about using this product.  I have very sensitive skin and have a history of eczema so I was afraid of using something too rough on my face.  However, this product is extremely gentle, but effectively cleans your skin.  You can definitely feel a difference.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this!  I have been a Clarisonic user for years but my skin is very sensitive and I felt that even the sensitive brush head was too abrasive for me.  I wanted to check this out after seeing some reviews on YouTube to compare it to the Clarisonic.  I love it!  It has silicone bristles that are not abrasive at all.  It vibrates and feels good on the skin.  I can use this morning and night and it&#x27;s not harsh on my skin but at the same time gets my skin clean!  I used my regular facial soap and rub it on my face and went in with the Foreo Mini.  It feels so good that I&#x27;m using it every time I cleanse my face.  I highly recommend this product.  I did receive this product at a discount for my honest review.</li>
            <li> It works great. It is real one and it is a great deal. i use it twice a day, my skin is combination-dry, it works perfectly on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already open. Its fake!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it :) Fast shipping and everything arrived great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to the Clarisonic, the Foreo Luna is gentle on the skin and in my opinion does a better job in cleaning the face. The full size is great but if you want to save a few bucks, the mini is amazing too. I highly recommend anyone who has sensitive skin to try this.</li>
            <li> I have used a Clarisonic for years and love it, but it&#x27;s bulky and difficult to take when traveling.  I purchased the Luna Mini with skepticism.  After some of the reviews, I expected to not like it or have good results and have to return it.  Quite the contrary, I love it and have been using it ever since I got it.  It will be much easier to take when I travel and there is no bulky charging unit (and the Luna Mini itself is much smaller than the Clarisonic).  I will still use my Clarisonic periodically I am sure, but the Luna Mini is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I try to check if it&#x27;s real or fake and it seems to be a real one. Got a big discount at snagshout, good price.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin who is looking for something to help clean their face!  I have been looking into the FOREO Luna for a while and then I got the chance to review this product and buy it at a discount and I couldn&#x27;t pass up the chance to review something so amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive dry skin and used this with my normal face clenser at night last night and again this morning and I can already see such a difference in my skin. There is no dry flakes on my face and my moisturizer seems to be more effective as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these at a discount in exchange for a review, all opinions are mine and unbiased.</li>
            <li> This is the first sonic facial cleanser I used.  It&#x27;s VERY easy (I recommend watching a Youtube video if you want to see how others are using it) and my face feels great afterwards.  This is to be used with your normal face cleanser and in the past, I&#x27;ve only washed my face manually and I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing out on.  My face is very smooth and feels refreshed after using the Foreo Luna Mini.  I have very sensitive skin (eczema and minor acne) and it is very gentle on it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face red and blotchy at all.  I love that it&#x27;s fully waterproof and easy to rinse off after I&#x27;m done. The battery life is amazing - it&#x27;s supposed to last 300 uses per charge.  I love the compact design as well - very easy to travel with.  I believe the full size Luna has the &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; setting which the mini doesn&#x27;t, but as a girl in her mid-20s, this product seems to serve me quite well.</li>
            <li> it &#x27;s so cheap on snagshout.</li>
            <li> Why people said it is faked???&lt;br /&gt;It is authentic! Great deal!</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning and night to clean and mildly exfoliate my face. First, I wet my face with warm water, and then put some cleanser on it using a circular motion throughout my face. What I love is that it leaves my face feeling very clean, while removing all dead cells and impurities. Also, you can use it before you remove your makeup, because this will clean the entire residue in your pores better than a simple cleanser. If you have acne, this is very gentle on your skin and it won’t hurt your face.</li>
            <li> This has completely changed the quality of my skin. I&#x27;ve always suffered from acne, specifically cystic acne and milia. This has helped my pores become less clogged and noticeable, reduced the amount of breakouts and dry patches, and has helped to exfoliate my skin gently to make it look brighter and feel smoother. It has definitely changed my cleansing routine for the better. I&#x27;m so glad I was able to give an honest review in exchange for a discounted on the price. This little baby here is aaaaamazing!!! I&#x27;m horrible with remembering to wash my face, but with this little dude I am stoked to take my make up off and really get in there. I have dry flakey skin around my nose and t-zone, gone after two uses!! My pimples are going down, it&#x27;s so soft, and even my hubby noticed a change!! Love it!!! AND the company itself has a wicked warranty as well!!</li>
            <li> It works really good on me. I use it more than Clarnosinc right now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a discount through Bzzagent and after trying it I would have paid full price for it! This product works great, the one-time charge allows you to use for several times (I think 100) before you have to recharge it.  It only takes 1-minute to thoroughly wash your face.  Plus I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in the size of my pores for the better! I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with oily skin, acne, or large pores; you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I have use a Nutra Sonic facial brush for many years. Although I thought it cleaned my skin well, I disliked the MESS (water and soap splashing from the brush rotation) and need to replace brush head as an added expense.  I have used the Luna Mini a few times now.  Comparison between the two - 1) the mini times the cleaning zones for rotation (like a sonic toothbrush)  2) no splash mess (A BIG plus)  3) ease of cleaning of the device  4) my skin feels TIGHTER after use of the Luna  4) soap residue rinses more thoroughly from face  5) the added &amp;#34;anti aging mode&amp;#34; is decreasing the under eye puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My vote is for the Luna over the facial brush!</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;d like to state that I did receive an authentic Foreo Luna Mini. Not a fake one as many have left reviews stating. I&#x27;m not sure if everyone who left a review here purchased theirs from this particular link, but mine said &amp;#34;by Foreo fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#34;, and it was authentic. I was scared to order it at first because of all the &amp;#34;1 star&amp;#34; reviews. But the seller had addressed the &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; issue and said there are a lot of imitations on Amazon and only the one that says &amp;#34;Foreo fulfilled by Amazon&amp;#34; is the real one so I was at ease. I was able to register this product for the 2 yr warranty, and I have attached pictures of the product I received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a Philips Pure Radiance already, and I love that thing. It is a rotating and sonic pulsing brush, its in the same category as the Luna or a Clarasonic. Essentially its a face washing/cleaning tool. Lets talk about the pros and cons of the Luna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Compact size (Love the size, love how there&#x27;s no moving parts)&lt;br /&gt;-Hygienic (Love that its silicone, and doesn&#x27;t have a brush u have to replace every few months. It seems like it would harbor fewer bacteria, etc. than a brush head would)&lt;br /&gt;-Facial Massage (The vibration or &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; vibration serves as a very good facial massage while it is doing the cleaning)&lt;br /&gt;-Product Appearance (Very sleek, very modern looking, like the colors that are offered)&lt;br /&gt;-Ease of Purchase (Can be bought in stores like Sephora or online like here on Amazon or at Foreo)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Price (The price for this item according in store and on here is $139. I do not think product warrants this price tag)&lt;br /&gt;-Stiff &amp; Rigid (This is just a solid round unit. The short silicone bristles on the unit both front and back are soft, but the unit itself is very hard)&lt;br /&gt;-No Carrying Case (Wish this came with a zipper pouch or something that you can travel with. The plastic case it came with can be used as storage and travel but would have liked to see a carrying case.)&lt;br /&gt;-No Moving Parts (The tool itself does not move, it only vibrates, u have to move ur hand in circular motion to actually do the &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;-Shape For Face (Shape itself is cute, but not very practical when you get to the nose area and around eyes. It simply does not get the sides of the nose well, and its too hard to get into small areas)&lt;br /&gt;-USB Charger (There is no AC adapter that comes with it. Its a usb head. So if you want to charge via the wall outlet, u need to have an AC adapter. Luckily u can use any adapter that takes a usb, I just used my phone charger adapter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detailed Review:&lt;br /&gt;I love the concept and the look of this product, but when it comes down to it, would I purchase again or do I think it warrants the price tag? No. I don&#x27;t think it cleaned my face as well as I would have liked it to. I use a gel face wash and it did not &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34; up like it did with my brush cleaner tool. I assume this would work ok with a foaming face wash. But who would want to change their face wash to accommodate a tool? I had a hard time cleaning the sides of my nose with this. I had to use one hand to push my nose to the other side so I could really get into the sides of the nose around my nostrils. The vibrating was actually very intense on the high speed. There are two speeds, high and low and the high was a little rough. I didn&#x27;t feel like it did a majority of the cleaning work, I had to move it around vigorously or I felt like it wasn&#x27;t doing anything other than giving me a great massage. I used a makeup wipe to remove my makeup first and then used the Luna but my face didn&#x27;t feel as clean afterwards as I do with my Philip&#x27;s brush. I used a magnifying mirror and looked at my pores, and the area under my chin and around my nose seemed to still have some makeup residue around it. I&#x27;d also like to note that the &amp;#34;button&amp;#34; that you press to turn on and to switch between speeds isreally hard! I have to use all my might to press it to get it to change speeds or turn off. The good part is if you travel with it you won&#x27;t have to worry about accidentally pressing it. Its cute and all, but I do not recommend this product. This is not a cheap product to invest in and I don&#x27;t think the actual cleaning &amp;#34;function&amp;#34; lives up to the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(*I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review)</li>
            <li> This is a fun product and I enjoyed it while it lasted which was about a week. The customer support from the company was a joke. The expectation is that customers pay to have the device shipped back to them (the customer pays this fee). Once they determine the device is defective then they will ship you a new one. Who knows how long this will take?! This is a reasonable process if I had the device for a few months but after a week I shouldn&#x27;t be expected to pay this fee. If you decide to buy this device I would recommend purchasing it from a retail store with a *very* liberal return policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also unlike a Clairsonic this device cannot be used to remove make up. It is really a glorified face massager.</li>
            <li> First- as of 2/20/2015 Amazon is not an authorized seller of the Foreo Luna mini, thus all purchases are from third-parties and the third-party selling the item changes frequently.  Based on the reviews some of the sellers are sending counterfeit products.  I ordered one from the seller VCI Group and it appears to be authentic (i.e. I was able to register it on the Foreo website with the included authenticity card).  I subsequently ordered another at a cheaper price from another seller and the seal on the outershell was broken and there was no authenticity card at all, so I&#x27;m returning it.  Because the third-party seller changes frequently you are taking a risk when ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the actual product goes, I really like it.  I hate washing my face because I hate water dripping down my face/arms and even with a washcloth there&#x27;s more dripping than I like to tolerate so I usually skip it.  Plus, I really dislike working with cold water directly on my face, especially in the winter.  With the luna, I remove my makeup with a wipe, wet the luna, put soap directly on the luna, wash for 1 minute, wipe off the soap with a wet rag and I&#x27;m done.  I find that there&#x27;s significantly less dripping water doing this than any other washing method I&#x27;ve tried and it takes me less time because of the built in timer (I realize I could use a timer myself, but I don&#x27;t so, I like having it built in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical that the t-sonic action would do more than washing with a washcloth does, but my skin does seem more exfoliated than using a washcloth.  Actually, I&#x27;ve only been using it once per day and after 3 days have begun feeling some tightness in the more delicate areas of my face, so I&#x27;m going to adjust the intensity down in those areas for a few days and see if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 3 year old also really likes it, but after 3 days of use (no soap just water) her cheeks have turned red and appear irritated so she&#x27;s taking a break from it until her face isclear then I&#x27;ll allow her to try it again only on the gently mode to see if it happens again.  For reference she&#x27;s a fair skinned red head and has the stereotypical sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I normally do not rave over a product and especially in less than a week, but I must say this product is THE BOMB!  It is so easy to use and very portable.  Another wonderful feature is that it is very sterile and carries far less bacteria because it is made of silicone.  I noticed a huge difference in the size of my pores and my face felt so tight, fresh and baby soft just after the first use!  I can&#x27;t wait to continue to use the Luna and look forward to more pleasant surprises to come in my quest for the fountain of youth.  You should definitely try the Luna, I promise you will not be disappointed!  This is the best invention to come along in a long time.</li>

            <li> LOVED the Mini Luna but was very upset that it only worked for 4 days and hasn&#x27;t worked since. Really pissed off that when I first received it, it was open and was clearly used due to damage on the silicone and just flat out looked used. But since I got such a deal on it I kept it. WORST MISTAKE. It stopped working 4 days after using it. VERY disappointed that I waisted my money and was cheated with this crap. DONT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!</li>
            <li> Through BzzAgent I was able to get this product in a discounted price. However, my opinion is honest and unbiased.&lt;br /&gt;I thought that if you want to buy this product, you are probably thinking about buying this or clarisonic. Well, I have used both so I thought I will do a little comparison.&lt;br /&gt;I have been really enjoying my Luna mini. I had a Clarisonic Mia before, I felt that it cleaned my skin a lot better than only with my hands. It felt harsh on my skin though. I had never thought that I had a sensitive skin until I started using my Mia. Even though I used the most gentle brush, delicate, my skin would just feel irritated after using it.&lt;br /&gt;This Luna Mini is so gentle on my skin. I had to get used to the feeling of the silicone bristles, but I like it. I like that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel irritated after using it. I also like that this has two speed. I would use the higher speed all over my face except my delicate eye area, where I use the more gentle speed.&lt;br /&gt;Another feature that I enjoy is that it pulses and tells you when to move from one area to another. This is something that Clarisonic Mia doesn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;This is something that didn&#x27;t bother me with Mia, but I had to charge it around every 2 weeks. I have been using Luna Mini for a month and hasn&#x27;t had to charge it again (since the first charge). It says that Luna Mini can go to 300 uses with one charge. So if you use it twice a day, that&#x27;s like 150 days or 5 months!&lt;br /&gt;Comparing between Luna Mini and Clarisonic Mia, in my opinion Luna Mini is the winner! I love that it&#x27;s more gentle on my skin, cleanses just as well, and cheaper in the long run because I don&#x27;t need to buy a new brush every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review can help you.</li>
            <li> I like this product! I also have a Clarisonic Mia2, I think FOREO is better for  sensetive skin and the best thing is you don&#x27;t need to change the brush all the time.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this is really a great product. It gave my skin a more matte finish (I have a very oily T-zone) and it&#x27;s much softer to the touch than it was even after just one use. It also feels more gentle on my skin than the brush cleaner things.</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend did not like it, she preferred the bigger one, not the mini</li>
            <li> I love this product，it is a great deal. i think this one is a real one not a fake one. Love It！</li>
            <li> as i expected and more.. although its soft but provide deep cleansing</li>
