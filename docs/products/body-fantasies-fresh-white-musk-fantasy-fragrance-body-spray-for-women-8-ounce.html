            <li>My favorite body spray.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy more soon.</li>
            <li>Scent was too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Makes my wife smell better</li>
            <li>If you want to smell good and fresh and not have an overpowering scent, then I recommend this scent.</li>
            <li>Never tried before, but love it and is all I use now.</li>
            <li>So, I am planning to buy one more.</li>
            <li>It is very light and easily sprayed on body pulse points.</li>
            <li>I love it, it&#x27;s a fresh smell and everybody else loves it also and want to know what are you wearing it smell so good and fresh</li>
            <li>This is a great body spray and I love the fragrance, but the fragrance does not last!</li>
            <li>Happy to be back to my signature scent.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t enjoy the vanilla</li>
            <li>White musk has always been one of my favorite scents--on me or memories of it on my mother.&lt;br /&gt;After a hiatus of many years I am using it again.</li>
            <li>Clean fresh and beautiful soft and does last</li>
            <li>Go easy until you see how you like it,the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Fantasies body sprays are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is very fresh and clean but also has an attraction of a cologne with out the overbearing  scent that bothers people who are sensitive to smells and colognes&lt;br</li>
            <li>but then it tones down to a nice clean cottony linen scent.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of Body Fantasies Fresh White Musk.  </li>
            <li>I used this as a teen but quit in my twenties because the spray would make me cough, much as I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I have used Body Fantasies White Musk for many years.  </li>
            <li>and I expected it to have it&#x27;s own box.</li>
            <li>The musk has a nice strong smell to it that last very long.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is wonderful and as expected but had leaked a little in the packaging.</li>
            <li>The genuine product has a fresh clean scent that&#x27;s not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>and I had to find a box to fit it in order  to wrap as a present..</li>
            <li>It went straight in the trash.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too much musk.</li>
            <li>Once again this seller is right on the money as far as the scent goes.</li>
            <li>I little bit strong for me at first</li>
            <li>the initial scent is actually pretty overpowering and a couple friends have commented that it gives them a headache.</li>
            <li>Scent a LITTLE strong for me..</li>
            <li>Go to everyday scent.. use sparingly because it can be strong.</li>
            <li>I use it a lot, before I would get the small bottles of it and decided from those to get the bigger size as I use it so much and love it</li>
            <li>When I sprayed it at first, it was a little overpowering but after a few seconds, it was much better.</li>

            <li> I have used it for years and is ver difficult to find in &amp;#34;MUSK&amp;#34; so I get what I can and store</li>

            <li> I love it, thnx  it came when it suppost to come in.</li>
            <li> I wear this fragrance and only this everyday. I have received so many compliments from both women and men on it. It is very fresh and clean but also has an attraction of a cologne with out the overbearing  scent that bothers people who are sensitive to smells and colognes&lt;br /&gt;  My local store has replaced this fragrance with the Signature series and it no way compares and that is why I am looking online so I can still get the PERFECT Fragrance.</li>
            <li> glad to find this. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> So glad to find this. I had all but given up. I&#x27;ve tried other scents this has been my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for about 10 years.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted! Smells great!!</li>
            <li> Go to everyday scent.. use sparingly because it can be strong. One spray and your good to go. Will last all day</li>
            <li> Always loved the smell of this body spray. Price was good too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Body Fantasies, but this is my favorite scent! It smells so perfumy and good, bit it isn&#x27;t overpowering. I love it!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents! the initial scent is actually pretty overpowering and a couple friends have commented that it gives them a headache. I love it and get lots of comments, but not recommended for those with sensitivity.</li>
            <li> The musk has a nice strong smell to it that last very long. Its a women&#x27;s fragrance with the smell of maybe your boyfriend or husband cologne. I happened to actually like smell that are a bit fringed like this one.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The smell is just wonderful. I have used this product for years. I get a lot of complements on this product.</li>
            <li> Really nice. i&#x27;m impressed. lasts too.</li>
            <li> I used this as a teen but quit in my twenties because the spray would make me cough, much as I love the scent. White musk has always been one of my favorite scents--on me or memories of it on my mother.&lt;br /&gt;After a hiatus of many years I am using it again. We went on vacation and I forgot to bring any perfume. Tired of smelling of nothing, I knew exactly what I wanted when I walked in the drugstore. I solved the coughing issue by spraying it close in my hand and mixing with lotion after showering.&lt;br /&gt;All I can think is that it&#x27;s the alcohol or one of the parfum components irritating my upper respiratory system. Once it melds with my skin it&#x27;s gorgeous and makes my clothes smell lovely for days. Happy to be back to my signature scent.</li>
            <li> I have looked in stores everywhere for this brand and fragrance but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores.  Was so happy for find it here online.  It&#x27;s probably been a year since I bought it but I&#x27;m still wearing it!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my grandmother-in-law last year. She loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great size, great delivery, sweet smell, lovely gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Fantasies body sprays are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance since 2004 and use it everyday. It is very light and easily sprayed on body pulse points.</li>
            <li> My favorite body spray. People are always telling me they like how I smell. Put it on in the morning and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this fragrance. It arrived quickly and in great shape, I would buy this again and again, why go to the store.</li>
            <li> I use it a lot, before I would get the small bottles of it and decided from those to get the bigger size as I use it so much and love it</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and is ver difficult to find in &amp;#34;MUSK&amp;#34; so I get what I can and store</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something similar to The Body Shop&#x27;s White Musk, and this product is very similar. When I sprayed it at first, it was a little overpowering but after a few seconds, it was much better. I will probably buy more soon.</li>
            <li> I little bit strong for me at first but then it tones down to a nice clean cottony linen scent.Go easy until you see how you like it,the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is the only scent I wear. Always receive compliments on it. Love,love,love it!</li>
            <li> Scent a LITTLE strong for me..</li>
            <li> Its strong.....has a nice smell like cream......stays on for hours I mean obviously it will start to go away but he smell was still there!!!! I will buy again.....packaging came nice</li>
            <li> Once again this seller is right on the money as far as the scent goes. I have been using this perfume since it came out and it&#x27;s the same as it was then. Not watered down.</li>
            <li> I have used Body Fantasies White Musk for many years.  Recently my local big box store quit carrying it so I looked here for a supplier.  The product I received was watered down considerably.  The genuine product has a fresh clean scent that&#x27;s not too heavy.  I prefer it to Jovan&#x27;s version of White Musk which tends to be too heavy a fragrance for my liking.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and I expected it to have it&#x27;s own box. It didn&#x27;t and I had to find a box to fit it in order  to wrap as a present..</li>
            <li> loved it, has a fantastic smell</li>
            <li> Horrible smelling like a public bathroom, but thats just my opinion. It went straight in the trash.</li>
            <li> Scent was too overwhelming. Something you&#x27;d find from the &#x27;90s.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is wonderful and as expected but had leaked a little in the packaging.</li>
            <li> This is a great body spray and I love the fragrance, but the fragrance does not last!</li>
            <li> I will order this product again love it!!</li>
            <li> Can i take a picture of what it look like</li>
            <li> Makes my wife smell better</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Body Fantasies Fresh White Musk.  It is a subtle but long lasting scent.  Best of all my boyfriend truly loves this scent on me.  If you want to smell good and fresh and not have an overpowering scent, then I recommend this scent.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t enjoy the vanilla but this is the best scent ever! It isn&#x27;t too much musk. Clean fresh and beautiful soft and does last</li>
            <li> My favorite scent!!!!</li>
            <li> Never tried before, but love it and is all I use now.</li>
            <li> It smells so good. When I bought this, it was about $10. It&#x27;s cheaper now. So, I am planning to buy one more.</li>
            <li> I love it, it&#x27;s a fresh smell and everybody else loves it also and want to know what are you wearing it smell so good and fresh</li>
            <li> My grandma loves this . We buy it for her all the time .. It smells pleasant ....and price is good toooo..</li>
