            <li>and we are very light skinned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So many of the cans of name brand suntan lotion sprays clog up</li>
            <li>Worked better for us.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Because of this I use Aveeno whenever I know I will be out in the sun for more than 15 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li>I resumed running this summer and this stuff was the perfect compliment to protect my bald Irish head as well as the rest of me that was exposed to the sun.</li>
            <li>We work outside throughout the summer and have found this to be the best product.</li>
            <li>Came when said it would and was a pretty good price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the spray on sunscreen on my kids since they were babies as it works well and is great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This spray goes on easily and evenly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Spreads easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am happy with this sunscreen and it is the one I use the most out of the 4 different kinds we have.</li>

            <li>Will be getting more next spring for sure!!</li>
            <li>easy.&lt;br /&gt;-Almost tear free.</li>
            <li>Aveeno is not cheap because it is the best</li>
            <li>Need some help after spraying but super</li>
            <li>Wish they still had it in higher SPF to use on kiddos!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and had a decent rating from EWG for a spray.</li>
            <li>it cool you off on hot days when you appy it on</li>

            <li>The nice thing about it always was it was mess free.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was my favorite sunscreen for a while, but recently I switched to banana boat 30spf sports ultra mist.</li>
            <li>Although it is still better to use in an open space or</li>
            <li>I LOVE all things Aveeno, especially their sunscreens and lotions.</li>
            <li>We love aveeno and this is the only place I&#x27;ve ever seen spray on sunblock!</li>
            <li>Also other products seem to run out quickly and more must be applied.</li>
            <li>When applied you can really feel it on.</li>
            <li>but as I mentioned it spreads very easily)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you put on the sun screen 20 min before you go into the water it really is water proof</li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen</li>
            <li>I will say, after contacting the seller they sent the 2nd can, but it was wholly unprofessional to not ship what I ordered and paid for originally.</li>

            <li>Not something I&#x27;m particularly fond of.&lt;br /&gt;-Requires</li>
            <li>It works just as well as the older version, but I&#x27;m giving it a 3 star as I don&#x27;t like the added step of rubbing it in.  </li>
            <li>Only with the hot water with soap</li>
            <li>The baby is _extremely_ sensitive, and was tearing a bit.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin this sunblock is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recently, they changed over to this new packaging and included that you need to rub it into the skin after spraying on.  </li>
            <li>so I generally use Aveeno in the afternoon.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This spray goes on easily and evenly. A friend introduced me to it and I bought a bunch of cans online so I&#x27;ll have it for next season. So many of the cans of name brand suntan lotion sprays clog up and I end up throwing away the rest of the can. I only wish it came in 50 SPF.</li>
            <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;It was my favorite sunscreen for a while, but recently I switched to banana boat 30spf sports ultra mist. The banana boat doesn&#x27;t need help spreading, creates minimal mist cloud while spraying and much less oily. Worked better for us.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0063A448K Banana Boat Sport Cool Zone Sunscreen Continuous Spray SPF 30, 6 Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Spreads easily. Need some help after spraying but super easy.&lt;br /&gt;-Almost tear free. Used it on my face and my 2 yo and 10 mo kids. The baby is _extremely_ sensitive, and was tearing a bit. It didn&#x27;t bother any other kids who tried it on.&lt;br /&gt;-Effective. No sunburns although it is only 30 spf and we are very light skinned.&lt;br /&gt;-Truly waterproof. When applied you can really feel it on. After applying I tried washing it with cold water, then hot water and then hot water with soap. Only with the hot water with soap I felt it starting to wash away.&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t create a cloud of mist you breathe when spraying, unlike other sprays. Although it is still better to use in an open space or outside.&lt;br /&gt;-Nice fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Somewhat oily. I imagine it could be a problem for acne prone people.&lt;br /&gt;-Makes your skin shine (because of the oily substance). Not something I&#x27;m particularly fond of.&lt;br /&gt;-Requires some help spreading on the skin after spraying (but as I mentioned it spreads very easily)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with this sunscreen and it is the one I use the most out of the 4 different kinds we have. I found it to be the easiest to use for impatient kids as well, and I keep the bottle in the stroller for the whole family to use on the go.</li>
            <li> The best of the best. This is the right stuff right here. I have been using Aveeno for about 6 years. My mom gets precancerous skin lesions and has to have them burned off. Because of this I use Aveeno whenever I know I will be out in the sun for more than 15 minutes at a time. I coach baseball and football so I generally use Aveeno in the afternoon. Aveeno is not cheap because it is the best and that is why I use it. When I use other products I notice how they are not very viscous. Also other products seem to run out quickly and more must be applied.</li>
            <li> This product is another great Aveeno product.  I&#x27;ve used the spray on sunscreen on my kids since they were babies as it works well and is great for sensitive skin.  Recently, they changed over to this new packaging and included that you need to rub it into the skin after spraying on.  It works just as well as the older version, but I&#x27;m giving it a 3 star as I don&#x27;t like the added step of rubbing it in.  The nice thing about it always was it was mess free.  But it still works just as well and lasts just as long on busy little bodies.</li>
            <li> I ordered 5 of these for our upcoming beach trip this weekend and was extremely disappointed to find them dented due to poor packing plus all were missing required expiration dates that are located on the bottom of each can.</li>
            <li> I have used Aveeno products since my childhood and I have never found them lacking in any way. When I found this spray-on sunscreen Aveeno Hydrosport product I was ecstatic. Since arriving I have used it 3-4 times and have been 100% protected from the sun&#x27;s rays (I should mention I have porcelain skin and Irish heritage; hence I don&#x27;t tan whatsoever, only burn).&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the seller, Wholesale Depo, I have been incredibly disappointed. My order had specified 2 cans of the sunscreen and I only received 1 can, even though I paid for the 2 cans. I will say, after contacting the seller they sent the 2nd can, but it was wholly unprofessional to not ship what I ordered and paid for originally.</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction. Every place that I sprayed this on my body broke out. It caused me to sweat profusely as well. I didn&#x27;t like it, but it worked for the kids.</li>
            <li> I liked it! Easy to apply and had a decent rating from EWG for a spray. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE all things Aveeno, especially their sunscreens and lotions.</li>
            <li> I use it and I like it</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin this sunblock is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason why&lt;br /&gt;1. it not sticky like other sun screen&lt;br /&gt;2. if you put on the sun screen 20 min before you go into the water it really is water proof&lt;br /&gt;3. it cool you off on hot days when you appy it on&lt;br /&gt;4. has a nice smell to it</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen, I have a pool and use LOTS of sunscreen at my house. Haven&#x27;t found one yet that works as good as this one. I was having trouble finding it in stores at the end of the season so I decided to purchase it from Amazon. Came when said it would and was a pretty good price. Give this product a try!</li>
            <li> I resumed running this summer and this stuff was the perfect compliment to protect my bald Irish head as well as the rest of me that was exposed to the sun. Effective and long lasting. Will be getting more next spring for sure!!</li>
            <li> We work outside throughout the summer and have found this to be the best product. Spray is wonderful and distributes evenly. Wish they still had it in higher SPF to use on kiddos! Very hard to find any aveeno spray in stores.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and it works for me.  I have never gotten sunburn when using it.  It doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing like some other brands do.  It is easy to apply.  I recommend it for everyone.  I had to buy it online because I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores this year, for some reason.</li>
            <li> It is a good sunscreen for the body.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t burn, even after spending all day in the pool.  However, must be used in a well venilated area.</li>
            <li> We love aveeno and this is the only place I&#x27;ve ever seen spray on sunblock! Convenient!</li>
