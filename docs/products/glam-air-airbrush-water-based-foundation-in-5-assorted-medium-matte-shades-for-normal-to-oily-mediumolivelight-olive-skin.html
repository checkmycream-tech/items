            <li>I suggest using a good primer then spray your foundation and Bam!</li>
            <li>great for airbrush makeup.</li>
            <li>and I have never been so happy with foundation before in my life.</li>
            <li>but once you do it is very easy and covers flawlessly!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and has great coverage.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and they were good</li>
            <li>Worth buying to figure out your perfect match</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be one happy camper like I am. :)</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>cleans up nice to.</li>
            <li>I liked the colors of the foundation</li>
            <li>The packaged arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li>I tried a bunch of times and still have not been successful at finding the right shade.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The coverage is better.  </li>
            <li>Will buy a bigger bottle when I figure out the colors I like best.</li>
            <li>Ok so I don&#x27;t do reviews on anything and trust me</li>
            <li>and OMG I love it</li>
            <li>I mixed two of the foundations to make my perfect color</li>
            <li>Love the variety.....</li>
            <li>The wide range of colors made it easy to pick the perfect match.  </li>
            <li>Its cheaper than other airbrush foundation and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It says it supposed to be light weight</li>
            <li>It is wonderful and leaves you with the Matte look without the feel of heavy makeup.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the product and customer service was quick and hassle free.</li>
            <li>but this is some great stuff, takes a bit more than a few drops like I have read for me probably about 10 drops.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s true of any cosmetic product.</li>
            <li>The price is right.  </li>
            <li>Looking at the bottles further it says for &amp;#34;dry to normal&amp;#34; but clearly in the picture &amp; in the description it says &amp;#34;normal to oily.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s good makeup</li>
            <li>MY SKIN IS TOO DRY FOR THIS KIND OF MAKEUP.</li>
            <li>The shipper is super fast with shipping and handling.  </li>
            <li>Somehow I still have it on after working out, and I really do work out - my shirt is soaked in sweat.  </li>
            <li>, I can finally wear foundation and you cant even tell I&#x27;m wearing it, the coverage is light</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin, so I purchased the M Medium Set thinking that the Matte will help with oil control and with the handful of shades I would be able to match my skin color.</li>
            <li>I like it better then other brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I am always ordering something off Amazon, However I finally got me a air brush machine only due to the fact that I have tried so many different kinds of foundations etc.</li>
            <li>compared to all my others it is very watered down no thick ness.</li>
            <li>so if you have a dark spot just dab some concealer over it first</li>
            <li>When it arrived three out of the five bottles said for normal to dry skin (not me at all, and not what I was led to believe I was purchasing).</li>
            <li>Takes a little practice to mix your exact color</li>

            <li> I mix a bunch at once and water it down because I don&#x27;t like the feeling of the very thick texture on my skin.  </li>
            <li> it was just like water with coloring added...very hard to use because it was so watery.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m just disappointed because it&#x27;s not exactly what I thought I was paying for.</li>
            <li> So far this airbrush makeup thing has been the worst experience.</li>
            <li> After a few hours my t-zone is glowing :(</li>
            <li> would like to return this disappointing stuff and receive credit for this expensive experience.</li>
            <li> You can see it on my face like bad, all of them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible makeup...</li>

            <li> Makeup was chalky and grainy did not go on evenly ....would like to return this disappointing stuff and receive credit for this expensive experience.</li>
            <li> great for airbrush makeup. cleans up nice to.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and they were good so I purchased to try them out. I just started to get into the airbrush world of makeup. The makeup totally sucked! Everything it says it does, I have found it does the opposite. I have extremely oily skin, so I purchased the M Medium Set thinking that the Matte will help with oil control and with the handful of shades I would be able to match my skin color. Not the case! When it arrived three out of the five bottles said for normal to dry skin (not me at all, and not what I was led to believe I was purchasing). I tried a bunch of times and still have not been successful at finding the right shade. It makes my face instantly look oily after about 30 mins of wearing, like I have been working out all day. It says it does not rub off, but it does. It supposed to set in seconds, but it doesnâ€™t. It says it supposed to be light weight, I look cakey every time (but that be operator error).  It says itâ€™s supposed to be long lasting, but after a couple of hours all of my imperfections start to show again. Now that I have opened them I canâ€™t send them back. So far this airbrush makeup thing has been the worst experience. I wish I could give them 0 stars!</li>
            <li> Its cheaper than other airbrush foundation and works wonderfully. LOVE them!!!! Just need practice to do the perfect color combination</li>
            <li> The packaged arrived very quickly! :) However it doesn&#x27;t set &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; it stays a little damp so I have to set it with powder. Looking at the bottles further it says for &amp;#34;dry to normal&amp;#34; but clearly in the picture &amp; in the description it says &amp;#34;normal to oily.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s good makeup but I&#x27;m just disappointed because it&#x27;s not exactly what I thought I was paying for. After a few hours my t-zone is glowing :(</li>
            <li> The wide range of colors made it easy to pick the perfect match.  The colors do mix well too.  Worth buying to figure out your perfect match and then order in bulk.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find something to use with my Stream cosemetic Airbrush system and these work great! I wish I could buy a bigger size of my personal color, but I can use the other&#x27;s to do all my friend&#x27;s Make-up. Will definately Order again</li>
            <li> The price is right.  Having several different shades helps me mix my color, which changes seasonally.  I mix a bunch at once and water it down because I don&#x27;t like the feeling of the very thick texture on my skin.  Somehow I still have it on after working out, and I really do work out - my shirt is soaked in sweat.  I use Luminess Air Boost It! (also watered down) to lessen the appearance of dark imperfections before using this stuff over it.  I finish with powder.  Don&#x27;t put too much or you&#x27;ll look silly.  That&#x27;s true of any cosmetic product.</li>
            <li> I like it better then other brands I have tried.  The coverage is better.  It doesn&#x27;t show pits in the face like,others I have tried.  Will buy a bigger bottle when I figure out the colors I like best.</li>
            <li> MY SKIN IS TOO DRY FOR THIS KIND OF MAKEUP.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the product and customer service was quick and hassle free. A+</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice to mix your exact color but once you do it is very easy and covers flawlessly!</li>
            <li> I was looking for airbrush make up to work in my Luminess airbrush kit and this makeup is perfect!  Matte finish with lots of colors to custom match skin tones.  The shipper is super fast with shipping and handling.  Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Ok so I don&#x27;t do reviews on anything and trust me I am always ordering something off Amazon, However I finally got me a air brush machine only due to the fact that I have tried so many different kinds of foundations etc. and nothing worked. You can see it on my face like bad, all of them. Well, I ordered this air brush make up and OMG I love it, I can finally wear foundation and you cant even tell I&#x27;m wearing it, the coverage is light so if you have a dark spot just dab some concealer over it first but this is some great stuff, takes a bit more than a few drops like I have read for me probably about 10 drops. I mixed two of the foundations to make my perfect color and I have never been so happy with foundation before in my life. Oh if you have biggish pores (like I do on my nose and cheeks) I suggest using a good primer then spray your foundation and Bam! you&#x27;ll be one happy camper like I am. :)</li>
            <li> I didnt like this ,its not asgood as luminesse too runny hard to apply cheaper not better</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and has great coverage. It is wonderful and leaves you with the Matte look without the feel of heavy makeup. Love it!</li>
            <li> I liked the colors of the foundation but when you go to drop them in the airbrush gun I had trouble doing the drops .I would shake it a little I got it on my shirt,shower curtain and toilet cover. compared to all my others it is very watered down no thick ness. It seems as water has been put in it. I know the texture of make-up and this one feels water down that&#x27;s why I am dissatisfied with this order.</li>
            <li> Love the variety.....I can mix 2 to match my tan in the summer</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible makeup...if you want call it that. ..it was just like water with coloring added...very hard to use because it was so watery. Would not come out of bottle either...returned asap!</li>
            <li> These colors range from green mud to tangerine. I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my money</li>
