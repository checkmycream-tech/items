            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I used to stock up on it during the after Xmas sales in stores, when fragrances can be had for 70% or more off their original sales price.</li>
            <li>Cool effect!</li>
            <li>Finally found my favorite perfume at a great price.  </li>
            <li>So easy to order online and have delivered to my home.  </li>
            <li>i like it, its a strong smell</li>
            <li>When I was a teenager, I liked this very much.  </li>
            <li>I have worn it for many years and it is always so light and sweet.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance, real staying power, you&#x27;re not going to wash this off on the first try.</li>
            <li>Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last .....</li>
            <li>Free 2 day shipping with Prime.</li>
            <li>It is light, yet smooth and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Light, long-lasting scent.</li>
            <li>It lasts, isnt overpowering, and it makes you smell clean, not overly flowery either.</li>
            <li>Did not have the true vanilla odor.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and feminine but strong (not overpowering)</li>
            <li>It was accessible because the local drug store chains carried it and it was under $20; the perfect price point for a working teen.</li>
            <li>A subtle scent perfect balance of vanilla and musk.  </li>
            <li>and im starting to like it more and more.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>A loyal wearer of Vanilla Musk for over 25 years.</li>
            <li>I wore this in high school in the 90&#x27;s and gravitated towards more designer stuff as my budget allowed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the scent she wore when we first met 34 years ago!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sophisticated scent, but if you&#x27;re looking for a warm earthy tone that reminds you of cozy winters in and baking cookies, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>Simple and nice.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a scent similar to bath and body work&#x27;s warm vanilla, but with staying power, yet I got this instead</li>
            <li>; right.  </li>
            <li>Went right away and got it.  </li>
            <li>Very light though, would&#x27;ve been better just slightly stronger.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have amassed a rather impressive collection of high-end fragrances, but you know, Vanilla Musk by Coty is one of only a few that has elicited compliments.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT, LIGHT BUT STAYS WITH U. &amp; SOMEWHAT UNIQUE FROM RAW VANILLA</li>
            <li>That reminds me I need to buy more in the larger size.</li>
            <li>Reordered more so I would have spare bottles for my travels and an extra for the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Total strangers stop to ask me what it is and say what a lovely fragrance it is.</li>
            <li>Just exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time and I like it.</li>
            <li>The soft smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>At first it irritated my nose.</li>
            <li>Not only do I wear this alone, but I will often mix it with other perfumes and it never fails, people come up to me all the time to tell me how good I smell...especially men!  </li>
            <li>Not too sweet and not too musky like many other vanillas.</li>
            <li>but when it settles on your skin/clothes its a soft sweet smell.</li>
            <li>A soft kinda sweet vanillary floral smell...</li>
            <li>It lasts all day &amp; the sillage is quite big so go easy with spraying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it smells too strongly of musk and not enough like vanilla, and the smell was gone by the time I was out of the house</li>
            <li>This cologne is the only scent I can use that does not cause my allergy to strong orders  create an asthma attack and sinus headaches.  </li>
            <li>Either they were too light or way to strong and heavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for a decade and it works very well with my body chemistry.  </li>
            <li>Smells just as provocative and playful as it did when it was available at the local drugstores.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s unusual for me.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter loves this stuff --- a little sweet for this old lady --- and it was a really good price.</li>
            <li>The mixture of Vanilla and Musk feels very primal and sweet at the same time.</li>
            <li>Personally I find this to be a very balanced scent--not too floral, not too vanilla, not too sweet.  </li>
            <li>It is lite but last and is not too sweet.</li>
            <li>This smell is less musk and more sandalwood vanilla.</li>
            <li>My husband immediately remembered me wearing it in high school and he loves it on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it since high school</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>For the better part of a year, I tried quite a few that wasn&#x27;t quite what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light, vanilla then musky smell, like it moves from one to the other.</li>
            <li>However I do end up smelling a little too sweet!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m given to understand that the exact scent can vary from person to person given how it reacts to our individual chemical signatures.</li>
            <li>I am a fresh baby all day long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in stores any more</li>
            <li>My favorite Cologne spray that&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li>Soft scent.</li>
            <li>Scent is soft but lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Normally I like my scents with only a bit of sweet to them, but I was curious and wanted to try a vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t cause people to leave the elevator floors early.  </li>
            <li>I used to wear this perfume decades ago, when I was in middle and high school.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not over-bearing in scent, but very earthy and remains on my clothes for a long time.</li>
            <li>Yes it was exactly what I expected..</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>we used to be able to find this scent in stores, but now it is so hard to find!</li>
            <li>I love this cologne by Coty but is very hard to find offline.</li>
            <li>In the last 5 or 6 years it has become difficult to find, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon at a reasonable, though definitely not &#x27;sale&#x27; price.</li>
            <li>PEOPLE IN GENERAL ASK WHAT I AM WEARING.  </li>

            <li> A loyal wearer of Vanilla Musk for over 25 years.</li>
            <li> I wore this in high school in the 90&#x27;s and gravitated towards more designer stuff as my budget allowed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the scent she wore when we first met 34 years ago!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sophisticated scent, but if you&#x27;re looking for a warm earthy tone that reminds you of cozy winters in and baking cookies, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Simple and nice.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a scent similar to bath and body work&#x27;s warm vanilla, but with staying power, yet I got this instead</li>
            <li> ; right.  </li>
            <li> Went right away and got it.  </li>
            <li> Very light though, would&#x27;ve been better just slightly stronger.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have amassed a rather impressive collection of high-end fragrances, but you know, Vanilla Musk by Coty is one of only a few that has elicited compliments.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, LIGHT BUT STAYS WITH U. &amp; SOMEWHAT UNIQUE FROM RAW VANILLA</li>
            <li> That reminds me I need to buy more in the larger size.</li>
            <li> Reordered more so I would have spare bottles for my travels and an extra for the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Total strangers stop to ask me what it is and say what a lovely fragrance it is.</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time and I like it.</li>
            <li> The soft smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> At first it irritated my nose.</li>
            <li> Not only do I wear this alone, but I will often mix it with other perfumes and it never fails, people come up to me all the time to tell me how good I smell...especially men!  </li>
            <li> Not too sweet and not too musky like many other vanillas.</li>
            <li> but when it settles on your skin/clothes its a soft sweet smell.</li>
            <li> A soft kinda sweet vanillary floral smell...</li>
            <li> It lasts all day &amp; the sillage is quite big so go easy with spraying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it smells too strongly of musk and not enough like vanilla, and the smell was gone by the time I was out of the house</li>
            <li> This cologne is the only scent I can use that does not cause my allergy to strong orders  create an asthma attack and sinus headaches.  </li>
            <li> Either they were too light or way to strong and heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for a decade and it works very well with my body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> Smells just as provocative and playful as it did when it was available at the local drugstores.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s unusual for me.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter loves this stuff --- a little sweet for this old lady --- and it was a really good price.</li>
            <li> The mixture of Vanilla and Musk feels very primal and sweet at the same time.</li>
            <li> Personally I find this to be a very balanced scent--not too floral, not too vanilla, not too sweet.  </li>
            <li> It is lite but last and is not too sweet.</li>
            <li> This smell is less musk and more sandalwood vanilla.</li>
            <li> My husband immediately remembered me wearing it in high school and he loves it on me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it since high school</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> For the better part of a year, I tried quite a few that wasn&#x27;t quite what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light, vanilla then musky smell, like it moves from one to the other.</li>
            <li> However I do end up smelling a little too sweet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m given to understand that the exact scent can vary from person to person given how it reacts to our individual chemical signatures.</li>
            <li> I am a fresh baby all day long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores any more</li>
            <li> My favorite Cologne spray that&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> Soft scent.</li>
            <li> Scent is soft but lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Normally I like my scents with only a bit of sweet to them, but I was curious and wanted to try a vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t cause people to leave the elevator floors early.  </li>
            <li> I used to wear this perfume decades ago, when I was in middle and high school.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not over-bearing in scent, but very earthy and remains on my clothes for a long time.</li>
            <li> Yes it was exactly what I expected..</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> we used to be able to find this scent in stores, but now it is so hard to find!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne by Coty but is very hard to find offline.</li>
            <li> In the last 5 or 6 years it has become difficult to find, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon at a reasonable, though definitely not &#x27;sale&#x27; price.</li>
            <li> PEOPLE IN GENERAL ASK WHAT I AM WEARING.  </li>
            <li> A soft, slightly musky vanilla scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I can wear this all year long.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is earthy, sensual and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> , then Coty Vanilla Musk in my palms, applied over wet skin (three sprays for entire body)and Voila!</li>
            <li> Suddenly I could no longer find it locally and tried a few other colognes but none &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I think it smells a little different on everyone since it is a Musk.</li>
            <li> I was curious what musk and vanilla would smell like.</li>
            <li> and I ran out a few months back.</li>
            <li> but my husband cannot smell it because it is not strong enough....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wore other vanilla perfumes and oils in the past, and this one is actually one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Other scents have been tried, but thrown away.  </li>
            <li> After it has been applied, other people ask what scent I am wearing when I can&#x27;t even smell it on myself.  </li>
            <li> But the vanilla smells very fake &amp; plasticy to me; I like a darker, rich, smoky vanilla now.  </li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s like a cozy sweater of a fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do well with floral smells or heavy perfume</li>
            <li> few years ago, I had kicked up my routine began exercising two-three times a day.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> This cologne (I thought it was a parfum - my bad) seems to be long lasting.  </li>
            <li> that are both usually cocoa or shea butter based.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like sickening sweet vanilla either, like you would get at Bath and Body Works.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t regret it in the least.</li>
            <li> Suffice to say, I showered a lot, which in turn made think twice about spritzing expensive perfume that would end up down the drain in a few hours!</li>
            <li> Also, the only time I see this product are at minimal dept stores and it will be very expensive; however, amazon has it for a steal!</li>
            <li> smells terrible and bad , i left it in my hotel room for whoever wants it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that complemented the smell of my soap and lotion but wasn&#x27;t as expensive as the usual scents</li>
            <li> Sorry to say this is very plastic, artificial and unpleasant on me.</li>
            <li> I RANDOMLY saw the bottle in Walmart of all places and the memories came rushing back!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an expensive product and never got compliments.</li>
            <li> I hate giving bad reviews, sorry.</li>
            <li> Is this bad?</li>
            <li> so that isn&#x27;t all bad!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wore this in high school in the 90&#x27;s and gravitated towards more designer stuff as my budget allowed. Recently I saw this at Wal-Mart and snatched it up. My husband immediately remembered me wearing it in high school and he loves it on me. It&#x27;s not over-bearing in scent, but very earthy and remains on my clothes for a long time. I like to spray my scarves with it, as it retains a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say this is very plastic, artificial and unpleasant on me. Some people call fragrances like Coty Vanilla Musk &amp;#34;scrubbers&amp;#34; and I have to say this is a scrubber on me. I hate giving bad reviews, sorry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for a decade and it works very well with my body chemistry.  I don&#x27;t do well with floral smells or heavy perfume smells, so this is the one for me.  I don&#x27;t like sickening sweet vanilla either, like you would get at Bath and Body Works.  This fragrance is vanilla MUSK, meaning it is earthy and warm.  I&#x27;ve even had people that said they do not like the smell of vanilla, but they like this fragrance on me.  So find what works for you and stick with it.</li>
            <li> it smells too strongly of musk and not enough like vanilla, and the smell was gone by the time I was out of the house</li>
            <li> My signature scent at a great price!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne to keep the mosquitoes away from me. Well, it works the best of anything that I have ever tried before. And I have tried about all products that you can think of. However I do end up smelling a little too sweet! But it is vanilla so that isn&#x27;t all bad!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and good service.</li>
            <li> My favourite cologne that I have been wearing for 20 years!  It&#x27;s hard to find in stores any more and I am so glad that Amazon carries it.  A soft, slightly musky vanilla scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> i like it, its a strong smell</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Simple and nice. we used to be able to find this scent in stores, but now it is so hard to find! So happy to be able to order it and have it delivered to our house!</li>
            <li> This cologne and my chemistry work well together.  I get lots of compliments and can&#x27;t find it in any store.</li>
            <li> smells terrible and bad , i left it in my hotel room for whoever wants it. it smells nothing like vanilla .</li>
            <li> Great price, I love the way my wife smells.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I have worn it for many years and it is always so light and sweet. I can wear this all year long.</li>
            <li> I was told id be getting it by next monday-thursday. But I got it today xD FRIDAY! Not the vanilla scent I was hoping for but when it settles on your skin/clothes its a soft sweet smell. And it lingers. For example I got it in the mail. Regular packaged in a box envelope thingy btw. Opened it up. No cracks, the box looked nice. Now thus is like 11:45am and I immediately gave it a spritz. Its now 2pm and it STILL smell as if I just sprayed it. A soft kinda sweet vanillary floral smell... and im starting to like it more and more. (:&lt;br /&gt;First time buyer of this product btw</li>
            <li> like scent... but my husband cannot smell it because it is not strong enough.... so that defeats the purpose</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of vanilla. That reminds me I need to buy more in the larger size.</li>
            <li> I love vanilla and I love musk.  You can smell a hint of both in this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Someone commented that they couldn&#x27;t smell the vanilla but I could.  It&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;not supposed to smell like just vanilla.  There is a nice blend of both scents.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this -- since my kids were in gradeschool and they are now in college. Light and delicious -- I get nothing but compliments. Shipping came on time.Happy to have found them. I can never find it in the stores that carry it, so this is great. I like to stock up when I can.</li>
            <li> Finally found my favorite perfume at a great price.  Reordered more so I would have spare bottles for my travels and an extra for the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I love it, so I gave some to a friend!!</li>
            <li> I used to wear this perfume decades ago, when I was in middle and high school. It was accessible because the local drug store chains carried it and it was under $20; the perfect price point for a working teen. As I grew up (as well as my budget) I began to wear the designer stuff. I had about five - seven different fragrances that I kept in my arsenal but rotated depending upon the situation. My every day go-to fragrances were either: Simply by Clinique, Michael Kors by Michael Kors, L&#x27;eau De Issey By Issey Miyake and/or Flowerbomb by Viktor &amp; Rolf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago, I had kicked up my routine began exercising two-three times a day. Suffice to say, I showered a lot, which in turn made think twice about spritzing expensive perfume that would end up down the drain in a few hours! I was looking for something that complemented the smell of my soap and lotion but wasn&#x27;t as expensive as the usual scents I wore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began looking for a simple vanilla oil/fragrance. I use deep moisturizing soap and lotion (again, multiple showers) that are both usually cocoa or shea butter based. For the better part of a year, I tried quite a few that wasn&#x27;t quite what I was looking for. Either they were too light or way to strong and heavy. I RANDOMLY saw the bottle in Walmart of all places and the memories came rushing back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been through about four bottles since re-discovering this gem! I love how soft and feminine but strong (not overpowering) this scent is. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Did not have the true vanilla odor. But it was nice. will try something different next time Might give it away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what my wife wanted and I get to enjoy it as well! It&#x27;s the scent she wore when we first met 34 years ago!</li>
            <li> she loves this product</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent. I love it and have been wearing it for years. Total strangers stop to ask me what it is and say what a lovely fragrance it is.</li>
            <li> Not the scent that I remembered to be, but it&#x27;s ok.  I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent for the colder months, I find it to be comforting and soothing to the senses. Not too strong in scent, pleasant.</li>
            <li> Got this for a friend of my moms for Christmas. She liked it and wore it every day. So good purchase for her.</li>
            <li> Love the vanilla musk. It is my favorite. And others comment on how great I smell which is an awesome feeling!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this in stores too often anymore.  I wish it came in a larger size bottle and then I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy it so often.  All in all, just love this stuff.  Soft scent. I think it smells a little different on everyone since it is a Musk.</li>
            <li> I hope they never stop making this stuff- I&#x27;ve been wearing it since high school and I have people stop me and ask about the amazing scent I&#x27;m wearing all of the time!  Cheap too!</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I wanted.  Quick delivery.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, real staying power, you&#x27;re not going to wash this off on the first try. Is this bad? You decide.</li>
            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last .....gave it to my daughter and it lasts on her! Must be a case of her body chemistry vs. mine?</li>
            <li> way more musk than vanilla. not a fan!</li>
            <li> I get compliments every time I wear this cologne.  Hearing &amp;#34;wow, what are you wearing? it smells so good&amp;#34; makes you know that you have a hit of a cologne .</li>
            <li> The perfect balance of vanilla and musk. Scent is soft but lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for my mother. A loyal wearer of Vanilla Musk for over 25 years. Free 2 day shipping with Prime. Fantastic!</li>
            <li> not so sweet..not my taste....</li>
            <li> Yes it was exactly what I expected..Love it and thank you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sophisticated scent, but if you&#x27;re looking for a warm earthy tone that reminds you of cozy winters in and baking cookies, this isn&#x27;t it. I was looking for a scent similar to bath and body work&#x27;s warm vanilla, but with staying power, yet I got this instead and I don&#x27;t regret it in the least.</li>
            <li> Heavenly,&lt;br /&gt;It makes me feel so sexy. I love scents. The mixture of Vanilla and Musk feels very primal and sweet at the same time. This is my favorite Musk product.</li>
            <li> Normally I like my scents with only a bit of sweet to them, but I was curious and wanted to try a vanilla scent. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed! I&#x27;m given to understand that the exact scent can vary from person to person given how it reacts to our individual chemical signatures. On me it definitely smells like vanilla and goes from the range of cupcake-sweet to musky-sweet. I also found the scent to be long-lasting; I&#x27;d still be getting whiffs of vanilla hours after applying it. If you haven&#x27;t tried this produce before I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfurm.</li>
            <li> Always wear it so order lots of it at once.</li>
            <li> Everyone compliments it.</li>
            <li> Brings back memories. Smells just as provocative and playful as it did when it was available at the local drugstores.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time and I like it. This may become my signature sent. It is lite but last and is not too sweet.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments on this perfume! I&#x27;ve been using an expensive product and never got compliments. Plus my husband LOVES it. Try it, you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing, the smell is so nice and it actually lasted on me. I&#x27;ve wore other vanilla perfumes and oils in the past, and this one is actually one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> IT SMELL REAL GOOD .  PEOPLE IN GENERAL ASK WHAT I AM WEARING.  IT&#x27;S VANILLA.  ONLY IT VANILLA MUSK BY COTY.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT, LIGHT BUT STAYS WITH U. &amp; SOMEWHAT UNIQUE FROM RAW VANILLA</li>
            <li> This use this daily, I always get compliments when I wear it.. My hubby loves the smell..  My signature fragrance!!</li>
            <li> I guess it just works with my body chemistry.  Suddenly I could no longer find it locally and tried a few other colognes but none &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; right.  I was so happy to be able to find it here!</li>
            <li> This cologne (I thought it was a parfum - my bad) seems to be long lasting.  That&#x27;s unusual for me.  It really doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla. It&#x27;s a sweeter scent.</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for the last 40 years. It is light, yet smooth and not overpowering. I used to stock up on it during the after Xmas sales in stores, when fragrances can be had for 70% or more off their original sales price. In the last 5 or 6 years it has become difficult to find, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon at a reasonable, though definitely not &#x27;sale&#x27; price.</li>
            <li> The soft smell is fantastic. You only need one to two sprays MAX. At first it irritated my nose. I wasn&#x27;t used to any Vanilla Musk perfumes. Over time I grew accustomed to the Vanilla Musk and even when I couldn&#x27;t smell the perfume on my person, my friends could... and they liked it too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Great value! Awesome service! Highly recommend this product to anyone. This is a life time scent for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m A Vanilla Lover So I Love This &amp; ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Reminds me of the 70&#x27;s when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne by Coty but is very hard to find offline. This arrived in great time and not disappointing me as the consumer. Will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> Asked a stranger what she was wearing.  Went right away and got it.  Not floral.  Doesn&#x27;t leave you needing oxygen.  Won&#x27;t cause people to leave the elevator floors early.  A subtle scent perfect balance of vanilla and musk.  Only if you don&#x27;t like musk would I say  choose something else.</li>
            <li> My favorite Cologne spray that&#x27;s hard to find. Light, long-lasting scent.</li>
            <li> have used this for years, have always gotten compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I can get the perfume that I love thanks</li>
            <li> So easy to order online and have delivered to my home.  I like this fragrance, it isn&#x27;t too flowery</li>
            <li> I was curious what musk and vanilla would smell like. It&#x27;s a light, vanilla then musky smell, like it moves from one to the other. Cool effect! Very light though, would&#x27;ve been better just slightly stronger.</li>
            <li> Used this cologne and Vanilla fields a lot and I ran out a few months back. Couldn&#x27;t find it in stores around my area.</li>
            <li> very pleasant fragrance, good for quick gift purchase  but would recommend getting it with free shipping.  Package came as advertised.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter loves this stuff --- a little sweet for this old lady --- and it was a really good price.</li>
            <li> Not only do I wear this alone, but I will often mix it with other perfumes and it never fails, people come up to me all the time to tell me how good I smell...especially men!  :)  I read an article after I started getting all that attention and it said vanilla is a scent men associate with love.  I don&#x27;t know about that, but I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target a few months ago.  When I was a teenager, I liked this very much.  I loved vanilla &amp; musk &amp; this was inexpensive.  It still is inexpensive.  But the vanilla smells very fake &amp; plasticy to me; I like a darker, rich, smoky vanilla now.  The musk is nice &amp; the undertones of sandalwood &amp; cedar make it more interesting.  It lasts all day &amp; the sillage is quite big so go easy with spraying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an OK fragrance &amp; I understand why it&#x27;s still popular; it&#x27;s like a cozy sweater of a fragrance.  But I have moved on.  Another fragrance to pass on to my younger sister.</li>
            <li> everything was as advertised and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This perfume is a wonderful choice if you like vanilla. Not too sweet and not too musky like many other vanillas.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34;. I personally call it perfume, but that is besides the point. This smell is less musk and more sandalwood vanilla. It is light but still warm and inviting. I use this perfume for all occasions, because it is appropriate for all occasions. Highly recommend. Also, the only time I see this product are at minimal dept stores and it will be very expensive; however, amazon has it for a steal!</li>
            <li> Smells great , it&#x27;s a nice light scent</li>
            <li> I love this perfume it&#x27;s my favorite.  It was rapped well and was on time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite perfume that goes with my chemistry.</li>
            <li> This cologne is the only scent I can use that does not cause my allergy to strong orders  create an asthma attack and sinus headaches.  I have used this cologne for years.  Other scents have been tried, but thrown away.  The musk in the vanilla works with your own body.  After it has been applied, other people ask what scent I am wearing when I can&#x27;t even smell it on myself.  It is absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> My favorite. Love it.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is earthy, sensual and lasts a long time. I have always gone to Sephoras or Macys for my fragrances, thinking that expensive was better. But, it aint! This fragrance smells sooooo good, and people LOVE it! It lasts, isnt overpowering, and it makes you smell clean, not overly flowery either. I use Dove liquid soap to shower, then Coty Vanilla Musk in my palms, applied over wet skin (three sprays for entire body)and Voila! I am a fresh baby all day long.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love this scent! It&#x27;s been around forever but it&#x27;s so hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have amassed a rather impressive collection of high-end fragrances, but you know, Vanilla Musk by Coty is one of only a few that has elicited compliments.  Personally I find this to be a very balanced scent--not too floral, not too vanilla, not too sweet.  Vanilla Musk by Coty is a perfect any-time-of-day fragrance which could easily become one&#x27;s signature scent.</li>
