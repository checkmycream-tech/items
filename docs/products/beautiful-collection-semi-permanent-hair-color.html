    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I cannot use permanent hair colors, so this suits my purpose perfectly.  </li>
            <li>My best conditioner didn&#x27;t help my hair at all.</li>
            <li>Another wonderful product that should have never been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li>Great production (I use the \\&quot;black\\&quot; haiir color)</li>
            <li>and I loved it for about 8 washes</li>
            <li>I used this on my medium brown hair (warm darkest brown) and the results are amazing!  </li>
            <li>ran across this on Amazon and I am very pleased</li>
            <li>love my hair products happy with price, thanks</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over ten years because I&#x27;m allergic to some ingredients in the permanent dyes, this product is absolutely awesome</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad for the delivery of my order.</li>
            <li>Therefore I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love that.</li>
            <li>Clairol  Professional  Beautiful</li>
            <li>Clairol Beautiful Collection seems to be a conditioner for my hair: it leaves it really soft and manageable</li>
            <li>the color turns a nice warm brown and lasts a good 12 days with daily hair wash and all.</li>
            <li>It is fast, true to color, and great for the touch up around the airline to extend the time between the full color job.</li>
            <li>My brother could not find available stock in stores in the USA</li>
            <li>Now that &amp;#34;Clairol Beautiful&amp;#34; is available, she has switched to this product.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a bad thing for</li>
            <li>It is messy but it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;I got darkest brown on my copperish hair it turned more of ash olive people liked</li>
            <li>I may not go back to permanent coloring if the color stays after so many washes.</li>
            <li>I used the red copper shade to be a sexy poison Ivy for Halloween</li>
            <li>I was a sexy red head!</li>
            <li>, y use a golden brown color and my yellow color gone, it turn in honey- light brown.</li>
            <li>and i did a mess but was easy to clean</li>
            <li>This works really really well.  </li>
            <li>does come off fast after shower</li>
            <li>And then it washed out completely and left my hair healthy and shiny no problems at all</li>
            <li>It keeps it from dripping all down your face and neck :)</li>
            <li>Touch up with a lighter shade like Honey Brown that will not last more than a week then go back to coloring it with Darkest Brown.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally color my hair because I want to maintain the health of my hair, but I decided to try this product to cover my grays.</li>
            <li>, I have experimented with it over the years and have found that after I apply it, I put a plastic cap on my head and sit under a hair dryer (medium heat) for 25min &amp; the dye sets in the hair better &amp; will last a lot longer opposed to letting it air dry which is stated on the directions.</li>
            <li>and my grays turned light silvery orange ( I bought dark brown color).</li>
            <li>The trick I found is that you wash before time, color for an hour and then rinse until just running almost clear.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews for this, I had high hopes but it just didn&#x27;t overall work for me.</li>
            <li>My Mom has sensitive skin and this is the only hair dye that suits her scalp.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not harsh on your hair, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long in my hair.</li>

            <li> 4 days ago i dye my hair with a stylist, and was horrible, it let me a yellow tone, and im light brown skin,i was looking for a natural tint to fix my hair, and went to a beauty supply and they sell this to fix it.....was easy to used</li>
            <li> I have been not satisfied with the fact that permanent color doesn&#x27;t cover much</li>
            <li> I only have a bit of grey on the hairline</li>
            <li> This is the longer lasting shade I&#x27;ve used, though at the beginning it seems too dark, color washes away progressively and soon enough</li>
            <li> and then you can&#x27;t color for so long or you will ruin your hair.  </li>
            <li> Then after I blow dry and if any grey is showing you can take a swab and some color and cover it up and don&#x27;t rinse out.  </li>
            <li> Every time I go to the hair stylist for a hair color, my hair gets incredibly dry.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my naturally black hair that I had been dying honey blonde</li>
            <li> a note: This type of color dye does not last very long in your hair after a few shampoos.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and have greying that has been hard to color over.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> My shower looked like a murder scene of black dye.</li>
            <li> This hair color really dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Messy.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately &amp;#34;Loving Care&amp;#34; was discontinued, and it went to black market.</li>
            <li> so disappointed when they quit making this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> It is drippy. Solution... Saran Wrap your head. It keeps it from dripping all down your face and neck :)</li>
            <li> love my hair products happy with price, thanks</li>
            <li> 4 days ago i dye my hair with a stylist, and was horrible, it let me a yellow tone, and im light brown skin,i was looking for a natural tint to fix my hair, and went to a beauty supply and they sell this to fix it.....was easy to used and i did a mess but was easy to clean, y use a golden brown color and my yellow color gone, it turn in honey- light brown.</li>
            <li> Clairol  Professional  Beautiful&lt;br /&gt;hair  color  is  the  only  one  I  use,  it  has  no  ammonia  and  no  peroxide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It  does  not  bother  my  scalp ,  it  leave  my  hair&lt;br /&gt;soft  and  shining  ,</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. I use to use Clairol&lt;br /&gt;Loving Care but they took it off the market. I&lt;br /&gt;was so disappointed when they quit making this.&lt;br /&gt;I ran across this on Amazon and I am very pleased&lt;br /&gt;with the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over ten years because I&#x27;m allergic to some ingredients in the permanent dyes, this product is absolutely awesome and I will not trade it for the world, I have experimented with it over the years and have found that after I apply it, I put a plastic cap on my head and sit under a hair dryer (medium heat) for 25min &amp; the dye sets in the hair better &amp; will last a lot longer opposed to letting it air dry which is stated on the directions.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time. I cannot use permanent hair colors, so this suits my purpose perfectly.  Love it</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews for this, I had high hopes but it just didn&#x27;t overall work for me. The upside is it covers the &amp;#34;majority&amp;#34; of my gray and it&#x27;s not harsh on your hair, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long in my hair.</li>
            <li> My Mom has sensitive skin and this is the only hair dye that suits her scalp. My brother could not find available stock in stores in the USA so I tried ordering via Amazon.  I&#x27;m so glad for the delivery of my order.</li>
            <li> This hair color really dried out my hair. My best conditioner didn&#x27;t help my hair at all. It&#x27;s back to Loreal Preference for now.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to hair color with ammonia and peroxide or any of the product in the hair color.  Therefore I love this product.</li>
            <li> Messy. Messy. Messy. Messy. Messy. Messy. Never again. Two ruined towels and one ruined robe. My shower looked like a murder scene of black dye.</li>
            <li> This washes out almost immediately.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Another wonderful product that should have never been discontinued.  I use it for the &amp;#34;in between&amp;#34; colorings.  It is fast, true to color, and great for the touch up around the airline to extend the time between the full color job.</li>
            <li> I think I am going to stick with this product. Every time I go to the hair stylist for a hair color, my hair gets incredibly dry. Clairol Beautiful Collection seems to be a conditioner for my hair: it leaves it really soft and manageable and I love that. Great production (I use the \\&quot;black\\&quot; haiir color)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally color my hair because I want to maintain the health of my hair, but I decided to try this product to cover my grays. I left it in my hair for 45 min and my grays turned light silvery orange ( I bought dark brown color). What&#x27;s the point of buying a product to cover gray that doesn&#x27;t cover gray. Don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> I have been looking for &amp;#34;Loving Care&amp;#34; for years that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. My mom is allergic to both peroxide and ammonia. Unfortunately &amp;#34;Loving Care&amp;#34; was discontinued, and it went to black market. Now that &amp;#34;Clairol Beautiful&amp;#34; is available, she has switched to this product. No allergies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note: This type of color dye does not last very long in your hair after a few shampoos.</li>
            <li> I used this on my medium brown hair (warm darkest brown) and the results are amazing!  I am in my mid 40&#x27;s and have greying that has been hard to color over.  I only have a bit of grey on the hairline but I like to pull my hair back in a pony tail to run errands and such.  I have been not satisfied with the fact that permanent color doesn&#x27;t cover much and then you can&#x27;t color for so long or you will ruin your hair.  The trick I found is that you wash before time, color for an hour and then rinse until just running almost clear. Then after I blow dry and if any grey is showing you can take a swab and some color and cover it up and don&#x27;t rinse out.  This works really really well.  All in all, I am very impressed.  I may not go back to permanent coloring if the color stays after so many washes.</li>
            <li> This is the longer lasting shade I&#x27;ve used, though at the beginning it seems too dark, color washes away progressively and soon enough the color turns a nice warm brown and lasts a good 12 days with daily hair wash and all. I have so much white hair that the roots start to grow and then I need to cover the roots again. Touch up with a lighter shade like Honey Brown that will not last more than a week then go back to coloring it with Darkest Brown.</li>
            <li> It is messy but it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;I got darkest brown on my copperish hair it turned more of ash olive people liked it.&lt;br /&gt;It does come off fast after shower but it&#x27;s not a bad thing for me.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is longish and one bottle covered it 2.5 times</li>
            <li> I tried this on my naturally black hair that I had been dying honey blonde I used the red copper shade to be a sexy poison Ivy for Halloween and I loved it for about 8 washes I was a sexy red head! And then it washed out completely and left my hair healthy and shiny no problems at all</li>
