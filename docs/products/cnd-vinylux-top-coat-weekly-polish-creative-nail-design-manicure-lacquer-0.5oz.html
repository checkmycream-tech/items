            <li>Amazing product with the topcoat and nailpolish</li>

            <li>ABSOLUTELY the best and longest wearing polish you will ever buy.  </li>
            <li>purchased \\&quot;Lavishly Loved #126\\&quot; and the \\&quot;CND Vinylux Top Coat Weekly Polish.  </li>
            <li>good top coat for the vynilux line.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a nice topcoat....</li>
            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>Effective combination.  </li>
            <li>I used it with CND&#x27;s own nail color, and everything started to peel in just a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good product - I love this stuff</li>

            <li>I do my own nails, I have for years,</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>My manicure that I gave myself with Vinylux polish and top coat has lasted a full week!!!  </li>
            <li>the super quick drying time is great, though, and does create a beautiful shine .</li>
            <li>Omg this is an amazing product at an even more amazing price.</li>
            <li>I have never had nail polish stay on and look good for more than a couple of days before using this top coat.  </li>
            <li>This top coat is the absolute best.</li>
            <li>This came quickly and is a great alternative for shellac.</li>
            <li>Love love it!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this top coat!  </li>
            <li>Love this top coat!</li>
            <li>and my nails look pretty good when it&#x27;s time to get my nails done again!</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve found so far that lasts 2 weeks or longer on my toenails.  </li>
            <li>Honestly see no difference with this top coat as compared to others when I used with the vinylux Polish.</li>
            <li>But this top coat is amazing</li>
            <li>It goes over any nail color and dries very quickly!</li>
            <li>100% acatone to easily remove!</li>
            <li>love love love!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Natural, quick, easy, beautiful.</li>
            <li>Great price &amp; fast shipping!</li>
            <li>So happy no lamp needed and not a difficult removal like gel polish.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of top coats and this by far is the BEST top coat I have found</li>
            <li>As described, Beautiful color thanks.</li>
            <li>Somewhere I had read that Witch Hazel, wiped on clean nails with a cotton ball, is a great nail prep - as well as cheap.  </li>
            <li>Vinylux dries quickly and has a good shine.</li>
            <li>Love the color, very light camel.</li>
            <li>Love being able to do my own gel nails and still remove the polish easily at home (I use just acetone polish remover from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply).  </li>
            <li>I did like the top coat.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Now I use the Vinylux Top Coat EVERY time I paint my nails</li>
            <li>Over three weeks using this top coat</li>
            <li>You must try these polishes and this top coat is a must.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, without touch ups</li>
            <li>I love the vinylux polishes.</li>
            <li>It lasts about 4 days on my fingernails, I haven&#x27;t been able to get a week out of it yet.</li>
            <li>Maybe because I still used another top coat.</li>
            <li>Will try using it without a top coat and see how it lasts.</li>
            <li>I love this topcoat.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that my manicures actually last longer than a day.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 bottles of color and the top coat</li>
            <li>Found this polish at a beauty supply store, but am able to purchase it cheaper on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>this top coat goes on after .</li>
            <li>Came quickly and for an exceptional price.  </li>
            <li>Seem to have more shredding nails.</li>
            <li>--which was heartbreaking because I love having polished nails.  </li>
            <li>I have used the CND vinylux  polish,  vinylux top coat and CND  solar oil for about 3 months now.  </li>
            <li>Apply 2 coats of the polish and 1 of the top coat.  </li>
            <li>I love CND products.  </li>
            <li>I plan to buy more colors to expand my collection.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this nail polish for sure.</li>
            <li>I bought more for my family as well because it works so well.  </li>
            <li>The top coat has been staining the nail polish, and isn&#x27;t seeming to be chip resistant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve attached pictures of two coats of CND cake pop color and one coat of CND top coat.</li>
            <li>comes in many many fashion colors.</li>
            <li>I bought this top coat to go along with the Weekly Polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many polishes and top coats, but this one lasts longer than any of them.  </li>
            <li>This product is excellent and does last over a week.</li>
            <li>I ordered both the Vinylux top coat &amp; 1 color.</li>

            <li>Just love the polish.</li>
            <li>AND THAN AFTER 3 DAYS I ADD A TOP COAT</li>
            <li>SAVING ME MORE MONEY.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the strength of my nails.</li>
            <li>This top coat is better than any I have used because it protects the nail lacquer from chipping and breaking.</li>
            <li>I love this Vinylux top coat.  </li>
            <li>I SWEAR BY THIS and have converted many, many friends.</li>
            <li>This top coat makes the polish shine and stay on for most of a week, if you use your hands at work a lot, or in water a lot.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Nails looked healthy when push was removed.</li>
            <li>did not stay on more than 3 days</li>
            <li>I love nail polish</li>
            <li>CND Vinylux Top Coat&#x3D;</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>love Vinylux.  </li>
            <li>It is an okay top coat.</li>
            <li>This is the top coat for the vinylux nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Love working with this seller</li>
            <li>I have never had a top coat that didn&#x27;t chip within 2-3 days except for a gel manicure until this.</li>
            <li>- I think you will be pleasantly pleased.</li>
            <li>So glad to be able to use this with CND Vinylux polish as they are made to work together to protect your nails.</li>
            <li>, I opted for this top coat as an alternative.</li>
            <li>It works fabulous on my nails!  </li>
            <li>I love the nail polish</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lasted 2 days and the manicure was chipping and then on day 3 the top coat was started to peel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the polish, but lacks shine and staying power.  </li>
            <li>Awesome stuff..you can use as a top coat with any polish &amp; it gives it lasting power for about a week.</li>
            <li>This top coat dries in under 10 minutes and my manicure lasts over a week, even working as a nurse.</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to wait the recommended time between the polish coats and top coat.  </li>
            <li>Keep your supply of top coat in the box to prevent sunlight from hitting it.</li>
            <li>And it works for more than 7 days.</li>
            <li>And even better when the top layer is applied</li>
            <li>This top coat creates a barrier to protect the polish.  </li>
            <li>It was okay.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, helps to keep your polish from chipping.</li>
            <li>Vinylux is supposed to be one of the top lacquer nail polishes that wear for 7-10 days.  </li>
            <li>and then put another brand of top coat on</li>
            <li>Love this top coat.</li>
            <li>this is what makes the weekly polish work, so make sure to buy it when you buy the polish, it truly works for a week.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I believe CND was ranked in the top 3.  </li>
            <li>the polish itself went on with a lot of streaks, &amp; the top coat didn&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li>This top coat never disappoints.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I definally buy more.</li>
            <li>Best top coat , I apply several times over the two week period&lt;</li>
            <li>One coat of polish and one coat of top coat</li>
            <li>Love, love this polish.</li>
            <li>Top coat  </li>
            <li>This top coat helps seal the long-lasting Vinylux colors.</li>
            <li>I use it with all of my brand nail polishes and it works like magic.  </li>
            <li>I love this top coat.</li>
            <li>I did two coats of the Vinylux nail pollish and then put this on top.  </li>
            <li>I use this when I need to cover nail jewels and make the surface smooth!</li>
            <li>I start to get cracks or chips in the places where my nails bend most.</li>
            <li>She is on day 9 with the polish and top coat . . .</li>
            <li>So it seems that the better the nails, the better the product will work.</li>
            <li>it is just okay.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own a UV light yet but tried both anyway.</li>
            <li>and I love this top coat.</li>
            <li>It is better than others I&#x27;ve tried, but I have to repair chips after a day or two.</li>
            <li>Love this product and will buy again</li>
            <li>My daughters love this product and are amazed at how well it works to keep their manis intact</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish brand</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love this topcoat.</li>
            <li>I know that some people like it better than I do.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have it put on my nails every week when I go to the nail salon.  </li>
            <li>This works great as directed over Vinylux colors, but I found it also works great over other brand colors.</li>
            <li>works good, recommend using on clean, oil free nails.</li>
            <li>This polish stayed on a full week and more!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not terribly disappointed, but I was kind of hoping I could have found something that worked.</li>
            <li>This is currently the best top coat on the market that&#x27;s available for non-professionals.</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This top coat goes on so easily.</li>
            <li>The Vinylux Top Coat Weekly Polish applied easily as well.  </li>
            <li>For you who have strong nails, you will love the glossy finish.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend this any more strongly.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t recommend this more strongly.</li>
            <li>You need this top coat for your vinylux nail polish to last that good 7-10 days!</li>
            <li>Wonderful product to top coat active nails.  </li>
            <li>It works great even with my normal OPI polish and drys quickly!</li>
            <li>One time I didn&#x27;t have time to do the top coat, and there was a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I know this works great for many people, but the polish and top coat lasted no longer than regular polish on me.  </li>
            <li>love the fact that you don&#x27;t need a UV light.</li>
            <li>It is important to put another top coat on a week into your wear.</li>
            <li>I love the way it stays on for almost 2 full weeks, I wish this top coat was a bit easier to put on though.</li>
            <li>This top coat gives the polish the shine that stays for a week and helps keep it on fabulous.</li>
            <li>And stayed nice / fresh / shiny.</li>
            <li>Good product, shipped promptly, thanks</li>
            <li>My pedicure is on its 3rd week and still looks good!  </li>
            <li>I also bought the polish and it lasted a full two weeks!</li>
            <li>Make sure you paint the tips of your fingers too for maximum success!</li>
            <li>My manicure would look great for a full 5-7 days, but it was high maintenance.</li>
            <li>Smooths the appearance of ridges and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, very impressed with the product &amp; plan to order a few more colors.</li>
            <li>And easily comes off with nail polish remover &amp; a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>It did go on easy and did not clump up.</li>
            <li>I could never keep nails from chipping very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easy.</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly and blends well.  </li>
            <li>It dries very quickly and lasts 4-5 days for me.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>prefer this over shellac because it doesn&#x27;t damage your nails and is easy to apply &amp;remove yourself at home.  </li>
            <li>It dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>Keeps nails strong and holds up in water too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used the Vinylux colored polish (which are good, but not great), but this topcoat is awesome.  </li>
            <li>It is strong and durable.</li>
            <li>Keeps my nails strong and the polish lasts for over a week</li>
            <li>my mother has always had strong nails.</li>
            <li>Special top coat used with Vinylux polish.</li>
            <li>Very good top coat for other nail brand polishes as well.</li>
            <li>Lasts a full week with 2 coats and 2 top coats!&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li>This is really shiny  and looks great when you first put it on; however, it tends to peel off really easy.</li>
            <li>This is a super shiny top coat like the gel ones you get in the Salon.  </li>
            <li>Makes the Vinlyux polish super shiny and lasts about 7-10 days!</li>
            <li>Dries quickly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of shellac but since the colors are a bit pricy</li>
            <li>(Again, still a huge improvement over reg polish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then 2 light coats of OPI color of choice.  </li>
            <li>, I may try it with my gel UV light just to see if it helps.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cure under the light and it peels off in minutes.</li>
            <li>so they are free from dirt and oil.  </li>
            <li>I can polish my nails myself with the light color that I chose.  </li>
            <li>No need to cure it under light like gels.</li>
            <li>not just the cheap brands.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy to find something that doesn&#x27;t peel off the second day after application.</li>
            <li>No base coat needed.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it was on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is amazing and works very well for me.</li>
            <li>No base coat needed.</li>
            <li>Please make additional light pastel colors that are opaque.</li>
            <li>Great lasting shine.  </li>
            <li>The shine was there, and I didn&#x27;t put a fresh top coat on on purpose just to see what my nails would look like after 7 days.</li>
            <li>This combination allows you to use any polish you like for a great looking and lasting manicure!</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice now and both times it chipped on the 5th day which is great definitely will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li>Works great with any nail polish, especially with quick-dry ones.</li>
            <li>so I just add a few drops of nail polish remover and it works great!</li>
            <li>and it srill looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say how well it works with a UV light.</li>
            <li>It kept my nails looking good when I was traveling and too busy to have to stop and do touch ups or take off my nail polish.</li>
            <li>The vinylux left a very nice s</li>
            <li>It also seals the enamel very nicely and the manicure does stay for several days without chipping.  </li>
            <li>The seller is great,  got some issues with delivery but fixed everything very fast.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time 13 days ago and my polish still looks fine!  </li>
            <li>but this one goes on so easily and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I love it at first, but discovered it too hurt the nail, was somewhat time consuming, and I worried about the effect of the light on my skin and nail beds.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to quickly apply another coat inbetween polishes to perk it up.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it when doing my own pedicures.  </li>
            <li>This top coat helps seal in your polish for a whole week and is easily removed without all the steps you have to go through with gel polish.</li>
            <li>Finding this online excited me.</li>
            <li>Overall, I Love this top coat!</li>
            <li>be aware these polishes and top coat to age faster in the bottles and then tend to go on in a rather gummy fashion.</li>
            <li>But for the money and hassle-free removal, it&#x27;s really worth it!</li>
            <li>This is THE BEST and only top coat that actually lives up to its promise.</li>
            <li>My favorite top coat thus far!</li>
            <li>This is a top coat that really works!</li>
            <li>A great top coat really makes the polish last</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>I used as a top coat at home over my nail polish( I used my own regular nail polish not CND).</li>
            <li>I use this as a top coat for regular polish because some of the Vinylux colors are kind of unattractive to me, and it keeps the polish from chipping for over a week.  </li>
            <li>Top coat goes on nice, did not last one week.</li>
            <li>So far, I am every pleased with the top coat.</li>
            <li>fantastic top coat, just dries too fast in the bottle</li>
            <li>I clean &amp; wash dishes without gloves.</li>
            <li>It lasts a good 5-7 days and does not dry out my nails.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, lasts and looks good for almost the entire week and is easily removed with polish remover.  </li>
            <li>This is a beautiful glossy top coat, and I bought it based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews by other purchasers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with the long lasting wear on this top coat, even on my kids.</li>
            <li>I like this top coat the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that it isn&#x27;t shiny which I find kind of strange its matte, so I had to put the top coat on to kind of seal it</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth the $ and dries quickly!  </li>
            <li>Nothing Special here.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to use in special clients who always are dealing with water.</li>
            <li>It works better with their products, but I still get around 5 chip free days--so much better than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really seem like anything more special than things I&#x27;ve already used for this purpose</li>
            <li>Love this product really works</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t get a full 7 days of wear (I have 3 kids and craft a lot with my hands)</li>
            <li>It changed my life :) I really like it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products.</li>
            <li>With this polish, I am assured a full week&#x27;s of wear and they will remain almost intact.  </li>
            <li>overall good, but does not provide a shiny gel like appearance</li>
            <li>I use the top coat over the Vinylux Nail Enamel and it really makes the nail enamel &amp;#34;pop.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Good stuff - helps my polish last</li>
            <li>This top coat for nail polish is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>The top coat is all you really need to use over any brand nail polish.</li>
            <li>If I use this top coat, I get a whole week our of the polish.</li>
            <li>I can no longer wear regular polish and expect it to last so this product line is great when you want a break from Shellac or don&#x27;t want a color on for a long time but want it looking its best!</li>
            <li>For me my nail polish never makes it through one full day (I have brittle nails).</li>
            <li>I loved the shellac-style durability with the ease of removal like regular polish.</li>
            <li>I really like this top coat.</li>
            <li>Good product, same as described.</li>
            <li>However, the Vinylux polishes call for it and really does work better and lasts longer with it.  </li>
            <li>On my toes it lasts a solid two weeks and a good 10 days on my nails.</li>
            <li>Looked good for less than one day before polish and top coat started to peel off from the edge of my nail.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>I did not think it went on streaky at all, and it was pretty easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Works great with other polishes, too.</li>
            <li>I know natural UV light (the sun) is supposed to harden the top coat</li>
            <li>Dries super quick and shiny</li>
            <li>I had chipping almost immediately and noticed that my shine diminished quickly.  </li>
            <li>It lasts for about a week with a regular nail polish and it also dries quickly so you don&#x27;t need a Quickdry coat on top or a top coat.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t raved about it enough, probably the greatest thing about this system is how quickly it dries compared to regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>This get sticky and gummy quickly</li>
            <li>This dries so quickly and you don&#x27;t have to worry about smudging your nails.  </li>
            <li>This dries quickly but still chips in a couple of days not the week that is advertised.  </li>
            <li>I love this top coat and it is totally necessary to use with the weekly polish.  </li>
            <li>Note that when applying, you need a quick hand.</li>
            <li>This top coat works beautifully over vinylux color polish - it&#x27;s all rock hard and looks stunning and professional.</li>
            <li>I continue to purchase it because overall I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, no thinner available.</li>
            <li>Most polishes only last 2 days for me before they start chipping - this stuff is great</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and dries super fast as well.</li>
            <li>Great just as expected!!</li>
            <li>A new favorite.</li>
            <li>My manicurist in Miami told me it is her new favorite product.  </li>
            <li>My favorite new nail product.  </li>
            <li>beautiful top coat, fast trying to a hard finish -</li>
            <li>The nail polish stayed on the whole time!!  </li>
            <li>High Recommend!!!</li>
            <li>It is the first nail polish that will stay on my nails for a week with no chipping!</li>
            <li>Does not last, more like a 7 hour polish!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m back here for more!</li>
            <li>and, I was wearing &amp;#34;Lobster Pot&amp;#34; Red!..:)  !</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying it in more colors!</li>
            <li>Last for more than a week!</li>
            <li>After 2 months of continued use, I actually have nails and they are strong and healthy</li>
            <li>The Lavishly Loved polish was easily to apply and with one coat, the result was a natural French manicure.  </li>
            <li>I have done two manicures with this now and my nails stay absolutely chip free for 5-6 days.</li>
            <li>nice and shinny but does not last a week</li>
            <li>The top coat is so important in making these polishes last a week.</li>
            <li>I added another topcoat layer for fun, and painted another layer on after 3 days.  </li>
            <li>Use this top coat to complete the CND Vinylux system.</li>
            <li>Great shine and last for much longer than a regular top coat.</li>
            <li>, I just like for my polish to look fresh.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>Helps keep my manicure looking fresh for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Drys</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the try.</li>
            <li>The polish rarely ever chips and even though this isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;quick-dry&amp;#34</li>
            <li>First time trying it at home my polish lasted a full week before chipping.</li>
            <li>So far this top coat along with the nail polish has been on for three days and no chipping yet.</li>
            <li>polish.&lt;br /&gt; Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it at that point.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>This nail polish really stays on for a week and has been gentle on my nails!!!  </li>
            <li>I use it on top of OPI and other polish brands, and LOVE how durable this topcoat is.  </li>
            <li>Stays on better than other top coats, but not as well with a Vinylux color underneath.</li>
            <li>it did have started to wear off pretty quickly in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This stuff dries pretty quickly, too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Was really hopeful for this company and the high rated top coat, but it&#x27;s just not working for me.</li>
            <li>did not stay on peeled right off almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I used Acetone nail polish remover and it came right</li>
            <li>I used thus according to instructions and the Polish came right off.</li>
            <li>Look great wet but lose a bit of gloss when dry and prevents me from touching and smudging to check.</li>
            <li>My manicures last a full week when I use this as a top coat.</li>
            <li>My nails overall feel very strong as if I had wraps on.</li>
            <li>After 5-7 days I add a whole new coat of color plus another CND Vinylux Top Coat.</li>
            <li>I am not sure my nails are happy with the product though.  </li>
            <li>It really keeps my nails shiny for a full week and helps prevent chipping</li>
            <li>A great hack from Kate at the small things</li>
            <li>It is nothing less than magical how the polish/top set without any light or special salon machines.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect with my OPI polish; last much longer than with other topcoats.</li>
            <li>fabulous new product by CND.  </li>
            <li>This top coat makes it shine and protects it a few more days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super fast and keeps my polish on for up to 10 days.</li>
            <li>Super fast drying &amp; didn&#x27;t need a touch up for over 10 days.</li>
            <li>Then 2 coats of polish (any brand), then follow with a nice thick coat of CND Vinylux Top Coat.</li>
            <li>So considering that I am happy it last 3-4 days and another coat to last the week.</li>
            <li>Love this, it went on easily and dried quickly.</li>
            <li>my nails look like I had JUST HAD A NEW MANICURE!!!....</li>
            <li>I bought this with the neutral pink, love it!</li>
            <li>lasts longer than typical polish; looks pretty good for about a week.  </li>
            <li>It works very fast to set the polish and it smoothes out any &amp;#34;oops&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>; formula it dries very fast.  </li>
            <li>The Vinylux line it not as long-lasting as the Shellac, but it is so easy to apply, dries quickly, and lasts several days.  </li>
            <li>(also, I used a cheap beauty supply nail polish for $1.99)&lt;br /&gt;They were strong, and it seem like it did take about 10 minutes for my nails to completely dry (which I didn&#x27;t  like),</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so quick and easy to change colors (no soaking, just regular polish remover).</li>
            <li>Great answer to avoid gel polish which is so hard on the nails.</li>
            <li>No other top coat gives the same shine (unless its a UV-set gel top coat) Dries fast, durable and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>A definite must to use over your favorite nail polish color.</li>
            <li>My nails are healthy and I had two chips the same day I put it on.  </li>
            <li>Love how it makes my nails feel stronger unlike gel nails which left my nails brittle.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of this brand.</li>
            <li>Thanks!,,,,</li>
            <li>This top coat was short-lived as mine became gooey after a short period of time.</li>
            <li>CND VINYLUX TOP COAT Weekly polish is just that you only have to apply it weekly</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t last more than a day.</li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>the instructions for the polish said it is only supposed to be used with the matching top coat</li>
            <li>Necessary to purchase this top coat with any of your CND Vinylux.</li>
            <li>I have issues w/nail polish lasting more than 2 or 3 days.  </li>
            <li>not necessarily because they are chipping but more because it&#x27;s a nervous habit.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to other friends, and they love it too!  </li>
            <li>The vinylux system saves me so much time!</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well!</li>
            <li>It lasted the whole 7 days without chipping and stayed shiny!</li>
            <li>Like many others, I have been getting \\&quot;gel nails\\&quot; for several years.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know if the witch hazel prep made the difference, the polish and top coat made the difference, or the sun curing process made the difference, I only know that when I continued using these products and this routine,  SOMETHING made a difference.  </li>
            <li>So now I&#x27;m the working mom with pretty nails who doesn&#x27;t pay $80 per month for them.</li>
            <li>Tried this at my nail salon and made my manicure last for more than 10 days.  </li>
            <li>Was wearing out at the tips at the end of the first day.</li>
            <li>I like this product although it looks glossy the first couple of days but begins to chip at about three days.</li>
            <li>Apply the top coat again a week later and get a bonus week of wear.</li>
            <li>Top coat is essential.  </li>
            <li>It really works too!</li>
            <li>Only lasted two days at the most.</li>
            <li>Two weeks after my manicure (with CND  &amp;#34;Lobster Pot Red&amp;#34;) I apply a coat of this....and BELIEVE  ME...</li>
            <li>FUNNY,</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>nails fast !</li>
            <li>This works really well!</li>
            <li>I will buy more of this with my next polish order.</li>
            <li>This polish costs the same as most regular polishes but has many added benefits.</li>
            <li>You can use it on top of regular nail polish to help keep it from chipping too, not just vinylux polish.</li>
            <li>but it did not last more than 2-3 days before chipping.</li>
            <li>And to top all that off, it only lasts a day on me before chipping.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this item and I will definitely be ordering these products again.</li>
            <li>Great consistency and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I have also applied it as a top coat to extend a manicure with regular polish and that worked well too!</li>
            <li>I love how quickly the Vinylux products dry!</li>
            <li>The CND vinylux top coat is required in order to help the polish to last for  close to two  weeks.</li>
            <li>The strength increases over time from exposure to natural light.</li>
            <li>My regular polish with vase and top coat stays on longer.</li>
            <li>especially since I never think they do a better job than me</li>
            <li>My first time using this product</li>
            <li>I have had to put on many coats and it still chips off the next day.</li>
            <li>but of course the CND nail colors do last the longest when they are used with the top coat.</li>
            <li>Keeps my nail polish nice, shiny and minimal chipping/fading by the end of the week.</li>
            <li>I wash my hands a lot and handwash my dishes, so I was pretty amazed.  </li>
            <li>My grandmother had it and it works really well!</li>
            <li>I was first offered to try this product at my nail salon and although my nails didn&#x27;t chip for a record breaking three days</li>
            <li>Wore this top coat with CNDs gel polish as a regular polish.</li>
            <li>This top coat does not last me a week.</li>
            <li>I used to be an avid Gel Polish Gal - but have switched to Vinylux.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Super high gloss for weeks on end.  </li>
            <li>This lasts just as long ang comes off easy!</li>
            <li>It did dry fast and went on nicely</li>
            <li>This product line is fantastic...dries super fast ....is very durable...and</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, dries quickly, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>These kind of products dont really have nail strengthener ingredients within them so not being able to use my top coat will just have my nails back to where they were weak and britttle.</li>
            <li>It does thicken more quickly than other brands.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and helps prevent chipping better than any other brand I have tried.</li>
            <li>This top coat works together with the vinylux polish to shine and dry immediately and last a whole week easily!</li>
            <li>My nails will only get little dings and chips and still look pretty darn good through Friday!</li>
            <li>Two coats produced a manicure that looks clean and professional.  </li>
            <li>While it dries quickly and has a nice shine to it, I can get my polish to only last a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>This top coat makes the Vinylux polish really shine and it seems to help the polish last longer too.</li>
            <li>It lasts pretty long but the longer your nails are the quicker it chips, even with the top coat.</li>
            <li>This top coat lasts much longer than I would have thought possible.</li>
            <li>so naturally I could open a mini salon in my house with the amount of nail polish I own.</li>
            <li>I use it long time and never see smth better.</li>
            <li>Vinylux is an awesome product lasts as long as stated, even longer if you aren&#x27;t hard on your nails.</li>
            <li>Works awesome not only with the Cnd nail polish but also any other brand for longer lasting color.</li>
            <li>Normally my nail doesn&#x27;t last more than a day, i have.</li>
            <li>Dazzle Dry Top Coat is</li>
            <li>same results as shellack manicure with out harmful UV rays, easy to remove.</li>
            <li>easy application - stays on for a week - may need a middle of the week recoat to keep the shine</li>
            <li>Love the dry time and the resilience.</li>
            <li>I put on three coats, letting each dry in between coats for eight minutes, and then applied the top coat.  </li>
            <li>Regular &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34;  polish or top coat,is normally chipped within a day.</li>
            <li>Application and removal is easy enough, but it does not stay on my nails even 3 days, let alone 7.  </li>
            <li>If you have strong nails, your color might last longer.</li>
            <li>Even when using other brands this top coat cuts drying time way down and the polish is good for a week untouched 10-14 days if you put the top coat on every other day.  </li>
            <li>There are some times that it starts to wear off a little more quickly than others.  </li>
            <li>used to touch up the tips of my nails every single night and add a coat of top coat.</li>
            <li>It certainly met my expectations.</li>
            <li>and I will certainly continue to use.</li>
            <li>Vinylux Polish is easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t stink quite as much as the regular stuff.</li>
            <li>After applying the final top coat, it will be dry and smudge free in under 10 minutes, just as CND claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a much superior product - dries rock hard in 5 minutes always.  </li>
            <li>Delivery timely and fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay...prefer fast drying topcat.  </li>
            <li>DRIES FAST TOO</li>
            <li>this really works without damaging your nails like shellac.</li>
            <li>Really really REALLY WORKS.  </li>
            <li>In combination with the CND Vinylux 7-day polish, this is a real winner.  </li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t ever very shiny and the shine</li>
            <li>I really get 5-6 days out of this polish without chipping.  </li>
            <li>Vinylux goes on well and dries fast and doesn&#x27;t chip off.</li>
            <li>The polish itself has a very watery consistency.</li>
            <li>I used that, which is very watery as well.</li>
            <li>I expected so much more from this product.  </li>
            <li>Really whiney.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really too sure with this product.</li>
            <li>Really works.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Way too much money for what it does.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>much cheaper buy</li>
            <li>Really wanted to try it bcuz</li>
            <li>I even tried to speed up the drying on my second attempt by holding my nails up against the light.</li>
            <li>fast shipping a++</li>
            <li>It really extends the life of my manicure.</li>
            <li>really AMAZING!!&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I was REALLY</li>
            <li>I it also dries relatively fast which is a plus</li>
            <li>I would advise this to anyone looking for a longer lasting polish without the damaging effects of gel polish, and no UV light</li>
            <li>but dries up fast before i finished useing the bottle ,</li>
            <li>I did not notice the wearing off as much.</li>
            <li>Much easier than Shellac.</li>
            <li>It is what extends the polish so is absolutely required.</li>
            <li>Fast drying as well</li>
            <li>It is fast drying and the shine stays on the whole time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries really fast</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>It is very glossy and it dries really fast.</li>
            <li>(I had heard of people sticking their hands next to light bulbs and inside lamps).</li>
            <li>The shine of the top coat dulls after a week or so but the strength is still there.  </li>
            <li>Really, really keeps its promises.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>You really need to use it with vinylux together.</li>
            <li>the polish dries so fast.  </li>
            <li>have tried various ways of applying this, but thin coats of color (2-3) with 2 coats of this product, the Vinylux topcoat, seems to work best for me.</li>
            <li>I have high hopes right now, but lets see if it can withstand the mom of two preschoolers life I live.  </li>
            <li>I get a good 4 or 5 days with no chipping and usually 2 weeks on my toes!  </li>
            <li>Because if you just use a nail polisher it will not last for so long as with this top coat!</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and dried quickly.  </li>
            <li>coat!&lt;br /&gt;I found the smell to be just like any other nail polish or top coat.&lt;br /&gt;Kept</li>
            <li>I;ve used this as a top coat with other brands and types of polish/lacquer and it works well with all of them.  </li>
            <li>I will never buy any other top coat, but this one.</li>
            <li>I will never use any other top coat again</li>
            <li>Either way, I prefer this brand over any other polish and top coat.</li>
            <li>I dries super fast, no light required, and does last amazingly well.</li>
            <li>Clean and push back your cuticles, wash your nails and hands</li>
            <li>While the vinylux polish did not work as promised, this is a great topcoat- works with other brands of polish and really does dry completely within under nine minutes to a high gloss</li>
            <li>It will stay on for a week with no chipping even on bright colors, like red and black, with no re-application.</li>
            <li>Not long wearing didn&#x27;t add any more days than regular drug store nail polish, chipped  in just a couple days.</li>
            <li>this nail polish was not thick, and it chips off fast.</li>
            <li>I will use it as a regular top coat on top of other nail polishes in the future.</li>
            <li>I have yet to get it to last a full week</li>
            <li>I am sure if it was a dark color - it wouldn&#x27;t have made any difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This did not last a full week.  </li>
            <li>Vinylux is a true surprise for me and from now on, I will only use Vinilux if any.</li>
            <li>For me the rubble held up better than the dark dahlia</li>
            <li>This is what makes the lacquer last the full week...</li>
            <li>Does not last a full week</li>
            <li>Gives a beautiful shiny finish, and it seriously lasts and lasts, and stands up under the &amp;#34;stress&amp;#34; of daily life and tasks.  </li>
            <li>It works great--and lets my nails grow better than any other polish!</li>
            <li>Then I add a little color on the very edges and another top coat.</li>
            <li>This is my new holy grail, give it a shot!</li>
            <li>It is my new polish!  </li>
            <li>Helps to add another top coat half way through the week.</li>
            <li>I wondered if it was an older bottle.</li>
            <li>If this is what it takes to make my CND Vinylux last for two weeks, I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li>Let that sink in for a bit: no waiting at the salon, no praying you don&#x27;t smudge them in the car home or that your child wants you to get something for him as soon as you get home and inevitably ruin $20 worth of manicure the moment you step in the door.  </li>
            <li>This top coat is expensive and doesn&#x27;t work any better than a cheaper brand.</li>
            <li>Made by same company that makes the Shellac manicure products, so I am able to get the same colors that I like  at the Nail Salon.</li>
            <li>I have tried many nail polishes only to have them start chipping or wearing  off the very next day.  </li>
            <li>Stays super shiny throughout &amp; you can remove yourself instead of having to go back to a salon.</li>
            <li>PERHAPS I GOT A BOTTLE THAT WAS OLDER SINCE IT WAS HEAVY/THICK WHEN APPLIED.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still pretty shiny-not nearly as nice as it was initially, and there are quite a few chips.</li>
            <li>Vinylux lasts easily 3 weeks with only tip wear apparent -</li>
            <li>Taking into account that I am very rough on my nails, am constantly having them in water &amp; my nails are also very brittle (which makes it easy for polish to peel off) - I&#x27;d say this product is worth it, considering it is cheaper than Essie &amp; OPI!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to people I know.</li>
            <li>After using high end polishes, I find that CND goes on easier and lasts two weeks.</li>
            <li>high gloss</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have my hopes set too high</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It stayed on longer than any other regular polish I own.</li>
            <li>It really protects soft nails</li>
            <li>Keeps the vnylux polish looking great and elimnates expensive manicures.  </li>
            <li>Keeps your polish nice for at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Normal polish normally lasts about a day on me.</li>
            <li>SAVE your money waste of 6.14 theirs nothing magical about this nail polish.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra effort, however.</li>
            <li>Stays on with the color for almost a week if you don&#x27;t do heavy stuff at home :)</li>
            <li>I bought a few of the Vinylux nail polishes and top coat after a friend of mine raved about them on Facebook.  </li>
            <li>This top coat makes my home manicures last twice as long.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth getting, but its not the same as a gel manicure.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the extra effort</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t know if that was normal or not,</li>
            <li>I use it with other brands of nail polish and it works fine</li>
            <li>Not hard to remove at all.</li>
            <li>she told me you only need 2 coats of the polish on dry nails and this top coat.</li>
            <li>Your nails dry almost instantly and the polish stays on more than a week.</li>
            <li>Necessary to use this or other good topcoat in order for your polish to last a week as promised.</li>
            <li>I dries quickly and lasts long.  </li>
            <li>The beauty of this stuff as compared to other extended last shine product is that is comes off easily with fingernail polish, unlike gel, you don&#x27;t need to soak!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it with other Vinylyx products so I might have to do that before making an accurate review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been one day, I will update in a week with new results  </li>
            <li>So now I have to buy a brand new one for all the CND nail polish I have.</li>
            <li>blog is to use a very light color (I have lavishly loved) as a base, then whatever brand/color you like as usual, followed by the top coat.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t quite as fabulous as I expected, but I am a busy mom who does lots of hand and dish washing.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered for years with super dry nails.  </li>
            <li>Finally i can be free with a polish that only requires changing after 7-10 days.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the polishes I got were old, or what, but they go on kind of thick and goopy,</li>
            <li>I have never been much for using a top coat because they were always so thick and gummy.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time to do my nails every other day, I am happy that this polish does stay for a week, at least.</li>
            <li>so I just paint another coat (about 2 days in) and my manicure ends up lasting the whole 7 days, sometimes even longer!</li>
            <li>I have not been disappointed and find Vinylux is the best nail polish I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>my nail polish lasts WAY more than a week- two week if not more.</li>
            <li>I first located it in England while there, and finally found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My nails chipped after 1 day so same as other top coats</li>
            <li>When I first learned about this 7-day polish, it was in the salon where I tried it instead of regular polish for a manicure.</li>
            <li>Lasts longer than other top coats I have tried, but doesn&#x27;t last a week on me.</li>
            <li>Super glossy, super thick, but doesn&#x27;t bubble.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast, gives your nails a wet, glossy look, and prevents chipping longer than any other type of top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly, but sometimes if I put too much on it leaves little bubbles which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>did much better with Sally Hanson Nail Shine Miracle Top Coat, which has become virtually impossible to find in stores.</li>
            <li>I typically get about 10 days out of my polish which is much better than traditional nail polish.</li>
            <li>Ive also used betweeb polish to reseal worn nails where Ive used or overwashed hands and want a little extra protection between nail color changes.easy to tell when it dries with both color and top coat.  </li>
            <li>they last the whole week (even if you do the dishes or wash clothes,</li>
            <li>Keeps polish chip proof for 10 days ,, dries in 8 minutes and can use hands completely without messing manicure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done my toes and so far have lasted almost a month without any noticeable wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only on day three, but I really put it to the test today and no chipping.</li>
            <li>and it really does last.  </li>
            <li>Does not stay on would not waste your money</li>
            <li>Really lasts, i can get up to 10-11 days out of it (lighter colors last longer).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m busy with my hands</li>
            <li>I was rather hesitant to try the CND Vinylux system as I had noticed mixed reviews, but I needed an alternative to gel polish as it was very drying and damaging to my nails.</li>
            <li>so I would advise against using them, as this must bond directly to the nail for it to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really does make your nail polish last.</li>
            <li>I get longer-lasting results when a pro gives my mani, but this lasts much longer than a regular at-home job.</li>
            <li>I did not think that was possible, but this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>a manicurist and stay-mom of 3yrs old)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather deal with the gel polish and at least know that when I&#x27;m done I&#x27;m done for 2 weeks or more.</li>
            <li>I even put it over my 2 week old gel nails to help them last a few day more.</li>
            <li>It stays on your nails much longer than regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>I am a a busy nurse with a 6month old baby which means my nails&amp; polish take a beating.  </li>
            <li>Experimented -  vinylux only lasted a few days without this top coat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for years to find polish that will last more than a few days on my nails.  </li>
            <li>Glad my nails grow slowly</li>
            <li>By the time I am ready to apply the second coat, the first is completely dry.</li>
            <li>First, let your nails dry completely before applying any nail polish.</li>
            <li>Man of them are very streaky and require several coats (particularly bicycle yellow).</li>
            <li>This stuff works wonders at first, by it seems to dry out soon.</li>
            <li>Must have top coat for long long long term wear.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t quite help the polish last a full week, but it helps the color to last longer than traditional nail polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what is different about this top coat but</li>
            <li>consulted with several sources before deciding on a color - A few of my favorite bloggers who have tried the product, YouTube reviews, &amp; the official Vinylux website to see swatches of the colors (their website clarifies whether it is sheer, semi-sheer or opaque which was very helpful because I only like opaque colors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would order the CND VINYLUX NAIL COLOR, as well, next time, as the polish that I have been using was not appropriate for this top coat.</li>
            <li>put over regular essie and helped my mani last almost a whole week!</li>
            <li>w/ less wear &amp; tear on my nails being home, I&#x27;m lucky if I can get 2-3 days before it chips.</li>
            <li>For me it keeps vinylux polish from chipping, peeling, or becoming dull.  </li>
            <li>Do not care for this product does not last does not dry fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt; 2 steps so fast and long lasting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My manicurist uses this product and it really lasts long.  </li>
            <li>I wash my hands dozens of times per day and normal polish chips the same day I put it on!</li>
            <li>I purchased that a few years back, but I heard that polish can last for many years.</li>
            <li>I am pretty rough with gardening and refinishing furniture.</li>
            <li>As long as you use the Scrub Fresh and the top coat, per the directions, this polish will last at least a week with NO chipping!</li>
            <li>It does however last longer than normal polish</li>
            <li>Other than that, it does live up to its name and protected my nail color very well.</li>
            <li>I recently had a manicure by a new nail tech.  </li>
            <li>and I have to touch up my polish every few days, but that&#x27;s a huge improvement over every day, like it was with regular polish.</li>
            <li>I even tried it a few times and was more careful with what I was doing with my finger nails.</li>
            <li>It never lasted a week, however, polish on my toes last at least 3 weeks or more.</li>
            <li>Lately I&#x27;ve been able to get it only through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It took a few tries to make it work, but I have grown to love</li>
            <li>, on my nails it lasts a few days without the tops chipping, but I type a lot, I was expecting more after reading all of the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping that it would keep my nails chip free for at least 5-7 days</li>
            <li>This clear polish works only with Vinylux Polish.</li>
            <li>So far it does not last for 7 days.</li>
            <li>Though it killed me to wait what seemed like an eternity for the polishes to arrive, it was so worth</li>
            <li>The thing that makes me want to repaint is the growth from my cuticles!!!&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to have some sort of cuticle gel/moisturizer as that is a frustrating difference of a salon mani vs. doing your nails yourself.  </li>
            <li>would say...that this is a definite buy.&lt;br /&gt;***7 days and no chipping, creates a hard nail, and easy to take off.</li>
            <li>stuff dries quickly &amp; my manicures last for a week with a few chips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only because the polish - a bright pink - started looking a little dark, however, I think that that&#x27;s only because of the polish color.</li>
            <li>I found the polish chipped as readily as any other.  </li>
            <li>It really does make a difference at setting the polish and ultimately making the mani last as long as possible!!!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, but a little harder to remove than traditional polish.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not limited.</li>
            <li>This top coat is the secret to making the Vinylux polish last a week.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it last longer than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used in the past, but I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li>but i was hoping for a least a full week without any chipping or peeling.</li>
            <li>In other reviews, I saw that it works best with the cnd \\&quot;sticky base coat\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this top coat and base coat because my hair stylist recommended it to me &amp; said that her polish stays on her fingernails for about 2 weeks &amp; her toe nail polish stays on for a month.</li>
            <li>Love this product, but the seller sold me one that was old and too thick to apply because it had dried out.</li>
            <li>So I sat down and  filed, shaped, used cuticle remover, - the whole 9 yards</li>
            <li>I usually do another layer of top coat after a few days, especially on the tips, so help it last.</li>

            <li> Really amazing results</li>
            <li> I got hooked on Vinylux after getting a salon mani/pedi and learning about this amazing product.  </li>
            <li> one word AMAZING</li>
            <li> Amazing product with the topcoat and nailpolish</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is amazing.</li>
            <li> Along with Vinylux Polish it looks good for more days than OPI Infinite Shine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY the best and longest wearing polish you will ever buy.  </li>
            <li> purchased \\&quot;Lavishly Loved #126\\&quot; and the \\&quot;CND Vinylux Top Coat Weekly Polish.  </li>
            <li> good top coat for the vynilux line.</li>
            <li> With 2 coats of polish and this as a top coat, my nails look good for a week or two.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice topcoat....</li>
            <li> Nice product</li>
            <li> Effective combination.  </li>
            <li> I used it with CND&#x27;s own nail color, and everything started to peel in just a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good product - I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails, I have for years,</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> My manicure that I gave myself with Vinylux polish and top coat has lasted a full week!!!  </li>
            <li> the super quick drying time is great, though, and does create a beautiful shine .</li>
            <li> Omg this is an amazing product at an even more amazing price.</li>
            <li> I have never had nail polish stay on and look good for more than a couple of days before using this top coat.  </li>
            <li> This top coat is the absolute best.</li>
            <li> This came quickly and is a great alternative for shellac.</li>
            <li> Love love it!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this top coat!  </li>
            <li> Love this top coat!</li>
            <li> and my nails look pretty good when it&#x27;s time to get my nails done again!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve found so far that lasts 2 weeks or longer on my toenails.  </li>
            <li> Honestly see no difference with this top coat as compared to others when I used with the vinylux Polish.</li>
            <li> But this top coat is amazing</li>
            <li> It goes over any nail color and dries very quickly!</li>
            <li> 100% acatone to easily remove!</li>
            <li> love love love!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Natural, quick, easy, beautiful.</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; fast shipping!</li>
            <li> So happy no lamp needed and not a difficult removal like gel polish.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of top coats and this by far is the BEST top coat I have found</li>
            <li> As described, Beautiful color thanks.</li>
            <li> Somewhere I had read that Witch Hazel, wiped on clean nails with a cotton ball, is a great nail prep - as well as cheap.  </li>
            <li> Vinylux dries quickly and has a good shine.</li>
            <li> Love the color, very light camel.</li>
            <li> Love being able to do my own gel nails and still remove the polish easily at home (I use just acetone polish remover from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply).  </li>
            <li> I did like the top coat.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Now I use the Vinylux Top Coat EVERY time I paint my nails</li>
            <li> Over three weeks using this top coat</li>
            <li> You must try these polishes and this top coat is a must.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff, without touch ups</li>
            <li> I love the vinylux polishes.</li>
            <li> It lasts about 4 days on my fingernails, I haven&#x27;t been able to get a week out of it yet.</li>
            <li> Maybe because I still used another top coat.</li>
            <li> Will try using it without a top coat and see how it lasts.</li>
            <li> I love this topcoat.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that my manicures actually last longer than a day.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles of color and the top coat</li>
            <li> Found this polish at a beauty supply store, but am able to purchase it cheaper on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> this top coat goes on after .</li>
            <li> Came quickly and for an exceptional price.  </li>
            <li> Seem to have more shredding nails.</li>
            <li> --which was heartbreaking because I love having polished nails.  </li>
            <li> I have used the CND vinylux  polish,  vinylux top coat and CND  solar oil for about 3 months now.  </li>
            <li> Apply 2 coats of the polish and 1 of the top coat.  </li>
            <li> I love CND products.  </li>
            <li> I plan to buy more colors to expand my collection.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this nail polish for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought more for my family as well because it works so well.  </li>
            <li> The top coat has been staining the nail polish, and isn&#x27;t seeming to be chip resistant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve attached pictures of two coats of CND cake pop color and one coat of CND top coat.</li>
            <li> comes in many many fashion colors.</li>
            <li> I bought this top coat to go along with the Weekly Polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many polishes and top coats, but this one lasts longer than any of them.  </li>
            <li> This product is excellent and does last over a week.</li>
            <li> I ordered both the Vinylux top coat &amp; 1 color.</li>
            <li> Probably won&#x27;t purchase again, but will def update if I get better results.</li>
            <li> Love this topcoat.</li>
            <li> Love this system.</li>
            <li> I pleased with the products:  100% -</li>
            <li> I pleased with the products:  100% -</li>
            <li> Just love the polish.</li>
            <li> AND THAN AFTER 3 DAYS I ADD A TOP COAT</li>
            <li> SAVING ME MORE MONEY.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the strength of my nails.</li>
            <li> This top coat is better than any I have used because it protects the nail lacquer from chipping and breaking.</li>
            <li> I love this Vinylux top coat.  </li>
            <li> I SWEAR BY THIS and have converted many, many friends.</li>
            <li> This top coat makes the polish shine and stay on for most of a week, if you use your hands at work a lot, or in water a lot.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Nails looked healthy when push was removed.</li>
            <li> did not stay on more than 3 days</li>
            <li> I love nail polish</li>
            <li> CND Vinylux Top Coat&#x3D;</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> love Vinylux.  </li>
            <li> It is an okay top coat.</li>
            <li> This is the top coat for the vinylux nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Love working with this seller</li>
            <li> I have never had a top coat that didn&#x27;t chip within 2-3 days except for a gel manicure until this.</li>
            <li> - I think you will be pleasantly pleased.</li>
            <li> So glad to be able to use this with CND Vinylux polish as they are made to work together to protect your nails.</li>
            <li> , I opted for this top coat as an alternative.</li>
            <li> It works fabulous on my nails!  </li>
            <li> I love the nail polish</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasted 2 days and the manicure was chipping and then on day 3 the top coat was started to peel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the polish, but lacks shine and staying power.  </li>
            <li> Awesome stuff..you can use as a top coat with any polish &amp; it gives it lasting power for about a week.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries in under 10 minutes and my manicure lasts over a week, even working as a nurse.</li>
            <li> Also, be sure to wait the recommended time between the polish coats and top coat.  </li>
            <li> Keep your supply of top coat in the box to prevent sunlight from hitting it.</li>
            <li> And it works for more than 7 days.</li>
            <li> And even better when the top layer is applied</li>
            <li> This top coat creates a barrier to protect the polish.  </li>
            <li> It was okay.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff, helps to keep your polish from chipping.</li>
            <li> Vinylux is supposed to be one of the top lacquer nail polishes that wear for 7-10 days.  </li>
            <li> and then put another brand of top coat on</li>
            <li> Love this top coat.</li>
            <li> this is what makes the weekly polish work, so make sure to buy it when you buy the polish, it truly works for a week.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I believe CND was ranked in the top 3.  </li>
            <li> the polish itself went on with a lot of streaks, &amp; the top coat didn&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> This top coat never disappoints.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I definally buy more.</li>
            <li> Best top coat , I apply several times over the two week period&lt;</li>
            <li> One coat of polish and one coat of top coat</li>
            <li> Love, love this polish.</li>
            <li> Top coat  </li>
            <li> This top coat helps seal the long-lasting Vinylux colors.</li>
            <li> I use it with all of my brand nail polishes and it works like magic.  </li>
            <li> I love this top coat.</li>
            <li> I did two coats of the Vinylux nail pollish and then put this on top.  </li>
            <li> I use this when I need to cover nail jewels and make the surface smooth!</li>
            <li> I start to get cracks or chips in the places where my nails bend most.</li>
            <li> She is on day 9 with the polish and top coat . . .</li>
            <li> So it seems that the better the nails, the better the product will work.</li>
            <li> it is just okay.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own a UV light yet but tried both anyway.</li>
            <li> and I love this top coat.</li>
            <li> It is better than others I&#x27;ve tried, but I have to repair chips after a day or two.</li>
            <li> Love this product and will buy again</li>
            <li> My daughters love this product and are amazed at how well it works to keep their manis intact</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish brand</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> love this topcoat.</li>
            <li> I know that some people like it better than I do.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have it put on my nails every week when I go to the nail salon.  </li>
            <li> This works great as directed over Vinylux colors, but I found it also works great over other brand colors.</li>
            <li> works good, recommend using on clean, oil free nails.</li>
            <li> This polish stayed on a full week and more!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not terribly disappointed, but I was kind of hoping I could have found something that worked.</li>
            <li> This is currently the best top coat on the market that&#x27;s available for non-professionals.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty good.  </li>
            <li> This top coat goes on so easily.</li>
            <li> The Vinylux Top Coat Weekly Polish applied easily as well.  </li>
            <li> For you who have strong nails, you will love the glossy finish.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend this any more strongly.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t recommend this more strongly.</li>
            <li> You need this top coat for your vinylux nail polish to last that good 7-10 days!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product to top coat active nails.  </li>
            <li> It works great even with my normal OPI polish and drys quickly!</li>
            <li> One time I didn&#x27;t have time to do the top coat, and there was a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I know this works great for many people, but the polish and top coat lasted no longer than regular polish on me.  </li>
            <li> love the fact that you don&#x27;t need a UV light.</li>
            <li> It is important to put another top coat on a week into your wear.</li>
            <li> I love the way it stays on for almost 2 full weeks, I wish this top coat was a bit easier to put on though.</li>
            <li> This top coat gives the polish the shine that stays for a week and helps keep it on fabulous.</li>
            <li> And stayed nice / fresh / shiny.</li>
            <li> Good product, shipped promptly, thanks</li>
            <li> My pedicure is on its 3rd week and still looks good!  </li>
            <li> I also bought the polish and it lasted a full two weeks!</li>
            <li> Make sure you paint the tips of your fingers too for maximum success!</li>
            <li> My manicure would look great for a full 5-7 days, but it was high maintenance.</li>
            <li> Smooths the appearance of ridges and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, very impressed with the product &amp; plan to order a few more colors.</li>
            <li> And easily comes off with nail polish remover &amp; a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> It did go on easy and did not clump up.</li>
            <li> I could never keep nails from chipping very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Easy.</li>
            <li> It dries very quickly and blends well.  </li>
            <li> It dries very quickly and lasts 4-5 days for me.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> prefer this over shellac because it doesn&#x27;t damage your nails and is easy to apply &amp;remove yourself at home.  </li>
            <li> It dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Keeps nails strong and holds up in water too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used the Vinylux colored polish (which are good, but not great), but this topcoat is awesome.  </li>
            <li> It is strong and durable.</li>
            <li> Keeps my nails strong and the polish lasts for over a week</li>
            <li> my mother has always had strong nails.</li>
            <li> Special top coat used with Vinylux polish.</li>
            <li> Very good top coat for other nail brand polishes as well.</li>
            <li> Lasts a full week with 2 coats and 2 top coats!&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li> This is really shiny  and looks great when you first put it on; however, it tends to peel off really easy.</li>
            <li> This is a super shiny top coat like the gel ones you get in the Salon.  </li>
            <li> Makes the Vinlyux polish super shiny and lasts about 7-10 days!</li>
            <li> Dries quickly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of shellac but since the colors are a bit pricy</li>
            <li> (Again, still a huge improvement over reg polish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then 2 light coats of OPI color of choice.  </li>
            <li> , I may try it with my gel UV light just to see if it helps.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cure under the light and it peels off in minutes.</li>
            <li> so they are free from dirt and oil.  </li>
            <li> I can polish my nails myself with the light color that I chose.  </li>
            <li> No need to cure it under light like gels.</li>
            <li> not just the cheap brands.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m happy to find something that doesn&#x27;t peel off the second day after application.</li>
            <li> No base coat needed.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it was on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is amazing and works very well for me.</li>
            <li> No base coat needed.</li>
            <li> Please make additional light pastel colors that are opaque.</li>
            <li> Great lasting shine.  </li>
            <li> The shine was there, and I didn&#x27;t put a fresh top coat on on purpose just to see what my nails would look like after 7 days.</li>
            <li> This combination allows you to use any polish you like for a great looking and lasting manicure!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice now and both times it chipped on the 5th day which is great definitely will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Works great with any nail polish, especially with quick-dry ones.</li>
            <li> so I just add a few drops of nail polish remover and it works great!</li>
            <li> and it srill looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say how well it works with a UV light.</li>
            <li> It kept my nails looking good when I was traveling and too busy to have to stop and do touch ups or take off my nail polish.</li>
            <li> The vinylux left a very nice s</li>
            <li> It also seals the enamel very nicely and the manicure does stay for several days without chipping.  </li>
            <li> The seller is great,  got some issues with delivery but fixed everything very fast.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time 13 days ago and my polish still looks fine!  </li>
            <li> but this one goes on so easily and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I love it at first, but discovered it too hurt the nail, was somewhat time consuming, and I worried about the effect of the light on my skin and nail beds.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to quickly apply another coat inbetween polishes to perk it up.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it when doing my own pedicures.  </li>
            <li> This top coat helps seal in your polish for a whole week and is easily removed without all the steps you have to go through with gel polish.</li>
            <li> Finding this online excited me.</li>
            <li> Overall, I Love this top coat!</li>
            <li> be aware these polishes and top coat to age faster in the bottles and then tend to go on in a rather gummy fashion.</li>
            <li> But for the money and hassle-free removal, it&#x27;s really worth it!</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST and only top coat that actually lives up to its promise.</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat thus far!</li>
            <li> This is a top coat that really works!</li>
            <li> A great top coat really makes the polish last</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I used as a top coat at home over my nail polish( I used my own regular nail polish not CND).</li>
            <li> I use this as a top coat for regular polish because some of the Vinylux colors are kind of unattractive to me, and it keeps the polish from chipping for over a week.  </li>
            <li> Top coat goes on nice, did not last one week.</li>
            <li> So far, I am every pleased with the top coat.</li>
            <li> fantastic top coat, just dries too fast in the bottle</li>
            <li> I clean &amp; wash dishes without gloves.</li>
            <li> It lasts a good 5-7 days and does not dry out my nails.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, lasts and looks good for almost the entire week and is easily removed with polish remover.  </li>
            <li> This is a beautiful glossy top coat, and I bought it based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews by other purchasers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with the long lasting wear on this top coat, even on my kids.</li>
            <li> I like this top coat the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that it isn&#x27;t shiny which I find kind of strange its matte, so I had to put the top coat on to kind of seal it</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth the $ and dries quickly!  </li>
            <li> Nothing Special here.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to use in special clients who always are dealing with water.</li>
            <li> It works better with their products, but I still get around 5 chip free days--so much better than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really seem like anything more special than things I&#x27;ve already used for this purpose</li>
            <li> Love this product really works</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t get a full 7 days of wear (I have 3 kids and craft a lot with my hands)</li>
            <li> It changed my life :) I really like it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products.</li>
            <li> With this polish, I am assured a full week&#x27;s of wear and they will remain almost intact.  </li>
            <li> overall good, but does not provide a shiny gel like appearance</li>
            <li> I use the top coat over the Vinylux Nail Enamel and it really makes the nail enamel &amp;#34;pop.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Good stuff - helps my polish last</li>
            <li> This top coat for nail polish is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> The top coat is all you really need to use over any brand nail polish.</li>
            <li> If I use this top coat, I get a whole week our of the polish.</li>
            <li> I can no longer wear regular polish and expect it to last so this product line is great when you want a break from Shellac or don&#x27;t want a color on for a long time but want it looking its best!</li>
            <li> For me my nail polish never makes it through one full day (I have brittle nails).</li>
            <li> I loved the shellac-style durability with the ease of removal like regular polish.</li>
            <li> I really like this top coat.</li>
            <li> Good product, same as described.</li>
            <li> However, the Vinylux polishes call for it and really does work better and lasts longer with it.  </li>
            <li> On my toes it lasts a solid two weeks and a good 10 days on my nails.</li>
            <li> Looked good for less than one day before polish and top coat started to peel off from the edge of my nail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy.  </li>
            <li> I did not think it went on streaky at all, and it was pretty easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Works great with other polishes, too.</li>
            <li> I know natural UV light (the sun) is supposed to harden the top coat</li>
            <li> Dries super quick and shiny</li>
            <li> I had chipping almost immediately and noticed that my shine diminished quickly.  </li>
            <li> It lasts for about a week with a regular nail polish and it also dries quickly so you don&#x27;t need a Quickdry coat on top or a top coat.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t raved about it enough, probably the greatest thing about this system is how quickly it dries compared to regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> This get sticky and gummy quickly</li>
            <li> This dries so quickly and you don&#x27;t have to worry about smudging your nails.  </li>
            <li> This dries quickly but still chips in a couple of days not the week that is advertised.  </li>
            <li> I love this top coat and it is totally necessary to use with the weekly polish.  </li>
            <li> Note that when applying, you need a quick hand.</li>
            <li> This top coat works beautifully over vinylux color polish - it&#x27;s all rock hard and looks stunning and professional.</li>
            <li> I continue to purchase it because overall I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, no thinner available.</li>
            <li> Most polishes only last 2 days for me before they start chipping - this stuff is great</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and dries super fast as well.</li>
            <li> Great just as expected!!</li>
            <li> A new favorite.</li>
            <li> My manicurist in Miami told me it is her new favorite product.  </li>
            <li> My favorite new nail product.  </li>
            <li> beautiful top coat, fast trying to a hard finish -</li>
            <li> The nail polish stayed on the whole time!!  </li>
            <li> High Recommend!!!</li>
            <li> It is the first nail polish that will stay on my nails for a week with no chipping!</li>
            <li> Does not last, more like a 7 hour polish!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m back here for more!</li>
            <li> and, I was wearing &amp;#34;Lobster Pot&amp;#34; Red!..:)  !</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying it in more colors!</li>
            <li> Last for more than a week!</li>
            <li> After 2 months of continued use, I actually have nails and they are strong and healthy</li>
            <li> The Lavishly Loved polish was easily to apply and with one coat, the result was a natural French manicure.  </li>
            <li> I have done two manicures with this now and my nails stay absolutely chip free for 5-6 days.</li>
            <li> nice and shinny but does not last a week</li>
            <li> The top coat is so important in making these polishes last a week.</li>
            <li> I added another topcoat layer for fun, and painted another layer on after 3 days.  </li>
            <li> Use this top coat to complete the CND Vinylux system.</li>
            <li> Great shine and last for much longer than a regular top coat.</li>
            <li> , I just like for my polish to look fresh.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my manicure looking fresh for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Drys</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the try.</li>
            <li> The polish rarely ever chips and even though this isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;quick-dry&amp;#34</li>
            <li> First time trying it at home my polish lasted a full week before chipping.</li>
            <li> So far this top coat along with the nail polish has been on for three days and no chipping yet.</li>
            <li> polish.&lt;br /&gt; Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it at that point.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> This nail polish really stays on for a week and has been gentle on my nails!!!  </li>
            <li> I use it on top of OPI and other polish brands, and LOVE how durable this topcoat is.  </li>
            <li> Stays on better than other top coats, but not as well with a Vinylux color underneath.</li>
            <li> it did have started to wear off pretty quickly in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This stuff dries pretty quickly, too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Was really hopeful for this company and the high rated top coat, but it&#x27;s just not working for me.</li>
            <li> did not stay on peeled right off almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I used Acetone nail polish remover and it came right</li>
            <li> I used thus according to instructions and the Polish came right off.</li>
            <li> Look great wet but lose a bit of gloss when dry and prevents me from touching and smudging to check.</li>
            <li> My manicures last a full week when I use this as a top coat.</li>
            <li> My nails overall feel very strong as if I had wraps on.</li>
            <li> After 5-7 days I add a whole new coat of color plus another CND Vinylux Top Coat.</li>
            <li> I am not sure my nails are happy with the product though.  </li>
            <li> It really keeps my nails shiny for a full week and helps prevent chipping</li>
            <li> A great hack from Kate at the small things</li>
            <li> It is nothing less than magical how the polish/top set without any light or special salon machines.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect with my OPI polish; last much longer than with other topcoats.</li>
            <li> fabulous new product by CND.  </li>
            <li> This top coat makes it shine and protects it a few more days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super fast and keeps my polish on for up to 10 days.</li>
            <li> Super fast drying &amp; didn&#x27;t need a touch up for over 10 days.</li>
            <li> Then 2 coats of polish (any brand), then follow with a nice thick coat of CND Vinylux Top Coat.</li>
            <li> So considering that I am happy it last 3-4 days and another coat to last the week.</li>
            <li> Love this, it went on easily and dried quickly.</li>
            <li> my nails look like I had JUST HAD A NEW MANICURE!!!....</li>
            <li> I bought this with the neutral pink, love it!</li>
            <li> lasts longer than typical polish; looks pretty good for about a week.  </li>
            <li> It works very fast to set the polish and it smoothes out any &amp;#34;oops&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> ; formula it dries very fast.  </li>
            <li> The Vinylux line it not as long-lasting as the Shellac, but it is so easy to apply, dries quickly, and lasts several days.  </li>
            <li> (also, I used a cheap beauty supply nail polish for $1.99)&lt;br /&gt;They were strong, and it seem like it did take about 10 minutes for my nails to completely dry (which I didn&#x27;t  like),</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quick and easy to change colors (no soaking, just regular polish remover).</li>
            <li> Great answer to avoid gel polish which is so hard on the nails.</li>
            <li> No other top coat gives the same shine (unless its a UV-set gel top coat) Dries fast, durable and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> A definite must to use over your favorite nail polish color.</li>
            <li> My nails are healthy and I had two chips the same day I put it on.  </li>
            <li> Love how it makes my nails feel stronger unlike gel nails which left my nails brittle.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more of this brand.</li>
            <li> Thanks!,,,,</li>
            <li> This top coat was short-lived as mine became gooey after a short period of time.</li>
            <li> CND VINYLUX TOP COAT Weekly polish is just that you only have to apply it weekly</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last more than a day.</li>
            <li> This product really works!  </li>
            <li> the instructions for the polish said it is only supposed to be used with the matching top coat</li>
            <li> Necessary to purchase this top coat with any of your CND Vinylux.</li>
            <li> I have issues w/nail polish lasting more than 2 or 3 days.  </li>
            <li> not necessarily because they are chipping but more because it&#x27;s a nervous habit.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to other friends, and they love it too!  </li>
            <li> The vinylux system saves me so much time!</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well!</li>
            <li> It lasted the whole 7 days without chipping and stayed shiny!</li>
            <li> Like many others, I have been getting \\&quot;gel nails\\&quot; for several years.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know if the witch hazel prep made the difference, the polish and top coat made the difference, or the sun curing process made the difference, I only know that when I continued using these products and this routine,  SOMETHING made a difference.  </li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m the working mom with pretty nails who doesn&#x27;t pay $80 per month for them.</li>
            <li> Tried this at my nail salon and made my manicure last for more than 10 days.  </li>
            <li> Was wearing out at the tips at the end of the first day.</li>
            <li> I like this product although it looks glossy the first couple of days but begins to chip at about three days.</li>
            <li> Apply the top coat again a week later and get a bonus week of wear.</li>
            <li> Top coat is essential.  </li>
            <li> It really works too!</li>
            <li> Only lasted two days at the most.</li>
            <li> Two weeks after my manicure (with CND  &amp;#34;Lobster Pot Red&amp;#34;) I apply a coat of this....and BELIEVE  ME...</li>
            <li> FUNNY,</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> nails fast !</li>
            <li> This works really well!</li>
            <li> I will buy more of this with my next polish order.</li>
            <li> This polish costs the same as most regular polishes but has many added benefits.</li>
            <li> You can use it on top of regular nail polish to help keep it from chipping too, not just vinylux polish.</li>
            <li> but it did not last more than 2-3 days before chipping.</li>
            <li> And to top all that off, it only lasts a day on me before chipping.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item and I will definitely be ordering these products again.</li>
            <li> Great consistency and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have also applied it as a top coat to extend a manicure with regular polish and that worked well too!</li>
            <li> I love how quickly the Vinylux products dry!</li>
            <li> The CND vinylux top coat is required in order to help the polish to last for  close to two  weeks.</li>
            <li> The strength increases over time from exposure to natural light.</li>
            <li> My regular polish with vase and top coat stays on longer.</li>
            <li> especially since I never think they do a better job than me</li>
            <li> My first time using this product</li>
            <li> I have had to put on many coats and it still chips off the next day.</li>
            <li> but of course the CND nail colors do last the longest when they are used with the top coat.</li>
            <li> Keeps my nail polish nice, shiny and minimal chipping/fading by the end of the week.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot and handwash my dishes, so I was pretty amazed.  </li>
            <li> My grandmother had it and it works really well!</li>
            <li> I was first offered to try this product at my nail salon and although my nails didn&#x27;t chip for a record breaking three days</li>
            <li> Wore this top coat with CNDs gel polish as a regular polish.</li>
            <li> This top coat does not last me a week.</li>
            <li> I used to be an avid Gel Polish Gal - but have switched to Vinylux.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Super high gloss for weeks on end.  </li>
            <li> This lasts just as long ang comes off easy!</li>
            <li> It did dry fast and went on nicely</li>
            <li> This product line is fantastic...dries super fast ....is very durable...and</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, dries quickly, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> These kind of products dont really have nail strengthener ingredients within them so not being able to use my top coat will just have my nails back to where they were weak and britttle.</li>
            <li> It does thicken more quickly than other brands.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and helps prevent chipping better than any other brand I have tried.</li>
            <li> This top coat works together with the vinylux polish to shine and dry immediately and last a whole week easily!</li>
            <li> My nails will only get little dings and chips and still look pretty darn good through Friday!</li>
            <li> Two coats produced a manicure that looks clean and professional.  </li>
            <li> While it dries quickly and has a nice shine to it, I can get my polish to only last a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> This top coat makes the Vinylux polish really shine and it seems to help the polish last longer too.</li>
            <li> It lasts pretty long but the longer your nails are the quicker it chips, even with the top coat.</li>
            <li> This top coat lasts much longer than I would have thought possible.</li>
            <li> so naturally I could open a mini salon in my house with the amount of nail polish I own.</li>
            <li> I use it long time and never see smth better.</li>
            <li> Vinylux is an awesome product lasts as long as stated, even longer if you aren&#x27;t hard on your nails.</li>
            <li> Works awesome not only with the Cnd nail polish but also any other brand for longer lasting color.</li>
            <li> Normally my nail doesn&#x27;t last more than a day, i have.</li>
            <li> Dazzle Dry Top Coat is</li>
            <li> same results as shellack manicure with out harmful UV rays, easy to remove.</li>
            <li> easy application - stays on for a week - may need a middle of the week recoat to keep the shine</li>
            <li> Love the dry time and the resilience.</li>
            <li> I put on three coats, letting each dry in between coats for eight minutes, and then applied the top coat.  </li>
            <li> Regular &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34;  polish or top coat,is normally chipped within a day.</li>
            <li> Application and removal is easy enough, but it does not stay on my nails even 3 days, let alone 7.  </li>
            <li> If you have strong nails, your color might last longer.</li>
            <li> Even when using other brands this top coat cuts drying time way down and the polish is good for a week untouched 10-14 days if you put the top coat on every other day.  </li>
            <li> There are some times that it starts to wear off a little more quickly than others.  </li>
            <li> used to touch up the tips of my nails every single night and add a coat of top coat.</li>
            <li> It certainly met my expectations.</li>
            <li> and I will certainly continue to use.</li>
            <li> Vinylux Polish is easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t stink quite as much as the regular stuff.</li>
            <li> After applying the final top coat, it will be dry and smudge free in under 10 minutes, just as CND claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a much superior product - dries rock hard in 5 minutes always.  </li>
            <li> Delivery timely and fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay...prefer fast drying topcat.  </li>
            <li> DRIES FAST TOO</li>
            <li> this really works without damaging your nails like shellac.</li>
            <li> Really really REALLY WORKS.  </li>
            <li> In combination with the CND Vinylux 7-day polish, this is a real winner.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t ever very shiny and the shine</li>
            <li> I really get 5-6 days out of this polish without chipping.  </li>
            <li> Vinylux goes on well and dries fast and doesn&#x27;t chip off.</li>
            <li> The polish itself has a very watery consistency.</li>
            <li> I used that, which is very watery as well.</li>
            <li> I expected so much more from this product.  </li>
            <li> Really whiney.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really too sure with this product.</li>
            <li> Really works.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Way too much money for what it does.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> much cheaper buy</li>
            <li> Really wanted to try it bcuz</li>
            <li> I even tried to speed up the drying on my second attempt by holding my nails up against the light.</li>
            <li> fast shipping a++</li>
            <li> It really extends the life of my manicure.</li>
            <li> really AMAZING!!&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> I was REALLY</li>
            <li> I it also dries relatively fast which is a plus</li>
            <li> I would advise this to anyone looking for a longer lasting polish without the damaging effects of gel polish, and no UV light</li>
            <li> but dries up fast before i finished useing the bottle ,</li>
            <li> I did not notice the wearing off as much.</li>
            <li> Much easier than Shellac.</li>
            <li> It is what extends the polish so is absolutely required.</li>
            <li> Fast drying as well</li>
            <li> It is fast drying and the shine stays on the whole time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries really fast</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> It is very glossy and it dries really fast.</li>
            <li> (I had heard of people sticking their hands next to light bulbs and inside lamps).</li>
            <li> The shine of the top coat dulls after a week or so but the strength is still there.  </li>
            <li> Really, really keeps its promises.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> You really need to use it with vinylux together.</li>
            <li> the polish dries so fast.  </li>
            <li> have tried various ways of applying this, but thin coats of color (2-3) with 2 coats of this product, the Vinylux topcoat, seems to work best for me.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes right now, but lets see if it can withstand the mom of two preschoolers life I live.  </li>
            <li> I get a good 4 or 5 days with no chipping and usually 2 weeks on my toes!  </li>
            <li> Because if you just use a nail polisher it will not last for so long as with this top coat!</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and dried quickly.  </li>
            <li> coat!&lt;br /&gt;I found the smell to be just like any other nail polish or top coat.&lt;br /&gt;Kept</li>
            <li> I;ve used this as a top coat with other brands and types of polish/lacquer and it works well with all of them.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy any other top coat, but this one.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other top coat again</li>
            <li> Either way, I prefer this brand over any other polish and top coat.</li>
            <li> I dries super fast, no light required, and does last amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Clean and push back your cuticles, wash your nails and hands</li>
            <li> While the vinylux polish did not work as promised, this is a great topcoat- works with other brands of polish and really does dry completely within under nine minutes to a high gloss</li>
            <li> It will stay on for a week with no chipping even on bright colors, like red and black, with no re-application.</li>
            <li> Not long wearing didn&#x27;t add any more days than regular drug store nail polish, chipped  in just a couple days.</li>
            <li> this nail polish was not thick, and it chips off fast.</li>
            <li> I will use it as a regular top coat on top of other nail polishes in the future.</li>
            <li> I have yet to get it to last a full week</li>
            <li> I am sure if it was a dark color - it wouldn&#x27;t have made any difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This did not last a full week.  </li>
            <li> Vinylux is a true surprise for me and from now on, I will only use Vinilux if any.</li>
            <li> For me the rubble held up better than the dark dahlia</li>
            <li> This is what makes the lacquer last the full week...</li>
            <li> Does not last a full week</li>
            <li> Gives a beautiful shiny finish, and it seriously lasts and lasts, and stands up under the &amp;#34;stress&amp;#34; of daily life and tasks.  </li>
            <li> It works great--and lets my nails grow better than any other polish!</li>
            <li> Then I add a little color on the very edges and another top coat.</li>
            <li> This is my new holy grail, give it a shot!</li>
            <li> It is my new polish!  </li>
            <li> Helps to add another top coat half way through the week.</li>
            <li> I wondered if it was an older bottle.</li>
            <li> If this is what it takes to make my CND Vinylux last for two weeks, I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> Let that sink in for a bit: no waiting at the salon, no praying you don&#x27;t smudge them in the car home or that your child wants you to get something for him as soon as you get home and inevitably ruin $20 worth of manicure the moment you step in the door.  </li>
            <li> This top coat is expensive and doesn&#x27;t work any better than a cheaper brand.</li>
            <li> Made by same company that makes the Shellac manicure products, so I am able to get the same colors that I like  at the Nail Salon.</li>
            <li> I have tried many nail polishes only to have them start chipping or wearing  off the very next day.  </li>
            <li> Stays super shiny throughout &amp; you can remove yourself instead of having to go back to a salon.</li>
            <li> PERHAPS I GOT A BOTTLE THAT WAS OLDER SINCE IT WAS HEAVY/THICK WHEN APPLIED.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still pretty shiny-not nearly as nice as it was initially, and there are quite a few chips.</li>
            <li> Vinylux lasts easily 3 weeks with only tip wear apparent -</li>
            <li> Taking into account that I am very rough on my nails, am constantly having them in water &amp; my nails are also very brittle (which makes it easy for polish to peel off) - I&#x27;d say this product is worth it, considering it is cheaper than Essie &amp; OPI!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product to people I know.</li>
            <li> After using high end polishes, I find that CND goes on easier and lasts two weeks.</li>
            <li> high gloss</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have my hopes set too high</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It stayed on longer than any other regular polish I own.</li>
            <li> It really protects soft nails</li>
            <li> Keeps the vnylux polish looking great and elimnates expensive manicures.  </li>
            <li> Keeps your polish nice for at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Normal polish normally lasts about a day on me.</li>
            <li> SAVE your money waste of 6.14 theirs nothing magical about this nail polish.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra effort, however.</li>
            <li> Stays on with the color for almost a week if you don&#x27;t do heavy stuff at home :)</li>
            <li> I bought a few of the Vinylux nail polishes and top coat after a friend of mine raved about them on Facebook.  </li>
            <li> This top coat makes my home manicures last twice as long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth getting, but its not the same as a gel manicure.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the extra effort</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t know if that was normal or not,</li>
            <li> I use it with other brands of nail polish and it works fine</li>
            <li> Not hard to remove at all.</li>
            <li> she told me you only need 2 coats of the polish on dry nails and this top coat.</li>
            <li> Your nails dry almost instantly and the polish stays on more than a week.</li>
            <li> Necessary to use this or other good topcoat in order for your polish to last a week as promised.</li>
            <li> I dries quickly and lasts long.  </li>
            <li> The beauty of this stuff as compared to other extended last shine product is that is comes off easily with fingernail polish, unlike gel, you don&#x27;t need to soak!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it with other Vinylyx products so I might have to do that before making an accurate review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been one day, I will update in a week with new results  </li>
            <li> So now I have to buy a brand new one for all the CND nail polish I have.</li>
            <li> blog is to use a very light color (I have lavishly loved) as a base, then whatever brand/color you like as usual, followed by the top coat.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite as fabulous as I expected, but I am a busy mom who does lots of hand and dish washing.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered for years with super dry nails.  </li>
            <li> Finally i can be free with a polish that only requires changing after 7-10 days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the polishes I got were old, or what, but they go on kind of thick and goopy,</li>
            <li> I have never been much for using a top coat because they were always so thick and gummy.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to do my nails every other day, I am happy that this polish does stay for a week, at least.</li>
            <li> so I just paint another coat (about 2 days in) and my manicure ends up lasting the whole 7 days, sometimes even longer!</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed and find Vinylux is the best nail polish I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> my nail polish lasts WAY more than a week- two week if not more.</li>
            <li> I first located it in England while there, and finally found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My nails chipped after 1 day so same as other top coats</li>
            <li> When I first learned about this 7-day polish, it was in the salon where I tried it instead of regular polish for a manicure.</li>
            <li> Lasts longer than other top coats I have tried, but doesn&#x27;t last a week on me.</li>
            <li> Super glossy, super thick, but doesn&#x27;t bubble.  </li>
            <li> It dries fast, gives your nails a wet, glossy look, and prevents chipping longer than any other type of top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Dries quickly, but sometimes if I put too much on it leaves little bubbles which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> did much better with Sally Hanson Nail Shine Miracle Top Coat, which has become virtually impossible to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I typically get about 10 days out of my polish which is much better than traditional nail polish.</li>
            <li> Ive also used betweeb polish to reseal worn nails where Ive used or overwashed hands and want a little extra protection between nail color changes.easy to tell when it dries with both color and top coat.  </li>
            <li> they last the whole week (even if you do the dishes or wash clothes,</li>
            <li> Keeps polish chip proof for 10 days ,, dries in 8 minutes and can use hands completely without messing manicure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done my toes and so far have lasted almost a month without any noticeable wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only on day three, but I really put it to the test today and no chipping.</li>
            <li> and it really does last.  </li>
            <li> Does not stay on would not waste your money</li>
            <li> Really lasts, i can get up to 10-11 days out of it (lighter colors last longer).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m busy with my hands</li>
            <li> I was rather hesitant to try the CND Vinylux system as I had noticed mixed reviews, but I needed an alternative to gel polish as it was very drying and damaging to my nails.</li>
            <li> so I would advise against using them, as this must bond directly to the nail for it to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really does make your nail polish last.</li>
            <li> I get longer-lasting results when a pro gives my mani, but this lasts much longer than a regular at-home job.</li>
            <li> I did not think that was possible, but this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> a manicurist and stay-mom of 3yrs old)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather deal with the gel polish and at least know that when I&#x27;m done I&#x27;m done for 2 weeks or more.</li>
            <li> I even put it over my 2 week old gel nails to help them last a few day more.</li>
            <li> It stays on your nails much longer than regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> I am a a busy nurse with a 6month old baby which means my nails&amp; polish take a beating.  </li>
            <li> Experimented -  vinylux only lasted a few days without this top coat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for years to find polish that will last more than a few days on my nails.  </li>
            <li> Glad my nails grow slowly</li>
            <li> By the time I am ready to apply the second coat, the first is completely dry.</li>
            <li> First, let your nails dry completely before applying any nail polish.</li>
            <li> Man of them are very streaky and require several coats (particularly bicycle yellow).</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders at first, by it seems to dry out soon.</li>
            <li> Must have top coat for long long long term wear.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t quite help the polish last a full week, but it helps the color to last longer than traditional nail polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is different about this top coat but</li>
            <li> consulted with several sources before deciding on a color - A few of my favorite bloggers who have tried the product, YouTube reviews, &amp; the official Vinylux website to see swatches of the colors (their website clarifies whether it is sheer, semi-sheer or opaque which was very helpful because I only like opaque colors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would order the CND VINYLUX NAIL COLOR, as well, next time, as the polish that I have been using was not appropriate for this top coat.</li>
            <li> put over regular essie and helped my mani last almost a whole week!</li>
            <li> w/ less wear &amp; tear on my nails being home, I&#x27;m lucky if I can get 2-3 days before it chips.</li>
            <li> For me it keeps vinylux polish from chipping, peeling, or becoming dull.  </li>
            <li> Do not care for this product does not last does not dry fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt; 2 steps so fast and long lasting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My manicurist uses this product and it really lasts long.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hands dozens of times per day and normal polish chips the same day I put it on!</li>
            <li> I purchased that a few years back, but I heard that polish can last for many years.</li>
            <li> I am pretty rough with gardening and refinishing furniture.</li>
            <li> As long as you use the Scrub Fresh and the top coat, per the directions, this polish will last at least a week with NO chipping!</li>
            <li> It does however last longer than normal polish</li>
            <li> Other than that, it does live up to its name and protected my nail color very well.</li>
            <li> I recently had a manicure by a new nail tech.  </li>
            <li> and I have to touch up my polish every few days, but that&#x27;s a huge improvement over every day, like it was with regular polish.</li>
            <li> I even tried it a few times and was more careful with what I was doing with my finger nails.</li>
            <li> It never lasted a week, however, polish on my toes last at least 3 weeks or more.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been able to get it only through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It took a few tries to make it work, but I have grown to love</li>
            <li> , on my nails it lasts a few days without the tops chipping, but I type a lot, I was expecting more after reading all of the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that it would keep my nails chip free for at least 5-7 days</li>
            <li> This clear polish works only with Vinylux Polish.</li>
            <li> So far it does not last for 7 days.</li>
            <li> Though it killed me to wait what seemed like an eternity for the polishes to arrive, it was so worth</li>
            <li> The thing that makes me want to repaint is the growth from my cuticles!!!&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to have some sort of cuticle gel/moisturizer as that is a frustrating difference of a salon mani vs. doing your nails yourself.  </li>
            <li> would say...that this is a definite buy.&lt;br /&gt;***7 days and no chipping, creates a hard nail, and easy to take off.</li>
            <li> stuff dries quickly &amp; my manicures last for a week with a few chips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only because the polish - a bright pink - started looking a little dark, however, I think that that&#x27;s only because of the polish color.</li>
            <li> I found the polish chipped as readily as any other.  </li>
            <li> It really does make a difference at setting the polish and ultimately making the mani last as long as possible!!!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, but a little harder to remove than traditional polish.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not limited.</li>
            <li> This top coat is the secret to making the Vinylux polish last a week.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it last longer than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used in the past, but I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> but i was hoping for a least a full week without any chipping or peeling.</li>
            <li> In other reviews, I saw that it works best with the cnd \\&quot;sticky base coat\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this top coat and base coat because my hair stylist recommended it to me &amp; said that her polish stays on her fingernails for about 2 weeks &amp; her toe nail polish stays on for a month.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but the seller sold me one that was old and too thick to apply because it had dried out.</li>
            <li> So I sat down and  filed, shaped, used cuticle remover, - the whole 9 yards</li>
            <li> I usually do another layer of top coat after a few days, especially on the tips, so help it last.</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s been 48 hours; a trip to the mall, a trip to the grocery store, 8 loads of laundry, 3 sinks full of dishes, broke down about about a dozen boxes for the recycling, half a dozen showers (twins included) and general household cleaning/cooking and at the end of the weekend 1 nail chipped within 24 hours and 2 after 48....</li>
            <li> Makes home manicure/pedicure so much easier and without annoying scratch marks on the freshly done nails!!!</li>
            <li> Not only does my polish only last 2 days before it chips, it takes forever for it to dry.</li>
            <li> doesnt chip as soon as regular nail polish, and doesnt last as long as gel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long either of these brands last with regular glossy or matte colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble applying other top coats in the past</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely over the Vinylux base coat and helps keep the polish looking new for up to two weeks.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;d spent as much as $20 a bottle for nail color, thinking the more expensive would last longer.  </li>
            <li> Again, this didn&#x27;t last as long as it said it would.</li>
            <li> Keeps polish from chipping as long as you properly prepped your nails before applying the color.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the vinylux  color polish; didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Polish last s a long time...</li>
            <li> It protects, but the shine doesn&#x27;t seem to last quite as long as the full-on shellac.</li>
            <li> Shines and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> This product really long last as it says.</li>
            <li> Works well but doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as they advertise.  </li>
            <li> It makes your nails shiny and it keeps the polish on a long time (especially when I travel I use it!).</li>
            <li> Use Seche Vite topcoat instead for a long lasting shine.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> The main reason is my nails are very soft, weak, and peel - NO MATTER</li>
            <li> This is my second order, and I am very hard on my nails and rarely remember to wear gloves.  </li>
            <li> and BEFORE I applied the polish, I wiped my nails with Walgreen&#x27;s generic witch hazel and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping that it would make my manicure last at least a week.  </li>
            <li> have a two and half year old son (read: bathing him, cleaning up, and wear and tear on my nails), as well as packing my house up to move (read: boxes</li>
            <li> It took a while to dry completely (over an hour) and even then I didn&#x27;t know if it would last through the night because it still felt a little off.</li>
            <li> Definitely be sure to use this with other Vinylux products, though, as it is useless otherwise.</li>
            <li> The first time I used I was skeptical but pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Occupational Therapist, and I wash my hands all day long in between patients, but with this topcoat, I don&#x27;t have to worry about chipping for 4 days or longer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a buyer for life as long as the formula doesn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> Plus it the shine also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I started using these two products, my nails are as long as my sister&#x27;s acrylic nails</li>
            <li> to  long  maybe  </li>
            <li> I use it every week for my manicure and the nail color lasts all week long.</li>
            <li> Polish stays on twice as long.</li>
            <li> Smoothes away the imperfection and helps you hold on to your mani for a long time.</li>
            <li> If you use as directed - it can last almost 3 weeks with minimal chip/wear and tear.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> This takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> Did not like this, takes way to long to dry.  </li>
            <li> This can be used with the other CND Polishes or regular polish.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried the product with other CND nail polish, but paired with some polishes I have found it to last around three to four days.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and it will last a longer time than other polishes on the market.</li>
            <li> I like to put it on every other day to make the polish last</li>
            <li> This kept the polish longer than other polishes, but it did not last a week.</li>
            <li> Why am I not surprised!</li>
            <li> I even use it with my other brands of nail polish to make them last longer.</li>
            <li> I have nails that split and peel, and thus, cannot keep polish on my nails for very long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to sit around for my nails to dry, because I am always running between work, events for my kid, dealing with my dog, chores, cooking, cleaning, washing.  </li>
            <li> From the application to dry time to the length of wear</li>
            <li> If there is moisture in them from a cuticle soak or shower, they will shrink as they dry</li>
            <li> You nails are completely dry in 10 - 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> only one small barely noticeable chip.</li>
            <li> It also goes on in a less messy fashion than normal polish.  </li>
            <li> There are a few small pieces of polish chipped at the end, but it really is nothing to notice and that is with Rubble (a dark grey) which would be very obvious.  </li>
            <li> I love the lacquers but for some reason this discolors to an awful yellowy white straight away.</li>
            <li> My nail polish has a shine and lasts for a long time!!</li>
            <li> On the advice of my previously mentioned friend, I walked outside, held my fingers up and let the sun \\&quot;cure</li>
            <li> almost black, just a hint of blue in it!</li>
            <li> BUT TYPICAL  happening last Saturday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my polish on for 6 days now and am just starting to see slight wear on the tips.</li>
            <li> First I just recently got my nails stronger by using Nail Tek, and the fact that I cant use my base coat with the CND Vinylux polishes, doesnt really fancy me.</li>
            <li> For those that say their polish chips after a few days it&#x27;s likely because your coats weren&#x27;t dry before you applied this</li>
            <li> This polish system has supported my weak, dry nails and as they have grow out, I now have  healthier new  nails!  </li>
            <li> So far not loving it.</li>
            <li> I am a professional woman who just goes without manicures because they are too delicate and require weekly trips to the salon.  </li>
            <li> It lasted a few days which is longer than my regular polish!</li>
            <li> as expected.  </li>
            <li> I probably could leave this polish on for another few days if it was necessary.  </li>
            <li> You just need to be careful of getting it on your skin.</li>
            <li> This definitely helps your nail polish stay on for a few days longer -</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I get a few to several from this.</li>
            <li> It wlll last a week with a few touchups every other day or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty hard on my nails, and this polish lasted for at least a week with no chipping.  </li>
            <li> Nails still chipped, but my polish lasted a little long than other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Let nail polish dry completely before applying a thin layer.</li>
            <li> Using this topcoat over my regular base and color makes my nails feel strong.</li>
            <li> One for me and two other ppl</li>
            <li> 3 days longer wear from my nail polish than I have with other topcoats.  </li>
            <li> Unheard of before with any other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I would like to see if it helps my other polishes stay longer, but haven&#x27;t had a chance to do this yet.</li>
            <li> have always had chipping problems with other polishes  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product with both vinylux color and other nail polish.</li>
            <li> However, I read other tips online</li>
            <li> also a variation of your very dark opaque colors...like a very dark navy blue perhaps without a speckle shine...</li>
            <li> this will keep my nailpolish from chipping for at least 5 days, and even then, they are barely noticeable even when using a dark nail polish.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two colors; one is the dark dahlia and the other is rubble.  </li>
            <li> This product did not work well; It was actually a bit dull.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t always last 7 days but usually at least 5.  </li>
            <li> I definitely think it is worth trying if you are unhappy with your nail polish!</li>
            <li> I use it several times between manicures to help strengthen my poor abused nails as a result of using acrylic nails so long.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I have so much oil in my nails that polishes and topcoats peel off within 24 hours of application.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is easier to get on and off, but if I have to re-do the manicure every couple of days because of the edges wearing or chipping, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that nail color can fade towards end of wear.</li>
            <li> (I apply 2 base coats of color, and one of the top coat)</li>
            <li> I am still searching for the top and base coat that would last for at least 5 days.</li>
            <li> I use this top coat with Essie base coat and polishes or OPI polishes</li>
            <li> The polish dries in less than 5 min and my manicure last at least a week without chipping.</li>
            <li> the only thing is it is a little hard to get off</li>
            <li> Listen to me - NO CHIPS for a week - just slight tip wear.</li>
            <li> It made a slight difference in time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Less harmful than gel polishes, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Half way threw the bottle it gets tacky</li>
            <li> drys up at about slightly less than quarter of the bottle-used by wife</li>
            <li> Manicure with this product  using  CND Vinylux polish does dry in about 8 minutes and lasts for at least a week.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the sides will start to come up a little bit</li>
            <li> Not sure if it can be used with other brands, but I will try it.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I was a little ambivalent when I purchased this product and the nail polish &amp;#34;Negligee&amp;#34;, because of said reviews.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little time and effort but is removed without soaking and without damage to nails.</li>
            <li> It dries crazy fast and even with my polish under it being a little tacky.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing, really.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> It stayed on through a messy Christmas project with students at school, through packing for vacation, opening presents, washing dishes, etc.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t don&#x27;t any heavy cleaning.</li>
            <li> I did get some chipping after a few days</li>
            <li> I have been using this polish for a few years now.</li>
            <li> After a few years without, I swapped to shellac.</li>
            <li> Keeps my polish from chipping a few days longer than without it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> A waste of money</li>
            <li> My advise to all negative reviews, watch U-tube video on how to prep and apply base coat and weekly top coat.</li>
            <li> absolutely recommend if you do not want to commit to gel polish but hate short &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; wear stuff.  </li>
            <li> I use it on regular nail polish and it is very hard, I usually get</li>
            <li> I use this every Sunday night as my topcoat on my natural nails that are very thin.  </li>
            <li> but I usually have a few chips in my nails by the end of the week.</li>
            <li> Goes on thick and glossy and dries in less than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I used a base coat from CND, 2 coats of polish, 1 coat if CND super shiny, and1 coat of this.</li>
            <li> If you apply thin coats, your nails will be dry in 5 minutes, and all cured in 8!</li>
            <li> I had very little chipping</li>
            <li> Not sure if I bought from a knockoff seller, but this isn&#x27;t what I got in the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this</li>
            <li> For the past 10 years I have not used ANY polish, thinking it was the polish</li>
            <li> (usually 5 days is the max), but I&#x27;m also a &amp;#34;picker&amp;#34; and by the end of the week begin picking at my nails...</li>
            <li> I usually polish nails and will chip by end of day.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to try it it with a CND nail polish</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it because I bought it, but I am not sure that I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Was pretty disappointed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, the manicure lasted 7 days, and could have probably longer, (usually my manis start chipping around day 3)</li>
            <li> but I swear my polish dried faster and lasted longer!&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;</li>
            <li> I have been using Sally Hansen product - in the black bottle also - and the Sally Hansen items says that it lasts 2 weeks which is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how this product has received one star reviews.  </li>
            <li> no more smudges, indentations, etc.  </li>
            <li> - not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product.</li>
            <li> I order the product, I was very disappointed when I received a use bottle of top coat, it was so thick</li>
            <li> Did my nails in the evening, the next day I lunched and shopped, polish needed to be removed by the afternoon, it was positively awful, large chips</li>
            <li> I called around locally but it is impossible to purchase anywhere other than on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It stays on at least 10 days with very little chipping.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to take it off if you use non-acetone remover.</li>
            <li> With the polish on, my nails were hard and after the polish was removed my nails were still hard.  </li>
            <li> Your nail polish will not chip for at least 5 days.</li>
            <li> Lasts at least one week with no problems.</li>
            <li> Smeared, went on thick, lasted 2 days tops.&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> I put it on over 3 thick coats of Vinylux and it lasted almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> My nails are unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, just spread it on thickly, don&#x27;t keep brushing it to make it spread out.</li>
            <li> Definitely try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I and my friends tried it, all 3 of us have weak nails prone to breakage.  </li>
            <li> So sorry I wasted all that money!</li>
            <li> My nails are weak and therefore they bend a lot.</li>
            <li> Smudges and thick!</li>
            <li> I am usually very hard on my nails.  </li>
            <li> It started chipping at the tips after about 4 days and was very dull from the start.</li>
            <li> My nails are thin and weak</li>
            <li> My nails are thin and weak.</li>
            <li> packing tape getting stuck on nails and pulled off and really, really tough wear on my nails).  </li>
            <li> It shiny and tough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and smears the color coat.</li>
            <li> I do my regular manicure, using a base coat,</li>
            <li> I have had terribly thin nails for years.  </li>
            <li> I was so tired of going to the salon for gel manicures.</li>
            <li> Game.</li>
            <li> My nails have never been longer and stronger (they used to split and peel) and I credit this as PART of the secret.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I did not get the long wear Vinylux advertised.</li>
            <li> no matter how thin you try to get it,</li>
            <li> and I am used to doing thin, I also do gel nails on myself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not great at it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot recommend it to people with weak nails.  </li>
            <li> I still chips at the tips, but part of that involves the weak nails the polish is applied to!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very hard on my manicures and it still lasted!</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Expensive, though.  </li>
            <li> I was once a fake nail girl.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> and I am eager to get away from twice weekly shellac manicures because it&#x27;s expensive and dries out my nails.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is very tough, too.  </li>
            <li> My nails are very thin and flexible</li>
            <li> Expensive, time-consuming, toxic and destructive.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Tried on 1 finger and disappointed I am unable to return the product.</li>
            <li> When a friend told me I could do a gel manicure at home, I was very skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Gets globby and impossible to apply after a while.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product as it chipped before a week was up.</li>
            <li> Disappointment!</li>
            <li> obsessed!!</li>
            <li> I used to hate taking the time to give myself manicures at home because they would just be ruined within a day or two.  </li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for the base coat and never found one then when I saw my manicurist</li>
            <li> It dries in under 10 minutes, and it works with Vinylux nail polishes to create a long-lasting polish that doesn&#x27;t require a base coat.  </li>
            <li> It is my understanding that a base coat is not needed because the polish itself contains a basecoat and a nail strengthener.  </li>
            <li> apply a generous coat of CND Stickey Base Coat.</li>
            <li> I use it without a base coat and with whatever polish I have on hand.</li>
            <li> In my experience, base coats cause this to chip prematurely</li>
            <li> I use a base coat, two coats of color and this topcoat.  </li>
            <li> Base coat:</li>
            <li> I do find that I need a sticky base coat, regardless.</li>
            <li> It lasts without the base coat for about 3 days before you see wear,but even then it is unnoticable.</li>
            <li> and we all were so very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> very disappointed in this product line.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> nail polish for me lasts a MAX of 3 days before looking disgusting.  </li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Great top coat!&lt;br /&gt;I found the smell to be just like any other nail polish or top coat.&lt;br /&gt;Kept the polish from chipping.</li>
            <li> Love this product really works</li>
            <li> I did like the top coat.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this stuff.  I used to hate taking the time to give myself manicures at home because they would just be ruined within a day or two.  Now I use the Vinylux Top Coat EVERY time I paint my nails and they last a week every time!  Sometimes the sides will start to come up a little bit so I just paint another coat (about 2 days in) and my manicure ends up lasting the whole 7 days, sometimes even longer!</li>
            <li> Good quality and price</li>
            <li> A definite must to use over your favorite nail polish color. Adds shine and protection. Reapply weekly over non chipped polish to extend the life of your color.</li>
            <li> My nails are healthy and I had two chips the same day I put it on.  I was really disappointed that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  I do my regular manicure, using a base coat, then 2 light coats of OPI color of choice.  Then one coat of Vinylux.  The next night or two nights later add another coat of Vinylux and my manicure lasts ALMOST TWO WEEKS!!!!!  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> did not stay on peeled right off almost immediately. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This top coat is the secret to making the Vinylux polish last a week.  Two coats of polish and top coat, all dries hard in less than 30 minutes!</li>
            <li> This nal polish is truly amazing. Normally my nail doesn&#x27;t last more than a day, i have. Over three weeks using this top coat and they have lasted 5 days even washing dishes. I use it with other brands of nail polish and it works fine</li>
            <li> The best products for nail care.  I&#x27;m saving money on gel nails and nobody knows.</li>
            <li> Delivery timely and fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay...prefer fast drying topcat.  This takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> nice and shinny but does not last a week</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with the vinylux line!  While I don&#x27;t get a full 7 days of wear (I have 3 kids and craft a lot with my hands) I get a good 4 or 5 days with no chipping and usually 2 weeks on my toes!  Love how it makes my nails feel stronger unlike gel nails which left my nails brittle.</li>
            <li> 2.5 weeks and still perfect. Glad my nails grow slowly</li>
            <li> I know this works great for many people, but the polish and top coat lasted no longer than regular polish on me.  It chipped off while I took a shower.  I know natural UV light (the sun) is supposed to harden the top coat, I may try it with my gel UV light just to see if it helps.</li>
            <li> Dries super quick and shiny</li>
            <li> You must try these polishes and this top coat is a must.  I have not been disappointed and find Vinylux is the best nail polish I have ever used.  The top coat is so important in making these polishes last a week.</li>
            <li> Great complement to vinylux polish - this product has subbed for gel nail manicures at the salon.</li>
            <li> This clear polish works only with Vinylux Polish. It works very fast to set the polish and it smoothes out any &amp;#34;oops&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Best topcoat! Shines all week, reapply each week for just-done look.</li>
            <li> Works great with CND Vinylux polish.  My nails almost went an entire week before chipping.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, without touch ups this will keep my nailpolish from chipping for at least 5 days, and even then, they are barely noticeable even when using a dark nail polish.</li>
            <li> It chipped after 2 days</li>
            <li> Gave it a one star only because I couldn&#x27;t give it zero. It doesn&#x27;t cure under the light and it peels off in minutes.</li>
            <li> Did not like this, takes way to long to dry.  Dazzle Dry Top Coat is a much superior product - dries rock hard in 5 minutes always.  Tried on 1 finger and disappointed I am unable to return the product.</li>
            <li> I now only use Vinylux nail polishes!  they last the whole week (even if you do the dishes or wash clothes, etc etc) and they still look amazing.  They will not look as glossy as with the Shellac, but you can put another coat of this top coat and your nails will look glossy again!</li>
            <li> Again, this didn&#x27;t last as long as it said it would. I will use it as a regular top coat on top of other nail polishes in the future.</li>
            <li> Love it! Love it! Love it! This polish stayed on a full week and more! Absolutely amazing product! I will definitely buy more of this brand.</li>
            <li> Love it! My polish lasts for a week.</li>
            <li> Great top coat for the Vinylux polish</li>
            <li> This product and Amazon&#x27;s delivery service exceeded my expectations. Thanks!,,,,</li>
            <li> This top coat makes the Vinylux polish really shine and it seems to help the polish last longer too.</li>
            <li> the best topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Stayed on only for a day or so</li>
            <li> Adds great shine. Looks just like gel polish from a salon.</li>
            <li> This top coat was short-lived as mine became gooey after a short period of time. Other than that, it does live up to its name and protected my nail color very well.</li>
            <li> I love the vinylux polishes. They definitely have lasting power!!! I wash my hands dozens of times per day and normal polish chips the same day I put it on! The Vinylux lasts about a week for me, which is amazing. This top coat makes it shine and protects it a few more days. DRIES FAST TOO</li>
            <li> This is required for best performance of Vinylux Polish. Love it!</li>
            <li> CND VINYLUX TOP COAT Weekly polish is just that you only have to apply it weekly it stayed on for over a week</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve found so far that lasts 2 weeks or longer on my toenails.  It lasts about 4 days on my fingernails, I haven&#x27;t been able to get a week out of it yet.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I bought from a knockoff seller, but this isn&#x27;t what I got in the salon. Didn&#x27;t last more than a day. What a waste.</li>
            <li> Keeps your polish nice for at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to add to the polish life.  Polish chipped off and peeled even though it was supposed to last longer.</li>
            <li> Stays on for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Love this brand! Beautiful colors &amp; polish lasts longer than most &amp; makes nails very strong! Great price &amp; fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Works; came well-packaged, and no complaints at all! Can also be used over non-Vinylux nail lacquers.</li>
            <li> If used with CND vinylux polish, your mani will last 2-3 days before chipping at the tips, not a week like they advertise.  I;ve used this as a top coat with other brands and types of polish/lacquer and it works well with all of them.  It dries fast, gives your nails a wet, glossy look, and prevents chipping longer than any other type of top coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  This is currently the best top coat on the market that&#x27;s available for non-professionals.</li>
            <li> This is a must if your going to use the CND- Vinylux polish. I looked everywhere for the base coat and never found one then when I saw my manicurist she told me you only need 2 coats of the polish on dry nails and this top coat. It&#x27;s super fast and keeps my polish on for up to 10 days.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite nailpolish!!!!</li>
            <li> It lasts pretty long but the longer your nails are the quicker it chips, even with the top coat.</li>
            <li> This works great as directed over Vinylux colors, but I found it also works great over other brand colors.</li>
            <li> It peels within 2 days. Maybe because I still used another top coat. Will try using it without a top coat and see how it lasts.</li>
            <li> I used as a top coat at home over my nail polish( I used my own regular nail polish not CND). It lasted 4 days without chipping which I&#x27;m very happy about. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Necessary last step with Vynylux Polish. Great find for my splitting nails.</li>
            <li> I was using Seche Vite and Out the Door for about a year.  Each one caused shrinkage issues and my mani would chip in one day.  CND Vinylux was recommended by someone online and I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m never looking back!  I love this topcoat.  Unlike SV, you don&#x27;t have to glop it on in order for it to work.  And unlike SV and Out The Door, no shrinkage!  Now if I forget to cap my tips it&#x27;s no big deal!  The best part is that my manicures actually last longer than a day.  It dries to the touch within 7-10 minutes.  This is my new holy grail, give it a shot!</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my go to nail guru.  I had chipping almost immediately and noticed that my shine diminished quickly.  I wondered if it was an older bottle.</li>
            <li> I used to get gel polish on my nails, but found that after wearing it for a while - my nails seemed to be damaged.  I bought 2 bottles of color and the top coat and they don&#x27;t always last 7 days but usually at least 5.  Normal polish normally lasts about a day on me.</li>
            <li> this really works without damaging your nails like shellac. It lasts a good 5-7 days and does not dry out my nails.</li>
            <li> This product really works!  I will now only use these products - makes your manicures last!  Definitely try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty good.  Extends the life of you manicure!</li>
            <li> Honestly see no difference with this top coat as compared to others when I used with the vinylux Polish. Didn&#x27;t seem to improve longevity of the Polish.</li>
            <li> I recently had a manicure by a new nail tech.  She used CND Stickey Basecoat and then a coat of Vinylux.  I have had terribly thin nails for years.  They also split and peeled continually.  I notice immediately that the Vinylux stayed on longer than regular topcoat.  So, I went to Amazon, purchased the basecoat and topcoat.  It took a couple of months, but I started to notice the difference. My nails are now stronger and longer than ever before.  This the &amp;#34;real deal.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It lasts for about a week with a regular nail polish and it also dries quickly so you don&#x27;t need a Quickdry coat on top or a top coat.</li>
            <li> Good topcoat.  It does thicken more quickly than other brands.</li>
            <li> Does not wear well.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these. One for me and two other ppl and we all were so very disappointed with this product. It didn&#x27;t last 24 hours on our fingernails. All 3 of us  the same experience.</li>
            <li> Helps my manicures/polish.</li>
            <li> Keeps polish chip proof for 10 days ,, dries in 8 minutes and can use hands completely without messing manicure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty hard on my nails, and this polish lasted for at least a week with no chipping.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> best top cocat i ever tried</li>
            <li> I dries quickly and lasts long.  the only problem is that after about ten days it turns yellow.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let this polish fool you.  The CND Vinylux doesn&#x27;t work.  It won&#x27;t last a week.  I had clips on my nails within two days.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li> Found this polish at a beauty supply store, but am able to purchase it cheaper on Amazon.  Keeps nails strong and holds up in water too.</li>
            <li> Really really REALLY WORKS.  I love this stuff.  Gives a beautiful shiny finish, and it seriously lasts and lasts, and stands up under the &amp;#34;stress&amp;#34; of daily life and tasks.  A new favorite.</li>
            <li> This top coat is great!  It dries in under 10 minutes, and it works with Vinylux nail polishes to create a long-lasting polish that doesn&#x27;t require a base coat.  Definitely be sure to use this with other Vinylux products, though, as it is useless otherwise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is different about this top coat but the instructions for the polish said it is only supposed to be used with the matching top coat so I bought it.</li>
            <li> It changed my life :) I really like it.</li>
            <li> Can use with any polish. Great to on you&#x27;re not limited.</li>
            <li> As described for use with Vinylux Color Nail Polish this top coat goes on after . Ive also used betweeb polish to reseal worn nails where Ive used or overwashed hands and want a little extra protection between nail color changes.easy to tell when it dries with both color and top coat.  Look great wet but lose a bit of gloss when dry and prevents me from touching and smudging to check.</li>
            <li> Necessary to purchase this top coat with any of your CND Vinylux. It seals the polish, looks really beautiful and shiny when applied.</li>
            <li> I had this brand while on a cruise and really loved it. Finding this online excited me. I was disappointed with this product as it chipped before a week was up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and smears the color coat.</li>
            <li> I would give this 100 stars if I could. Along with Vinylux Polish it looks good for more days than OPI Infinite Shine.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that you don&#x27;t need a UV light. Just color, topcoat, then GO.&lt;br /&gt; 2 steps so fast and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Stays on my fingernails 7-12 days depending on what I do. I&#x27;ve done my toes and so far have lasted almost a month without any noticeable wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with the long lasting wear on this top coat, even on my kids.</li>
            <li> Love love it! Easy and beautiful!</li>
            <li> This product goes along with the Nail Polish Lacquer.  It was easy to use and dried quickly.  If this is what it takes to make my CND Vinylux last for two weeks, I will definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and for an exceptional price.  Would recommend seller without hesitation.  I am not sure my nails are happy with the product though.  Seem to have more shredding nails.</li>
            <li> In combination with the CND Vinylux 7-day polish, this is a real winner.  As advertised, it does stay on without chipping for a week or more!</li>
            <li> Experimented -  vinylux only lasted a few days without this top coat.  Mani with topcoat lasted 8 days.  And stayed nice / fresh / shiny.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t quite as fabulous as I expected, but I am a busy mom who does lots of hand and dish washing.  It lasted a few days which is longer than my regular polish!</li>
            <li> It peels within 24 hours</li>
            <li> Great price-fast service!</li>
            <li> This top coat goes on so easily. I&#x27;ve had trouble applying other top coats in the past but this one goes on so easily and dries quickly. Keeps polish from chipping as long as you properly prepped your nails before applying the color.</li>
            <li> I have suffered for years with super dry nails.  Chipping, peeling, breaking off.  I have tried every formula out there to no avail.  For the past 10 years I have not used ANY polish, thinking it was the polish and it&#x27;s chemicals that made my nails split --which was heartbreaking because I love having polished nails.  I have used the CND vinylux  polish,  vinylux top coat and CND  solar oil for about 3 months now.  It&#x27;s pretty easy.  Clean and push back your cuticles, wash your nails and hands so they are free from dirt and oil.  Apply 2 coats of the polish and 1 of the top coat.  Use the solar oil daily.  My nails are unbelievable!  This polish system has supported my weak, dry nails and as they have grow out, I now have  healthier new  nails!  Use this regularly and give your nails a chance to grow out.  Be patient!  You will not believe it!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products.</li>
            <li> beautiful color! doesnt chip as soon as regular nail polish, and doesnt last as long as gel. it looks good while it lasts!</li>
            <li> Best polish I&#x27;ve ever used! It stays on!</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT top coat. My stylist bought me this polish for Christmas. Boy am I in heaven! This polish lasted two weeks......Great investment...</li>
            <li> I can polish my nails myself with the light color that I chose.  With regular manicures, my polish stays on about 3 days.  This polish stays on for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a super shiny top coat like the gel ones you get in the Salon.  It does help in keeping the polish on for several days and keep it looking shiny.</li>
            <li> I am usually very hard on my nails.  My manicurist uses this product and it really lasts long.  No need to cure it under light like gels.</li>
            <li> I love CND products.  The Vinylux line it not as long-lasting as the Shellac, but it is so easy to apply, dries quickly, and lasts several days.  I plan to buy more colors to expand my collection.  I recommend this nail polish for sure.</li>
            <li> I have issues w/nail polish lasting more than 2 or 3 days.  With this polish, I am assured a full week&#x27;s of wear and they will remain almost intact.  I don&#x27;t have to be applying extra coats of polish to cover up  chips.&lt;br /&gt;Good buy</li>
            <li> Your nail polish will not chip for at least 5 days. Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to take it off if you use non-acetone remover.</li>
            <li> This really is a magical nail polish!  I am so happy that I tried it.  I bought more for my family as well because it works so well.  I tried the Romantique and Negligee colors (which are both beautiful), and this topcoat.  The directions say to paint on 2 layers of the color, and then one layer of the topcoat.  I added another topcoat layer for fun, and painted another layer on after 3 days.  The nail polish stayed on the whole time!!  It stayed on through a messy Christmas project with students at school, through packing for vacation, opening presents, washing dishes, etc.  That is what I call magical nail polish!</li>
            <li> So far not loving it. Was really hopeful for this company and the high rated top coat, but it&#x27;s just not working for me. The top coat has been staining the nail polish, and isn&#x27;t seeming to be chip resistant. I haven&#x27;t don&#x27;t any heavy cleaning. I&#x27;ve attached pictures of two coats of CND cake pop color and one coat of CND top coat. This picture was from the 2/3rd day and already chips. Had to remove it that same day, embarrassing walking around like that.</li>
            <li> Best product ever !!!</li>
            <li> SAVE your money waste of 6.14 theirs nothing magical about this nail polish. Nails chipped day 2...5 out of 10 nails are chipped..BUYER BEWARE,SAVE your money...</li>
            <li> this is the best thing since slised bread.  ABSOLUTELY the best and longest wearing polish you will ever buy.  comes in many many fashion colors. same results as shellack manicure with out harmful UV rays, easy to remove. Great Great product.  High Recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this top coat to go along with the Weekly Polish. Since my manicure only lasted for 3 days without starting to chip it&#x27;s my opinion that this isn&#x27;t a great product. It did dry fast and went on nicely but it wasn&#x27;t ever very shiny and the shine it did have started to wear off pretty quickly in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many polishes and top coats, but this one lasts longer than any of them.  And I&#x27;m talking about OPI and Nicole, etc., not just the cheap brands.  I really get 5-6 days out of this polish without chipping.  I definitely think it is worth trying if you are unhappy with your nail polish!</li>
            <li> I heard about Vinylux from a beauty blogger, and tried this product based on her suggestion.  I&#x27;ve also used the Vinylux colored polish (which are good, but not great), but this topcoat is awesome.  I use it on top of OPI and other polish brands, and LOVE how durable this topcoat is.  I&#x27;ve gotten 3 days longer wear from my nail polish than I have with other topcoats.  I&#x27;m an Occupational Therapist, and I wash my hands all day long in between patients, but with this topcoat, I don&#x27;t have to worry about chipping for 4 days or longer.  I have yet to get it to last a full week (usually 5 days is the max), but I&#x27;m also a &amp;#34;picker&amp;#34; and by the end of the week begin picking at my nails...not necessarily because they are chipping but more because it&#x27;s a nervous habit.  I have recommended this product to other friends, and they love it too!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I am a guy who loves polish. Vinylux goes on well and dries fast and doesn&#x27;t chip off.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and does last over a week. My nails are thin and weak so I&#x27;m happy to find something that doesn&#x27;t peel off the second day after application. good service too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to go with the nail laquers and it works with them wonderfully.  Nail  polish stays on for a week without chipping.</li>
            <li> The vinylux system saves me so much time! If you apply thin coats, your nails will be dry in 5 minutes, and all cured in 8! (I apply 2 base coats of color, and one of the top coat)</li>
            <li> I use this as a top coat for regular polish because some of the Vinylux colors are kind of unattractive to me, and it keeps the polish from chipping for over a week.  Smooths the appearance of ridges and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> overall good, but does not provide a shiny gel like appearance</li>
            <li> While the vinylux polish did not work as promised, this is a great topcoat- works with other brands of polish and really does dry completely within under nine minutes to a high gloss</li>
            <li> I ordered both the Vinylux top coat &amp; 1 color. It lasted a solid 4-5 days without chipping. Taking into account that I am very rough on my nails, am constantly having them in water &amp; my nails are also very brittle (which makes it easy for polish to peel off) - I&#x27;d say this product is worth it, considering it is cheaper than Essie &amp; OPI!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consulted with several sources before deciding on a color - A few of my favorite bloggers who have tried the product, YouTube reviews, &amp; the official Vinylux website to see swatches of the colors (their website clarifies whether it is sheer, semi-sheer or opaque which was very helpful because I only like opaque colors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very impressed with the product &amp; plan to order a few more colors.</li>
            <li> It works great--and lets my nails grow better than any other polish! It&#x27;s nice to be able to have longer nails!</li>
            <li> Top coat goes on nice, did not last one week.</li>
            <li> Got it bc of the claims to make polish last longer. I just used it saturday night, it is now monday morning. I started seeing chips by the time i woke up. I literally did it around 11:00pm the night before, and woke up around 10:00am....The polish itself has a very watery consistency. In other reviews, I saw that it works best with the cnd \\&quot;sticky base coat\\&quot;. I used that, which is very watery as well. I purchased that a few years back, but I heard that polish can last for many years. I used an OPI polish. The vinylux left a very nice s*** at first-comparable to gel. It&#x27;s still pretty shiny-not nearly as nice as it was initially, and there are quite a few chips. I&#x27;ll give it a try again...if anyone has any suggestions please let me know! Probably won&#x27;t purchase again, but will def update if I get better results.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles was not close properly &amp; some of the liquid was spill</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product again!  I&#x27;m only on day three, but I really put it to the test today and no chipping. I usually polish nails and will chip by end of day. My advise to all negative reviews, watch U-tube video on how to prep and apply base coat and weekly top coat.</li>
            <li> fabulous new product by CND.  Vinylux is an awesome product lasts as long as stated, even longer if you aren&#x27;t hard on your nails. The beauty of this stuff as compared to other extended last shine product is that is comes off easily with fingernail polish, unlike gel, you don&#x27;t need to soak!</li>
            <li> Lasted 2-3 days, even polish on my toes chipped. I expected so much more from this product.  I am still searching for the top and base coat that would last for at least 5 days.</li>
            <li> Really whiney.  My polish..vinyl lux stayed even through planting a truck load of flowers without gloves.  I do recommend this</li>
            <li> GREAT stuff, keeps my polish on for 2 weeks and my hands are always in water.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well! It goes over any nail color and dries very quickly! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Like the polish and products of Vinlyx, but it seems like if you keep it on for any length of time, it definitely weakens (my) nails.  Great delivery.</li>
            <li> Love this topcoat. It goes great with any polish color or brand.</li>
            <li> Have used&lt;br /&gt;Before. Excellent. My pedi lasts for 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the neutral pink, love it! It lasted the whole 7 days without chipping and stayed shiny! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Best top coat I have ever used. Dries quickly and helps prevent chipping better than any other brand I have tried.</li>
            <li> A very good product! My nail polish has a shine and lasts for a long time!!</li>
            <li> I was so tired of going to the salon for gel manicures. Finally i can be free with a polish that only requires changing after 7-10 days. Love this system. I use 3 coats of color instead of 2.</li>
            <li> Super fast drying &amp; didn&#x27;t need a touch up for over 10 days. And easily comes off with nail polish remover &amp; a cotton ball. So happy no lamp needed and not a difficult removal like gel polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really too sure with this product. First I just recently got my nails stronger by using Nail Tek, and the fact that I cant use my base coat with the CND Vinylux polishes, doesnt really fancy me. These kind of products dont really have nail strengthener ingredients within them so not being able to use my top coat will just have my nails back to where they were weak and britttle.</li>
            <li> Love being able to do my own gel nails and still remove the polish easily at home (I use just acetone polish remover from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply).  This top coat works beautifully over vinylux color polish - it&#x27;s all rock hard and looks stunning and professional.</li>
            <li> I use the top coat over the Vinylux Nail Enamel and it really makes the nail enamel &amp;#34;pop.&amp;#34;  It also seals the enamel very nicely and the manicure does stay for several days without chipping.  So far, I am every pleased with the top coat.</li>
            <li> Really works.  Last polished nails 10 days ago and they still look good.  Very satisfied with this product and will recommended.</li>
            <li> I order the product, I was very disappointed when I received a use bottle of top coat, it was so thick you could not even use it, I&#x27;m so surprise is was even ship to me.</li>
            <li> I was quite impressed by this top coat.&lt;br /&gt;I use with my regular opi and essie polishes.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff dries quickly &amp; my manicures last for a week with a few chips.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my nails look like they&#x27;re gel/shellac. Everyone keeps asking me if they are gel nails. Even when I go to the nail salon to get my nails done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. I&#x27;m very pleased. I&#x27;m a buyer for life as long as the formula doesn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I have been getting \\&quot;gel nails\\&quot; for several years.  The main reason is my nails are very soft, weak, and peel - NO MATTER WHAT I DO!!!  Or so I thought.......When a friend told me I could do a gel manicure at home, I was very skeptical.  She insisted, I purchased, and here&#x27;s my review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased \\&quot;Lavishly Loved #126\\&quot; and the \\&quot;CND Vinylux Top Coat Weekly Polish.  Somewhere I had read that Witch Hazel, wiped on clean nails with a cotton ball, is a great nail prep - as well as cheap.  So I sat down and  filed, shaped, used cuticle remover, - the whole 9 yards and BEFORE I applied the polish, I wiped my nails with Walgreen&#x27;s generic witch hazel and let it dry.  The Lavishly Loved polish was easily to apply and with one coat, the result was a natural French manicure.  No globs and no streaks.  Two coats produced a manicure that looks clean and professional.  The Vinylux Top Coat Weekly Polish applied easily as well.  On the advice of my previously mentioned friend, I walked outside, held my fingers up and let the sun \\&quot;cure the manicure.\\&quot;  About 5 days into the week, I applied another coat of top coat and got 13 days of a non-chipped manicure!  Mind you, this includes washing dishes, laundry, and cleaning without gloves as well as moving the lawn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I redid the manicure was the growth showed and I&#x27;m OCD.  With the polish on, my nails were hard and after the polish was removed my nails were still hard.  After 2 months of continued use, I actually have nails and they are strong and healthy and I actually have to file because they get too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don&#x27;t know if the witch hazel prep made the difference, the polish and top coat made the difference, or the sun curing process made the difference, I only know that when I continued using these products and this routine,  SOMETHING made a difference.  It is my understanding that a base coat is not needed because the polish itself contains a basecoat and a nail strengthener.  Whatever..................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I pleased with the products:  100% - in fact I just ordered 2 additional colors.trengthener.  Whatever..................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I pleased with the products:  100% - in fact I just ordered 2 additional colors.</li>
            <li> This top coat lasts much longer than I would have thought possible. I still chips at the tips, but part of that involves the weak nails the polish is applied to!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to sit around for my nails to dry, because I am always running between work, events for my kid, dealing with my dog, chores, cooking, cleaning, washing.  I have things to do, you know?  I am a professional woman who just goes without manicures because they are too delicate and require weekly trips to the salon.  This nail polish dries in 9 minutes.  Let that sink in for a bit: no waiting at the salon, no praying you don&#x27;t smudge them in the car home or that your child wants you to get something for him as soon as you get home and inevitably ruin $20 worth of manicure the moment you step in the door.  I paint my nails and go to bed.  No smudges after 9 minutes.  It&#x27;s glorious.  Also, there are lots of great colors and I&#x27;ve been using these products for weeks and my nails have not changed.  It does not make them week like Shellac and it hasn&#x27;t stained them.  It also goes on in a less messy fashion than normal polish.  So now I&#x27;m the working mom with pretty nails who doesn&#x27;t pay $80 per month for them.</li>
            <li> Tried this at my nail salon and made my manicure last for more than 10 days.  My pedicure is on its 3rd week and still looks good!  Use with Vinylux Nail Lacquer.  No base coat needed.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Use this top coat to complete the CND Vinylux system. One would think I work for this company - I dont. Just love the polish. Found it at a spa I went to in Palm Desert and have been using since.</li>
            <li> and lasts a week just as they say!  It is my new polish!  Now I just need more colors!!  My hair dresser recommended Vinylux to me when I asked about durable nail polishes.  I don&#x27;t have the time or money to go for weekly nail appts.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of top coats and this by far is the BEST top coat I have found and it really does last.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Way too much money for what it does. Did not make my polish last a week. Was wearing out at the tips at the end of the first day.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat on the market today. It meets every one of my criteria: it goes on easily; it dries INSTANTLY to a brilliant shine; it leaves a flawless finish eliminating visible  signs of  bubbled or smeared nail polish and any ridges in the underlying  nail itself; it lasts making your nail polish color chip proof.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish! It is the first nail polish that will stay on my nails for a week with no chipping!</li>
            <li> I like this product although it looks glossy the first couple of days but begins to chip at about three days.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful glossy top coat, and I bought it based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews by other purchasers.  I and my friends tried it, all 3 of us have weak nails prone to breakage.  It only lasted maybe 24 hours before peeling and I broke 2 nails the weekend I tested it.  Unfortunately I cannot recommend it to people with weak nails.  For you who have strong nails, you will love the glossy finish.</li>
            <li> Keeps your nail polish longer!</li>
            <li> This nail polish really stays on for a week and has been gentle on my nails!!!  I would recommend this product to anyone who hates when you put polish on one day and it is chipped the next!</li>
            <li> This works well with the weekly CND nail polished. It works well alone too.</li>
            <li> Complements the lasting effect of the nail polish lacquer. It certainly met my expectations. Have used it only twice since it is a recent purchase and I will certainly continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have never had nail polish stay on and look good for more than a couple of days before using this top coat.  I tried this product for the first time 13 days ago and my polish still looks fine!  Amazing.  I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I TAKE THIS TO THE SALON AND SAVE THE +$3.00 UP CHARGE EACH WEEK TO USE THEIRS.  AND THAN AFTER 3 DAYS I ADD A TOP COAT AT HOME WHICH FURTHER EXTENDS MY MANI SAVING ME MORE MONEY.  IT&#x27;S A WIN WIN!!</li>
            <li> This can be used with the other CND Polishes or regular polish.  manicures will last for seven days without chips.  I&#x27;m very hard on my manicures and it still lasted!</li>
            <li> My manicurist in Miami told me it is her new favorite product.  I also bought the polish and it lasted a full two weeks!</li>
            <li> Great shine and last for much longer than a regular top coat. I&#x27;m pleased with the strength of my nails.</li>
            <li> This top coat is better than any I have used because it protects the nail lacquer from chipping and breaking. Plus it the shine also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this Vinylux top coat.  I have used it with regular OPI polish and it works the same as with the Vinylux polishes.</li>
            <li> Necessary when using Vinylux nail polish as it sets the polish.  Goes on easily, but a little harder to remove than traditional polish.  Worth the extra effort, however.</li>
            <li> It makes your nails shiny which lasts for days. I did get some chipping after a few days but I wash dishes so I guess it comes with the territory. Overall, I Love this top coat!</li>
            <li> Vinylux is amazing.  From the application to dry time to the length of wear I am HOOKED on vinylux plus it doesn&#x27;t ruin your fingernails when removing like gel/shellac polishes! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> good top coat for the vynilux line. be aware these polishes and top coat to age faster in the bottles and then tend to go on in a rather gummy fashion.</li>
            <li> No longer am I getting chipped nail polish or even chipped nails.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  Great when you are traveling because you don&#x27;t have to worry about chipped nail polish</li>
            <li> as expected.  lasts longer than typical polish; looks pretty good for about a week.  Expensive, though.  Probably would buy it locally next time.</li>
            <li> WOW!  you must have to use with CND polish i used w/OPI and it sucked!  Smeared, went on thick, lasted 2 days tops.&lt;br /&gt;will not purchase again.  Sally Hansen much cheaper buy local lasts a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I SWEAR BY THIS and have converted many, many friends. People- my nail polish lasts WAY more than a week- two week if not more. Game. Changer.</li>
            <li> This top coat helps seal in your polish for a whole week and is easily removed without all the steps you have to go through with gel polish.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the product with other CND nail polish, but paired with some polishes I have found it to last around three to four days. I am anxious to try it it with a CND nail polish</li>
            <li> This top coat makes the polish shine and stay on for most of a week, if you use your hands at work a lot, or in water a lot.  Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Love it. Stays on with the color for almost a week if you don&#x27;t do heavy stuff at home :)</li>
            <li> Does not last, more like a 7 hour polish!</li>
            <li> The must-do step if using VINYLUX polishes.</li>
            <li> This polish is awesome!  Stays on eight to ten days without chips depending on how you treat your mani. I am pretty rough with gardening and refinishing furniture. My mani still looked great at the end of the week. Nails looked healthy when push was removed. No splinting or flaking on the tips.</li>
            <li> Calling this a weekly polish is a misstatement.  It definitely does not last a week.  While it dries quickly and has a nice shine to it, I can get my polish to only last a couple of days.  I will continue to use it because I bought it, but I am not sure that I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Does not stay on would not waste your money</li>
            <li> Omg this is an amazing product at an even more amazing price. I paid $20.00 for a bottle of this at my hair salon. I can&#x27;t believe how cheap it was on Amazon. It really keeps my nails shiny for a full week and helps prevent chipping</li>
            <li> A perfect top coat for the colored vinylux weekly polish.  This stuff is very tough, too.  It takes a beating and keeps shining.</li>
            <li> Protects polish from chipping for days.  I won&#x27;t use anything else from now on.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice now and have been very pleased with this product. Would highly recommend this product to people I know.</li>
            <li> This is the only topcoat that does not chip. Lasts at least one week with no problems. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this polish for a few years now. I first located it in England while there, and finally found it on Amazon. It is amazing and works very well for me. After using high end polishes, I find that CND goes on easier and lasts two weeks. It is important to put another top coat on a week into your wear. It&#x27;s amazing, and I won&#x27;t use anything else. No base coat needed. Please make additional light pastel colors that are opaque. also a variation of your very dark opaque colors...like a very dark navy blue perhaps without a speckle shine...almost black, just a hint of blue in it! I am running out of colors to wear but will stick with this amazing polish! Follow the directions and it will last a longer time than other polishes on the market.</li>
            <li> did not stay on more than 3 days</li>
            <li> Good stuff - helps my polish last</li>
            <li> I found the polish chipped as readily as any other.  very disappointed in this product line.  Save your money and purchase a product that you can rely on.  This isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> It chipped 4 hours after I used it. Was pretty disappointed.  Really wanted to try it bcuz I love nail polish but it never lasts</li>
            <li> CND Vinylux polish +  CND Vinylux Top Coat&#x3D; The best home manicure i have ever experienced, by far. Apply the top coat again a week later and get a bonus week of wear. Fantastic!</li>
            <li> My nails have never been longer and stronger (they used to split and peel) and I credit this as PART of the secret. First, let your nails dry completely before applying any nail polish. If there is moisture in them from a cuticle soak or shower, they will shrink as they dry and if you&#x27;ve already applied polish it will crack and chip sooner.&lt;br /&gt;First apply a generous coat of CND Stickey Base Coat. Then 2 coats of polish (any brand), then follow with a nice thick coat of CND Vinylux Top Coat. It&#x27;s very thick, just spread it on thickly, don&#x27;t keep brushing it to make it spread out. It&#x27;s the easiest polish I&#x27;ve ever applied, like 2 strokes per nail. This stuff dries pretty quickly, too.&lt;br /&gt;I used to touch up the tips of my nails every single night and add a coat of top coat. Every night. My manicure would look great for a full 5-7 days, but it was high maintenance. (I model - my nails always have to look perfect.)&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using these two products, my nails are as long as my sister&#x27;s acrylic nails AND I only have to touch up the tips maybe every 3-4-days. Then I add a little color on the very edges and another top coat. After 5-7 days I add a whole new coat of color plus another CND Vinylux Top Coat. My manicures have lasted and looked great for 12 days! Unheard of before with any other products I&#x27;ve tried. I couldn&#x27;t recommend this any more strongly.</li>
            <li> love Vinylux.  Really lasts, i can get up to 10-11 days out of it (lighter colors last longer).  Top coat is essential.  absolutely recommend if you do not want to commit to gel polish but hate short &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; wear stuff.  love love love!</li>
            <li> I chose this product after reading the reviews of Vinylux products.  It is an okay top coat. I can&#x27;t say it last longer than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used in the past, but I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Love it!  Does not chip.</li>
            <li> keeps the polish intact for over a week.  good product</li>
            <li> As described, Beautiful color thanks.</li>
            <li> Its not weekly at all. My nails chipped after 1 day so same as other top coats</li>
            <li> Good product, shipped promptly, thanks</li>
            <li> This top coat is the absolute best. Works awesome not only with the Cnd nail polish but also any other brand for longer lasting color.</li>
            <li> This is the top coat for the vinylux nail polish.  It keeps the polish from coming off.  It really works too!</li>
            <li> Great product for your CND Vinylux nail polish.  I applied it after the second coat of nail polish, and reapplied in 5 days.  Great lasting shine.  Love working with this seller</li>
            <li> Nails still chipped, but my polish lasted a little long than other products I have tried.  May or may not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this top coat didn&#x27;t stay for me. Only lasted two days at the most. I even tried it a few times and was more careful with what I was doing with my finger nails.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product to top coat active nails.  It is strong and durable.</li>
            <li> I have never had a top coat that didn&#x27;t chip within 2-3 days except for a gel manicure until this. I have had my nail polish on for 8 days and there is not 1 chip! Really amazing results and I can&#x27;t recommend this more strongly. I used a base coat from CND, 2 coats of polish, 1 coat if CND super shiny, and1 coat of this. It&#x27;s nothing short of miraculous</li>
            <li> Great price and product. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> My nails never looked so good! I have done two manicures with this now and my nails stay absolutely chip free for 5-6 days. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. The polish dries in less than 5 min and my manicure last at least a week without chipping. It looks like gel polish. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Listen to me - NO CHIPS for a week - just slight tip wear. After! 7 days and I decided to redo my nails, only because the polish - a bright pink - started looking a little dark, however, I think that that&#x27;s only because of the polish color. I am sure if it was a dark color - it wouldn&#x27;t have made any difference.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the manicure lasted 7 days, and could have probably longer, (usually my manis start chipping around day 3), I just like for my polish to look fresh. The shine was there, and I didn&#x27;t put a fresh top coat on on purpose just to see what my nails would look like after 7 days. (also, I used a cheap beauty supply nail polish for $1.99)&lt;br /&gt;They were strong, and it seem like it did take about 10 minutes for my nails to completely dry (which I didn&#x27;t  like), but when I weigh 7 days and no chipping against, 10 minutes of sitting still, I will take the 10 minutes. I even tried to speed up the drying on my second attempt by holding my nails up against the light. It made a slight difference in time.&lt;br /&gt;I would say...that this is a definite buy.&lt;br /&gt;***7 days and no chipping, creates a hard nail, and easy to take off. I used Acetone nail polish remover and it came right off.&lt;br /&gt;Try it - I think you will be pleasantly pleased.</li>
            <li> great quality. fast shipping a++</li>
            <li> It lasted for 5 days. I work in the medical field so I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands.</li>
            <li> A great product. Your nails dry almost instantly and the polish stays on more than a week.</li>
            <li> I like it but I would not say that it makes my nail polish lash any longer than sally hansen from the drug store, on my nails it lasts a few days without the tops chipping, but I type a lot, I was expecting more after reading all of the other reviews.  plus I have tried it with VINYLUX nail polish and OPI nail polish with the same results</li>
            <li> This top coat is great.  Used with the nail polish your nails look great.</li>
            <li> Great product and priced well.  So glad to be able to use this with CND Vinylux polish as they are made to work together to protect your nails.</li>
            <li> This top coat for nail polish is very sturdy. I would order the CND VINYLUX NAIL COLOR, as well, next time, as the polish that I have been using was not appropriate for this top coat.</li>
            <li> This did not last a full week.  It did go on easy and did not clump up.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and in perfect condition. The product is wonderful. It really extends the life of my manicure. I put it on every 2-3 days and the polish will stay on for almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a boutique months ago and I&#x27;m back here for more! The top coat is all you really need to use over any brand nail polish. I like to put it on every other day to make the polish last an freshen the look. Also I like the texture it gives to the nail. Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> This product is great and lasted for 7 days as promised with the Vinylux Nail Polish Lacquer</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I did not get the long wear Vinylux advertised. My nails started chipping on day two!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of shellac but since the colors are a bit pricy and it takes a production to do your nails, I opted for this top coat as an alternative. It works great even with my normal OPI polish and drys quickly!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a nail technician.  It works fabulous on my nails!  I could never keep nails from chipping very quickly.  With 2 coats of polish and this as a top coat, my nails look good for a week or two.</li>
            <li> This kept the polish longer than other polishes, but it did not last a week. I would like to see if it helps my other polishes stay longer, but haven&#x27;t had a chance to do this yet.</li>
            <li> I love the nail polish the only thing is it is a little hard to get off you need to use acetate</li>
            <li> This is the product to seal Vinulux polish.  I use it several times between manicures to help strengthen my poor abused nails as a result of using acrylic nails so long.</li>
            <li> This top coat is expensive and doesn&#x27;t work any better than a cheaper brand. I used OPI nail poish and this as a topcoat.  Polish started to come off after 1 1/2 days.  I&#x27;ve been looking for years to find polish that will last more than a few days on my nails.  Was hopeful this topcoat might hold the polish on longer.  It didn&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t even return it from ordering it on Amazon.  So now I have another bottle of topcoat to add to my collection.</li>
            <li> I am simply smitten with my recent (how did I just learn of this:!:!) discovery of Vinylux. I was once a fake nail girl. Expensive, time-consuming, toxic and destructive. After a few years without, I swapped to shellac. I love it at first, but discovered it too hurt the nail, was somewhat time consuming, and I worried about the effect of the light on my skin and nail beds. THIS stuff is the bomb. I dries super fast, no light required, and does last amazingly well. My nails peel and chip within a day with regular polish. This stuff is the bomb. So happy. I haven&#x27;t kept it on a week yet. It&#x27;s so quick and easy to change colors (no soaking, just regular polish remover). Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural, quick, easy, beautiful. Super happy!</li>
            <li> Two weeks after my manicure (with CND  &amp;#34;Lobster Pot Red&amp;#34;) I apply a coat of this....and BELIEVE  ME...my nails look like I had JUST HAD A NEW MANICURE!!!....Truly, people go out of their way to mention the shine of this product!  It&#x27;s..really AMAZING!!&lt;br /&gt;A FUNNY, BUT TYPICAL  happening last Saturday......I was REALLY At &amp;#34;RED LOBSTER&amp;#34;...waiting for my take-out order....when a woman tapped me on my shoulder to COMPLIMENT me on my BEAUTIFUL NAIL POLISH LUSTRE!  (THE TRUTH!!! ....and, I was wearing &amp;#34;Lobster Pot&amp;#34; Red!..:)  !</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Makes the Vinlyux polish super shiny and lasts about 7-10 days!</li>
            <li> No other top coat gives the same shine (unless its a UV-set gel top coat) Dries fast, durable and inexpensive. I&#x27;m busy with my hands and I have to touch up my polish every few days, but that&#x27;s a huge improvement over every day, like it was with regular polish. I&#x27;d definitely recommend the VinyLux polishes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on its claim.  I was really hoping that it would make my manicure last at least a week.  It lasted 2 days and the manicure was chipping and then on day 3 the top coat was started to peel.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the polish, but lacks shine and staying power.  Not impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> its  good  but  I  does not  stay  on  the  nails  to  long  maybe  only  2  days</li>
            <li> Helps keep my manicure looking fresh for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;Drys nails fast !</li>
            <li> I love this topcoat!  It&#x27;s perfect with my OPI polish; last much longer than with other topcoats. I didn&#x27;t like the vinylux  color polish; didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Did not last but two days</li>
            <li> Great alternative to gel manicures.  Lasts longer then the regular nail polish!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff..you can use as a top coat with any polish &amp; it gives it lasting power for about a week.</li>
            <li> This works really well! It kept my nails looking good when I was traveling and too busy to have to stop and do touch ups or take off my nail polish.</li>
            <li> This goes with Vinlylux color.  My favorite new nail product.  Will not use shellac again!  This lasts just as long ang comes off easy!</li>
            <li> Great shine and cover.</li>
            <li> Did my nails in the evening, the next day I lunched and shopped, polish needed to be removed by the afternoon, it was positively awful, large chips</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely over the Vinylux base coat and helps keep the polish looking new for up to two weeks.</li>
            <li> This was recommened by a friend who was trying to get her nails back after years of gel nails. It is great I used it with the vinyl lux polish my nails were perfect for 10 days without touch up. I will buy more of this with my next polish order.</li>
            <li> The key to this nail polish is sunlight. It&#x27;s simple. Sunlight makes it stronger. I it also dries relatively fast which is a plus</li>
            <li> Love the vinylux system! This top coat dries in under 10 minutes and my manicure lasts over a week, even working as a nurse. I usually do another layer of top coat after a few days, especially on the tips, so help it last. A great hack from Kate at the small things blog is to use a very light color (I have lavishly loved) as a base, then whatever brand/color you like as usual, followed by the top coat. This combination allows you to use any polish you like for a great looking and lasting manicure!</li>
            <li> I finally used this with a non-Vinylux color.  Stays on better than other top coats, but not as well with a Vinylux color underneath.</li>
            <li> Makes my polish last a week!</li>
            <li> Necessary for all vinylux manicures.</li>
            <li> The best top coat I have ever used.  It stays on at least 10 days with very little chipping.  I use it without a base coat and with whatever polish I have on hand.</li>
            <li> I was rather hesitant to try the CND Vinylux system as I had noticed mixed reviews, but I needed an alternative to gel polish as it was very drying and damaging to my nails. It took a few tries to make it work, but I have grown to love Vinylux.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried various ways of applying this, but thin coats of color (2-3) with 2 coats of this product, the Vinylux topcoat, seems to work best for me. In my experience, base coats cause this to chip prematurely so I would advise against using them, as this must bond directly to the nail for it to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be removed with regular acetone/polish remover, which is another big advantage over gel. I would advise this to anyone looking for a longer lasting polish without the damaging effects of gel polish, and no UV light required!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I haven&#x27;t raved about it enough, probably the greatest thing about this system is how quickly it dries compared to regular nail polish. Gone are the days of sitting in front of a fan for 30 minutes only to still smudge my polish. By the time I am ready to apply the second coat, the first is completely dry. After applying the final top coat, it will be dry and smudge free in under 10 minutes, just as CND claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize, I truly believe in the Vinylux system and would recommend it to anyone. This polish costs the same as most regular polishes but has many added benefits. Definitely worth the try.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Vinylux polish without realizing this is what seals the deal on keeping your polish looking good.  Quickly ordered this as well and am very happy with the results.  My nails look just as good as they did when I put the polish on two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice topcoat....It doesn&#x27;t keep your mani great for two weeks, but maybe for about 5 days or so</li>
            <li> easy application - stays on for a week - may need a middle of the week recoat to keep the shine</li>
            <li> Vinylux nail polish has changed my life!  It is nothing less than magical how the polish/top set without any light or special salon machines.  I got hooked on Vinylux after getting a salon mani/pedi and learning about this amazing product.  I called around locally but it is impossible to purchase anywhere other than on Amazon.  Though it killed me to wait what seemed like an eternity for the polishes to arrive, it was so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I have a two and half year old son (read: bathing him, cleaning up, and wear and tear on my nails), as well as packing my house up to move (read: boxes packing tape getting stuck on nails and pulled off and really, really tough wear on my nails).  My manicure that I gave myself with Vinylux polish and top coat has lasted a full week!!!  There are a few small pieces of polish chipped at the end, but it really is nothing to notice and that is with Rubble (a dark grey) which would be very obvious.  I probably could leave this polish on for another few days if it was necessary.  The thing that makes me want to repaint is the growth from my cuticles!!!&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to have some sort of cuticle gel/moisturizer as that is a frustrating difference of a salon mani vs. doing your nails yourself.  Also, be sure to wait the recommended time between the polish coats and top coat.  It really does make a difference at setting the polish and ultimately making the mani last as long as possible!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering getting this polish: DO IT!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, it is shiny and looks like I&#x27;ve just had a manicure, but it lasts for days!!</li>
            <li> This came quickly and is a great alternative for shellac.</li>
            <li> Keep your supply of top coat in the box to prevent sunlight from hitting it. This is a great product when stored correctly!</li>
            <li> Great! And it works for more than 7 days. And I am a massage therapist, my hands are either in oil or in water all the time. No polish ever stayed. Vinylux is a true surprise for me and from now on, I will only use Vinilux if any. I don&#x27;t have time to do my nails every other day, I am happy that this polish does stay for a week, at least. And even better when the top layer is applied</li>
            <li> This top coat creates a barrier to protect the polish.  For me it keeps vinylux polish from chipping, peeling, or becoming dull.  I take off polish once a week, even though there is no reason to do so except I want to change color.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Works and keeps the nail polish on the 7 days it said it would.</li>
            <li> keeps on shining for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> This works as it claims with used with the Vinylux polishes.  It dries quickly, lasts and looks good for almost the entire week and is easily removed with polish remover.  Made by same company that makes the Shellac manicure products, so I am able to get the same colors that I like  at the Nail Salon.</li>
            <li> It was okay.  It lasts about a week.  Doesn&#x27;t really seem like anything more special than things I&#x27;ve already used for this purpose</li>
            <li> Wonderful and lasts a week!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, helps to keep your polish from chipping. Helps to add another top coat half way through the week. You can use it on top of regular nail polish to help keep it from chipping too, not just vinylux polish.</li>
            <li> You need this top coat for your vinylux nail polish to last that good 7-10 days!</li>
            <li> good stuff but dries up fast before i finished useing the bottle ,</li>
            <li> Works just like a salon gel service.  Easy. Lasts.</li>
            <li> Vinylux is supposed to be one of the top lacquer nail polishes that wear for 7-10 days.  I bought several colors and used them as instructed but it did not last more than 2-3 days before chipping. The top coat did not protect my polish although it did have great shine.  However, great shine and chipped nails is not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Makes my nails look shiny! I use it with regular polish so it doesn&#x27;t last seven days. It may if I used 7 day polish color but I have not tried it.</li>
            <li> I bought a few of the Vinylux nail polishes and top coat after a friend of mine raved about them on Facebook.  Let me tell you, not a fan.  I don&#x27;t know if the polishes I got were old, or what, but they go on kind of thick and goopy, no matter how thin you try to get it, and I am used to doing thin, I also do gel nails on myself.  And then when you put the topcoat on, it looks even goopier and bubbly.  And to top all that off, it only lasts a day on me before chipping.  So sorry I wasted all that money!</li>
            <li> I have written about this product before and am happy to endorse it again.  I have tried many nail polishes only to have them start chipping or wearing  off the very next day.  I continue to be impressed by the vinylux polish.  I have gone up to a week with it and it still looks good.  There are some times that it starts to wear off a little more quickly than others.  I have purchased two colors; one is the dark dahlia and the other is rubble.  For me the rubble held up better than the dark dahlia but it could be that because the rubble is a brown color I did not notice the wearing off as much. It is also easy to quickly apply another coat inbetween polishes to perk it up.  It dries very quickly and blends well.  I continue to purchase it because overall I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I never gave this nail polish a try because I did not like the color.  It was different than it appeared on the website.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a friend. I was skeptical because I have so much oil in my nails that polishes and topcoats peel off within 24 hours of application. The Vinylux polish and topcoat stayed on for over a week with no chips or peeling!!</li>
            <li> This top coat makes my home manicures last twice as long.  The polish rarely ever chips and even though this isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;quick-dry&amp;#34; formula it dries very fast.  I will never use another topcoat.</li>
            <li> Pedicure lasted almost 2 months...one word AMAZING</li>
            <li> It met my expectation.</li>
            <li> I like this top coat the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that it isn&#x27;t shiny which I find kind of strange its matte, so I had to put the top coat on to kind of seal it and then put another brand of top coat on so It was shine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item and I will definitely be ordering these products again.</li>
            <li> Great consistency and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have nails that split and peel, and thus, cannot keep polish on my nails for very long. If I use this top coat, I get a whole week our of the polish. A record for me. Love this top coat.</li>
            <li> The product is great.</li>
            <li> Nothing Special here.  Not long wearing didn&#x27;t add any more days than regular drug store nail polish, chipped  in just a couple days.</li>
            <li> Polish last s a long time...pedicure for over 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I think you can use this over regular nail polish too!  not advertised that way but I swear my polish dried faster and lasted longer!&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;</li>
            <li> This really does make your nail polish last.</li>
            <li> !great Nail polish! Love the color and durablity! Lasts a full week with 2 coats and 2 top coats!&lt;br /&gt;Need 100% acatone to easily remove!</li>
            <li> Much easier than Shellac. Dries quickly! Love it! Will definitely be buying it in more colors! So glad this stuff came out!</li>
            <li> This product is great! It is what extends the polish so is absolutely required. I have also applied it as a top coat to extend a manicure with regular polish and that worked well too! I can no longer wear regular polish and expect it to last so this product line is great when you want a break from Shellac or don&#x27;t want a color on for a long time but want it looking its best!</li>
            <li> put over regular essie and helped my mani last almost a whole week!</li>
            <li> Durable nail polish. Doesn&#x27;t last me a week but I&#x27;m in the Healthcare profession and am constantly using alcohol hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> This get sticky and gummy quickly</li>
            <li> Do not care for this product does not last does not dry fast.</li>
            <li> works good, recommend using on clean, oil free nails. Great seller, great product.</li>
            <li> Last for more than a week!</li>
            <li> I love how quickly the Vinylux products dry!</li>
            <li> Must have top coat for long long long term wear.  I&#x27;ve been in sandals for almost three solid months so my toes have been exposed for all the world to see.  This line of nail color wears like iron.  Never seen anything like it before.  Super high gloss for weeks on end.  It is a bear to remove, but who cares???</li>
            <li> Amazing product with the topcoat and nailpolish I have a manicure at home that actually last for a week! obsessed!!</li>
            <li> The CND vinylux top coat is required in order to help the polish to last for  close to two  weeks.</li>
            <li> like but doesn&#x27;t last a week</li>
            <li> Chipped after 3 d as ys</li>
            <li> The only one I ever buy!</li>
            <li> Keeps my polish from chipping a few days longer than without it. It never lasted a week, however, polish on my toes last at least 3 weeks or more.</li>
            <li> Great when used with Vinylux nail polishes. It dries very quickly and lasts 4-5 days for me.</li>
            <li> Gets globby and impossible to apply after a while. Unfortunately, no thinner available.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. For me my nail polish never makes it through one full day (I have brittle nails). This made my nails last for three days and it lasts on my toenails for two to three weeks. It&#x27;s really great. You just need to be careful of getting it on your skin.</li>
            <li> No problems with delivery. Nice product</li>
            <li> When I first learned about this 7-day polish, it was in the salon where I tried it instead of regular polish for a manicure. I loved the shellac-style durability with the ease of removal like regular polish. My nails are very thin and flexible so the shellac was always good until it came to the torturous removal process!&lt;br /&gt;This Vinylux Polish is easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t stink quite as much as the regular stuff. It protects, but the shine doesn&#x27;t seem to last quite as long as the full-on shellac. But for the money and hassle-free removal, it&#x27;s really worth it! I get longer-lasting results when a pro gives my mani, but this lasts much longer than a regular at-home job.</li>
            <li> Chipped &amp; peeled in 2 days.Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This did not last a week and after a day it chipped.  I have been using Sally Hansen product - in the black bottle also - and the Sally Hansen items says that it lasts 2 weeks which is ridiculous.  But Sally Hansen&#x27;s does last one week - longer than this.  BUT, I think that if you&#x27;ve not used any of these types of topcoats, you may be happy with this.</li>
            <li> My manicurist recommended this with the polish.  Effective combination.  Use both.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, but sometimes if I put too much on it leaves little bubbles which I don&#x27;t like. Doesn&#x27;t last for 7 days either. It&#x27;s good but I&#x27;m not buying again.</li>
            <li> I really like this top coat. My hands are constantly in water and this polish stayed on for one week. I had very little chipping I would use it again.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this top coat and base coat because my hair stylist recommended it to me &amp; said that her polish stays on her fingernails for about 2 weeks &amp; her toe nail polish stays on for a month. But my peeled off by the end 4 days. Which is longer than without it but i was hoping for a least a full week without any chipping or peeling.</li>
            <li> Good product, same as described. The seller is great,  got some issues with delivery but fixed everything very fast.</li>
            <li> Best topcoat ever!  It really protects soft nails</li>
            <li> Great product, stays on my toes for weeks and I also use it over regular nail polish</li>
            <li> I had a french manicure at a Ritz Carlton in FL using all the Vinylux products. Being on the beach, swimming/sunscreen &amp; sand the manicure literally lasted all week, which prompted me to buy the very same products as soon as I got home. Disappointment! I don&#x27;t know what is different, but w/ less wear &amp; tear on my nails being home, I&#x27;m lucky if I can get 2-3 days before it chips. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Loving the CND VYNYLUX Top Coat, covers well and holds up great.</li>
            <li> This top-coat is a very nice product. Not sure if it can be used with other brands, but I will try it.</li>
            <li> this is what makes the weekly polish work, so make sure to buy it when you buy the polish, it truly works for a week.</li>
            <li> Lasted 5 days no longer no shorter. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and both times it chipped on the 5th day which is great definitely will be repurchasing. Fast drying as well</li>
            <li> Seams to stay sticky.  Why am I not surprised!</li>
            <li> it really last loooonger!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product. This plus CND vinyl Polish did not last 3 days.</li>
            <li> I love the way it stays on for almost 2 full weeks, I wish this top coat was a bit easier to put on though. I&#x27;m not great at it.</li>
            <li> This is a great top coat.  My nails are gleaming and my manicure lasts for over a week.</li>
            <li> I love the lacquers but for some reason this discolors to an awful yellowy white straight away.</li>
            <li> This definitely helps your nail polish stay on for a few days longer - but I usually have a few chips in my nails by the end of the week. It&#x27;s worth getting, but its not the same as a gel manicure.</li>
            <li> This dries so quickly and you don&#x27;t have to worry about smudging your nails.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. I bought this based on Consumer Reports rating as one of the best.  I believe CND was ranked in the top 3.  On me, it had virtually no staying power.  I used it with CND&#x27;s own nail color, and everything started to peel in just a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did much better with Sally Hanson Nail Shine Miracle Top Coat, which has become virtually impossible to find in stores. Lately I&#x27;ve been able to get it only through Amazon.  In the past I&#x27;d spent as much as $20 a bottle for nail color, thinking the more expensive would last longer.  Come to find out Sally Hanson ($2 to $6) and Sinful Colors ($2, also recommended by Consumer Reports) outlasts them all: 7-10 days and beyond.  FYI:  I wear only sheer, shimmery colors, which I&#x27;ve been told last longer anyway. I don&#x27;t know how long either of these brands last with regular glossy or matte colors.</li>
            <li> Great just as expected!!</li>
            <li> I painted my nails using the svelte suede. Love the color, very light camel. Two coats are great. So far it does not last for 7 days. I&#x27;m getting 3-4 days and putting another coat of polish on. I am ruff on my nails and they are in a lot of water. So considering that I am happy it last 3-4 days and another coat to last the week. I will later try another color.</li>
            <li> Best top coat EVER.  Super glossy, super thick, but doesn&#x27;t bubble.  Goes on thick and glossy and dries in less than 10 minutes.  I put it on over 3 thick coats of Vinylux and it lasted almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Keeps the vnylux polish looking great and elimnates expensive manicures.  I will continue to buy these Vinylux products.  Love them!</li>
            <li> the polish itself went on with a lot of streaks, &amp; the top coat didn&#x27;t fix it.&lt;br /&gt;disappointed in the entire product line.</li>
            <li> Works with the Weekly Polish to achieve a long-lasting manicure. Finally, a manicure that lasts a week! My nails look great.</li>
            <li> Not only does my polish only last 2 days before it chips, it takes forever for it to dry. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how well this line of nail polish works! One time I didn&#x27;t have time to do the top coat, and there was a huge difference. The system together works so well, and this is a crucial part of it!</li>
            <li> This top coat gives the polish the shine that stays for a week and helps keep it on fabulous. Product Bravo</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTE CRAP!!!!&lt;br /&gt;NO shine/worthless!!!!!!!!  Manufacturer should be ashamed to sell this JUNK!!</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST and only top coat that actually lives up to its promise. It will stay on for a week with no chipping even on bright colors, like red and black, with no re-application. I did not think that was possible, but this stuff really works. It is fast drying and the shine stays on the whole time. I will never buy any other top coat, but this one.</li>
            <li> I like this brand, stays a bit longer than regular polish.</li>
            <li> Said it before, will say it again... great finish, lasts 7 days (more on your toes)... definitely a great investment!</li>
            <li> Shines and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> My nails are thin and weak. Using this topcoat over my regular base and color makes my nails feel strong. The strength increases over time from exposure to natural light. I add a second coat during the week. Vinylux dries quickly and has a good shine.</li>
            <li> Keeps my nails strong and the polish lasts for over a week</li>
            <li> This product line is fantastic...dries super fast ....is very durable...and high gloss</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever!  I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> good product - I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I did my nails on Monday night and by Tuesday afternoon, they were already chipped... I also have 5 kids, 2 of which are toddlers, so I wash my hands a millions times a day. I didn&#x27;t have my hopes set too high so I&#x27;m not terribly disappointed, but I was kind of hoping I could have found something that worked. Oh well! Guess it works for some people, just not for me.</li>
            <li> one of the best topcoats out there</li>
            <li> Looked good for less than one day before polish and top coat started to peel off from the edge of my nail.</li>
            <li> This dries quickly but still chips in a couple of days not the week that is advertised.  I will continue to get Shellac manicures</li>
            <li> This top coat never disappoints. I even use it with my other brands of nail polish to make them last longer. Goes on easy and dries super fast as well.</li>
            <li> This product works SO well. As long as you use the Scrub Fresh and the top coat, per the directions, this polish will last at least a week with NO chipping!</li>
            <li> This goes with any polish. So easy to use and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I used this too can&#x27;t with regular nail polish and they work really good. I&#x27;m trying to use in special clients who always are dealing with water. This product really long last as it says. I try this on myself and last for 6 days( Im a manicurist and stay-mom of 3yrs old) I love it. I definally buy more.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. I followed the directions and it chipped the next day. What a bummer!</li>
            <li> Best top coat , I apply several times over the two week period&lt;br /&gt;It dries really fast&lt;br /&gt;I have always had chipping problems with other polishes  and this seems to prevent that</li>
            <li> Works well but doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as they advertise.  It does however last longer than normal polish so it&#x27;s worth the $ and dries quickly!  Stays super shiny throughout &amp; you can remove yourself instead of having to go back to a salon.</li>
            <li> fantastic top coat, just dries too fast in the bottle</li>
            <li> Did not produce a manicure that lasted longer than regular nail polish and topcoat.</li>
            <li> This is what makes the lacquer last the full week...don&#x27;t skip this step.  It is definitely worth the extra effort</li>
            <li> I use this topcoat even when I am not using the CND polish.  It makes your nails shiny and it keeps the polish on a long time (especially when I travel I use it!).</li>
            <li> The polish said it was the equivalent of a gel manicure in staying power and gloss. No on bot claims. It started chipping at the tips after about 4 days and was very dull from the start. A waste of money</li>
            <li> Yes, this is easier to get on and off, but if I have to re-do the manicure every couple of days because of the edges wearing or chipping, it&#x27;s not worth it. I&#x27;d rather deal with the gel polish and at least know that when I&#x27;m done I&#x27;m done for 2 weeks or more.</li>
            <li> I use this every Sunday night as my topcoat on my natural nails that are very thin.  I use a base coat, two coats of color and this topcoat.  It&#x27;s the best! My nails will only get little dings and chips and still look pretty darn good through Friday! Note: I never wash dishes without gloves.</li>
            <li> I used thus according to instructions and the Polish came right off. My regular polish with vase and top coat stays on longer.</li>
            <li> Works great with other polishes, too. Love the dry time and the resilience.</li>
            <li> Special top coat used with Vinylux polish. One coat of polish and one coat of top coat and you Are good to go. Most polishes only last 2 days for me before they start chipping - this stuff is great</li>
            <li> Have only used it once, but only made it one day with the Vinylux Rouge Red and this as a topcoat before it chipped.</li>
            <li> I like the Vinylux nail polish and this is a necessary part of the process.  I typically get about 10 days out of my polish which is much better than traditional nail polish.</li>
            <li> started peeling/chipping off my nails after four days. the super quick drying time is great, though, and does create a beautiful shine .</li>
            <li> Love, love this polish. Goes on easily, dries quickly, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this, it went on easily and dried quickly. First time trying it at home my polish lasted a full week before chipping.</li>
            <li> delivered on time was what I wanted</li>
            <li> a must have for the vinylux color nail polish.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I use it every week for my manicure and the nail color lasts all week long.</li>
            <li> Great to use if you use vinylux nail polish.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  I even put it over my 2 week old gel nails to help them last a few day more.</li>
            <li> Nice. Top coat  dried really fast just wish it would of kept color sealed for longer.  I will put two coats on next time.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat and it is totally necessary to use with the weekly polish.  Make sure you paint the tips of your fingers too for maximum success!</li>
            <li> Love this! My manicure lasted over a week and I did a lot of dishes! Finally had to remove my polish when I chipped  a nail trying to pull a stuck drawer out of a table!</li>
            <li> I do my own nails, I have for years, so naturally I could open a mini salon in my house with the amount of nail polish I own. I wanted to do a gel for vacation but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend all that money at a salon (especially since I never think they do a better job than me and I have hundreds of colors here.) After 2 days of researching, I settled on this topcoat. My two requirements were it had to last and it had to work with regular polish. I&#x27;m putting it to the test. It&#x27;s been one day, I will update in a week with new results  Base coat: Nailtiques (formula 2) Polish: Essie pret-a-surfer Topcoat: Vinylux  The Essie applies beautifully with one coat however while applying the topcoat, the polish became streaky so a second coat was added and the topcoat went on without a hitch thereafter. It took a while to dry completely (over an hour) and even then I didn&#x27;t know if it would last through the night because it still felt a little off. My first time using this product so I didn&#x27;t know if that was normal or not, but I woke up without any blanket creases and it feels like a regular polish now. My nails overall feel very strong as if I had wraps on. I have high hopes right now, but lets see if it can withstand the mom of two preschoolers life I live.  *****Update: it&#x27;s been 48 hours; a trip to the mall, a trip to the grocery store, 8 loads of laundry, 3 sinks full of dishes, broke down about about a dozen boxes for the recycling, half a dozen showers (twins included) and general household cleaning/cooking and at the end of the weekend 1 nail chipped within 24 hours and 2 after 48....the rest are dulled with scratches. I&#x27;ll still use it only because it&#x27;s here. Maybe I&#x27;ll pair it with the vinylux color polish and see how that goes in the future, but all hope is gone. My regular mani&#x27;s have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> So far this top coat along with the nail polish has been on for three days and no chipping yet. It does not have the look of gel polish as it is not as shinning and does not cover nail flaws</li>
            <li> works perfectly- lasts over a week-great product!</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have ever used. Polish stays on twice as long. I will never use any other top coat again</li>
            <li> Very good top coat for other nail brand polishes as well.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this top coat!  It dries crazy fast and even with my polish under it being a little tacky.  It shiny and tough.  It will be my go to for now on!!</li>
            <li> This top coat helps seal the long-lasting Vinylux colors. Less harmful than gel polishes, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> this nail polish was not thick, and it chips off fast. I have had to put on many coats and it still chips off the next day.</li>
            <li> This top coat works together with the vinylux polish to shine and dry immediately and last a whole week easily!</li>
            <li> This is a great top coat polish. It is very glossy and it dries really fast. I have never been much for using a top coat because they were always so thick and gummy.  However, the Vinylux polishes call for it and really does work better and lasts longer with it.  I am very happy with this top coat.  I mainly use it when doing my own pedicures.  It helps the color lasts for 2-3 weeks and helps keep it from chipping.  After placing my order, it took about 1 week to arrive.  I am very pleased with this seller and would purchase from them again. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Dries very quickly to a beautiful shine that lasts and protects.  Necessary to use this or other good topcoat in order for your polish to last a week as promised.</li>
            <li> I use it with all of my brand nail polishes and it works like magic.  It works well with Butter and Opi but of course the CND nail colors do last the longest when they are used with the top coat.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase this item again and recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this item again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This product did not work well; It was actually a bit dull. Use Seche Vite topcoat instead for a long lasting shine.</li>
            <li> Will definitely recommend this product! Works great with any nail polish, especially with quick-dry ones. Makes home manicure/pedicure so much easier and without annoying scratch marks on the freshly done nails!!!</li>
            <li> I love this top coat. It works wonderfully. I&#x27;ve had my polish on for 6 days now and am just starting to see slight wear on the tips. I&#x27;ve used the product with both vinylux color and other nail polish. It works great with both. I do find that I need a sticky base coat, regardless. It lasts without the base coat for about 3 days before you see wear,but even then it is unnoticable. But if you apply a sticky base it last beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been as happy with the VInylux color. Man of them are very streaky and require several coats (particularly bicycle yellow). But this top coat is amazing</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply. It is easy to remove. It stays on your nails much longer than regular nail polish. It&#x27;s a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with the Vinylux nail polish for a manicure that lasts a week or longer!  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Best topcoat I have ever used. Lasts 7 days which for me is great. I work in a hospital and am constantly washing my hands/ using hand sanitizer. I clean &amp; wash dishes without gloves. It looks like a gel and shine lasts esp if you use cuticle oil. My only complaint is that nail color can fade towards end of wear.</li>
            <li> My favorite top coat thus far! Keeps my nail polish nice, shiny and minimal chipping/fading by the end of the week. Not hard to remove at all. No soak needed. Definitely will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is a top coat that really works!</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this product has received one star reviews.  Perhaps the people in question did not use it correctly.  Anyway, I was a little ambivalent when I purchased this product and the nail polish &amp;#34;Negligee&amp;#34;, because of said reviews.  However, I read other tips online and I am eager to get away from twice weekly shellac manicures because it&#x27;s expensive and dries out my nails.  I gave myself a regular manicure and then wiped my nails with rubbing alcohol.  Perhaps this is the critical step the one star reviewers missed.  I put on three coats, letting each dry in between coats for eight minutes, and then applied the top coat.  I did not think it went on streaky at all, and it was pretty easy to apply.  I applied my polish on Sunday afternoon, and it lasted the entire week without any chips or tip wear.  I wash my hands a lot and handwash my dishes, so I was pretty amazed.  I think I&#x27;ve found my shellac substitute.</li>
            <li> the necessary step 2 in the vinylux polish application.  beautiful top coat, fast trying to a hard finish - no more smudges, indentations, etc.  Hooray!</li>
            <li> After using Vinylux you will toss out everything else.&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing. AND you use your regular nail polish remover!</li>
            <li> You need to for the nail polish colors to last 7 days. Only works with correct polish.&lt;br /&gt; Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders at first, by it seems to dry out soon. So now I have to buy a brand new one for all the CND nail polish I have.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I did two coats of the Vinylux nail pollish and then put this on top.  It has been over a week now and the polish has not chipped or worn off.</li>
            <li> With the polish works as described.  Great answer to avoid gel polish which is so hard on the nails.</li>
            <li> Came well packaged and undamaged.  Manicure with this product  using  CND Vinylux polish does dry in about 8 minutes and lasts for at least a week. Takes a little time and effort but is removed without soaking and without damage to nails.</li>
            <li> It works so well! My grandmother had it and it works really well! Awesome!</li>
            <li> Nice product. Great transaction.</li>
            <li> Drys in 10-15 minutes. But still chips in 2 days</li>
            <li> I was first offered to try this product at my nail salon and although my nails didn&#x27;t chip for a record breaking three days I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it at that point.  I was hoping that it would keep my nails chip free for at least 5-7 days and now I still use it and my nails on chipping on the 1st or 2nd day. - not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this top coat! Dries great! Lasts just about a week. Half way threw the bottle it gets tacky so I just add a few drops of nail polish remover and it works great! I use this when I need to cover nail jewels and make the surface smooth!</li>
            <li> Love this product, but the seller sold me one that was old and too thick to apply because it had dried out. Disappointing, really.</li>
            <li> Vinylux is amazing !  I am a a busy nurse with a 6month old baby which means my nails&amp; polish take a beating.  The first time I used I was skeptical but pleasantly surprised.  Regular (even OPI and the like) nail polish for me lasts a MAX of 3 days before looking disgusting.  Vinylux lasts easily 3 weeks with only tip wear apparent - no chips (except where I had chipped the nail itself.).  I didn&#x27;t do anything fancy to harden the topcoat. (I had heard of people sticking their hands next to light bulbs and inside lamps). It comes off with regular acetone polish remover.  Do not use non-acetone, it will take forever!  The shine of the top coat dulls after a week or so but the strength is still there.  (Again, still a huge improvement over reg polish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this over shellac because it doesn&#x27;t damage your nails and is easy to apply &amp;remove yourself at home.  Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Awful! Smudges and thick! Wish I could return. Amazon does not authrorize returns for liwquid so beware when you buy polish on sight.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t quite help the polish last a full week, but it helps the color to last longer than traditional nail polish. I applied an extra coat on day 3. If you have strong nails, your color might last longer. My nails are weak and therefore they bend a lot. I start to get cracks or chips in the places where my nails bend most. I kept my nails shorter this time and the color lasted longer. Either way, I prefer this brand over any other polish and top coat. UPDATE: my mother has always had strong nails. She is on day 9 with the polish and top coat . . . her nails look great! only one small barely noticeable chip. I&#x27;m impressed! So it seems that the better the nails, the better the product will work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product. I don&#x27;t use it with other Vinylyx products so I might have to do that before making an accurate review. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. Long lasting. Smoothes away the imperfection and helps you hold on to your mani for a long time. I washed dishes, scrubbed the tub and it srill looks fabulous. I will never do the no chip again after this.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions and chipped after 3-4 days. Bummer.</li>
            <li> Very good product, impressive for home use.</li>
            <li> it is just okay. Last 1 week if on the toes but not on the hands. drys up at about slightly less than quarter of the bottle-used by wife</li>
            <li> Bought this to apply over CND&#x27;s gel polish. I don&#x27;t own a UV light yet but tried both anyway. Wore this top coat with CNDs gel polish as a regular polish. It stayed on longer than any other regular polish I own. Can&#x27;t say how well it works with a UV light.</li>
            <li> I used this as directed with their polish and it has stayed on for days with no chips or problems, love it!</li>
            <li> Really, really keeps its promises.  This is my second order, and I am very hard on my nails and rarely remember to wear gloves.  An additional benefit is that my nails don&#x27;t seem to break as often.  I&#x27;ve also used the product and polish for a pedicure, and it actually lasts, without chipping, until my nails need to be cut and have grown out enough that there is a space at the nail bed.</li>
            <li> I use it on regular nail polish and it is very hard, I usually get about 4 days before it&#x27;s starts to go at the end of the nail.  It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and I love this top coat.</li>
            <li> This top coat is great.  You nails are completely dry in 10 - 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> This top coat does not last me a week. It is better than others I&#x27;ve tried, but I have to repair chips after a day or two. It wlll last a week with a few touchups every other day or so.</li>
            <li> Does not last a full week</li>
            <li> Love this product and will buy again</li>
            <li> My daughters love this product and are amazed at how well it works to keep their manis intact</li>
            <li> great product will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish brand but Note: it does get sticky and goopy after opening it.</li>
            <li> I used to be an avid Gel Polish Gal - but have switched to Vinylux.&lt;br /&gt;I will never go back! I promise- If you use as directed - it can last almost 3 weeks with minimal chip/wear and tear.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!</li>
            <li> You really need to use it with vinylux together. Because if you just use a nail polisher it will not last for so long as with this top coat! It is good for up to week for nails and as min 3-4 weeks for toes)</li>
            <li> This is really shiny  and looks great when you first put it on; however, it tends to peel off really easy.</li>
            <li> its the only nail enamel that last in my hands without the roughness to the nails of shelac</li>
            <li> A great top coat really makes the polish last</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat ever. It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> Love it. I can count on this.</li>
            <li> Nice. Regular &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34;  polish or top coat,is normally chipped within a day. I get a few to several from this. Awesome.</li>
            <li> I use this top coat with Essie base coat and polishes or OPI polishes and it&#x27;s amazing! I will buy it again and again. For those that say their polish chips after a few days it&#x27;s likely because your coats weren&#x27;t dry before you applied this but that&#x27;s my guess. On my toes it lasts a solid two weeks and a good 10 days on my nails. It creates a shiny finish and hides any polish imperfections. Note that when applying, you need a quick hand. It dries very quickly. All in all, you need this product in your life!</li>
            <li> Definitely purchase this if you are getting the vinylux nail polish.  They work hand in hand.  Love it!</li>
            <li> MY FAV TOPCOAT&lt;br /&gt;I love this topcoat. My manicures last a full week when I use this as a top coat. You can use it with any polish. Definitely my go to!!</li>
            <li> Best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. I put it over any nail polish, not specifically CND. It works better with their products, but I still get around 5 chip free days--so much better than any other top coat I&#x27;ve tried. Would buy and recommend over and over again.</li>
            <li> Polish peeled off in one day</li>
            <li> Let nail polish dry completely before applying a thin layer.</li>
            <li> excellent.  the polish dries so fast.  Even when using other brands this top coat cuts drying time way down and the polish is good for a week untouched 10-14 days if you put the top coat on every other day.  Great product</li>
            <li> The entire line of WEEKLY products does not work for me. Application and removal is easy enough, but it does not stay on my nails even 3 days, let alone 7.  I know that some people like it better than I do.</li>
            <li> Lasts longer than other top coats I have tried, but doesn&#x27;t last a week on me.</li>
            <li> WORKED GREAT FOR ABOUT 1 MONTH.  STILL OVER 1/2 BOTTLE LEFT AND ALL THE POLISH DOES NOW IS PEEL AWAY.  I BOUGHT THIS POLISH BECAUSE OF IT&#x27;S GREAT REVIEWS.  PERHAPS I GOT A BOTTLE THAT WAS OLDER SINCE IT WAS HEAVY/THICK WHEN APPLIED.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have it put on my nails every week when I go to the nail salon.  It makes my manicure last and my nails look pretty good when it&#x27;s time to get my nails done again!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help polish last any longer.</li>
            <li> I use it long time and never see smth better.</li>
