            <li>nails look healthier, become stronger and smoother, and just feel better.</li>

            <li>The oil penetrates into the most lifeless of nail.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use it any more.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I really love using this after I take off nail polish</li>
            <li>stuff seems to work insofar as making the nails appear more uniform.</li>

            <li>I really love it.</li>

            <li>I will use it up but will not purchase more.</li>
            <li>I love this cuticle oil.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many cuticle/nail creams (I literally pick my cuticles to shreds ... always have, always will.</li>
            <li>This oil makes my cuticles and fingers so velvety smooth and amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got this oil.</li>
            <li>I am most satisfied.  </li>
            <li>and I am so pleased with what seemed like overnight results, in reality more like 5-7 days.</li>
            <li>Much better than all the others I have tried and love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I have problem nails, and have tried many products.  </li>
            <li>Most just leave oil on your nails for hours and never &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The girl that does my manicure commented on how much better my cuticles and nails looked.</li>
            <li>I think it helps (and the price here is better than in stores)</li>
            <li>but I think my sally hansen cuticle oil is much more nourishing and portable.</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>MY NAILS LOOK HEALTHY.</li>
            <li>It worked to make the nail healthy again.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Be sure to buff them with a 280 buffer after you use this.</li>
            <li>I love the product itself.</li>
            <li>and it is sure working.  </li>
            <li>So glad to find something to solve my cuticle problem.  </li>
            <li>They have more life in them.</li>
            <li>I love ordering through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>I love OPI and their products.  </li>
            <li>I will be using a lot more of this.</li>
            <li>to my surprise I have this to be yet another winning product from OPI.</li>
            <li>What more can a girl as for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would buy again, just wish it had more staying power.</li>

            <li>love that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soooo glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, I love this stuff</li>
            <li>Since my cuticles look so much better</li>
            <li>I will keep this in my nail kit hopefully this may be a preventive to the jagged cuticle conundrum :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone having trouble with their hands the way I was, it works great! :D</li>
            <li>And I am positively reinforced by the pleasant smell, I just want to keep putting it on :)</li>
            <li>Does a great job of replenishing moisture into skin, particularly around cuticles.  </li>
            <li>I use my hands a lot - baking and cooking - and my cuticles are often dry, so this product is perfect for me and works much better for me than Sally Hansen has.</li>
            <li>All the different oils and what-not have a very pleasant scent to them.</li>
            <li>I normally use another brand of cuticle oil, but I thought I&#x27;d give this a try because OPI has great products.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, has a nice wide brush for application, and once it&#x27;s all massaged in, my nails and cuticles look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li>the oil is excellent have this product for a long time</li>
            <li>The scent is great and the opi standard brush size make it amazing to apply.</li>
            <li>It is especially wonderful for nails and cuticle in the dry winter months</li>
            <li>It keeps my cuticles healthy, supple, and strong.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product for dry and cracked cuticles.  </li>
            <li>and this is the best deal I&#x27;ve found on Amazon, and it&#x27;s really cheap compared to the tiny tubes of Avoplex that they sell at Ulta.</li>
            <li>Takes care of all cuticles (hands and feet) keeps them hydrated and clean looking!</li>
            <li>WOW Is all I have to say, What a great product.</li>
            <li>So far this works great.  </li>
            <li>The smell is incredible and it is simple to apply (uses a dropper).</li>
            <li>Working great so far.</li>
            <li>Love the light scent also.</li>
            <li>My cuticles and nails have never looked this good thanks to OPI.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I find this easy to use&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;for make strong nails growing and work prefect</li>
            <li>I was so dissapointed with this -- I have allergies to scents and did not know how strong an aroma this had.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also very pleased on how fast it was shipped and delivered to my house.</li>
            <li>First of all I have to say about the smell!its amazing  .</li>
            <li>My nails are getting healthier (no longer as brittle or &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34;) and they are growing nicely.</li>
            <li>i really liked this product even using it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I think the oil just affects the refractive index of the nail material, but, frankly, at this point I&#x27;m fine with that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My nails are finally strong enough to grow out to an attractive length.</li>
            <li>and so are my hands, after using about twice a day, I can see a difference - although it isn&#x27;t a huge difference, but I will keep using.</li>
            <li>While the actual bottle didn&#x27;t look like the picture, it is still a great produce and helps my cuticles heal.  </li>
            <li>I was using this product a few times a week after I got it, and have been very impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>Works great for nails and definitely seems to help.</li>
            <li>It smells great, but I only use it before I do the nail polish.</li>
            <li>The coolest thing is it doesn&#x27;t take much time or effort to keep my nails looking really nice.</li>
            <li>Nice smelling cuticle oil that absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>It works and makes cuticles smooth.</li>
            <li>finally remembered what I used to use; and it&#x27;s great...  </li>
            <li>Overall it is good, but I think my sally hansen one is better.</li>
            <li>Even better, the price was right with this seller.</li>
            <li>I doubt i will reorder since there are so many other great oils that are cheaper</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very useful and lovely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t had my nails NOT done since christmas time (when i got my UV system) and my nails are still super strong</li>
            <li>My new favorite cuticle oil!</li>
            <li>to grow strong and more fast</li>
            <li>I would suggest this to anyone who wants to keep their cuticles strong and smooth!</li>
            <li>A lot of people rave about cuticle oil pens because they&#x27;re so much easier to apply, but I honestly feel like this brush is much easier and much more generous with the oil.</li>
            <li>The scent is unique</li>
            <li>I opted for this full bottle size as it&#x27;s easy to apply like polish, just a quick dab on each finger cuticle and rub it in.  </li>
            <li>This is great for repairing dry nails &amp; cuticles.</li>
            <li>This product is great for my dry cuticles.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell FABULOUS, but the smell dissipates quickly.    </li>
            <li>It has a great scent and seems to add moisture to my dry cuticles.</li>
            <li>This works far better than most nail oils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d probably work better if I used it more consistenly, but I like it so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a couple of people complain about the smell, but I actually think it&#x27;s somewhat pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Just got this stuff today, so while I suppose the long-term effects are still to be determined, so far I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>The reviews are right, it smells great, but seems to disappear the second you wash your hands.</li>
            <li>Almost 20$ at salons, and pretty much worth it!!</li>
            <li>great help for my very dry nails. . .</li>
            <li>It smells great and if u have wet polish</li>
            <li>how great it heals my rough cuticles.</li>
            <li>but wow, Opi Avoplex is amazing stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems to last a good while, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After your cuticles start looking healthier, you only need to use this product about once a week to maintain good looking nails.</li>
            <li>Smells good enough, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my nailbeds.</li>
            <li>Excellent without being too greasy and thick that it doesn&#x27;t soak in.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe the sickeningly sweet smell of it.  </li>
            <li>This oil makes the cuticle feel so soft and replenishes nicely.  </li>
            <li>works great, packaged shipped very carefully.</li>
            <li>This is seriously some of the best cuticle oil I have used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine when you first put it on and massage it around</li>
            <li>i use this after i take off my old shellac polish - it works great to bring my nails &amp; cuticles back to their original look.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft the cuticles are now</li>
            <li>Simple to use and effective.  </li>
            <li>An excellent help for your brittle, broken, and just won&#x27;t grow nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>worth to recommend it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth every</li>
            <li>but I think it will be well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Works well to keep the polish looking fresh and chip-free.</li>
            <li>The only way I can have any kind of nails without breakage  - use nightly before bed.</li>
            <li>worth the price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and it totally makes my nails grown when they won&#x27;t on their own.  </li>
            <li>My cuticles were pushed back nice and neat and it made painting my nails 10 times easier.</li>
            <li>so it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>and right before I go to bed at night.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see it on Amazon right now to include a product link, but here&#x27;s the product information from Aveda:  </li>
            <li>From now on I&#x27;m going to make sure I put a little bit of this stuff on each finger every day to keep all of them healthy.</li>
            <li>and I love how it comes with a little pamphlet to read more about the product and ways on using</li>
            <li>I saw a dermatologist about the issue and he suggested biotin supplements as being the only real fix, but added that even biotin taken as directed is kind of hit or miss.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money and will definitely purchase again, love it</li>
            <li>I only recently started getting into nail care and manicures, but this produce is great.</li>
            <li>Helps it dry more quickly.</li>
            <li>After reading several reviews on this I decided to give it a shot and am abosultey glad I did.</li>
            <li>I first seen this product on NailPro.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay, but doesn&#x27;t seem to make a lasting difference for me</li>
            <li>It does what it says it does, and the results are pretty immediate.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The oil itself works pretty well.</li>
            <li>totally fall in love</li>
            <li>My nails are really growing!</li>
            <li>There are hand lotions out there which last better than this oil.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I have tried this product.  </li>
            <li>Has prevented many problems and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work when I bought it, but after using it I definitely notice a difference.</li>
            <li>IT LEFT MY CUTICLES FEELING MOISTURIZED AND LOOKING HEALTHY.</li>
            <li>Bought this to add to my manicure regimen as the last step after the top coat.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>and I will order more in the future!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day and will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>recommend it to first users</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to buying more products in the future with this seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Do exactly as the directions say (apply it twice a day&amp; massage it in).</li>
            <li>I guess that I will be buying more of this in the future!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really moisturizes!</li>
            <li>I use this daily for my cuticles and I love it.</li>
            <li>and this was my first time purchasing it,</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been getting into nail art though and subsequently have been trying to take better care of my nails, I decided to purchase this and give it a shot.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>Secondly it does what it claims for sure.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and great smell but not sure it has made any difference in my nails or cuticules, they all lookk same an dhas been using it for over 1 week twice a day</li>
            <li>Living on a fixed income, I need to try to keep my nails as nice as I can between necessary manicures.  </li>
            <li>which don&#x27;t really seem any different to me than nail polish), but they&#x27;re either ineffective or just make the lines more</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I was going to like this product more than the Essie apricot oil (which I absolutely find it particularly a basic on my nail care routine).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply every day, with a wide brush and all.</li>
            <li>The only com I have to it is that it wipes off pretty easy.</li>
            <li>It really helps and I also really like the smell of it!</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and deeply into my skin, and the skin around my nails has truly never been healthier.  </li>
            <li>My nails were brittle and would break and peel constantly, and I was becoming very discouraged.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely dry cuticles, more so than any guy I&#x27;ve ever known.  </li>
            <li>I especially like its smell, which is sweet and fresh.</li>
            <li>This nail replenishing oil smell so good and long lasting</li>
            <li>Of course it washes off (as several reviewers have commented), but re-applications are fast and easy.</li>
            <li>This container was actually leaking when it arrived, but the product works just fine.</li>
            <li>I would very  highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>i use it daily, already noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>and I can garden, and cook, and not worry so much about my cuticles and nails.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you have this problem!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very that I purchased this.  </li>
            <li>And it really does work:</li>
            <li>It helped my nails so much.</li>
            <li>This really lets it absorb into the skin instead of just coming off on your fingertips while massaging.  </li>
            <li>this will just be much easier for me to use.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really know what to do about it.</li>
            <li>After using the nail polish remover, it can moisturize my nails gently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i havent seen much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I like that the oil doesn&#x27;t have a really overpowering smell</li>
            <li>but when I do, it REALLY helps.</li>
            <li>my cuticles are softer and my nails feel much healthier and stronger.</li>
            <li>I really like this product for both my cuticles and nails.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it provides your nails with the much needed oil that they need.</li>
            <li>For a while, I stopped really trying to take care of my nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li>The instructions don&#x27;t really tell you how to use it</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>and it really makes my nails look nicer.</li>
            <li>OPI products are very dependable.  </li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t used it much</li>
            <li>I stuck with it for a while and really gave the oil a chance, but it just did nothing for</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really justify getting manicures, so I came to Amazon to find a solution.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my cuticles, they are much softer and moist.</li>
            <li>$2 shipping was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend and I will keep using it!</li>
            <li>there isn&#x27;t really a smell to it to me and it does wonders for my nails.  </li>
            <li>should have bought the real solar oil.</li>
            <li>This cuticle oil really helped me to replenish try nails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Actual toenails look healthier, whiter and so much healthier.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy in your shoes.&lt;br /&gt;Great smell, but very light.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s a bit pricey to me, it really does work so well</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s completely and totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I recently started doing my nails again and needed something to help make them look more professional.</li>
            <li>Most recently, this happened on my right middle finger and it was bothering me a lot.</li>
            <li>I would not purchase it again, as it is nothing special, and due to the sweet smell.  </li>
            <li>If you can apply nail polish sloppily, you can figure this out, lol.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous creams and other oils, and nothing has delivered a result as good as this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This has really saved my cuticles, I am not big fan of manicures, I just like my nails to look clean and well groomed with no drying or cracking around the nail bed.</li>
            <li>cuticles are normal again!</li>
            <li>Like all other OPI products, it&#x27;s top notch</li>
            <li>Anyway, the oil is okay other than that.  </li>
            <li>I normally love your nail care products and am happy you have embraced new formulations in the polish leaving out some of the bad stuff...  </li>
            <li>Not only that, nails are much healthier and cracks and dryness are quickly disappearing as is discolouration.  </li>
            <li>My cuticles look amazing after a few days and I have not had them clipped ever since!</li>
            <li>It moisturizes and replenishes your nailbed and your cuticles, and that&#x27;s very important, especially if you&#x27;re constantly changing nail polishes, like me.</li>
            <li>amazon carries an amazing selection of various OPI products sold by other vendors who are very reliable.</li>
            <li>however i find that the oil dries off relatively quickly which is why i have to re-apply several times a day when i feel my cuticles are dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i dont see any reason why this particular product needs to be purchased.</li>
            <li>I am not convinced that it works for the long-term (e.g., I put on at night and hope for moisturized cuticles in the a.m.), but the quick fix to make my fingernails look presentable is enough to please me!</li>
            <li>Not so lucky still  having the same problem..</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve found a decent cuticle oil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seriously never seen my cuticles looking so</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it &amp; will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and really helps with those dry cuticles in the winter.</li>
            <li>Yeah... I got this inside an empty box of some nail cream with the words FREE OPI AVOPLEX OIL on it.</li>
            <li>It is a bit expensive, but the product is great.</li>
            <li>gets rid of rough hang nails and makes your nails look fabulous</li>
            <li>i clean my cuticles and painted my nails, also it makes my nail polish dry faster</li>
            <li>It works for making my nails more presentable, but verdict is out on whether it has any long lasting effects.</li>
            <li>the bottle are like&lt;br /&gt;the normal size on opi nail polish after use this for one week every day</li>
            <li>My cuticles look healthy, and they are no longer dried out or peeling.</li>
            <li>I love this product - it helps keep the delicate skin around my fingernails from splitting and breaking and if I had reviewed when I had first started using the product, I would have given it five stars.</li>
            <li>In addition, I apply it a few minutes after using a top coat on my polish.</li>
            <li>I use this daily on my cuticles all year round, it replenishes your dry cuticles and makes them look refreshed and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Keeps a manicure looking new and fingers looking younger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works any better than just plain old vitamin E oil or even any vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I let it soak in a bit first before rubbing it in and, to get the excess oil off my finger tips, I rub it into the back of my hands.</li>
            <li>My cuticles have always been in rough shape, so this is pretty much a miracle worker</li>
            <li>if good smelling stuff like this was in more salons , people would not say how BAD they smell !</li>
            <li>made nails clear and neat</li>
            <li>My cuticles look much nicer now, &amp; I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks so far.</li>
            <li>Only been a few days but so far, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I find applying and massaging it in twice a day a real bore, but that&#x27;s the only drawback I can see.</li>
            <li>I absolutely cannot get enough of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but surprised it did not come with a brush, has a dropper instead which I do not prefer.</li>
            <li>It will help with keeping your cuticles soft.</li>
            <li>Stopped because I got busy..</li>
            <li>It keeps my nails so soft.</li>
            <li>The next morning, I really can&#x27;t tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>the cuticles will stop cracking with raised edges, but so far, this product has not corrected my problem.</li>
            <li>I bought this directly from OPI at a beauty show after telling them about my nails.  </li>
            <li>son took one of my bottles and has completely stopped biting his cuticles</li>
            <li>Some people may be apprehensive about an oil treatment, however, this is a non-greasy oil!It leaves your cuticles soft and it lasts.</li>
            <li>It really seems to help, and this is only day 2.</li>
            <li>Invested in this, cuticles are so much nicer now with this simple, aromatic, and quick-absorbing oil.  </li>
            <li>I know others were saying, &amp;#34;what about when you wash your hands?&amp;#34; but this really soaks into the cuticle skin and repair happens almost instantly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my go to when my cuticles look rough...makes that ugliness disappear, and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li>So that you get the complete picture: I work with my hands</li>
            <li>toenails as it keeps the skin so soft the nail grow correctly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works very well, especially if you&#x27;re one of those people who doesn&#x27;t like oily things on your fingers; lets you use them without getting it all over something,</li>
            <li>; When I brushed it over my cuticles, it almost instantly smoothed them and made them look freshly manicured, unlike any product I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>, either - I frame the entire nail in a full square/circle, since I get dry skin and hangnails all over the place.     </li>
            <li>I agree with a few other reviews in the fact that it comes off pretty easily, but I just apply this while watching TV to let it soak in</li>
            <li>But it brushes on with a light, non-greasy feel, and the brush is OPI&#x27;s normal thick brush, which aids</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for a short time but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>It keeps my cuticles moisturized for a long time and smells really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My cuticles are finally starting to look normal, I have no idea how this works</li>
            <li>My nails really soak this oil up and it has made a big difference in a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few different cuticle oils - some cheaper and some more expensive, and I have to say, they all kind of feel about the same to me.</li>
            <li>No other cuticle oil or cream I have tried works as well as OPI.</li>
            <li>I bought the brands Avoplex nail and cuticle replenishing oil because my cuticles were dry - in other words a mess - and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>I have washed my hands several times and the cuticles are still soft.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made a big difference so far.</li>
            <li>This product keeps my nails and cuticles soft especially during the Winter months.</li>
            <li>I also started getting better results by applying it down a little further on the fingertip as well.  </li>
            <li>I do clean my cuticles and remove the extra dead layers so in conjunction with this product my manicures always look neatly done!</li>
            <li>I live in Phoenix so have dry skin.</li>
            <li>It keeps my cuticles looking moist and not dry.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and have noticed a major improvement after only two weeks.</li>
            <li>Bottle was leaking and not alot of this product was lost but due to the high quality of the product it was everywhere.</li>
            <li>I used it every morning and night before bed in the past 2 days, today I actually have it sitting on my desk so that I can apply it right after I was my hands.</li>
            <li>I really like this but the cap on it won&#x27;t get tight at all</li>
            <li>Bought this because of all the good reviews and I needed some help with my bad cuticles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of OPI nail products, but did not try this until I bought a promotional nail care kit a few years ago around Christmas a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Try it you will love</li>
            <li> The oil penetrates into the most lifeless of nail.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use it any more.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I really love using this after I take off nail polish</li>

            <li> I love this cuticle oil.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many cuticle/nail creams (I literally pick my cuticles to shreds ... always have, always will.</li>
            <li> This oil makes my cuticles and fingers so velvety smooth and amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this oil.</li>
            <li> I am most satisfied.  </li>
            <li> and I am so pleased with what seemed like overnight results, in reality more like 5-7 days.</li>
            <li> Much better than all the others I have tried and love the scent.  </li>
            <li> I have problem nails, and have tried many products.  </li>
            <li> Most just leave oil on your nails for hours and never &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The girl that does my manicure commented on how much better my cuticles and nails looked.</li>
            <li> I think it helps (and the price here is better than in stores)</li>
            <li> but I think my sally hansen cuticle oil is much more nourishing and portable.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> MY NAILS LOOK HEALTHY.</li>
            <li> It worked to make the nail healthy again.</li>

            <li> I love the product itself.</li>
            <li> and it is sure working.  </li>
            <li> So glad to find something to solve my cuticle problem.  </li>
            <li> They have more life in them.</li>
            <li> I love ordering through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> I love OPI and their products.  </li>
            <li> I will be using a lot more of this.</li>
            <li> to my surprise I have this to be yet another winning product from OPI.</li>
            <li> What more can a girl as for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would buy again, just wish it had more staying power.</li>

            <li> love that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m soooo glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Since my cuticles look so much better</li>
            <li> I will keep this in my nail kit hopefully this may be a preventive to the jagged cuticle conundrum :)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone having trouble with their hands the way I was, it works great! :D</li>
            <li> And I am positively reinforced by the pleasant smell, I just want to keep putting it on :)</li>
            <li> Does a great job of replenishing moisture into skin, particularly around cuticles.  </li>
            <li> I use my hands a lot - baking and cooking - and my cuticles are often dry, so this product is perfect for me and works much better for me than Sally Hansen has.</li>
            <li> All the different oils and what-not have a very pleasant scent to them.</li>
            <li> I normally use another brand of cuticle oil, but I thought I&#x27;d give this a try because OPI has great products.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, has a nice wide brush for application, and once it&#x27;s all massaged in, my nails and cuticles look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li> the oil is excellent have this product for a long time</li>
            <li> The scent is great and the opi standard brush size make it amazing to apply.</li>
            <li> It is especially wonderful for nails and cuticle in the dry winter months</li>
            <li> It keeps my cuticles healthy, supple, and strong.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for dry and cracked cuticles.  </li>
            <li> and this is the best deal I&#x27;ve found on Amazon, and it&#x27;s really cheap compared to the tiny tubes of Avoplex that they sell at Ulta.</li>
            <li> Takes care of all cuticles (hands and feet) keeps them hydrated and clean looking!</li>
            <li> WOW Is all I have to say, What a great product.</li>
            <li> So far this works great.  </li>
            <li> The smell is incredible and it is simple to apply (uses a dropper).</li>
            <li> Working great so far.</li>
            <li> Love the light scent also.</li>
            <li> My cuticles and nails have never looked this good thanks to OPI.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I find this easy to use&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;for make strong nails growing and work prefect</li>
            <li> I was so dissapointed with this -- I have allergies to scents and did not know how strong an aroma this had.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also very pleased on how fast it was shipped and delivered to my house.</li>
            <li> First of all I have to say about the smell!its amazing  .</li>
            <li> My nails are getting healthier (no longer as brittle or &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34;) and they are growing nicely.</li>
            <li> i really liked this product even using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I think the oil just affects the refractive index of the nail material, but, frankly, at this point I&#x27;m fine with that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nails are finally strong enough to grow out to an attractive length.</li>
            <li> and so are my hands, after using about twice a day, I can see a difference - although it isn&#x27;t a huge difference, but I will keep using.</li>
            <li> While the actual bottle didn&#x27;t look like the picture, it is still a great produce and helps my cuticles heal.  </li>
            <li> I was using this product a few times a week after I got it, and have been very impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> Works great for nails and definitely seems to help.</li>
            <li> It smells great, but I only use it before I do the nail polish.</li>
            <li> The coolest thing is it doesn&#x27;t take much time or effort to keep my nails looking really nice.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling cuticle oil that absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> It works and makes cuticles smooth.</li>
            <li> finally remembered what I used to use; and it&#x27;s great...  </li>
            <li> Overall it is good, but I think my sally hansen one is better.</li>
            <li> Even better, the price was right with this seller.</li>
            <li> I doubt i will reorder since there are so many other great oils that are cheaper</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very useful and lovely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t had my nails NOT done since christmas time (when i got my UV system) and my nails are still super strong</li>
            <li> My new favorite cuticle oil!</li>
            <li> to grow strong and more fast</li>
            <li> I would suggest this to anyone who wants to keep their cuticles strong and smooth!</li>
            <li> A lot of people rave about cuticle oil pens because they&#x27;re so much easier to apply, but I honestly feel like this brush is much easier and much more generous with the oil.</li>
            <li> The scent is unique</li>
            <li> I opted for this full bottle size as it&#x27;s easy to apply like polish, just a quick dab on each finger cuticle and rub it in.  </li>
            <li> This is great for repairing dry nails &amp; cuticles.</li>
            <li> This product is great for my dry cuticles.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell FABULOUS, but the smell dissipates quickly.    </li>
            <li> It has a great scent and seems to add moisture to my dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> This works far better than most nail oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d probably work better if I used it more consistenly, but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a couple of people complain about the smell, but I actually think it&#x27;s somewhat pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Just got this stuff today, so while I suppose the long-term effects are still to be determined, so far I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> The reviews are right, it smells great, but seems to disappear the second you wash your hands.</li>
            <li> Almost 20$ at salons, and pretty much worth it!!</li>
            <li> great help for my very dry nails. . .</li>
            <li> It smells great and if u have wet polish</li>
            <li> how great it heals my rough cuticles.</li>
            <li> but wow, Opi Avoplex is amazing stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems to last a good while, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After your cuticles start looking healthier, you only need to use this product about once a week to maintain good looking nails.</li>
            <li> Smells good enough, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my nailbeds.</li>
            <li> Excellent without being too greasy and thick that it doesn&#x27;t soak in.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe the sickeningly sweet smell of it.  </li>
            <li> This oil makes the cuticle feel so soft and replenishes nicely.  </li>
            <li> works great, packaged shipped very carefully.</li>
            <li> This is seriously some of the best cuticle oil I have used.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine when you first put it on and massage it around</li>
            <li> i use this after i take off my old shellac polish - it works great to bring my nails &amp; cuticles back to their original look.  </li>
            <li> I love how soft the cuticles are now</li>
            <li> Simple to use and effective.  </li>
            <li> An excellent help for your brittle, broken, and just won&#x27;t grow nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> worth to recommend it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth every</li>
            <li> but I think it will be well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Works well to keep the polish looking fresh and chip-free.</li>
            <li> The only way I can have any kind of nails without breakage  - use nightly before bed.</li>
            <li> worth the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and it totally makes my nails grown when they won&#x27;t on their own.  </li>
            <li> My cuticles were pushed back nice and neat and it made painting my nails 10 times easier.</li>
            <li> so it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> and right before I go to bed at night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see it on Amazon right now to include a product link, but here&#x27;s the product information from Aveda:  </li>
            <li> From now on I&#x27;m going to make sure I put a little bit of this stuff on each finger every day to keep all of them healthy.</li>
            <li> and I love how it comes with a little pamphlet to read more about the product and ways on using</li>
            <li> I saw a dermatologist about the issue and he suggested biotin supplements as being the only real fix, but added that even biotin taken as directed is kind of hit or miss.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money and will definitely purchase again, love it</li>
            <li> I only recently started getting into nail care and manicures, but this produce is great.</li>
            <li> Helps it dry more quickly.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews on this I decided to give it a shot and am abosultey glad I did.</li>
            <li> I first seen this product on NailPro.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, but doesn&#x27;t seem to make a lasting difference for me</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does, and the results are pretty immediate.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The oil itself works pretty well.</li>
            <li> totally fall in love</li>
            <li> My nails are really growing!</li>
            <li> There are hand lotions out there which last better than this oil.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have tried this product.  </li>
            <li> Has prevented many problems and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work when I bought it, but after using it I definitely notice a difference.</li>
            <li> IT LEFT MY CUTICLES FEELING MOISTURIZED AND LOOKING HEALTHY.</li>
            <li> Bought this to add to my manicure regimen as the last step after the top coat.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> and I will order more in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day and will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> recommend it to first users</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to buying more products in the future with this seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Do exactly as the directions say (apply it twice a day&amp; massage it in).</li>
            <li> I guess that I will be buying more of this in the future!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really moisturizes!</li>
            <li> I use this daily for my cuticles and I love it.</li>
            <li> and this was my first time purchasing it,</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been getting into nail art though and subsequently have been trying to take better care of my nails, I decided to purchase this and give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> Secondly it does what it claims for sure.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and great smell but not sure it has made any difference in my nails or cuticules, they all lookk same an dhas been using it for over 1 week twice a day</li>
            <li> Living on a fixed income, I need to try to keep my nails as nice as I can between necessary manicures.  </li>
            <li> which don&#x27;t really seem any different to me than nail polish), but they&#x27;re either ineffective or just make the lines more</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I was going to like this product more than the Essie apricot oil (which I absolutely find it particularly a basic on my nail care routine).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply every day, with a wide brush and all.</li>
            <li> The only com I have to it is that it wipes off pretty easy.</li>
            <li> It really helps and I also really like the smell of it!</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly and deeply into my skin, and the skin around my nails has truly never been healthier.  </li>
            <li> My nails were brittle and would break and peel constantly, and I was becoming very discouraged.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry cuticles, more so than any guy I&#x27;ve ever known.  </li>
            <li> I especially like its smell, which is sweet and fresh.</li>
            <li> This nail replenishing oil smell so good and long lasting</li>
            <li> Of course it washes off (as several reviewers have commented), but re-applications are fast and easy.</li>
            <li> This container was actually leaking when it arrived, but the product works just fine.</li>
            <li> I would very  highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I very highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> i use it daily, already noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> and I can garden, and cook, and not worry so much about my cuticles and nails.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you have this problem!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very that I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> And it really does work:</li>
            <li> It helped my nails so much.</li>
            <li> This really lets it absorb into the skin instead of just coming off on your fingertips while massaging.  </li>
            <li> this will just be much easier for me to use.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really know what to do about it.</li>
            <li> After using the nail polish remover, it can moisturize my nails gently.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i havent seen much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I like that the oil doesn&#x27;t have a really overpowering smell</li>
            <li> but when I do, it REALLY helps.</li>
            <li> my cuticles are softer and my nails feel much healthier and stronger.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for both my cuticles and nails.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it provides your nails with the much needed oil that they need.</li>
            <li> For a while, I stopped really trying to take care of my nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li> The instructions don&#x27;t really tell you how to use it</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> and it really makes my nails look nicer.</li>
            <li> OPI products are very dependable.  </li>
            <li> but I really like it.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t used it much</li>
            <li> I stuck with it for a while and really gave the oil a chance, but it just did nothing for</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really justify getting manicures, so I came to Amazon to find a solution.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my cuticles, they are much softer and moist.</li>
            <li> $2 shipping was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend and I will keep using it!</li>
            <li> there isn&#x27;t really a smell to it to me and it does wonders for my nails.  </li>
            <li> should have bought the real solar oil.</li>
            <li> This cuticle oil really helped me to replenish try nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actual toenails look healthier, whiter and so much healthier.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy in your shoes.&lt;br /&gt;Great smell, but very light.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s a bit pricey to me, it really does work so well</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s completely and totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I recently started doing my nails again and needed something to help make them look more professional.</li>
            <li> Most recently, this happened on my right middle finger and it was bothering me a lot.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase it again, as it is nothing special, and due to the sweet smell.  </li>
            <li> If you can apply nail polish sloppily, you can figure this out, lol.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous creams and other oils, and nothing has delivered a result as good as this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This has really saved my cuticles, I am not big fan of manicures, I just like my nails to look clean and well groomed with no drying or cracking around the nail bed.</li>
            <li> cuticles are normal again!</li>
            <li> Like all other OPI products, it&#x27;s top notch</li>
            <li> Anyway, the oil is okay other than that.  </li>
            <li> I normally love your nail care products and am happy you have embraced new formulations in the polish leaving out some of the bad stuff...  </li>
            <li> Not only that, nails are much healthier and cracks and dryness are quickly disappearing as is discolouration.  </li>
            <li> My cuticles look amazing after a few days and I have not had them clipped ever since!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes and replenishes your nailbed and your cuticles, and that&#x27;s very important, especially if you&#x27;re constantly changing nail polishes, like me.</li>
            <li> amazon carries an amazing selection of various OPI products sold by other vendors who are very reliable.</li>
            <li> however i find that the oil dries off relatively quickly which is why i have to re-apply several times a day when i feel my cuticles are dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i dont see any reason why this particular product needs to be purchased.</li>
            <li> I am not convinced that it works for the long-term (e.g., I put on at night and hope for moisturized cuticles in the a.m.), but the quick fix to make my fingernails look presentable is enough to please me!</li>
            <li> Not so lucky still  having the same problem..</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve found a decent cuticle oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seriously never seen my cuticles looking so</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it &amp; will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and really helps with those dry cuticles in the winter.</li>
            <li> Yeah... I got this inside an empty box of some nail cream with the words FREE OPI AVOPLEX OIL on it.</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive, but the product is great.</li>
            <li> gets rid of rough hang nails and makes your nails look fabulous</li>
            <li> i clean my cuticles and painted my nails, also it makes my nail polish dry faster</li>
            <li> It works for making my nails more presentable, but verdict is out on whether it has any long lasting effects.</li>
            <li> the bottle are like&lt;br /&gt;the normal size on opi nail polish after use this for one week every day</li>
            <li> My cuticles look healthy, and they are no longer dried out or peeling.</li>
            <li> I love this product - it helps keep the delicate skin around my fingernails from splitting and breaking and if I had reviewed when I had first started using the product, I would have given it five stars.</li>
            <li> In addition, I apply it a few minutes after using a top coat on my polish.</li>
            <li> I use this daily on my cuticles all year round, it replenishes your dry cuticles and makes them look refreshed and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Keeps a manicure looking new and fingers looking younger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works any better than just plain old vitamin E oil or even any vegetable oil.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I let it soak in a bit first before rubbing it in and, to get the excess oil off my finger tips, I rub it into the back of my hands.</li>
            <li> My cuticles have always been in rough shape, so this is pretty much a miracle worker</li>
            <li> if good smelling stuff like this was in more salons , people would not say how BAD they smell !</li>
            <li> made nails clear and neat</li>
            <li> My cuticles look much nicer now, &amp; I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks so far.</li>
            <li> Only been a few days but so far, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I find applying and massaging it in twice a day a real bore, but that&#x27;s the only drawback I can see.</li>
            <li> I absolutely cannot get enough of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but surprised it did not come with a brush, has a dropper instead which I do not prefer.</li>
            <li> It will help with keeping your cuticles soft.</li>
            <li> Stopped because I got busy..</li>
            <li> It keeps my nails so soft.</li>
            <li> The next morning, I really can&#x27;t tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> the cuticles will stop cracking with raised edges, but so far, this product has not corrected my problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this directly from OPI at a beauty show after telling them about my nails.  </li>
            <li> son took one of my bottles and has completely stopped biting his cuticles</li>
            <li> Some people may be apprehensive about an oil treatment, however, this is a non-greasy oil!It leaves your cuticles soft and it lasts.</li>
            <li> It really seems to help, and this is only day 2.</li>
            <li> Invested in this, cuticles are so much nicer now with this simple, aromatic, and quick-absorbing oil.  </li>
            <li> I know others were saying, &amp;#34;what about when you wash your hands?&amp;#34; but this really soaks into the cuticle skin and repair happens almost instantly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go to when my cuticles look rough...makes that ugliness disappear, and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li> So that you get the complete picture: I work with my hands</li>
            <li> toenails as it keeps the skin so soft the nail grow correctly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works very well, especially if you&#x27;re one of those people who doesn&#x27;t like oily things on your fingers; lets you use them without getting it all over something,</li>
            <li> ; When I brushed it over my cuticles, it almost instantly smoothed them and made them look freshly manicured, unlike any product I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> , either - I frame the entire nail in a full square/circle, since I get dry skin and hangnails all over the place.     </li>
            <li> I agree with a few other reviews in the fact that it comes off pretty easily, but I just apply this while watching TV to let it soak in</li>
            <li> But it brushes on with a light, non-greasy feel, and the brush is OPI&#x27;s normal thick brush, which aids</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a short time but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> It keeps my cuticles moisturized for a long time and smells really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My cuticles are finally starting to look normal, I have no idea how this works</li>
            <li> My nails really soak this oil up and it has made a big difference in a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different cuticle oils - some cheaper and some more expensive, and I have to say, they all kind of feel about the same to me.</li>
            <li> No other cuticle oil or cream I have tried works as well as OPI.</li>
            <li> I bought the brands Avoplex nail and cuticle replenishing oil because my cuticles were dry - in other words a mess - and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> I have washed my hands several times and the cuticles are still soft.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s made a big difference so far.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my nails and cuticles soft especially during the Winter months.</li>
            <li> I also started getting better results by applying it down a little further on the fingertip as well.  </li>
            <li> I do clean my cuticles and remove the extra dead layers so in conjunction with this product my manicures always look neatly done!</li>
            <li> I live in Phoenix so have dry skin.</li>
            <li> It keeps my cuticles looking moist and not dry.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and have noticed a major improvement after only two weeks.</li>
            <li> Bottle was leaking and not alot of this product was lost but due to the high quality of the product it was everywhere.</li>
            <li> I used it every morning and night before bed in the past 2 days, today I actually have it sitting on my desk so that I can apply it right after I was my hands.</li>
            <li> I really like this but the cap on it won&#x27;t get tight at all</li>
            <li> Bought this because of all the good reviews and I needed some help with my bad cuticles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of OPI nail products, but did not try this until I bought a promotional nail care kit a few years ago around Christmas a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my cuticles were dry, white, flaky and gross and I woke up this morning</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last a LONG time.</li>
            <li> To each his own, but regardless, it&#x27;s very faint, so it shouldn&#x27;t be bothersome either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a little over one month of regular, twice-a-day use so far.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me tell you, I&#x27;ve had some stinky cuticle oils in the past, and this is not one of them!</li>
            <li> Next morning my nails were just as dry and brittle and before.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this over many months, but over a few weeks it seems to have dramatically decreased the cracking in my finger nails.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is too thin and because of this it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> Because it take a long time to massage it into the skin.</li>
            <li> Never expected to find something that would cure the dry skin around my toe nails within a few short days!  </li>
            <li> Instantly softens dry rough edges.</li>
            <li> Applying it doesn&#x27;t take long, neither does waiting for it to dry</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit so it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Other sellers only charge $5.99</li>
            <li> I live in a hot hot dry dry climate and I am constantly washing my hands, and since I&#x27;ve started applying this regularly, it&#x27;s made my nails look healthier, the polish stay nice-looking longer, and I&#x27;ve had fewer hangnails and dry nasty skin.</li>
            <li> I have my hands in water a lot (doing dishes, watering in the yard, etc.), and I tend to have dry hands and cuticles.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry nails.</li>
            <li> it makes ur polish dry faster</li>
            <li> I bought this because my cuticles are SO dry</li>
            <li> Working miracles on my dry heels as well.  </li>
            <li> cuticles look dry again.</li>
            <li> I no longer have dry cuticles and my fingers look healthier.  </li>
            <li> My hands become horribly dry in winter, so I bought this hoping it might help with cuticle dryness.  </li>
            <li> would uses this again and tell every one that has dry cuticle nails to use this product</li>
            <li> w/ dry pealing cuticles.  </li>
            <li> I have dry cracked cuticles and I&#x27;m always chewing on the hangnails until they bleed.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would end all of that and repair my dry cuticles.  </li>
            <li> I go about my day with dry cuticles and catch myself chewing on them.  </li>
            <li> If your cuticles are dry, cracked, peeling, bleeding, etc.</li>
            <li> I tend to wear a lot of nail polishes for which The nails become dry and lifeless.</li>
            <li> My nails are extremely dry from being in the pool 4 days a week, so I tried this product.</li>
            <li> My cuticles are dry, but, my nails have grown.</li>
            <li> That, and my hands have always been on the dry side.</li>
            <li> My fingers weren&#x27;t dry anymore</li>
            <li> I have dry cuticles</li>
            <li> winter is hard on my cuticles &amp; this product seems to help prevent the &amp;#34;grannies&amp;#34; which I normally have in the colder weather.</li>
            <li> But after using this oil on all my fingers for just the past two days, that redness and pain is gone and it&#x27;s almost completely healed.</li>
            <li> To be honest I don&#x27;t even know if it works since I had to remove it immediately.  :-(</li>
            <li> And I have psoriasis of the nails and some of my cuticles are dry!</li>
            <li> Say goodbye to dry cuticles!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I thought my nails were very dry and thought this could help.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it seems to help my very dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> I have always had very dry skin and cuticles, and no amount of lotion has ever been able to prevent painful cracking.  </li>
            <li> so you can squirt (not brush, as I expected) the oil around.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, for just an ounce of oil, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I had deep ridges in them after a few rounds of IVF and taking hormone treatments.  </li>
            <li> However did not see expected</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m curious about the rest of the Avoplex line of products.</li>
            <li> I got my bottle less than a month ago and half of it is gone because the lid does not close properly and keeps spilling whenever I try to take it somewhere.</li>
            <li> Makes my hands seem less dry.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my cuticles soft and subtle.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Almost as good as CND for helping with the nasty dry hangnails I get.</li>
            <li> The actual bottle is small with a dropper in the lid</li>
            <li> and then every other day for another two weeks.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t feel so oily like other cuticle oil I have used</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to other sellers now for my replacement bottle.</li>
            <li> Once you start taking care of them, it will bug you endlessly if you stop.</li>
            <li> if i had any other oil, i&#x27;d just use that.</li>
            <li> Of course I use this with a combination of other products as well, but this is the one thing I go to use if I cannot use anything else for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> I am going to toss out all my other cuticle and nail creams and lotions, and just stick with this.</li>
            <li> I have used other cuticle oil products but none with the feel and benefits of OPI.....</li>
            <li> I was trying other things like unscented hand lotions, but nothing else worked like this oil.</li>
            <li> Would tell other people about it.  </li>
            <li> you can make stable forumulations without the cancer causing parabens and other toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> Using this oil helps to replenish oil in an area that is depleated due to nail products and every day wear and tear.</li>
            <li> The acetone from the polish remover always leaves my nails feeling a little dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> but when I feel that dead, dry skin, I just can&#x27;t help myself.  </li>
            <li> In the winter when my cuticles are REALLY dry, I even put a little under each fingernail -- it helps cut down on hangnails even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My cuticles honestly were so bad I was too embarrassed to get a manicure!</li>
            <li> I kept it on for 3 minutes and still had a hard time pushing back the cuticles.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying again</li>
            <li> This has helped cut down on peeling and breakage.</li>
            <li> have very thin and weak fingernails, primarily i bought this product just for my cuticles</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t lose half the product when I want to take it somewhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly foody, perhaps vanilla?</li>
            <li> /&gt;After maybe a week of using this (probably less)</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse or more painful than dry cuticles that tear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worked wonders on my dry cuticles over the past few weeks, and I often forget using it even once per day</li>
            <li> mine have always been a mess, but this helps them alot!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nails are a mess from thyroid disease .</li>
            <li> No more rough skin around toenails,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I especially like to use this in winter, just as general maintenance and upkeep, because the cold air leeches moisture from my skin, hair, and nails like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.</li>
            <li> I typically apply it, let it sit for a few minutes, then rub it in and go about my business.</li>
            <li> Brushing a little of this onto the nails helps relieve that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it feels a little oily.  </li>
            <li> During the winter months I sometimes will apply a little during the morning.  </li>
            <li> and I have very, very dry and hard cuticles.</li>
            <li> I put this on my cuticles, let it set for a few minutes, then use hand lotion.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday after my morning routine..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few years.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few weeks to see results with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few products to help (lotions and &amp;#34;nail strengtheners,&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks 2-4 times a day.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I wish I didn&#x27;t have to apply it every few days -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to use it every day, a few time a week work.</li>
            <li> As a result, the area of skin just behind the cuticles would sometimes split and become red, and sore on some of my fingers.</li>
            <li> My cuticles are still dried out and I still have hang nails.</li>
            <li> although I use it all year round.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> I do not understand the need for things like this to be heavily perfumed.  </li>
            <li> This works for maybe 2 hours before I&#x27;m dried out</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a little bit confusing but other</li>
            <li> my poor cuticles, so dry and abused, i use badger balm and that works, but its greasy so i can&#x27;t always use it.</li>
            <li> Just rub your fingers on a towel and you have no more mess!  </li>
            <li> No more dryness</li>
            <li> It was gift for my daughter in law and even though it was packaged and wrapped in bubble wrap, the bottle had a small puncture hole and leaked all over the bubble wrap.  </li>
            <li> Am not sure if it is helping my cuticles or nails yet.  </li>
            <li> as usual, OPI knocks it out of the park.</li>
            <li> However, the bottle is poorly designed and the suction tube reaches just over two-thirds down the bottle</li>
            <li> It claims it has nutrients and somehow makes the nail stronger, but I have a hard time buying it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had a hard time with my nails.</li>
            <li> I use this at least twice a day.  </li>
            <li> so you end up with a lot of oil you can&#x27;t use or have to dump out clumsily over your cuticles.</li>
            <li> Every time I try to close it all the way the lid slowly starts opening by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not very happy what this products.</li>
            <li> As soon as I would get one, a week later they would be back to terrible.</li>
            <li> Its a little on the expensive side</li>
            <li> Wintertime dries my cuticles so bad when I put on gloves the cuticles actually snag on the material and tear even bleed in some case.</li>
            <li> used it faithfully for several weeks and stopped having painful hangnails.  </li>
            <li> Anxious to see if it continues to work through our cold harsh winter season.</li>
            <li> avoplex oil is always good but terrible packing in this time! :(</li>
            <li> Will not likely buy again.  :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really addicted to nail colors</li>
            <li> I used this after taking off nail polish to find the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; on the nail that the polish leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this because I tend to use Avacado oil on my skin anyway, but I truly hate dry cuticles</li>
            <li> It has helped strengthen my very weak nails.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with any of the OPI products that I use.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and it has made a big difference...especially in the brutal Michigan winters!</li>
            <li> I have had very few hang nails since i started using it!!!</li>
            <li> They were brittle, dry and looked awful.  </li>
            <li> I have problems with my cuticles in cold weather.</li>
            <li> I decided to stop cutting my cuticles and this was just the thing to help me.</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> Smells so bad -</li>
            <li> Bad habit and cannot kick it.)</li>
            <li> i dont have very bad cuticles but decided to give this a try since its winter and my nails and cuticle could benefit from some moisture</li>
            <li> They are in very bad shape.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrible habit, I know.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product and fast service</li>
            <li> Great purchase....bought all of this line</li>
            <li> I got this to use at night with my hand cream. It made my hands so greasy I couldn&#x27;t stand it. Had to wash my hands and use my cuticle balm. Ended up getting rid of it.</li>
            <li> I love this. I&#x27;ve had it about a week and can already see a difference in my cuticles.</li>
            <li> Only been a few days but so far, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Received this today and i must say it&#x27;s lovely!! I used it with the OPI axxium nai kit; it smells wonderful and does moisturize cuticles. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have my hands in water a lot (doing dishes, watering in the yard, etc.), and I tend to have dry hands and cuticles.  I put this on my cuticles, let it set for a few minutes, then use hand lotion.  Works great!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday after my morning routine..shower, make up, jewelry.  It keeps my cuticles looking moist and not dry.  I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I have never used a product so effective in keeping hangnails,etc. away. A tiny bit rubbed into each nail 2 times a day...and I can garden, and cook, and not worry so much about my cuticles and nails.  I highly recommend this product if you have this problem!</li>
            <li> This is great for repairing dry nails &amp; cuticles. With continued use, you can see the improvement. A+++ product. I highly recommend it &amp; will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> WOW Is all I have to say, What a great product.</li>
            <li> I work in the medical field so I am constantly washing my hands.  This product is great for my dry cuticles.  I even rub the excess  into my hands.  I choose this product just from reading the review. I will purchase again because it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I really Love this Produkt i use it a Longe Time i am happy to find a Website now i am back in Europe and Hope to find it there</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, this product is awesome. IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> I have used them all, but this is the best and smells wonderful.  You can use it on knuckles and toes too.</li>
            <li> Never used oil before and so glad I started. Love how my nails are looking and my cuticles too</li>
            <li> love everything about it. And it smells great, leaves your cuticles moisturized! A drop is enough for each cuticle twice a day, that&#x27;s said in the directions in the packaging.</li>
            <li> GreatSeller,ItemPerfect,Emails,FastShipper &amp; trustworthy-that’sImportant</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry nails. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and notice an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to some reviews, I think the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this over many months, but over a few weeks it seems to have dramatically decreased the cracking in my finger nails.  I find applying and massaging it in twice a day a real bore, but that&#x27;s the only drawback I can see.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, the packaging was a nightmare. Bottle was leaking and not alot of this product was lost but due to the high quality of the product it was everywhere. that is the only reason for the 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Bottle leaked, but it is good nourishment for the cuticles.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few years.  It&#x27;s nice and smooth on the cuticles and under the nails.</li>
            <li> So far this works great.  Love the smell.  Anxious to see if it continues to work through our cold harsh winter season.</li>
            <li> Best cuticle oil ever! Smells great and this is the best deal I&#x27;ve found on Amazon, and it&#x27;s really cheap compared to the tiny tubes of Avoplex that they sell at Ulta. If you&#x27;re someone who does their own manicures at home, this is mandatory. Get this, your cuticles will thank-you!</li>
            <li> While the actual bottle didn&#x27;t look like the picture, it is still a great produce and helps my cuticles heal.  The actual bottle is small with a dropper in the lid so you can squirt (not brush, as I expected) the oil around.  I would still buy it again.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews on this I decided to give it a shot and am abosultey glad I did. It&#x27;s not to oily and the smell is kind of mellow so it&#x27;s not overbearing. I use it twice a day and have noticed a major improvement after only two weeks. I will definitely continue using this. Two thumbs up</li>
            <li> Really good oil! Use it all the time.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT.  I&#x27;m very that I purchased this.  I have had very few hang nails since i started using it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad a friend of mine told me to get this. This stuff is AMAZING. It smells absolutely perfect, and it glides on super smooth. It should - because it&#x27;s basically oil. And it really does work: nails look healthier, become stronger and smoother, and just feel better. I especially like to use this in winter, just as general maintenance and upkeep, because the cold air leeches moisture from my skin, hair, and nails like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. A great product. Expensive, for just an ounce of oil, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Great cuticle oil! And leaves nails looking great. Easy to use. Going to try too get my husband to use on callous.</li>
            <li> Living on a fixed income, I need to try to keep my nails as nice as I can between necessary manicures.  This product does the trick.  I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li> It took me a few weeks to see results with this product but I persisted and my nail beds/cuticles are normal again! They were brittle, dry and looked awful.  I used daily for a week and then every other day for another two weeks.  Now I just have to use it every couple of days to keep them in great condition.  My hands look so much better!</li>
            <li> I first seen this product on NailPro. You should also buy Sally Hansen&#x27;s Cuticle remover with the Opi Avoplex Nail and Cuticle Replenishing Oil for the best results. This Oil if great for keeping your Cuticle moisturized.</li>
            <li> My new favorite cuticle oil! It smells great and if u have wet polish n u put this on it makes ur polish dry faster and it doesn&#x27;t feel so oily like other cuticle oil I have used</li>
            <li> Keeps nails and cuticles incredibly moisturized! You only need a little bit so it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> avoplex oil is always good but terrible packing in this time! :(</li>
            <li> Like all OPI products, this nail and replenishing comlex is excellent.  You must use it once a day to obtain the benefits of it.  I keep mine on the table by my chair, so I can apply it and massage it in while I am watching TV.  Couldn&#x27;t be easier and the results are great.</li>
            <li> I recently started doing my nails again and needed something to help make them look more professional. I love how soft the cuticles are now but I have to say, it&#x27;s a rip off at $13. Other sellers only charge $5.99 and I&#x27;m going to other sellers now for my replacement bottle.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with any of the OPI products that I use. They are a quality company that provides quality products.&lt;br /&gt;I would and do recommend any hand &amp; nail product by OPI.</li>
            <li> It helped my nails so much. Very happy I tried it. I&#x27;m going to order it again when I run out</li>
            <li> The oil opi avoplex smells delicious and I loved working,Avoplex oil works on the first day is great...Try it you will love</li>
            <li> Simple to use and effective.  Also good for the hands.</li>
            <li> My wife talked me into having a manicure.  They used this product, and I was very impressed.  Does a great job of replenishing moisture into skin, particularly around cuticles.  Helps me to avoid picking at my cuticle areas, and make my hands look great.</li>
            <li> The oil penetrates into the most lifeless of nail. Gives supreme moisture and hydration. An excellent help for your brittle, broken, and just won&#x27;t grow nails. Purchase plenty, never be without.</li>
            <li> Smells so bad - I couldn&#x27;t use it any more.  Like a chemical cucumber smell.  The oil seems to work okay - but it gave me headaches so I gave it away,</li>
            <li> I have always had very dry skin and cuticles, and no amount of lotion has ever been able to prevent painful cracking.  I have tried numerous creams and other oils, and nothing has delivered a result as good as this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend brushing it on and then letting it sit for a couple of minutes before rubbing it in.  This really lets it absorb into the skin instead of just coming off on your fingertips while massaging.  I also started getting better results by applying it down a little further on the fingertip as well.  In the winter when my cuticles are REALLY dry, I even put a little under each fingernail -- it helps cut down on hangnails even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also been good for my nails after I remove polish.  The acetone from the polish remover always leaves my nails feeling a little dry and brittle.  Brushing a little of this onto the nails helps relieve that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a couple of people complain about the smell, but I actually think it&#x27;s somewhat pleasant.  To each his own, but regardless, it&#x27;s very faint, so it shouldn&#x27;t be bothersome either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I will say is that if you go several days without using it, you will definitely notice a deterioration in your cuticles.  So I guess in a way, this is kind of like wearing chapstick.  Once you start taking care of them, it will bug you endlessly if you stop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of cuticle oils but for me this one tops the list. I really love using this after I take off nail polish or after I&#x27;ve soaked my nails to help bring my nails back to life.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I expect it to work as well as the cream out of the squeeze bottle did. this will just be much easier for me to use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, but doesn&#x27;t seem to make a lasting difference for me</li>
            <li> It prevents dryness and softens cuticle. I do not run out of it as well as OPI strengthener. I like OPI.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Conditioning in my super-dry climate.  I use this at least twice a day.  My cuticles seem tamed.</li>
            <li> Okay, my toenails have weird cracks/ridges in them and I don&#x27;t really know what to do about it. I saw a dermatologist about the issue and he suggested biotin supplements as being the only real fix, but added that even biotin taken as directed is kind of hit or miss. I&#x27;ve used a few products to help (lotions and &amp;#34;nail strengtheners,&amp;#34; which don&#x27;t really seem any different to me than nail polish), but they&#x27;re either ineffective or just make the lines more apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff seems to work insofar as making the nails appear more uniform. It claims it has nutrients and somehow makes the nail stronger, but I have a hard time buying it. I think the oil just affects the refractive index of the nail material, but, frankly, at this point I&#x27;m fine with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I don&#x27;t use it for a day, my nails look just the same as they always have. It&#x27;s been a little over one month of regular, twice-a-day use so far. I&#x27;ll probably buy it again. Seems to last a good while, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr: It works for making my nails more presentable, but verdict is out on whether it has any long lasting effects.</li>
            <li> I love this cuticle oil. It&#x27;s very easy to apply every day, with a wide brush and all. You can also carry it around like an actual nail polish, since it&#x27;s the same size. It does what it says it does, and the results are pretty immediate. It moisturizes and replenishes your nailbed and your cuticles, and that&#x27;s very important, especially if you&#x27;re constantly changing nail polishes, like me. That could potentially take its toll on your nails, and it shouldn&#x27;t. This product is absolutley great! I really love it.</li>
            <li> Apply this once a day.  Works the best.  Not oily and absorbs nicely.  I would very  highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I always have one drop on my thumb and massage my nails. I especially like its smell, which is sweet and fresh. After using the nail polish remover, it can moisturize my nails gently.</li>
            <li> i dont have very bad cuticles but decided to give this a try since its winter and my nails and cuticle could benefit from some moisture therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks 2-4 times a day. it is basically oil that you are supposed to rub into the nails and cuticles however i find that the oil dries off relatively quickly which is why i have to re-apply several times a day when i feel my cuticles are dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i havent seen much of a difference. if i had any other oil, i&#x27;d just use that. i dont see any reason why this particular product needs to be purchased.</li>
            <li> Good cuticle oil and made the skin beside my fingernails smoother. Makes my hands seem less dry.  A good purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve only used it several times since purchasing it and I&#x27;ve already noted the difference in my nails and cuticles, especially my toe nails! I also LOVE the smell. It&#x27;s worth every penny. My nails are getting healthier (no longer as brittle or &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34;) and they are growing nicely. I absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> A lot of people rave about cuticle oil pens because they&#x27;re so much easier to apply, but I honestly feel like this brush is much easier and much more generous with the oil. If you can apply nail polish sloppily, you can figure this out, lol. I don&#x27;t limit the application to the cuticle, either - I frame the entire nail in a full square/circle, since I get dry skin and hangnails all over the place.     The oil itself works pretty well. It goes on and is viscous enough to stay in place without dripping everywhere. I typically apply it, let it sit for a few minutes, then rub it in and go about my business. I like that the oil doesn&#x27;t have a really overpowering smell - I don&#x27;t smell like I was just frying something in the kitchen. It doesn&#x27;t smell FABULOUS, but the smell dissipates quickly.    I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I wish I didn&#x27;t have to apply it every few days - but when I do, it REALLY helps. I live in a hot hot dry dry climate and I am constantly washing my hands, and since I&#x27;ve started applying this regularly, it&#x27;s made my nails look healthier, the polish stay nice-looking longer, and I&#x27;ve had fewer hangnails and dry nasty skin. My cuticles have also evened out and stopped cracking. Woo hoo!</li>
            <li> Good, and smells nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally fall in love this the smell of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very useful and lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth to recommend it.</li>
            <li> This nail cuticle oil works wonders! THANK YOU OPI!!  Will be using this on the daily. A must have for all you ladies who take care of your nails!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely cannot get enough of this stuff.  It feels so good to massage this into my cuticles every day.  It absorbs very quickly and deeply into my skin, and the skin around my nails has truly never been healthier.  Of course I use this with a combination of other products as well, but this is the one thing I go to use if I cannot use anything else for the rest of the day.  I do not go a day without using this!</li>
            <li> I have 2 toddlers, I have to wash my hands a lot. And I have psoriasis of the nails and some of my cuticles are dry! I didn&#x27;t think I was going to like this product more than the Essie apricot oil (which I absolutely find it particularly a basic on my nail care routine). This oil works!!! I don&#x27;t even have to use it every day, a few time a week work. The feel and smell of it are great too. Not too greasy and it can be rubbed generously over the surface of the nail.</li>
            <li> This is the best cuticle oil I have found.  It keeps my cuticles soft and subtle.  No more dryness and it helps to make my nails grow!!  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I found this at a great price on Amazon.  This is seriously some of the best cuticle oil I have used.  It absorbs quickly and really helps with those dry cuticles in the winter.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my cuticles are SO dry and so are my hands, after using about twice a day, I can see a difference - although it isn&#x27;t a huge difference, but I will keep using.</li>
            <li> I love it!! My nails are really growing!</li>
            <li> Love this cuticle oil!  I use it every day and it has made a big difference...especially in the brutal Michigan winters!</li>
            <li> Wow!  Never expected to find something that would cure the dry skin around my toe nails within a few short days!  Not only that, nails are much healthier and cracks and dryness are quickly disappearing as is discolouration.  Working miracles on my dry heels as well.  All this in just about a week of use.  Will be my #1 stocking stuffer this year!</li>
            <li> Very nice oil but surprised it did not come with a brush, has a dropper instead which I do not prefer.</li>
            <li> The oil is great when it&#x27;s on your finger nails/cuticles but once you wash your hands...poof all gone...cuticles look dry again. There are hand lotions out there which last better than this oil. I will use it up but will not purchase more. Sorry!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the oil yet but I already don&#x27;t like it because it did not come with a brush as described. I don&#x27;t like getting oil all over my fingers and the fact that it came with a brush was a big selling point.</li>
            <li> Best product for cuticles I&#x27;ve ever found. Instantly softens dry rough edges. I rub it all over my hands and toes. A must have before mani/pedi. Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I love this cuticle oil. The smell is incredible and it is simple to apply (uses a dropper). my cuticles are softer and my nails feel much healthier and stronger.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for both my cuticles and nails. It has a great scent and seems to add moisture to my dry cuticles. I&#x27;ve only used it for a short time but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> This works far better than most nail oils. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This container was actually leaking when it arrived, but the product works just fine.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful and nourishing for your cuticles! I can&#x27;t live without it. It definitely keeps my cuticles hydrated. Product arrived in perfect condition and delivered within stated timeframe.</li>
            <li> No other cuticle oil or cream I have tried works as well as OPI. I use it especially throughout the fall and winter months to keep my cuticles from cracking and creating hang nails. It works!</li>
            <li> This nail replenishing oil smell so good and long lasting the bottle are like&lt;br /&gt;the normal size on opi nail polish after use this for one week every day my nails&lt;br /&gt;start to grow strong and more fast I use this product in combination with Duri Rejuvacote pink&lt;br /&gt;for make strong nails growing and work prefect</li>
            <li> I have tried so many cuticle/nail creams (I literally pick my cuticles to shreds ... always have, always will. Bad habit and cannot kick it.) So, when I tried this, I figured &amp;#34;can&#x27;t hurt.&amp;#34; When I brushed it over my cuticles, it almost instantly smoothed them and made them look freshly manicured, unlike any product I have ever tried.  Of course it washes off (as several reviewers have commented), but re-applications are fast and easy. I have never had a product that truly made my ragged, jagged cuticles look smooth and healthy --- with just the swipe of a nail brush! I am not convinced that it works for the long-term (e.g., I put on at night and hope for moisturized cuticles in the a.m.), but the quick fix to make my fingernails look presentable is enough to please me! I am going to toss out all my other cuticle and nail creams and lotions, and just stick with this.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me tell you, I&#x27;ve had some stinky cuticle oils in the past, and this is not one of them! This oil makes my cuticles and fingers so velvety smooth and amazing. Highly recommend! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Great product. Opi does not disappoint...  Used as it should be it provides your nails with the much needed oil that they need. I have used other cuticle oil products but none with the feel and benefits of OPI..... Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this oil. For a while, I stopped really trying to take care of my nails and cuticles. As a result, the area of skin just behind the cuticles would sometimes split and become red, and sore on some of my fingers. Most recently, this happened on my right middle finger and it was bothering me a lot. But after using this oil on all my fingers for just the past two days, that redness and pain is gone and it&#x27;s almost completely healed. I was trying other things like unscented hand lotions, but nothing else worked like this oil. From now on I&#x27;m going to make sure I put a little bit of this stuff on each finger every day to keep all of them healthy.</li>
            <li> My cuticles are still dried out and I still have hang nails. I am not very happy what this products.</li>
            <li> I really like this but the cap on it won&#x27;t get tight at all and I can&#x27;t figure out why.  It&#x27;s driving me nuts.</li>
            <li> Yeah... I got this inside an empty box of some nail cream with the words FREE OPI AVOPLEX OIL on it. So, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m exactly happy that I bought this from this company. How skeezy. Great cuticle oil, but you can be sure I won&#x27;t buy from these charlatans again.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have tried this product.  I am most satisfied.  It keeps my nails/cuticles moist.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have now bought three bottles of this and I am so pleased with what seemed like overnight results, in reality more like 5-7 days. This has really saved my cuticles, I am not big fan of manicures, I just like my nails to look clean and well groomed with no drying or cracking around the nail bed. I use this a couple of times a day and for my polish I use a coat or two&lt;br /&gt;of Naitiques #2 and have been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Much better than all the others I have tried and love the scent.  Has prevented many problems and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very good nourishing, moisturizing product.</li>
            <li> Best cuticle oil ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have very thin and weak fingernails, primarily i bought this product just for my cuticles but it also helps making my fingernails stronger and grow faster. Really love this product!</li>
            <li> still using this product.</li>
            <li> I was using this product a few times a week after I got it, and have been very impressed with the results. My cuticles look healthy, and they are no longer dried out or peeling. After your cuticles start looking healthier, you only need to use this product about once a week to maintain good looking nails. Worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friends have even asked if I have started to get manicures. OPI Avoplex is awesome! ;)</li>
            <li> It really helps and I also really like the smell of it! I would suggest this to anyone who wants to keep their cuticles strong and smooth!</li>
            <li> works wonders on cuticles.  mine have always been a mess, but this helps them alot!&lt;br /&gt;that is........when i remember to put it on.</li>
            <li> I have problem nails, and have tried many products.  Most just leave oil on your nails for hours and never &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34;.  My nails really soak this oil up and it has made a big difference in a short period of time.  Am very happy I bought this and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very easy way to keep nail bed and cuticles lubricated especially during the winter months, and it may even strengthen the nails themselves.</li>
            <li> I like it, I used it with the nail envy and I like the results. It will help with keeping your cuticles soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 3 week snow but have noticed a difference in my nails already.  I no longer have dry cuticles and my fingers look healthier.  Its a little on the expensive side but I think it will be well worth it.  The girl that does my manicure commented on how much better my cuticles and nails looked.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! My cuticles look amazing after a few days and I have not had them clipped ever since!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work when I bought it, but after using it I definitely notice a difference. The instructions don&#x27;t really tell you how to use it so that&#x27;s a little bit confusing but other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the fence. I purchased this because I thought my nails were very dry and thought this could help. I think it helps (and the price here is better than in stores) but I think my sally hansen cuticle oil is much more nourishing and portable. I know there is a portable avoplex as well. Overall it is good, but I think my sally hansen one is better.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t help much. I kept it on for 3 minutes and still had a hard time pushing back the cuticles. Not worth buying again</li>
            <li> Just got this stuff today, so while I suppose the long-term effects are still to be determined, so far I LOVE it! It smells great, has a nice wide brush for application, and once it&#x27;s all massaged in, my nails and cuticles look and feel amazing.</li>
            <li> Works great, for some reason I didn&#x27;t realize it would come in a polish bottle application rather than just a drops bottle but that doesn&#x27;t change it&#x27;s effectiveness, it just doesn&#x27;t get used as often as it could because I have to have a place to stop and brush it on.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT. IT LEFT MY CUTICLES FEELING MOISTURIZED AND LOOKING HEALTHY. I BEEN TRYING TO GROW MY NAILS FOR THE LONGEST AND EVERY SINCE I BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT MY NAILS FEEL STRONGER, MY CUTICLES LOOK NEATER AND OVERALL MY NAILS LOOK HEALTHY. ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS PRODUCT IS A KEEPER.</li>
            <li> Good product. Helps the cuticles.</li>
            <li> I like this -- used it faithfully for several weeks and stopped having painful hangnails.  Stopped because I got busy..the hangmails came back withiin two weeks.</li>
            <li> Word can&#x27;t say very good</li>
            <li> Works great for nails and definitely seems to help. It is a bit expensive, but the product is great.</li>
            <li> I read the review and decided to buy this one for enhancing my nails. I like the smell and it really makes my nails look nicer. I&#x27;m really addicted to nail colors so I change my nail color every week. Opi Avoplex nail replenishing oil helps to prevent my nails from drying out.</li>
            <li> Very smooth application - like butter. I used this after taking off nail polish to find the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; on the nail that the polish leaves behind. It worked to make the nail healthy again. I trust OPI products.</li>
            <li> Bought this to add to my manicure regimen as the last step after the top coat. Works well to keep the polish looking fresh and chip-free. Smells surprisingly good. The only reason I rated it a 4 out of 5 is because I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s replenishing my cuticles.</li>
            <li> GREAT product to &amp;#34;moisturize&amp;#34; your cuticles to prevent &amp;#34;hang nails&#x27;.  Pls try this product.  OPI has great products.  Their nail polish is also great.</li>
            <li> gets rid of rough hang nails and makes your nails look fabulous&lt;br /&gt;i tried it and liked it hope you do too</li>
            <li> This got good reviews and that is why I boyght it.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have washed my hands several times and the cuticles are still soft.  Wow!  this stuff is good.  Has a very nice pleasant smell.  OPI products are very dependable.  I have used them for years.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; great product!</li>
            <li> It smells great, but I only use it before I do the nail polish. Because it take a long time to massage it into the skin.</li>
            <li> It has helped strengthen my very weak nails.</li>
            <li> I like this product! Very moisturizing! Like all other OPI products, it&#x27;s top notch and I will order more in the future!</li>
            <li> After my acrylic nails came off i neglected to add moisture to them routinely. This has helped cut down on peeling and breakage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of OPI products and have used their Nail Envy polish for years.  I bought the brands Avoplex nail and cuticle replenishing oil because my cuticles were dry - in other words a mess - and I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day and will definitely be ordering more. Even better, the price was right with this seller.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My cuticles have always been in rough shape, so this is pretty much a miracle worker lol. I agree with a few other reviews in the fact that it comes off pretty easily, but I just apply this while watching TV to let it soak in and I&#x27;m good to go! I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> i really liked this product even using it for the first time. It keeps my nails so soft. recommend it to first users</li>
            <li> This is so nice, and my nails have never looked better. They just drink it in and loved to be pampered and massaged. The Opi Avolplex line is great for your nails and hands, and mine need all the help they can get</li>
            <li> I cannot honestly say how well the product worked.  It was gift for my daughter in law and even though it was packaged and wrapped in bubble wrap, the bottle had a small puncture hole and leaked all over the bubble wrap.  I have sent an email request to the distributor requesting either credit or replacement, but I have not received a response back.</li>
            <li> My hands become horribly dry in winter, so I bought this hoping it might help with cuticle dryness.  It has definitely helped improve dryness, though there&#x27;s still work to be done.  I&#x27;ll continue using this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  It&#x27;s worked wonders on my dry cuticles over the past few weeks, and I often forget using it even once per day (the reccommended is two).  The best part about it is it doesn&#x27;t stick to your finger tips once you&#x27;re finished rubbing the oil into your cuticles.  Just rub your fingers on a towel and you have no more mess!  Some of the oils I have tried take forever to wash/rub off.  I can leave it the bottle by my computer at work, remember to use it, and be able to start typing on the keyboard again in no time!</li>
            <li> I love this. I apply it at night before bed and just feels good going on. The scent is unique but I really like it.</li>
            <li> replenishing cuticle great, the best that i have every used.  would uses this again and tell every one that has dry cuticle nails to use this product</li>
            <li> perfect.  just what I needed.  ive just gotten into &amp;#34;taking care of my nails&amp;#34; and this stuff works miracles w/ dry pealing cuticles.  I love it, AND it smells really good! wasn&#x27;t expecting that</li>
            <li> I like this product because it seems to help my very dry cuticles. I live in Phoenix so have dry skin. This is very easy to use and I noticed a difference in my cuticles almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Great product for keeping nails and cuticles manageable.  The only way I can have any kind of nails without breakage  - use nightly before bed.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I thought this product sounded awesome.  I have dry cracked cuticles and I&#x27;m always chewing on the hangnails until they bleed.  It&#x27;s a terrible habit, I know.  I&#x27;ve been trying to quit for years but when I feel that dead, dry skin, I just can&#x27;t help myself.  I was hoping this product would end all of that and repair my dry cuticles.  I&#x27;ve been using every day for several weeks and I can&#x27;t tell a difference.  I put it on at bedtime and go to sleep and it feels a little oily.  The next morning, I really can&#x27;t tell a difference.  I go about my day with dry cuticles and catch myself chewing on them.  I repeat this process every day in hopes the cuticles will stop cracking with raised edges, but so far, this product has not corrected my problem.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  It is especially wonderful for nails and cuticle in the dry winter months although I use it all year round.</li>
            <li> I thought this  would be the end of my cuticle skin peeling. Not so lucky still  having the same problem..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of OPI nail products, but did not try this until I bought a promotional nail care kit a few years ago around Christmas a few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I follow a morning and night regime when using Avoplex. I put a drop on each cuticle ever morning and right before I go to bed at night. I massage it into the cuticle and that&#x27;s it. It keeps my cuticles healthy, supple, and strong. My cuticles and nails have never looked this good thanks to OPI. The coolest thing is it doesn&#x27;t take much time or effort to keep my nails looking really nice.</li>
            <li> Very good for my nails.</li>
            <li> very good for the nail and cuticle, use it and noticed the difference on my nails, great product, thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this directly from OPI at a beauty show after telling them about my nails.  I had deep ridges in them after a few rounds of IVF and taking hormone treatments.  My nails were brittle and would break and peel constantly, and I was becoming very discouraged.  They suggested Avoplex and buffing my nails, and it literally took ONE TIME and my nails are smooth and beautiful.  No ridges.  Be sure to buff them with a 280 buffer after you use this.</li>
            <li> Another best of OPI. Takes care of all cuticles (hands and feet) keeps them hydrated and clean looking! Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> So impressed with this, noticed better looking cuticles immediately! Well worth the money and will definitely purchase again, love it</li>
            <li> Recommended by a friend. This is a great price and I hope it will have a good effect on my neglected nails.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t used it much but it worked well the times I did use it on my nails..made nails clear and neat</li>
            <li> Bought this because of all the good reviews and I needed some help with my bad cuticles. I stuck with it for a while and really gave the oil a chance, but it just did nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a nice smell though.</li>
            <li> Smells good enough, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my nailbeds. It doesn&#x27;t even get absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought a jar of cosmetic-grade shea butter, been using that for months. That actually works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I think this is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I only recently started getting into nail care and manicures, but this produce is great. It works well and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite a few years now.  It has been wonderful for my nails.  Used to have split nails and now they are very strong.  I very highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> I find this easy to use&lt;br /&gt;My son took one of my bottles and has completely stopped biting his cuticles&lt;br /&gt;well worth the price</li>
            <li> I love the product itself. It keeps my cuticles moisturized for a long time and smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging, however is a big problem. I got my bottle less than a month ago and half of it is gone because the lid does not close properly and keeps spilling whenever I try to take it somewhere. It&#x27;s also not in a nail polish bottle with a brush as shown in the pictures. Mine came with a dropper instead. The lid is made of rubber so it does not close. Every time I try to close it all the way the lid slowly starts opening by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably buy this again but I&#x27;ll buy the to-go version as well so I don&#x27;t lose half the product when I want to take it somewhere.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and great smell but not sure it has made any difference in my nails or cuticules, they all lookk same an dhas been using it for over 1 week twice a day</li>
            <li> Excellent without being too greasy and thick that it doesn&#x27;t soak in. Makes nails stronger and they look great!</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, I started getting hang nails a lot.  I can&#x27;t really justify getting manicures, so I came to Amazon to find a solution.  I let this sit in my cart for about a week, deciding, and finally just bought it.  I don&#x27;t use it often, I don&#x27;t need to!  Maybe once a week and I haven&#x27;t seen a hangnail since. No more cracking at the corners, my pretty nails are back!</li>
            <li> This has a nice scent and works great. I use after I get out of the shower in the morning and it&#x27;s made a big difference so far.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday. Works awesome on my cuticles.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for dry and cracked cuticles.  It was recommended to me and I use it faithfully twice a day and it is sure working.  So glad to find something to solve my cuticle problem.  Get it from Amazon tho and not a Salon.</li>
            <li> wanted a dropper in it.</li>
            <li> I love this product - it helps keep the delicate skin around my fingernails from splitting and breaking and if I had reviewed when I had first started using the product, I would have given it five stars. However, the bottle is poorly designed and the suction tube reaches just over two-thirds down the bottle so you end up with a lot of oil you can&#x27;t use or have to dump out clumsily over your cuticles.</li>
            <li> I have had my OPI Avoplex Nail &amp; Cuticle Oil for a couple weeks and I can tell a big difference in my cuticles and nails. I am recommending this product to anyone and everyone that is considering purchasing a cuticle treatment oil. This product is awesome!!!! I love it! Some people may be apprehensive about an oil treatment, however, this is a non-greasy oil!It leaves your cuticles soft and it lasts. I can&#x27;t say enough about it! It is a 10 star product to me!</li>
            <li> Smells nice works great. Would tell other people about it.  After massaging it into nails it leaves a nice shine.</li>
            <li> the oil is excellent have this product for a long time</li>
            <li> Great Product, Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the product. The packaging is really nice and I love how it comes with a little pamphlet to read more about the product and ways on using it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also very pleased on how fast it was shipped and delivered to my house. I am looking forward to buying more products in the future with this seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I have problems with my cuticles in cold weather. I bought this because so many people said they loved it. It&#x27;s oily, it fades in a matter of minutes, mind you leaving the oily residue on your fingers. I probably would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Use with OPI Nail Envy ... winter is hard on my cuticles &amp; this product seems to help prevent the &amp;#34;grannies&amp;#34; which I normally have in the colder weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my cuticles, they are much softer and moist. They have more life in them. The product arrived as described. The shipping was with in shipping time frame.</li>
            <li> Only started using it.  Am not sure if it is helping my cuticles or nails yet.  Review is asked for too soon.</li>
            <li> It is always good to moisturize your cuticles and this product does a good job of it. In addition, I apply it a few minutes after using a top coat on my polish. Helps it dry more quickly.</li>
            <li> I normally use another brand of cuticle oil, but I thought I&#x27;d give this a try because OPI has great products.  I cannot believe the sickeningly sweet smell of it.  I do not understand the need for things like this to be heavily perfumed.  Smells like watermelon candy....yuck.  Anyway, the oil is okay other than that.  I would not purchase it again, as it is nothing special, and due to the sweet smell.  It did come packaged nicely from the vendor and in a timely manner.  $2 shipping was reasonable.  I love ordering through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Do exactly as the directions say (apply it twice a day&amp; massage it in). My cuticles look much nicer now, &amp; I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks so far.</li>
            <li> Say goodbye to dry cuticles!  This is the best cuticle oil available, I think.  And it smells soooooo good too!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and pleasant fragrance. However did not see expected&lt;br /&gt;cosmetic corrections or results after one .5 bottle use.</li>
            <li> I love OPI and their products.  This oil makes the cuticle feel so soft and replenishes nicely.  I will be using a lot more of this.</li>
            <li> I feel like this bottle will last me a while. The scent is great and the opi standard brush size make it amazing to apply. Honestly i feel that any oil can work for your nails. From avocado, grape, etc and you dont have to buy a brand name cuticle oil. I doubt i will reorder since there are so many other great oils that are cheaper and you can buy and do yourself.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my nails and cuticles soft especially during the Winter months. It needs to be used every day but it does keep my nails for splitting and breaking off.</li>
            <li> Another OPI hit. I was skeptical about this because I tend to use Avacado oil on my skin anyway, but I truly hate dry cuticles so I thought that I would l give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to my surprise I have this to be yet another winning product from OPI. I have been using it twice a day per the directions. It really seems to help, and this is only day 2. I have been using it in the morning and at night before I go to bed, and once during the day at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I guess that I will be buying more of this in the future!</li>
            <li> I decided to stop cutting my cuticles and this was just the thing to help me. I have been using it for just 3 days and I can already see a big difference. my cuticles were dry, white, flaky and gross and I woke up this morning they are looking so much better! I used it every morning and night before bed in the past 2 days, today I actually have it sitting on my desk so that I can apply it right after I was my hands. it smells great too! I would recommend this product and buy again</li>
            <li> great help for my very dry nails. . .</li>
            <li> Nice smelling cuticle oil that absorbs fast. What more can a girl as for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every night &amp; it&#x27;s definitely helped with the condition of my nails &amp; cuticles.</li>
            <li> This is a good cuticle oil. It works and makes cuticles smooth. The only com I have to it is that it wipes off pretty easy. I put it on before bed or in the morning and it doesn&#x27;t last long. But I have definitely seen a big difference in my cuticles since using this. I would buy again, just wish it had more staying power.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years and it totally makes my nails grown when they won&#x27;t on their own.  Highly recommend and I will keep using it!</li>
            <li> my poor cuticles, so dry and abused, i use badger balm and that works, but its greasy so i can&#x27;t always use it. this is a great in between. i use it daily, already noticed a huge difference. as usual, OPI knocks it out of the park.</li>
            <li> As many others have said, this is a great product!  I&#x27;m over 40 and noticed that my nails just don&#x27;t have the same luster of my youth.  Invested in this, cuticles are so much nicer now with this simple, aromatic, and quick-absorbing oil.  I opted for this full bottle size as it&#x27;s easy to apply like polish, just a quick dab on each finger cuticle and rub it in.  Fabulous!</li>
            <li> If your cuticles are dry, cracked, peeling, bleeding, etc. you NEED this!!! My cuticles honestly were so bad I was too embarrassed to get a manicure! As soon as I would get one, a week later they would be back to terrible. I didn&#x27;t even think to use cuticle oil until I found reviews on this product. Well, the day I ordered it I put in on and could tell a difference by the end of the day! It says to use twice a day. I know others were saying, &amp;#34;what about when you wash your hands?&amp;#34; but this really soaks into the cuticle skin and repair happens almost instantly. Of course, the second time should be before bed when you can achieve maximum healing. My cuticles are finally starting to look normal, I have no idea how this works so well but it does. Only been using this about 4 days and already can tell this is my cuticles saving grace. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I was so dissapointed with this -- I have allergies to scents and did not know how strong an aroma this had.  I cannot use it without my eyes weeping and my nose running.  To be honest I don&#x27;t even know if it works since I had to remove it immediately.  :-(</li>
            <li> i use this after i take off my old shellac polish - it works great to bring my nails &amp; cuticles back to their original look.  there isn&#x27;t really a smell to it to me and it does wonders for my nails.  i haven&#x27;t had my nails NOT done since christmas time (when i got my UV system) and my nails are still super strong and i&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s because of the oil.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cuticle oil. It works great! I use my hands a lot - baking and cooking - and my cuticles are often dry, so this product is perfect for me and works much better for me than Sally Hansen has.</li>
            <li> I bought this Oil to see if it would make a difference in the condition of my nails and cuticles. They are in very bad shape. This did NOT help  the way the reviews said it would. You would have to keep putting it on your nails and cuticles every ten minutes. I always used it at night so it would have a chance to work while not using my hands. Next morning my nails were just as dry and brittle and before. Would NOT recommend it for that reason.</li>
            <li> This oil smells really nice and it also helps your cuticle recover. I try to use this every day. I even recommend this to my clients.</li>
            <li> Softens cuticles and delivers moisture to the area around the nails. I like to use it after having the manicure done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different cuticle oils - some cheaper and some more expensive, and I have to say, they all kind of feel about the same to me. I use it after I suck all the moisture out of my cuticles with acetone (and use a cuticle cream nightly). This OPI variety works really nicely - it immediately replenishes the skin around my nails and has a nice smell to boot. I do think you could probably find something comparable for a couple bucks cheaper, but this is a good oil.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product as well as how great it heals my rough cuticles. I probably put it on every couple of days yet my cuticle looks amazing! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i use this product for years. It&#x27;s great! and good price. i even carry this with me, when i go travel.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry cuticles, more so than any guy I&#x27;ve ever known.  I went to get a manicure one day and asked about it and was recommended OPI&#x27;s Avoplex in the tube w/ built in brush form ... It was &#x27;okay&#x27;.  I got this because I couldn&#x27;t think of what I used to use that worked for me.  This works for maybe 2 hours before I&#x27;m dried out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally remembered what I used to use; and it&#x27;s great...  If this doesn&#x27;t do it for you; try Aveda Cuticle Control ... I don&#x27;t see it on Amazon right now to include a product link, but here&#x27;s the product information from Aveda:  [...]</li>
            <li> This is the Best Cuticle Oil i have found ! and it Smellls wonderful ! if good smelling stuff like this was in more salons , people would not say how BAD they smell ! i LOVE this Product !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go to when my cuticles look rough...makes that ugliness disappear, and it smells lovely. This bottle will last a LONG time.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cuticle oil. It&#x27;s slightly foody, perhaps vanilla? But it brushes on with a light, non-greasy feel, and the brush is OPI&#x27;s normal thick brush, which aids application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really moisturizes! And I am positively reinforced by the pleasant smell, I just want to keep putting it on :)</li>
            <li> should have bought the real solar oil. The reviews are right, it smells great, but seems to disappear the second you wash your hands.</li>
            <li> works great, packaged shipped very carefully. the oil works doesn&#x27;t cause lifting to your polish or acrylics. just apply it regularly like it states and you will see an improvement in your cuticles. I do clean my cuticles and remove the extra dead layers so in conjunction with this product my manicures always look neatly done! highly recommend</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve found a decent cuticle oil.  It&#x27;d probably work better if I used it more consistenly, but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine when you first put it on and massage it around but within an hour it&#x27;s like it never touched your cuticles.  Will not likely buy again.  :(</li>
            <li> I tend to wear a lot of nail polishes for which The nails become dry and lifeless. This cuticle oil really helped me to replenish try nails. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the best cuticle treatment on the market.  I would not be without it.</li>
            <li> Applying it doesn&#x27;t take long, neither does waiting for it to dry so you can use your hands again.</li>
            <li> I use this daily on my cuticles all year round, it replenishes your dry cuticles and makes them look refreshed and beautiful.  During the winter months I sometimes will apply a little during the morning.  Otherwise you won&#x27;t regret purchasing OPI replenishing oil.</li>
            <li> Just buy this, what a steal!! Almost 20$ at salons, and pretty much worth it!! Great smelling, absorbs fast. You get a giant .5 oz bottle. This is my favorite cuticle oil!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this daily for my cuticles and I love it. After rubbing it into my cuticles, I rub it over my hands for added moisturizing. Bonus, it smells really, really good. Oh, and it works great on my cuticles. I never have them cut and don&#x27;t need to do it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I love how it makes my fingers and toes feel. I even rub it on the calloused area on my feet. Like the smell, too!</li>
            <li> My nails are extremely dry from being in the pool 4 days a week, so I tried this product. I don&#x27;t think it works any better than just plain old vitamin E oil or even any vegetable oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I received my item thank you!</li>
            <li> So that you get the complete picture: I work with my hands and I have very, very dry and hard cuticles. I must tend to them every day. Therefore, I require a product that delivers the best results. Opi Avoplex does not work for me. The consistency is too thin and because of this it wears off quickly. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. It&#x27;s almost as if it doesn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> My nails are a mess from thyroid disease . This has made a difference. You have to use it daily. My cuticles are dry, but, my nails have grown.</li>
            <li> I normally love your nail care products and am happy you have embraced new formulations in the polish leaving out some of the bad stuff...  but what up with this cuticle oil?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tocotrienol, Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Oleic Acid, Ascorbyl Palmitate (Vitamin C), Tocopherol, BHT, Methylparaben, Parfum/Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Benzyl Salicylate, Geraniol, Hexylcinnamal, Hydroxyisohexyl 3 Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Hydroxycitronellal, Butylphenyl Methypropional, Limonene, Linalool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;come on.  it is 2013 already.  you can make stable forumulations without the cancer causing parabens and other toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> This cuticle oil is great and smells fantastic!! Almost as good as CND for helping with the nasty dry hangnails I get.</li>
            <li> This cuticle oil won&#x27;t lift your nail enamel. I use it at night before bed. My nails are finally strong enough to grow out to an attractive length.</li>
            <li> helps my cuticles stay looking nice</li>
            <li> Working great so far. Love the light scent also.</li>
            <li> This OPI does miracles.  Use it on fingernails and toenails.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps a manicure looking new and fingers looking younger.&lt;br /&gt;The bonus is what it does for toes!  No more rough skin around toenails,&lt;br /&gt;Actual toenails look healthier, whiter and so much healthier.  Prevents&lt;br /&gt;ingrown toenails as it keeps the skin so soft the nail grow correctly.&lt;br /&gt;I use in morning and before bed.  Just dab alittle on with polish brush&lt;br /&gt;and rub in if you have time or just dab and forget.  Not greasy in your shoes.&lt;br /&gt;Great smell, but very light.&lt;br /&gt;Will ALWAYS USE !!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the cuticles.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> I was ordering nail polish &amp; decided to add this to my order.  This was delivered days sooner than projected- love that.  This product is really good- I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  Great product- even better seller.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Granted, I have nothing to compare it to, since I&#x27;ve never used cuticle oil before and this was my first time purchasing it, but wow, Opi Avoplex is amazing stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had a hard time with my nails. I&#x27;m one of those people who constantly is chewing on their nails. That, and my hands have always been on the dry side. Since I&#x27;ve been getting into nail art though and subsequently have been trying to take better care of my nails, I decided to purchase this and give it a shot. I&#x27;m soooo glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, it smells good! All the different oils and what-not have a very pleasant scent to them. Going by the directions, I started using it twice a day with about a drop per nail. I let it soak in a bit first before rubbing it in and, to get the excess oil off my finger tips, I rub it into the back of my hands. It works very well, especially if you&#x27;re one of those people who doesn&#x27;t like oily things on your fingers; lets you use them without getting it all over something, ha-ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After maybe a week of using this (probably less) I noticed how well it was working. My fingers weren&#x27;t dry anymore and my skin was a lot softer. My cuticles were pushed back nice and neat and it made painting my nails 10 times easier. I&#x27;ve seriously never seen my cuticles looking so healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I love this stuff and I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it! Though it&#x27;s a bit pricey to me, it really does work so well that it&#x27;s completely and totally worth it. I highly recommend this to anyone having trouble with their hands the way I was, it works great! :D</li>
            <li> Wintertime dries my cuticles so bad when I put on gloves the cuticles actually snag on the material and tear even bleed in some case. OUCH! This daily treatment has done wonders and the aforementioned no longer happens after 3 weeks of continued use. I use 3 times a day before work, during lunch and before bed time. The oil soaks in rather quickly,no residue or stains. In the weeks I&#x27;ve been doing this treatment I have not worn any polish. Since my cuticles look so much better I may polish this week and see how it holds up. Now I&#x27;m curious about the rest of the Avoplex line of products.I will keep this in my nail kit hopefully this may be a preventive to the jagged cuticle conundrum :)</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse or more painful than dry cuticles that tear. Using this oil helps to replenish oil in an area that is depleated due to nail products and every day wear and tear. amazon carries an amazing selection of various OPI products sold by other vendors who are very reliable.</li>
            <li> This is what my nail salon uses. A little bit goes a long way so it is worth the price. Really works! And I can use often at night before going to bed.</li>
            <li> First of all I have to say about the smell!its amazing  . Secondly it does what it claims for sure. i apply it afer i clean my cuticles and painted my nails, also it makes my nail polish dry faster</li>
            <li> I have dry cuticles and I&#x27;ve been on the search to find something that will actually keep them moisturized.  The search continues.</li>
