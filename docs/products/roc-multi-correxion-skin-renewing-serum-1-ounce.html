            <li>The results are incredible and I LOVE this stuff.</li>

            <li>My &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; are most gone after 1 month, and my skin looks great...</li>
            <li>All aspects of amazon and the Roc product iam very pleased with,</li>
            <li>I guess I have been using this product for over a month and love it!</li>
            <li>But this product works amazingly.  </li>
            <li>OK..I never write reviews but this product is so amazing I have to share.  </li>
            <li>This cream did amazing work on improving my complexion.  </li>
            <li>One day my husband smiled at me...</li>
            <li>This seems like a good serum - I do feel a tingling sensation, but not painful.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super!!</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m breaking out much more,</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff and will buy another bottle. :)</li>
            <li>will let you know more about this soon</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Love how it works - fades the spots and brightens the skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for years and now its gone.</li>
            <li>I am hoping I get used to it because it really does work great.</li>
            <li>Ok soo I get my bottle and the person scratched the expiration date off.</li>
            <li>Lovely muted scent.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product...</li>
            <li>it looks more \\&quot;alive\\&quot;- Friends and family</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from Lancôme,  Clinique, Estée Lauder, and this has been simply the best for me.</li>
            <li>I bought this product on a whim because Oprah told me that I need more retinol.</li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve talked to one aesthetician who said she won&#x27;t even wax customers that use RetinA (a more potent version of Retinol) because of this risk.  </li>
            <li>being able to get my roc beauty products from you has allowed me to afford to keep using the Roc products.  </li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>Maybe someone else will have better results.</li>
            <li>I have used this treatment for over 2 years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I had my doubts when I ordered the serum - read their claims - they sound too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>The top surface of your skin will tear more easily.</li>
            <li>the skin of a pubescent teen and the eyes of a wise over-worked octogenarian, all at the age of 23!</li>
            <li>Delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>This product has a scent that is a bit strong for me; however, it has not stopped me from using the product.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The antigravity serum has a beautiful smell and instantly lifted my jaw line and neck and stayed like that all day.  </li>
            <li>It has made me fall in love wid my skin for d first time :)</li>
            <li>Probably needs more time to give adequate review.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with how light this lotion is, it penetrates quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to use it right around my eyes with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>The most amazing thing is the skin on my upper chest, which was getting papery, is plump again and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to friends interested in my skin care routine, and have been using it for the better part of a year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine now but still, I looked like a super villian for about a week.</li>
            <li>In the morning, once its dry, I apply a lite covering of finishing powder and feel like I look great for my age.</li>
            <li>This bottle should last me a good while.  </li>
            <li>All the commercials are true.  </li>
            <li>I did  not expect much from this, but I am SO glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Fair price, I will definitely reorder when I run out.</li>
            <li>Overall I am impressed and will buy a second bottle.</li>
            <li>This is outstanding skin cream, making your tired skin seem bright and moist even after many ours wearing.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to minimize dark undereye circles.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent product and I prefer it to the cream version because I believe the pump keeps the retinol serum more sealed and fresh.  </li>
            <li>After using the whole bottle, this stuff made almost all of the scars go away!!</li>
            <li>either way, this is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>When i took it out I noticed thumb prints on the silver part near the top like someone had handled it.</li>
            <li>Buy it, use it - definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This trade off is 100% worth it.</li>
            <li>I have ordered several RoC products and am loving them.  </li>
            <li>and I can already see reduction in smile lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li>I have gone through many different types of facial skin care regimes and never received as many compliments and felt better about my skin than when using Roc products.</li>
            <li>The first 3 days it did not help at all with my dark marks, but it had AMAZING affects on my under eye!</li>
            <li>Be careful with sun exposure and/or use sunscreen, because it makes you burn more easily.</li>
            <li>So I later purchased this product from a different seller, fresh, and it works great.</li>
            <li>Really like the \\&quot;serum\\&quot; and glad to have a fast and reasonably priced place to buy it.</li>
            <li>the fact that my new skin now freely roams this earth without any cover up whatsoever is a sensation I assumed I would never experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in a few days and after a couple months I couldnt be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy with what it&#x27;s doing so far, and maybe it will completely fade away after a few more bottles, I&#x27;ll just have to wait and see.</li>
            <li>I am 26 years old have extremely fine lines, and I would like to keep it that way.</li>
            <li>I noticed results after I finished the first bottle.</li>
            <li>I have had a severe allergic reaction this product within 36 hours of first use.</li>
            <li>at first it was up to 4 plus a week, but now its like 6-8 plus, which stays 1-2 weeks, yikes, and still I see no difference, the cream is peachy orange, and smells of chemicles, which took some getting used to,</li>
            <li>Many of my friends all feel the same way.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Roc products since they were first introduced.</li>
            <li>pregnancy!&amp;#34;) and figured they would NEVER go away.</li>
            <li>My  husband and kids touch my face and comment on how soft and smooth my face is.  </li>
            <li>I use this product as a first layer on my face when I get out of the shower in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Wish it did more for the emerging brown spots, but I&#x27;m using a different product for that</li>
            <li>It smells, which I vowed at first to overlook if the product seemed to be working.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first time using this product.</li>
            <li>Within a few weeks I saw fewer lines (they&#x27;re still visible, but noticeably finer), more even skin tone, and the texture of my skin became fantastic -- very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Generally clear, shiny on the forehead and nose, dry on the cheeks, with an occasional cystic breakout from hormones and the requisite fine lines that come with age and good living.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or weird, smells pleasant, and when you wake up you have great-looking skin.</li>
            <li>and I would also suggest only using the serum 2x a week at first to make sure you are not too sensitive.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m 28, have moderate acne scars with some collagen loss from scarring, and now am showing fine lines as well.</li>
            <li>I bought this product a few days ago, and I must say that after 3 days of use my skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Started using this in May and find very pleasing results.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really tell if it helped my skin or not, but it didn&#x27;t seem to harm it.</li>
            <li>Roc really works.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very baby powder in fragrance.  </li>
            <li>After my pregnancy I had lots of sun spots/brown spots on my face (thanks, &amp;#34;mask of</li>
            <li>and I guess that is the real issue isnt it?</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>I could not get passed the feeling to see any real results.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much for a super facial serum!</li>
            <li>My face, neck and chest are full of red, itchy lumps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I can honestly review how well it works yet.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t work any miracles or anything, but so far i really like how much it plumps up my skin and makes my pores less visible, as promised.</li>
            <li>Please be sure to test this product on a small area first.</li>
            <li>I have been using this most days along with the night deep wrinkle cream occasionally as well as the eye cream</li>
            <li>And the auto-ship makes it so simple to keep it on hand at a better price that I can find locally, when I can find it.</li>
            <li>When you first begin to use it, it does burn a little and cause some redness, but this goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference to my skin because I think they sent me an old, dated product.</li>
            <li>some serum had spilled out and was dried around the top  </li>
            <li>My pores look smaller, my skin feels softer, my laugh lines have softened to the point that I don&#x27;t even notice them anymore.</li>
            <li>I come right back.</li>
            <li>4 months later, still breaking out with unusual large pimples,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product on and off for about two years, and every time I switch to try something new</li>
            <li>, goes to work on dark spots and makes my skin look and feel smooth and younger-looking.  </li>
            <li>Get the Lot# from your seller first and check it on [...] to see the actual expiration date (not noted on the product).</li>
            <li>love this serum does not clog my pores like other brands, just wish i could get in a bigger size</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and was trying something new recommended by a friend.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty clear the only &amp;#34;face saving&amp;#34; solution is plastic surgery.</li>
            <li>No other product I&#x27;ve tried that claims to \\&quot;penetrate\\&quot; really does, and the research I&#x27;ve done supports the idea that Retinol/RetinA is the only skin care substance capable of doing this.</li>
            <li>ROC Multi-Correxion Skin Renewing Serum has really made a difference in the appearance of my skin in only a week or so.  </li>
            <li>This product makes the lines nearly disappear, and I use it as a preventative measure as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think anything over the counter will ever make them completely disappear</li>
            <li>The reason I mention this is because if you have really sensitive skin this may not be something you want to use.</li>
            <li>I am 66 years old with the aging face that is a fact of life.</li>
            <li>I have been religiously using Boots No. 7 serum Intense for 3 years.  </li>
            <li>The scars are fading away, and the redness that I had become used to is completely gone.</li>
            <li>so I trade off by using my old Cetaphil moisturizer in the mornings to keep my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30s with combination skin --</li>
            <li>I took a before picture and the lines in my face are much lighter and not as deep.  </li>
            <li>I really had low expectations but what a change!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product did nothing as far as I could see.</li>
            <li>Its claim to lighten dark spots is a true claim, because already I can see a difference.  </li>
            <li>I am going to work on getting older as gracefully as possible.</li>
            <li>A few years ago, after turning 30, I decided I should take preventive action on my face, tried Garnier, and Neutrogena, saw no difference, decided to give this a try, another reviewer did complain about breaking out, so I gave this a go, after a day or 2 I started breaking out, with unusual large pimples, now</li>
            <li>Has only slightly faded a couple brown spots, but skins seems smooth w/smaller pores.</li>
            <li>a wonderful mix of oily but somehow also very very dry-likely due to years of product usage to control what were terrible skin problems (for real everyone, acne is no joke).</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and was actually prepared for some sort of side effects, but had zero issues.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product only 2 weeks, i can tell the difference, my skin getting smoother and the spots a little bit lighter, for the price, it really worth it!</li>
            <li>Better than the more expensive products that I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>Barely usable.</li>
            <li>I had a deep wrinkle between my eyebrows that is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and it has improved my overall appearance of my skin without make up.</li>
            <li>apparently this can be used both morning and night</li>
            <li>Since I started using ROC Multi-Correxion Skin Renewing Serum last year, my 70-year old face has noticeably improved in firmness and smoothness.  </li>
            <li>You can barely see anything now.</li>
            <li>I was using a very popular face wash system, and I broke out so bad.</li>
            <li>so far I really like this product.seen a little change in my skin.and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Have not really seen much improvement to erasing deep wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I have two obvious wrinkles on my forehead and within a week of using this one had completely disappeared and the other was barely visible.</li>
            <li>Good product, bad merchant.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Love how it works - fades the spots and brightens the skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for years and now its gone.</li>
            <li> I am hoping I get used to it because it really does work great.</li>
            <li> Ok soo I get my bottle and the person scratched the expiration date off.</li>
            <li> Lovely muted scent.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product...</li>
            <li> it looks more \\&quot;alive\\&quot;- Friends and family</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from Lancôme,  Clinique, Estée Lauder, and this has been simply the best for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim because Oprah told me that I need more retinol.</li>
            <li> okay...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve talked to one aesthetician who said she won&#x27;t even wax customers that use RetinA (a more potent version of Retinol) because of this risk.  </li>
            <li> being able to get my roc beauty products from you has allowed me to afford to keep using the Roc products.  </li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> Maybe someone else will have better results.</li>
            <li> I have used this treatment for over 2 years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I had my doubts when I ordered the serum - read their claims - they sound too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> The top surface of your skin will tear more easily.</li>
            <li> the skin of a pubescent teen and the eyes of a wise over-worked octogenarian, all at the age of 23!</li>
            <li> Delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> This product has a scent that is a bit strong for me; however, it has not stopped me from using the product.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The antigravity serum has a beautiful smell and instantly lifted my jaw line and neck and stayed like that all day.  </li>
            <li> It has made me fall in love wid my skin for d first time :)</li>
            <li> Probably needs more time to give adequate review.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with how light this lotion is, it penetrates quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to use it right around my eyes with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> The most amazing thing is the skin on my upper chest, which was getting papery, is plump again and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to friends interested in my skin care routine, and have been using it for the better part of a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine now but still, I looked like a super villian for about a week.</li>
            <li> In the morning, once its dry, I apply a lite covering of finishing powder and feel like I look great for my age.</li>
            <li> This bottle should last me a good while.  </li>
            <li> All the commercials are true.  </li>
            <li> I did  not expect much from this, but I am SO glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Fair price, I will definitely reorder when I run out.</li>
            <li> Overall I am impressed and will buy a second bottle.</li>
            <li> This is outstanding skin cream, making your tired skin seem bright and moist even after many ours wearing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to minimize dark undereye circles.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent product and I prefer it to the cream version because I believe the pump keeps the retinol serum more sealed and fresh.  </li>
            <li> After using the whole bottle, this stuff made almost all of the scars go away!!</li>
            <li> either way, this is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> When i took it out I noticed thumb prints on the silver part near the top like someone had handled it.</li>
            <li> Buy it, use it - definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This trade off is 100% worth it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered several RoC products and am loving them.  </li>
            <li> and I can already see reduction in smile lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have gone through many different types of facial skin care regimes and never received as many compliments and felt better about my skin than when using Roc products.</li>
            <li> The first 3 days it did not help at all with my dark marks, but it had AMAZING affects on my under eye!</li>
            <li> Be careful with sun exposure and/or use sunscreen, because it makes you burn more easily.</li>
            <li> So I later purchased this product from a different seller, fresh, and it works great.</li>
            <li> Really like the \\&quot;serum\\&quot; and glad to have a fast and reasonably priced place to buy it.</li>
            <li> the fact that my new skin now freely roams this earth without any cover up whatsoever is a sensation I assumed I would never experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in a few days and after a couple months I couldnt be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy with what it&#x27;s doing so far, and maybe it will completely fade away after a few more bottles, I&#x27;ll just have to wait and see.</li>
            <li> I am 26 years old have extremely fine lines, and I would like to keep it that way.</li>
            <li> I noticed results after I finished the first bottle.</li>
            <li> I have had a severe allergic reaction this product within 36 hours of first use.</li>
            <li> at first it was up to 4 plus a week, but now its like 6-8 plus, which stays 1-2 weeks, yikes, and still I see no difference, the cream is peachy orange, and smells of chemicles, which took some getting used to,</li>
            <li> Many of my friends all feel the same way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Roc products since they were first introduced.</li>
            <li> pregnancy!&amp;#34;) and figured they would NEVER go away.</li>
            <li> My  husband and kids touch my face and comment on how soft and smooth my face is.  </li>
            <li> I use this product as a first layer on my face when I get out of the shower in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Wish it did more for the emerging brown spots, but I&#x27;m using a different product for that</li>
            <li> It smells, which I vowed at first to overlook if the product seemed to be working.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first time using this product.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks I saw fewer lines (they&#x27;re still visible, but noticeably finer), more even skin tone, and the texture of my skin became fantastic -- very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Generally clear, shiny on the forehead and nose, dry on the cheeks, with an occasional cystic breakout from hormones and the requisite fine lines that come with age and good living.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or weird, smells pleasant, and when you wake up you have great-looking skin.</li>
            <li> and I would also suggest only using the serum 2x a week at first to make sure you are not too sensitive.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m 28, have moderate acne scars with some collagen loss from scarring, and now am showing fine lines as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few days ago, and I must say that after 3 days of use my skin looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Started using this in May and find very pleasing results.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really tell if it helped my skin or not, but it didn&#x27;t seem to harm it.</li>
            <li> Roc really works.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very baby powder in fragrance.  </li>
            <li> After my pregnancy I had lots of sun spots/brown spots on my face (thanks, &amp;#34;mask of</li>
            <li> and I guess that is the real issue isnt it?</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li> I could not get passed the feeling to see any real results.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much for a super facial serum!</li>
            <li> My face, neck and chest are full of red, itchy lumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can honestly review how well it works yet.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t work any miracles or anything, but so far i really like how much it plumps up my skin and makes my pores less visible, as promised.</li>
            <li> Please be sure to test this product on a small area first.</li>
            <li> I have been using this most days along with the night deep wrinkle cream occasionally as well as the eye cream</li>
            <li> And the auto-ship makes it so simple to keep it on hand at a better price that I can find locally, when I can find it.</li>
            <li> When you first begin to use it, it does burn a little and cause some redness, but this goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference to my skin because I think they sent me an old, dated product.</li>
            <li> some serum had spilled out and was dried around the top  </li>
            <li> My pores look smaller, my skin feels softer, my laugh lines have softened to the point that I don&#x27;t even notice them anymore.</li>
            <li> I come right back.</li>
            <li> 4 months later, still breaking out with unusual large pimples,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on and off for about two years, and every time I switch to try something new</li>
            <li> , goes to work on dark spots and makes my skin look and feel smooth and younger-looking.  </li>
            <li> Get the Lot# from your seller first and check it on [...] to see the actual expiration date (not noted on the product).</li>
            <li> love this serum does not clog my pores like other brands, just wish i could get in a bigger size</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was trying something new recommended by a friend.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty clear the only &amp;#34;face saving&amp;#34; solution is plastic surgery.</li>
            <li> No other product I&#x27;ve tried that claims to \\&quot;penetrate\\&quot; really does, and the research I&#x27;ve done supports the idea that Retinol/RetinA is the only skin care substance capable of doing this.</li>
            <li> ROC Multi-Correxion Skin Renewing Serum has really made a difference in the appearance of my skin in only a week or so.  </li>
            <li> This product makes the lines nearly disappear, and I use it as a preventative measure as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anything over the counter will ever make them completely disappear</li>
            <li> The reason I mention this is because if you have really sensitive skin this may not be something you want to use.</li>
            <li> I am 66 years old with the aging face that is a fact of life.</li>
            <li> I have been religiously using Boots No. 7 serum Intense for 3 years.  </li>
            <li> The scars are fading away, and the redness that I had become used to is completely gone.</li>
            <li> so I trade off by using my old Cetaphil moisturizer in the mornings to keep my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s with combination skin --</li>
            <li> I took a before picture and the lines in my face are much lighter and not as deep.  </li>
            <li> I really had low expectations but what a change!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing as far as I could see.</li>
            <li> Its claim to lighten dark spots is a true claim, because already I can see a difference.  </li>
            <li> I am going to work on getting older as gracefully as possible.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, after turning 30, I decided I should take preventive action on my face, tried Garnier, and Neutrogena, saw no difference, decided to give this a try, another reviewer did complain about breaking out, so I gave this a go, after a day or 2 I started breaking out, with unusual large pimples, now</li>
            <li> Has only slightly faded a couple brown spots, but skins seems smooth w/smaller pores.</li>
            <li> a wonderful mix of oily but somehow also very very dry-likely due to years of product usage to control what were terrible skin problems (for real everyone, acne is no joke).</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and was actually prepared for some sort of side effects, but had zero issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product only 2 weeks, i can tell the difference, my skin getting smoother and the spots a little bit lighter, for the price, it really worth it!</li>
            <li> Better than the more expensive products that I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Barely usable.</li>
            <li> I had a deep wrinkle between my eyebrows that is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and it has improved my overall appearance of my skin without make up.</li>
            <li> apparently this can be used both morning and night</li>
            <li> Since I started using ROC Multi-Correxion Skin Renewing Serum last year, my 70-year old face has noticeably improved in firmness and smoothness.  </li>
            <li> You can barely see anything now.</li>
            <li> I was using a very popular face wash system, and I broke out so bad.</li>
            <li> so far I really like this product.seen a little change in my skin.and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Have not really seen much improvement to erasing deep wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I have two obvious wrinkles on my forehead and within a week of using this one had completely disappeared and the other was barely visible.</li>
            <li> Good product, bad merchant.</li>
            <li> I usually suffer from minor skin problems like huge pores, occasional pimples, uneven skintone, a deep wrinkle between brows</li>
            <li> Not sure if  I can tell much diffence.</li>
            <li> There is slight stinging sensation the first few times I tried it</li>
            <li> Yes, it was an awkward moment, but I was so glad I listened to my gut and gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> But all of this is really minor.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t care for that feeling all day long.  </li>
            <li> In the long term, it helps me avoid breakouts and definitely reduces acne scarring because it encourages cell turnover and actually exfoliates down to a deeper level of skin.</li>
            <li> And the other day I was dining with my husband and our regular waitress</li>
            <li> Have tried other &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; products occasionally</li>
            <li> For the price, this ROC product does about the same thing I have paid 4 times for with other products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I cannot take the bad side effects and more, maybe this is for someone in their 50&#x27;s and up who show their age, or smoker who premature age, or for those who worship the sunn at all costs, this is clearly not for me, and as for me I still get carded when I buy drinks, so</li>
            <li> bottle was half open  </li>
            <li> Artificial, strong fragrances are IRRITANTS.</li>
            <li> I am the type of person that likes instant results and I almost gave up on this after the first week when I didn&#x27;t see any, plus the fact that I think this stuff stinks (like self tanner), but thank heavens I have stuck with it because I&#x27;m starting to notice my brown spots fading.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding on the open market.</li>
            <li> update when the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> Just be careful about putting either one of the products close to the skin around your eyes</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so it is something I won&#x27;t have to buy every month.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43 and have virtually no wrinkles due in part to this product.</li>
            <li> It was obviously expired so I&#x27;m not sure if this prevents the chemical from working or not.</li>
            <li> The other thing to remember is to not WAX YOUR FACE while using Retinol products.</li>
            <li> caveat-using it every day made my skin a little dry</li>
            <li> Not only do my eyes look way less tired and aged, my skin and complexion are completely different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately 3 weeks and can see a dramatic improvement in the look of fine lines, dark circles, and skin texture.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to see but the expiration date is stamped on the bottom, with no color, only indented.</li>
            <li> After a month of using this, the dark spots on my face are fading away.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for acne dark marks and under eye swelling and darkness.</li>
            <li> so the jury is still out on dark spot correction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and I MAY be addicted to ROC products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel just sick that the antigravity serum is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> My lines may be slightly less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I also noticed it expires in April of this year, which gives me basically a month and a half to use it.</li>
            <li> I randomly chose this product along with the deep wrinkle night cream and the eye cream because I wanted to see if I could control the wrinkles that have been starting for form around my sleep-deprived eyes (what!</li>
            <li> I had some sensitivity issues a few months back and was unable to keep using them but have since reordered two of their products because I just can&#x27;t get enough!  </li>
            <li> One thing I&#x27;d like to mention is that when applied my skin became slightly warm/tingly, and a little itchy but that went away after a hour.</li>
            <li> and they make my skin get a little bumpy on my forehead</li>
            <li> Skin feels smoother, but very slight wrinkles that I started with are still there.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would at least make a little</li>
            <li> it just takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> not sure about this yet.  </li>
            <li> -- can&#x27;t get this product for less, delivered, anywhere!!  </li>
            <li> My skin is firmer, clearer, I hardly get any pimples</li>
            <li> I m in my late 20s with combinatioin skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My Olay just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for me anymore, and with 5 kids I really can&#x27;t afford an expensive regime.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I am skeptical of all &amp;#34;renewing serums&amp;#34; and anti-aging products.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s suffocating, given that it&#x27;s used on the face.  </li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will never know if this product works.</li>
            <li> Anyway, being the desperate 40-something woman I decided to try this product.  </li>
            <li> This is why drugstore brands get the bad rap they do.</li>
            <li> no difference in skin at all although price wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too painful.</li>
            <li> This product has a sickening smell that you would not want anyone to associate with you and did not lift at all like it was supposed to.  </li>
            <li> and i have not been disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very  disappointed.</li>
            <li> simply awful  </li>
            <li> it tastes terrible!</li>
            <li> It was the worst it had ever been!</li>
            <li> This smells horrible</li>
            <li> However, after three days it burns my face and under eyes HORRIBLY when I apply it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I m in my late 20s with combinatioin skin. I usually suffer from minor skin problems like huge pores, occasional pimples, uneven skintone, a deep wrinkle between brows but this product has resolved all my skin issues. My skin is firmer, clearer, I hardly get any pimples nd d wrinkle on my firehead is almost gone,!,, I have using this product for 3 months now nd I use it once every day at night. It has made me fall in love wid my skin for d first time :)</li>
            <li> Skin feels smoother, but very slight wrinkles that I started with are still there.  They are only visible to me when I put on makeup, but they ARE there.  I had hoped ROC would have eliminated them after the four weeks.  I would not reccomend nor discourage anyone from buying this product.</li>
            <li> This is my third order of this product. I love the way it makes my skin look. I noticed results after I finished the first bottle. It&#x27;s a great product. I used to sell department store products that didn&#x27;t give the same results. I would recommend this to others. I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer; gets skin healthy looking and keeps it that way!  very good value for the money (esp on amazon auto ship!!) -- can&#x27;t get this product for less, delivered, anywhere!!  it&#x27;s super!!</li>
            <li> This seems like a good serum - I do feel a tingling sensation, but not painful. My lines may be slightly less noticeable. I do not notice any fading of my age spots, but maybe that will happen with time. It&#x27;s a good price and I will finish this bottle and then another before I make any changes.</li>
            <li> Seemed &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;.  Barely usable.</li>
            <li> Please be sure to test this product on a small area first. I have had a severe allergic reaction this product within 36 hours of first use. My face, neck and chest are full of red, itchy lumps. If I could give it no stars I would.</li>
            <li> ROC Multi-Correxion Skin Renewing Serum has really made a difference in the appearance of my skin in only a week or so.  I use it at night and put it on my face and neck.  Its claim to lighten dark spots is a true claim, because already I can see a difference.  It moisturizes well, goes to work on dark spots and makes my skin look and feel smooth and younger-looking.  I intend to stick with this product.  A little goes a long way, so it is something I won&#x27;t have to buy every month.  This bottle should last me a good while.  Very nice product.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, after turning 30, I decided I should take preventive action on my face, tried Garnier, and Neutrogena, saw no difference, decided to give this a try, another reviewer did complain about breaking out, so I gave this a go, after a day or 2 I started breaking out, with unusual large pimples, now 4 months later, still breaking out with unusual large pimples, but now I&#x27;m breaking out much more, at first it was up to 4 plus a week, but now its like 6-8 plus, which stays 1-2 weeks, yikes, and still I see no difference, the cream is peachy orange, and smells of chemicles, which took some getting used to, I have decided to abandon ship with this, I cannot take the bad side effects and more, maybe this is for someone in their 50&#x27;s and up who show their age, or smoker who premature age, or for those who worship the sunn at all costs, this is clearly not for me, and as for me I still get carded when I buy drinks, so good luck if you skin shows age and you give this a shot, but be forwarned</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the end of my 1st bottle and i can see a big difference in my skin. I had a deep wrinkle between my eyebrows that is almost completely gone. I was about to get Botox before I tried this product and now i dont need it! AWESOME! My skin is soft and it has improved my overall appearance of my skin without make up. I wish I tried this product years ago!</li>
            <li> Delivered very quickly. Great place to purchase the cream I was having trouble finding on the open market. Really like the \\&quot;serum\\&quot; and glad to have a fast and reasonably priced place to buy it. Started using this in May and find very pleasing results.</li>
            <li> Item was open, had a musty odor, and was expired. Submit a request for refund, it been months and I have not received it yet.</li>
            <li> i was looking for a less-heavy nighttime lotion to assist with everything this serum says it will assist with and i have not been disappointed! after using it for only a week (just at bedtime) i noticed improvements. after two weeks, improvements were pointed out to me by others. apparently this can be used both morning and night, however i find that i like the roc lift serum for day use. either way, this is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Since I started using ROC Multi-Correxion Skin Renewing Serum last year, my 70-year old face has noticeably improved in firmness and smoothness.  People compliment me, and friends look closely, trying to figure out whether I&#x27;ve had some plastic surgery (not!).  Wish I had discovered this product 40 years ago!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m 28, have moderate acne scars with some collagen loss from scarring, and now am showing fine lines as well. i&#x27;ve been using this for only 2 days, and today when i woke up my skin looked a lot smoother. i&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t work any miracles or anything, but so far i really like how much it plumps up my skin and makes my pores less visible, as promised.</li>
            <li> When I received my package it didn&#x27;t look sealed like it hadn&#x27;t been open, there was only a piece of scotch tape holding it together. When i took it out I noticed thumb prints on the silver part near the top like someone had handled it. I also noticed it expires in April of this year, which gives me basically a month and a half to use it. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference to my skin because I think they sent me an old, dated product. I will not be buying from this distributor again.</li>
            <li> Used up all of this serum, and it was alright. I couldn&#x27;t really tell if it helped my skin or not, but it didn&#x27;t seem to harm it. I wouldn&#x27;t try it again, only because there are plenty others out there that I&#x27;d rather try out instead.</li>
            <li> product purchased: JUNE 2011  expiration date: APRIL 2011  bottle was half open  some serum had spilled out and was dried around the top  simply awful  would not recommend this vendor</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me because Roc stopped making the antigravity serum that I have used for years and loved it.  The antigravity serum has a beautiful smell and instantly lifted my jaw line and neck and stayed like that all day.  This product has a sickening smell that you would not want anyone to associate with you and did not lift at all like it was supposed to.  I feel just sick that the antigravity serum is no longer available.  Many of my friends all feel the same way.  What was Roc thinking when they discontinued it?????</li>
            <li> Great stuff! The only thing I would say is don&#x27;t get it on your lips...it tastes terrible! All the Roc products work just like they say! I swear it took 10 years off my face!</li>
            <li> All the commercials are true.  Roc really works.  The best thing I have tried without a prescription! I have already told my friends.</li>
            <li> I was using a very popular face wash system, and I broke out so bad. It was the worst it had ever been! Of course I got like a million scars from it -_- After using the whole bottle, this stuff made almost all of the scars go away!! Absolutely love this stuff and will buy another bottle. :)</li>
            <li> I had my doubts when I ordered the serum - read their claims - they sound too good to be true.  But this product works amazingly.  I just spend six months in the Florida sun and even with sunblock, had weathered my skin.  After a month of using this, the dark spots on my face are fading away.  And the skin on my neck is firming and the wrinkles around my eyes are smoothing out.  The most amazing thing is the skin on my upper chest, which was getting papery, is plump again and smooth.  It&#x27;s like a time machine for your skin.  Buy it, use it - definitely worth the money.  And it smells wonderful.    Note: Get the Lot# from your seller first and check it on [...] to see the actual expiration date (not noted on the product).</li>
            <li> so far I really like this product.seen a little change in my skin.and around my eyes. it just takes a small amount. will let you know more about this soon</li>
            <li> I was skeptical. I am skeptical of all &amp;#34;renewing serums&amp;#34; and anti-aging products.  If they worked then why doesn&#x27;t everyone look like they are 30?  Anyway, being the desperate 40-something woman I decided to try this product.  I did actually notice a difference in about 2 weeks.  My pores look smaller, my skin feels softer, my laugh lines have softened to the point that I don&#x27;t even notice them anymore. I have not tried this product around my eye area so I cannot speak to that.  This product has a scent that is a bit strong for me; however, it has not stopped me from using the product.  The scent wears away after awhile.  There is slight stinging sensation the first few times I tried it but this went away.  Overall I am impressed and will buy a second bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m 43 and have virtually no wrinkles due in part to this product. Has only slightly faded a couple brown spots, but skins seems smooth w/smaller pores. No break-outs either. Lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> love this serum does not clog my pores like other brands, just wish i could get in a bigger size</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Roc products since they were first introduced. I&#x27;m 62 and am told I look 32! Give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Changed the formula at the department store so needed to replenish my stock.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I am 26 years old have extremely fine lines, and I would like to keep it that way. This product makes the lines nearly disappear, and I use it as a preventative measure as well. The only downside is that it is scented, but the scent is bearable. I recommend this to friends interested in my skin care routine, and have been using it for the better part of a year.</li>
            <li> Love how it works - fades the spots and brightens the skin.  I would have given 5 stars but the smell is overpowering.  It&#x27;s very baby powder in fragrance.  Why, why, why can&#x27;t skincare specialists get it and do fragrance-free?  In terms of doing what it promised, it&#x27;s all that and the price is EXCELLENT.  I wear it during the day.  If I try to wear it at night I just can&#x27;t deal with the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on and off for about two years, and every time I switch to try something new I come right back. It is the best product on the market for the money. After my pregnancy I had lots of sun spots/brown spots on my face (thanks, &amp;#34;mask of pregnancy!&amp;#34;) and figured they would NEVER go away. A month of using this serum cleared everything up! You can barely see anything now. It goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or weird, smells pleasant, and when you wake up you have great-looking skin. It&#x27;s wonderful! Buy it now!</li>
            <li> not sure about this yet.  Have not really seen much improvement to erasing deep wrinkles.  The up side is that it does not irritate skin</li>
            <li> Been using this for a couple of weeks. Not sure if  I can tell much diffence. I do like the product. Probably needs more time to give adequate review.</li>
            <li> This is why drugstore brands get the bad rap they do. Artificial, strong fragrances are IRRITANTS. This smells horrible and it&#x27;s suffocating, given that it&#x27;s used on the face.  I would give it zero stars if I could. Very  disappointed.</li>
            <li> Why do they always dis-continue the products that work great?  I love this product and have used it for years and now its gone.</li>
            <li> My Olay just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for me anymore, and with 5 kids I really can&#x27;t afford an expensive regime. I bought this product a few days ago, and I must say that after 3 days of use my skin looks and feels amazing. It literally glows. I have very sensitive skin, and was actually prepared for some sort of side effects, but had zero issues. I would have given this product 5 stars if it didnt have this horrendous smell. I am hoping I get used to it because it really does work great.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with how light this lotion is, it penetrates quickly.  I felt a burning sensation but thought it was the acids,  the next day however, I started to break out,  I have sensitive skin and was trying something new recommended by a friend.  I will continue to use my AVON ANEW, it works for me!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a decent product and I prefer it to the cream version because I believe the pump keeps the retinol serum more sealed and fresh.  I&#x27;m not sure I can honestly review how well it works yet.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month now..&lt;br /&gt;No complaints.</li>
            <li> Ok soo I get my bottle and the person scratched the expiration date off. It was obviously expired so I&#x27;m not sure if this prevents the chemical from working or not. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my skin yet but yes I still used the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product only 2 weeks, i can tell the difference, my skin getting smoother and the spots a little bit lighter, for the price, it really worth it!</li>
            <li> I did  not expect much from this, but I am SO glad I bought it. My &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; are most gone after 1 month, and my skin looks great...btw-I&#x27;m 47!!</li>
            <li> I am the type of person that likes instant results and I almost gave up on this after the first week when I didn&#x27;t see any, plus the fact that I think this stuff stinks (like self tanner), but thank heavens I have stuck with it because I&#x27;m starting to notice my brown spots fading. I don&#x27;t think anything over the counter will ever make them completely disappear but I&#x27;m happy with what it&#x27;s doing so far, and maybe it will completely fade away after a few more bottles, I&#x27;ll just have to wait and see. One thing I&#x27;d like to mention is that when applied my skin became slightly warm/tingly, and a little itchy but that went away after a hour. The reason I mention this is because if you have really sensitive skin this may not be something you want to use. I use this during the day time (with sunscreen) and the multi night cream from this same line at night along with the eye cream.</li>
            <li> This is outstanding skin cream, making your tired skin seem bright and moist even after many ours wearing. I would recommend to everyone I know to try this. Lovely muted scent.</li>
            <li> OK..I never write reviews but this product is so amazing I have to share.  I am 66 years old with the aging face that is a fact of life. I didnt expect the product to make me look 40 but since I dont FEEL 66 I was hoping it would at least make a little improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product...I noticed a difference in a few days and after a couple months I couldnt be more pleased.  My skin feels softer - somewhat firmer - it looks more \\&quot;alive\\&quot;- Friends and family I dont see every day have commented on how great I look - how relaxed and happy. One day my husband smiled at me...\\&quot;You look so nice\\&quot;..I like looking at you\\&quot;. (Isnt he a dear?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the product twice a day.  In the morning, once its dry, I apply a lite covering of finishing powder and feel like I look great for my age. It makes me FEEL younger and prettier and I guess that is the real issue isnt it?</li>
            <li> Great product! I would recommend. I have problem skin, but this product never caused any problem with oiliness.</li>
            <li> I have been religiously using Boots No. 7 serum Intense for 3 years.  Simply put, I threw it in the trash after using this product.  Yes, it&#x27;s that great!  My  husband and kids touch my face and comment on how soft and smooth my face is.  And the other day I was dining with my husband and our regular waitress got inches from my face and told me how beautiful I looked and wanted to know what I was using.  Yes, it was an awkward moment, but I was so glad I listened to my gut and gave it a try.  Granted, I do try to take care of myself with diet, exercise, and sleep, but there is an improvement in the luminosity of my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from Lancôme,  Clinique, Estée Lauder, and this has been simply the best for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim because Oprah told me that I need more retinol. My skin is (was!) a wonderful mix of oily but somehow also very very dry-likely due to years of product usage to control what were terrible skin problems (for real everyone, acne is no joke). I randomly chose this product along with the deep wrinkle night cream and the eye cream because I wanted to see if I could control the wrinkles that have been starting for form around my sleep-deprived eyes (what! the skin of a pubescent teen and the eyes of a wise over-worked octogenarian, all at the age of 23! What&#x27;s not to love?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can I just say, \\&quot;wow\\&quot;. I have been using this most days along with the night deep wrinkle cream occasionally as well as the eye cream and I cannot be more impressed. Not only do my eyes look way less tired and aged, my skin and complexion are completely different. Frankly I got used to wearing tons of foundation and concealer to control the scars from years of abuse, but after 2 weeks of this I don&#x27;t need anything at all. The scars are fading away, and the redness that I had become used to is completely gone. My skin is soft and I MAY be addicted to ROC products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot stress enough my freedom and shock-the fact that my new skin now freely roams this earth without any cover up whatsoever is a sensation I assumed I would never experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat-using it every day made my skin a little dry so I trade off by using my old Cetaphil moisturizer in the mornings to keep my skin hydrated. This trade off is 100% worth it.</li>
            <li> Just recevied it so don&#x27;t have to say about it yet.</li>
            <li> Might as well buy something at the drug store...no difference in skin at all although price wasn&#x27;t bad&lt;br /&gt;wouldn&#x27;t order again</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, works okay...I have oily skins and this leaves a bit of a shine over the course of a day.</li>
            <li> This serum is the best! I have two obvious wrinkles on my forehead and within a week of using this one had completely disappeared and the other was barely visible. I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> This is the only skin product I&#x27;ve ever used that actually does what it claims. I will not go without it ever again.  I&#x27;m in my early 30s with combination skin -- Generally clear, shiny on the forehead and nose, dry on the cheeks, with an occasional cystic breakout from hormones and the requisite fine lines that come with age and good living. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year, once to twice a day. When you first begin to use it, it does burn a little and cause some redness, but this goes away pretty quickly. Within a few weeks I saw fewer lines (they&#x27;re still visible, but noticeably finer), more even skin tone, and the texture of my skin became fantastic -- very soft and smooth. In the long term, it helps me avoid breakouts and definitely reduces acne scarring because it encourages cell turnover and actually exfoliates down to a deeper level of skin. No other product I&#x27;ve tried that claims to \\&quot;penetrate\\&quot; really does, and the research I&#x27;ve done supports the idea that Retinol/RetinA is the only skin care substance capable of doing this. I&#x27;ve been able to use it right around my eyes with no irritation.  The results are incredible and I LOVE this stuff. Highly recommended!  Caveats: The results are not permanent, so you will need to keep using it or your skin will gradually revert back to however it was before you started. Like another reviewer said, it tastes gross so keep it away from your lips. Be careful with sun exposure and/or use sunscreen, because it makes you burn more easily. And if you wax your lip or brows, don&#x27;t use it there! The top surface of your skin will tear more easily. I&#x27;ve talked to one aesthetician who said she won&#x27;t even wax customers that use RetinA (a more potent version of Retinol) because of this risk.  But all of this is really minor. All in all this is a really great product that lives up to its claims.</li>
            <li> thank you amazon. being able to get my roc beauty products from you has allowed me to afford to keep using the Roc products.  All aspects of amazon and the Roc product iam very pleased with,</li>
            <li> I was referred to this item by &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t Go To The Cosmetics Counter Without Me.&amp;#34;  Tried it, loved it.  Have tried other &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; products occasionally and they make my skin get a little bumpy on my forehead so I keep coming back.  And the auto-ship makes it so simple to keep it on hand at a better price that I can find locally, when I can find it.</li>
            <li> I have used one bottle of this and I can see the difference.  I took a before picture and the lines in my face are much lighter and not as deep.  I ordered another bottle.  I am going to work on getting older as gracefully as possible.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to minimize dark undereye circles.  I&#x27;ve been using it for approximately 3 weeks and can see a dramatic improvement in the look of fine lines, dark circles, and skin texture.  Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I really had low expectations but what a change!  I guess I have been using this product for over a month and love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for acne dark marks and under eye swelling and darkness. I have been using it for about a week! The first 3 days it did not help at all with my dark marks, but it had AMAZING affects on my under eye! However, after three days it burns my face and under eyes HORRIBLY when I apply it. I don&#x27;t have open wounds and I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin. wish I could continue to use this product but it&#x27;s too painful.</li>
            <li> I received this product expired. It is hard to see but the expiration date is stamped on the bottom, with no color, only indented. But this one had expired in December of 2012. It smelled a bit rancid which is why I looked to begin with. When I requested a refund the seller sent me a return label where I would pay the shipping. Why should I pay shipping for a defective expired product? So I later purchased this product from a different seller, fresh, and it works great. Good product, bad merchant.</li>
            <li> This cream did amazing work on improving my complexion.  I had acne scars and they are gone.  My skin looks awesome.</li>
            <li> Have bought over and over so it&#x27;s great for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty clear the only &amp;#34;face saving&amp;#34; solution is plastic surgery. Sad. This product did nothing as far as I could see.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase, I highly recommend it! My bf even told me he could see a difference in my face and asked of he could use the serum too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I have ordered several RoC products and am loving them.  Better than the more expensive products that I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of weeks so the jury is still out on dark spot correction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update when the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see an effect when I use it, although my skin feels softer but it doesn&#x27;t look any different to me.</li>
            <li> excellent cream, I&#x27;ve been using since 2008</li>
            <li> I use this product as a first layer on my face when I get out of the shower in the morning.  It smooths things out, tightens them up, and helps keep me looking a bit younger than my 64 years. Wish it did more for the emerging brown spots, but I&#x27;m using a different product for that so we&#x27;ll see.  For the price, this ROC product does about the same thing I have paid 4 times for with other products.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to keep using it daily.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve been using this RoC about 2years,then I noticed that this is very good quality.  I really love it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this but it feels rather sticky and I don&#x27;t care for that feeling all day long.  I threw the packaging away, something I wish I had not done so I could return it, guess I&#x27;m stuck with it now.  I may use it at night but that&#x27;s a big might.  I could not get passed the feeling to see any real results.  Maybe someone else will have better results.</li>
            <li> This is really great. It smells good and I can already see reduction in smile lines around my mouth. Fair price, I will definitely reorder when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have used this treatment for over 2 years and love it.  It keeps wrinkles at bay and I still get compliments on my skin!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will never know if this product works. It smells, which I vowed at first to overlook if the product seemed to be working. After about 5 uses I decided to just give up on it and look for another product. Also, I have oily skin. When I used this stuff before bed I woke up with puddles of oil on my face. Between that and the smell, I tossed it.</li>
            <li> I have gone through many different types of facial skin care regimes and never received as many compliments and felt better about my skin than when using Roc products. I had some sensitivity issues a few months back and was unable to keep using them but have since reordered two of their products because I just can&#x27;t get enough!  Use this serum with the Multi Correxion SPF 30 moisturizer and the Multi Correxion Facial Wash and believe me it will do wonders for your skin. Just be careful about putting either one of the products close to the skin around your eyes and I would also suggest only using the serum 2x a week at first to make sure you are not too sensitive. The other thing to remember is to not WAX YOUR FACE while using Retinol products. That was the biggest mistake I made and I tore off some of the skin on my eyebrow. It&#x27;s fine now but still, I looked like a super villian for about a week. LOL</li>
            <li> It is just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t know if I will use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice a day (morning and night)</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first time using this product. The serum made my face look flawless, diminishing the wrinkles that I have.  I am going to order again!  Thanks so much for a super facial serum!</li>
    </ol>
