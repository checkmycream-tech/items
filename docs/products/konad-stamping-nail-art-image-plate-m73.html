            <li>Seller good.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in good shape and on time.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly I am well practiced at the painting, scraping, and picking up the image technique now, and feel like I&#x27;ve gotten my stampers filed to the optimum level</li>
            <li>This is a nice plate with some great designs on it.</li>

            <li>It is so beautiful and unique.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice nail design size.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s handy to have the double-sided stampers, and rather than using the razor-esque scrapers that come with the kits (these can scratch your plates to heck</li>
            <li>Came nicely packaged and on time.</li>
            <li>You will get some really great results when you use their special polish.</li>
            <li>I can see using this plate many many times over!</li>
            <li>Learned about these products on Pinterest and love, love, love them!</li>
            <li>Love the designs and I use this plate more often than the others I own.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re buying the plate, make sure that you also have a nail stamp, and a scraper to use with it.</li>
            <li>Love this product...</li>
            <li>The viney flowers is my favorite</li>
            <li>I got this one because of the music art image, I know that I am going to love the image on my nails.  </li>
            <li>so i do suggest buying these if u have patience and talent :)</li>
            <li>I love Dominikas pictures for this plate</li>
            <li>I love the floral print.</li>
            <li>Dominika, if you&#x27;re out there I&#x27;d love to know what colors and brands you used.</li>
            <li>i think i use this plate over 20 times with all images the notes though is my all time favorite</li>
            <li>Try one :-)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always love the stamping way because I feel it takes awhile to do.</li>
            <li>It has hearts for the tip of your nail, cute floral design and music notes</li>
            <li>the plate(s) you just love :)</li>
            <li>I love this plate and so does my mom.</li>
            <li>well I love the plate and all the designs.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and she seems to love it, so</li>
            <li>so it really holds onto the polish and picks up on the stamper very nicely.</li>
            <li>Its all well worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I love the designs on this plate and like any konad product it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I think plate 64 has some more of her fine work.</li>
            <li>stamp is easy to use and very versatile styles, reuseable themes/designs that are flexible for many more manis to come!</li>
            <li>They are big and gorgeous!</li>
            <li>; I can&#x27;t wait to do a full mani with it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy.</li>
            <li>Make sure when you are using the plates that you also purchase the Special Konad polish to use with the plates.</li>
            <li>But all the others work just fine, so it&#x27;s just a matter of taste.</li>
            <li>They all work just fine</li>
            <li>Pretty much any polish that covers well with one light coat works great.  </li>
            <li>I have other brands of ail plates and Konad is always the best for full nail designs.</li>
            <li>think the biggest difference between these plates and the cheap ones I have are the level of detail.  </li>
            <li>I like the one coat, high pigment, and deep metallics best for stamping.  </li>
            <li>and i tried it right away!</li>
            <li>The images are clean, crisp and offer many fun options.</li>
            <li>It makes manicure more fun and gets your creative juices flowing and with crazy nail art is demand this is the PERFECT way to start.</li>
            <li>I love the designs on this particular plate</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of the different brands, but Konad truly remains my favorite, and is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I own about 15 of these plates, all of the Konad brand plates are of high quality and with large prints.</li>
            <li>Bundle monster is a great alternative for half the price.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>did fun heart mani for valentine&#x27;s day...</li>
            <li>Konad plates are definitely worth the money you spend on them.</li>
            <li>I just recently started stamping using the inexpensive 9.99 kit that you can buy pretty much anywhere, and loved the results.  </li>
            <li>The price was right too!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my first Konad pattern plate (I also bought the french tip plate), and I&#x27;m thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>Really love this plate because of the musical notes and piano keys.</li>
            <li>I just need to get better at actually placing the stamp on my nail.  </li>
            <li>and back if you&#x27;re not careful), use an old credit card - it works awesomely, and then gently roll the stamper back and forth to pick up the image, and then roll it on to your nail</li>
            <li>I tried the music note with keyboard with black paint but didn&#x27;t come out nicely at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what recommendation does for this kind of item...if you like the images, you&#x27;ll get it right?</li>
            <li>I am using regular nail polish and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Konad is highly recommended in my book, and as I said, this is truly a fun and super easy way to jazz up a plain manicure.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the pics too.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used much of this plate yet because I&#x27;ve been looking for a gold nail polish that stands out well with the flowery design; I saw someone else uploaded finished pictures online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t really matter which brand</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, Thank You.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of impatient, but if you like stamping get this plate.</li>
            <li>At least that&#x27;s how it works for me, so good luck finding</li>
            <li>and I personally prefer the Konad special polish.</li>
            <li>Nail stamping is such a fun way to jazz up any manicure.</li>
            <li>images are a tight fit if you have large nails.</li>
            <li>Stamping plates work best with Konad polishes as they are dark and thick and will definitely stand out.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this!</li>
            <li>and they looked so professional that I couldn&#x27;t believe you can do such a good work at home with such little tools!</li>
            <li>Large enough to cover larger/wide nails.</li>
            <li>for the product itself i have never seen designs such as this one before and although they look great when applied correctly the zebra look one is hard to center correctly</li>
            <li>The designs transfer well, showing the details clearly on the nail.</li>
            <li>but I had no trouble getting the complete pattern to pick up on my stamper.  </li>
            <li>would give them 4 stars for sizing, but the images are just wow.</li>
            <li>I love the delicate flower design,</li>
            <li>This plate features full nail designs, and they are large enough to cover the nail properly if placed carefully.</li>
            <li>I used a .99 cent nail polish as my stamping polish, and not a single issue!</li>
            <li>Polishes that require 2 to 3 coats to get anything other than sheer obviously don&#x27;t work very well for this.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>

            <li> I have long nail beds and wear an &amp;#34;active-length&amp;#34; nail and can juuust get the image on my middle finger.</li>
            <li> This plate is etched deep enough that the polish actually sinks into the designs for easy transfer to the nail (some of the other brands the etchings are so shallow or not consistent that it will affect the design).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use black over an off white polish.  </li>
            <li> I have a few different types of stamping plates, (bundle monster, salon express, fing&#x27;rs and Konad).</li>
            <li> I used konad white on my black polished nails!</li>

            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase. I have already used this stamp and it worked perfect! I used a .99 cent nail polish as my stamping polish, and not a single issue! The plate is cut well so it really holds onto the polish and picks up on the stamper very nicely. I have used 2 of the images on this plate with no issue at all. Perfect every stamp. So very happy!</li>
            <li> This plate is awesome however i was bummed to find out I could of gotten one ALOT cheaper than this one from another company. Konad is over priced. Bundle monster is a great alternative for half the price.</li>
            <li> I own about 15 of these plates, all of the Konad brand plates are of high quality and with large prints. Large enough to cover larger/wide nails. Stamping plates work best with Konad polishes as they are dark and thick and will definitely stand out.</li>
            <li> Konad is the best.  The piano keys and music is so finely crafted and comes out perfectly.  It is so beautiful and unique. I use black over an off white polish.  Amazing. A million compliments always. I would suggest using the konad polish designed for stamping use [[ASIN:B000ZV0D9W Konad Nail Art Stamping Polish - Black]]as it is denser and makes the best images.  It&#x27;s so easy.</li>
            <li> i would say that 4 out of these 5 patters i consider to be \\&quot;thick\\&quot; ... The lines for the musical notes are very very tiny, and it&#x27;s almost impossible (for me at least) to pick up the pattern properly. But all the others work just fine, so it&#x27;s just a matter of taste. The flowers very lovely, and the slanted lines as well.</li>
            <li> This plate features full nail designs, and they are large enough to cover the nail properly if placed carefully. The designs transfer well, showing the details clearly on the nail. If you&#x27;re buying the plate, make sure that you also have a nail stamp, and a scraper to use with it.</li>
            <li> Love this product...did fun heart mani for valentine&#x27;s day...stamp is easy to use and very versatile styles, reuseable themes/designs that are flexible for many more manis to come!</li>
            <li> I have other brands of ail plates and Konad is always the best for full nail designs. They are big and gorgeous! I use this plate all the time. The viney flowers is my favorite</li>
            <li> Great plate. I just got it today and tried it out; I can&#x27;t wait to do a full mani with it!</li>
            <li> I bought this plate for my daughter and she loved it.  She has a bunch of them and they work perfectly!  The price was right too!&lt;br /&gt;I saw her nails when she did the stamps and they looked so professional that I couldn&#x27;t believe you can do such a good work at home with such little tools!</li>
            <li> So easy to use and transfers great! Nice nail design size. Great tool to have at your home nail salon.</li>
            <li> Their plates and designs are really awesome. Make sure when you are using the plates that you also purchase the Special Konad polish to use with the plates. You will get some really great results when you use their special polish. I have tried regular polish with the plates and I personally prefer the Konad special polish. Its all well worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I got this one because of the music art image, I know that I am going to love the image on my nails.  I like it because it has different kinds of art images on it that I can have on my nails.</li>
            <li> Really love this plate because of the musical notes and piano keys. I love music and this is a great nail expression plate.</li>
            <li> as for the seller, it was a good one shipped in great time, way before i was expecting it&lt;br /&gt;as for the product itself i have never seen designs such as this one before and although they look great when applied correctly the zebra look one is hard to center correctly so i do suggest buying these if u have patience and talent :)</li>
            <li> Seller good. Product arrived in good shape and on time.  Product not all the stamps come out. half of the stamp shape prints.  Not sure why. using konad ink. white/black.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this! Designs are not etched deeP enough to transfer to your nails. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> This is a great plate and you can depend on Konad for quality nail art products. I love Dominikas pictures for this plate and I think plate 64 has some more of her fine work. I love the floral print. It looks like she used silver on bronze. Dominika, if you&#x27;re out there I&#x27;d love to know what colors and brands you used. Thanks for the pics too.</li>
            <li> This is my first Konad pattern plate (I also bought the french tip plate), and I&#x27;m thrilled with it.  I just recently started stamping using the inexpensive 9.99 kit that you can buy pretty much anywhere, and loved the results.  I&#x27;ve heard Konad is the best, so decided to order a couple of plates (also ordered a Bundle Monster pack but haven&#x27;t gotten that yet).&lt;br /&gt;I think the biggest difference between these plates and the cheap ones I have are the level of detail.  The Konad stamps have lots of teeny tiny intricate details but I had no trouble getting the complete pattern to pick up on my stamper.  Admittedly I am well practiced at the painting, scraping, and picking up the image technique now, and feel like I&#x27;ve gotten my stampers filed to the optimum level so I don&#x27;t have any issues picking up the images on the inexpensive plates either anymore.  I just need to get better at actually placing the stamp on my nail.  I am using regular nail polish and it works just fine.  I like the one coat, high pigment, and deep metallics best for stamping.  Pretty much any polish that covers well with one light coat works great.  Polishes that require 2 to 3 coats to get anything other than sheer obviously don&#x27;t work very well for this.&lt;br /&gt;Love these plates, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> i think i use this plate over 20 times with all images the notes though is my all time favorite</li>
            <li> I bought a Konad plate and it was the legit Konad, but with my order i recieved a coupon.... which you cant use. I tried it with amazon and their website, with several combonations it could be from what I got none worked.</li>
            <li> Konad plates are definitely worth the money you spend on them. The detail is amazing and the result is breathtaking when you use the Konad polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things:&lt;br /&gt;I do have the metal scraper and it leaves superficial scratches on the plate. However, it does not mar the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The images are a tight fit if you have large nails. I have long nail beds and wear an &amp;#34;active-length&amp;#34; nail and can juuust get the image on my middle finger. I have to double stamp my thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give them 4 stars for sizing, but the images are just wow. Try one :-)</li>
            <li> I love the designs on this particular plate and I have a couple. I don&#x27;t always love the stamping way because I feel it takes awhile to do. I&#x27;m kind of impatient, but if you like stamping get this plate. It has hearts for the tip of your nail, cute floral design and music notes</li>
            <li> Love this thing! It makes manicure more fun and gets your creative juices flowing and with crazy nail art is demand this is the PERFECT way to start.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used much of this plate yet because I&#x27;ve been looking for a gold nail polish that stands out well with the flowery design; I saw someone else uploaded finished pictures online. I bought this plate just to use the #3 image(flower one). I tried the music note with keyboard with black paint but didn&#x27;t come out nicely at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what recommendation does for this kind of item...if you like the images, you&#x27;ll get it right? At least that&#x27;s how it works for me, so good luck finding the plate(s) you just love :)</li>
            <li> Nail stamping is such a fun way to jazz up any manicure. I&#x27;ve tried many of the different brands, but Konad truly remains my favorite, and is worth the price. This plate is etched deep enough that the polish actually sinks into the designs for easy transfer to the nail (some of the other brands the etchings are so shallow or not consistent that it will affect the design).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t actually use the Konad polishes with my stamping plates - I found that they&#x27;re too thick for some of the other brands, so I&#x27;ve adapted to using the polishes I have - I just pick the color I want and go. I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t really matter which brand I use - I&#x27;ve ranged from Sally Hansen and Essie to Zoya and Deborah Lippmann. It&#x27;s all in the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip for those just getting into stamping - it&#x27;s handy to have the double-sided stampers, and rather than using the razor-esque scrapers that come with the kits (these can scratch your plates to heck and back if you&#x27;re not careful), use an old credit card - it works awesomely, and then gently roll the stamper back and forth to pick up the image, and then roll it on to your nail (I have weird shaped nails, I guess, so this is the easiest way for me to do mine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Konad is highly recommended in my book, and as I said, this is truly a fun and super easy way to jazz up a plain manicure.</li>
            <li> Learned about these products on Pinterest and love, love, love them! The images are clean, crisp and offer many fun options. Will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> I love this plate and so does my mom. My cousin wanted to know where i got my nails done. I love the delicate flower design, well I love the plate and all the designs. Fast delivery, Thank You.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for my niece since she plays the piano and loves music. Great choice because she loves it!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to get this one and i tried it right away! I used konad white on my black polished nails! Beautiful! Very happy!</li>
            <li> This is a nice plate with some great designs on it. I love it. Came nicely packaged and on time. Big thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girl and she seems to love it, so I assume it is good. Sorry I can not be more helpful.</li>
            <li> Love the designs and I use this plate more often than the others I own. Konad plates are th best and are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It did it&#x27;s job ! Arrived on time.  Works like a charm each and every time it is put to use.</li>
            <li> I have a few different types of stamping plates, (bundle monster, salon express, fing&#x27;rs and Konad). They all work just fine but I will say that the Konad always stamps the best. I love the designs on this plate and like any konad product it&#x27;s easy to use. I can see using this plate many many times over!</li>
