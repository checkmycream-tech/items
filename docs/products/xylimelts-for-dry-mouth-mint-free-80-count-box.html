            <li>I really like these and now sleep thru the night!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>These are amazing!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what makes Xylimelts so amazing!</li>
            <li>They are amazing!  </li>
            <li>These things are amazing!</li>
            <li>My mouth is nice and moist all through the night now!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find this in the stores, but Amazon has the best deal, I&#x27;m sure, and that&#x27;s where I stock up.</li>
            <li>One more drop of mint, would be wonderful.</li>
            <li>There are so many excellent reviews on these mints that I hope the price doesn&#x27;t go up.  </li>
            <li>They are truly remarkable.</li>
            <li>My hygienist was so impressed with how easy it was to remove the plaque.</li>
            <li>They are pleasant tasting and good for your teeth.</li>
            <li>A good product and good quality</li>
            <li>It may be a good product if one has some</li>
            <li>and they are fairly inexpensive so I&#x27;ll probably buy them again.</li>
            <li>they taste good</li>
            <li>They taste good and work day or night.</li>
            <li>Good.  </li>
            <li>The best part for him has been that they are available mint-free.</li>
            <li>I uses one tab per night and get a good night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
            <li>This works for a good 2 hours.</li>
            <li>but if you like mint those are good as well.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look good to me either.</li>
            <li>Taste good, too.</li>
            <li>It does work, but not quite as good as you&#x27;d like to see it work.</li>
            <li>These work fairly well.</li>
            <li>All those good ratings are misleading.</li>
            <li>Good idea in theory.</li>
            <li>The taste is good, but I wish it had a stronger minty flavor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and I will use it again.</li>
            <li>Good except I started getting sores on my gum line.</li>
            <li>These work great, mild pleasant taste,stay in place and no sugar!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s always nice and moist and the taste is extremely pleasant</li>
            <li>It continually emits a really pleasant mint taste into the mouth, and makes it fresh and very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the results using Xylimelts in conjunction with my CPAP.</li>
            <li>So very glad I found them.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased...</li>
            <li>It adheres real easy.</li>

            <li>This product is AWESOME and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>My friend is very pleased.  </li>
            <li>am SO glad I found these!  </li>
            <li>I encourage you to learn more about it!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>the* best for your product lines and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>My dentist suggested I try these, and I am so glad he did!</li>
            <li>His home health care nurse recommended them, and we are glad she did!</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I found them and can get them from Amazon!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>Best brand I have found - and really notice the difference if I run out of them!  </li>
            <li>These melts are easy to use, taste great.</li>
            <li>Great result from the very first try, and now I don&#x27;t wake up with the feeling of the Gobi desert in my mouth!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>this product is just amazing...</li>
            <li>It is amazing how it works.  </li>
            <li>They are kind of sticky, and you can&#x27;t keep one in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Kind of between chalky and slimy?</li>
            <li>Nice to keep some in your pocket for day use too.</li>
            <li>nice to wake up with a moist mouth</li>
            <li>She has many patients who are elderly, and she has recommended Xylimelts to them with good results.</li>
            <li>so nice to  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take two to be effective for me, so I put one on each side of my mouth.</li>
            <li>Mouth was nice and moist till morning.</li>
            <li>This helped, but has to be applied heavily to be effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to not need to drink water all night to keep my mouth from drying.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I is good, but I expect better.  </li>
            <li>If you use this, check with your own dentist first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The time-release system is effective, and I have no problems with my cheeks or gums.</li>
            <li>This is a surprisingly effective product: it sticks well and keeps the mouth moist during the night.</li>
            <li>Handy to carry in my purse to use when an oral rinse is impractical.</li>
            <li>Xylimelts have a special disc for adhering comfortably to the side of my gums and are the perfect size and shape that I don&#x27;t even feel them in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>These are very easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not grainy or gelatiny  like another brand I tried, and although the xylitol is sweet, it&#x27;s not too sweet, and best of all, it won&#x27;t hurt my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These tabs are very easy to use, just slide between teeth and cheek.</li>
            <li>These are the best I have found so far.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worked the best for me so far.</li>
            <li>XyliMelts are natural and totally AWESOME!</li>
            <li>I like the mint-free ones the best, as sensitive mouth lining may be irritated by the mint flavoring.  </li>
            <li>Not too effective,  but better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use too!</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best for my dentures (doesn&#x27;t stick) and 3 pieces will keep me satisfied dry mouth wise, for 3-4 hours..</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they were more minty, and most of all, melted faster in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>The mints are very easy to use and are refreshing.</li>
            <li>Does not solve for the full night but certainly helps a great deal!</li>
            <li>it adhears to the inside of your mouth very securely.</li>
            <li>More doctors should know about this product as it would ease a lot of folks&#x27; suffering.  </li>
            <li>many of the pockets in the gums have disappeared.    </li>
            <li>I have not been able to sleep well because my tongue gets stuck to the top of my mouth within minutes of falling to sleep.</li>
            <li>sometimes I use those xylitol ice chips for dryness and eat too many and my tummy hurts.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to sit through the concert in comfort.  </li>
            <li>Sure helps if one uses a CPAP machine at night.</li>
            <li>so I was sure I had found the solution.  </li>
            <li>so I felt confident in ordering.</li>
            <li>Shopping and officiating at weddings are enjoyable again.</li>
            <li>I do love them; they&#x27;re so portable.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite of the products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Aside from keeping your mouth more moist, Xylitol is supposed to help to prevent tooth decay.</li>
            <li>As with many things this was an impulse buy.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Could you check if they still carry the refreshing Mint?  </li>
            <li>love these melts.  </li>
            <li>Like many consumers of XyliMelts, I have Sjögren&#x27;s Syndrome.</li>
            <li>My mouth has stayed more hydrated as I run races.</li>
            <li>have used these for some time now and love them</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am sure it works for some people, but I have put the box in our medicine cabinet and will wonder why I evern bought it.</li>
            <li>I just wish it had a bit more xylitol for a more anti-cariogenic effect, but I guess you could just pack two of these,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but I have to say this product has saved my sanity.  </li>
            <li>I may wake up once or twice, but many nights don&#x27;t wake up at all.  </li>
            <li>and I got much more relief.  </li>
            <li>I am sure this is to ensure that you do not fall asleep and choke on the melt.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Because I breathe through my mouth at night, I would wake up one or more times a night with cheeks and tongue feeling like sandpaper.  </li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>Under the tongue seems to produce more saliva.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus, they aren&#x27;t  cheap!</li>
            <li>Better than Biotene gel.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased that I now can use one while shopping.</li>
            <li>I learned of this product on the Cancer Survivors&#x27; Network, and it has truly been a life-saver for him, as for many others.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product !</li>
            <li>THE MINT FLAVOR BETTER.</li>
            <li>Acacia is known to also help support healthy bacteria in the body.</li>
            <li>They work well I just like the biotene gum better..</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have ordered additional boxes I am so sure I will continue to use.</li>
            <li>and it just wouldn&#x27;t be appropriate to be chewing gum or gulping from my water bottle every two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put one on the roof of my mouth before going to sleep and it lasts most of the night.</li>
            <li>I have started producing more saliva and with the combination of the XyliMelt and c-pap</li>
            <li>I love it and will not be without it ever.</li>
            <li>I love that they attached to your gum.  </li>
            <li>It has helped me sleep better too because I don&#x27;t wake up feeling parched.</li>
            <li>I am able to use one of these to get through the night without waking.  </li>
            <li>I have slept better with them.</li>
            <li>do not understand how this simple, effective (even brilliant)</li>
            <li>This shows that in today&#x27;s media driven society even the better mousetrap needs an advertising campaign.</li>
            <li>I prefer the mint free kind because if I am drinking something the mint taste doesn&#x27;t interfere with that</li>
            <li>I have been using Biotene oral gel for years and these work better.</li>
            <li>Love that they are not minty.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product on the market.</li>
            <li>He has used them for several months and they are still working GREAT!</li>
            <li>To my great surprise it really did work.  </li>
            <li>my body helped more.</li>
            <li>but it does contain Xylitol as its only sweetener, and is not acidic so it is the best night time lozenge for dental health.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too many a day as it includes xylitol.</li>
            <li>I wish I had known about this wonderful product several years ago.</li>
            <li>i love them...</li>
            <li>It is Xylitol so checking  to make sure this form of sugar agrees with you would be advised.  </li>
            <li>The package says not to adhere to roof of mouth - but that is my favorite place.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for those with sjogrens and similar issues.</li>
            <li>I like these better.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found these online.</li>
            <li>Friends I gave them to love them.</li>
            <li>Have tried many products and this has been</li>
            <li>These are short lived and works best with Biotene gel.</li>
            <li>Came home, bought them and love them.  </li>
            <li>I use these tablets daily and they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Canker melts are better, but they dont make them anymore unfortunately.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She is pleased with the way they help to keep her mouth moist.</li>
            <li>They are the most helpful product I have used.</li>
            <li>This has worked better for me than the spray products of this type.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d probably lose more teeth unless I came in for cleanings and check ups three times a year instead of two</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m confident my dentist won&#x27;t see a tooth loss pattern in my mouth.</li>
            <li>are so much better ...</li>
            <li>you make a great product at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>I found the product helping me sleep a bit better.</li>
            <li>More long-lasting than an oral gel and more affordable.</li>
            <li>I prefer the 80 count box for economy, although, I think they cost more than they need to.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the Spry mints for daytime use.</li>
            <li>I have a better nights sleep using xyliments along with my Cpac machine.</li>
            <li>I had tried so many things.</li>
            <li>keep 4 by my bed :)</li>
            <li>worked better some nights than others</li>
            <li>I sleep so much better</li>
            <li>This one is the best I have tried but only lasts about 4 hours.  </li>
            <li>it seems to help more than some others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The taste is ok</li>
            <li>They have literally made my mother&#x27;s quality of life better.  </li>
            <li>Most drug stores do not carry XyliMelts</li>
            <li>I like this product better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how that works ... but will try that.</li>
            <li>Lasts many hours and moistens mouth as you sleep.</li>
            <li>These tablets help to make his mouth feel better.</li>
            <li>The answer is yes.  :)</li>
            <li>I would be glad to recommend these for anyone, any age</li>
            <li>Tastes OK too.</li>
            <li>Great product to fight gingivitus; highly recommended by my dentist.    </li>
            <li>After trying many ideas to help combat dry mouth symptoms, XyliMelts have been the very best.  </li>
            <li>I tried Biotene spray which is pretty good but is not a spray</li>
            <li>These worked pretty good</li>
            <li>This product works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad taste and it makes sense that there would be some kind of flavor.  </li>
            <li>I seldom comment, and this may be my most enthusiastic review ever; it&#x27;s worth taking the time to write.</li>

            <li>I am truly grateful to have found this product; it&#x27;s worth every penny and more!</li>
            <li>The best part is that if i want to just suck on these like a mint its very easy to break off the sticky layer in one piece with a little pressure from my front teeth before I pop it in my mouth.</li>

            <li>cavities(I am REALLY on top of my dry mouth, using these at night, sugar free gum during the day, Paleo diet to avoid processed sugar) so I am very happy for this</li>
            <li>Much more comfortable throughout the night since I began using this item.</li>
            <li>These pills soothe me to sleep and take over an hour to melt completely which is great.  </li>
            <li>So far the product has been great.</li>
            <li>It works great so far.</li>
            <li>I wake up in the morning feeling more comfortable.</li>
            <li>The XyliMelts combined with the Waterpik is more comfortable.</li>
            <li>It still is not as good as your real saliva</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the other gels and pills and this product has worked the best for me.</li>
            <li>The taste of these little beauties isn&#x27;t the best, but the job they do more than makes up for it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>They are easy to carry and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic because you can use it comfortably and safely as you sleep.</li>
            <li>They easily adhere to the inside of your cheek and are innocuous during the night (unlike another brand).</li>
            <li>But the mint flavor is very mild and pleasing.</li>
            <li>It is long-lasting and very mildly flavored.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and seem to work well</li>
            <li>ONE of these tablets can easily kill your dog.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to dislodge and throw away.  </li>

            <li>Easy to use and work work for me.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t have a strong mint flavor but there is still something . . .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that there is a need to purchase the mint-free version, though, since the mint version is not too strong.</li>
            <li>It is an absolutely unprecedented essential item for your good health.</li>
            <li>Lasts till morning which is the first product I have found of this kind.  </li>
            <li>For dry mouth these are very good.  </li>
            <li>It is also very good for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Biotene products like toothpaste, mouthwash, moistners have been the most successful for moisturizing my mouth for short periods of time.</li>
            <li>The instructions for night-time use say to use two tablets, one for each side of your mouth, but I just use one, and it works fine for me.</li>
            <li>As for the usage they work just fine.</li>
            <li>it is fine - just drips out of mouth while sleeping once in a while...</li>
            <li>The directions say to use one disk on each side of your mouth, but I find one at a time works fine.  </li>
            <li>works just fine and no side effects.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li>They help tremendously!</li>
            <li>XyliMelts are more convenient for me to use rather than gel based products that dissipate all too quickly.  </li>
            <li>Moved on to Act lozenges,which provide the same relief, have a more pleasant mouth feel</li>
            <li>Love these they are great for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>The tabs help alleviate most of the dry mouth problems I have experienced</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not annoying, taste fine, and do the job.</li>
            <li>These little tablets are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to use, relatively unobtrusive, and most of all, they work!!  </li>
            <li>This product has made a huge difference to me at night and during the day.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product that increases saliva production while sleeping.  </li>
            <li>XyliMelts have a light mint taste and you can use them while you sleep.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the ultimate, GREAT breath mint, also.</li>
            <li>Some rave about these, you just have to try what is available.</li>
            <li>I tried everything available, Biotene, mouth devices, etc.  </li>
            <li>Check the manufacturer&#x27;s website for free samples.</li>
            <li>I LIKE THE MINT FREE VS.</li>
            <li>Important to me.  </li>
            <li>prefer mint free, and the taste is pleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sleeping soundly.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying the mint version of this product, if you aren&#x27;t against mint flavored products, but this mint free version has an almost neutral taste and lasts for about 3 hours while sleeping.</li>
            <li>i use it during the day if i do not have available water and every night.  </li>
            <li>The instructions says use one on each side; I tried using just one at a time, putting in a second one when I woke up in the night, and this approach worked great.</li>
            <li>They really do adhere nicely.</li>
            <li>I was using sugar free drops.  </li>
            <li>Thank you again for such great service.</li>
            <li>After some experimenting, I confirmed the Xylimelts caused it.</li>
            <li>Before using these I used sugar free life savers, which is a choke hazard.  </li>
            <li>I just think the mint free might help to not upset  my stomach.</li>
            <li>They help a great deal but don&#x27;t last the night</li>
            <li>sugar free cough drops still have sugars and have caused me to have cavities.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I tried these and will definitely keep buying them!</li>
            <li>My daughter in-law gave me a free sample.</li>
            <li>They are mint free, but I don&#x27;t know that I wouldn&#x27;t like mint.</li>
            <li>She says her mouth hasn&#x27;t felt this comfortable in years.  </li>
            <li>Far superior to Act.</li>
            <li>These have been the most successful product for helping to keep away dry mouth.</li>
            <li>You have maybe two seconds to make sure you placed it in the right spot in the mouth.</li>
            <li>The melt lasts an hour, two if you are very calm (asleep or not talking/moving the mouth).</li>
            <li>Very useful solution that I carry with me at all times.</li>
            <li>The Biotene PBF mouth rinse is very nice but doesn&#x27;t last any length of time.</li>
            <li>great for one who has problems with dry mouth, easy to use and apply.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer to use the original formula of Oral Balance because of the protective enzymes, but it is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>They are easy and quick to use, and I find that I prefer the mint-free version.</li>
            <li>After four rounds of radioiodine treatment for thyroid cancer, my salivary glands have mostly put their hands up in mute surrender and stopped producing very much saliva.  </li>
            <li>These are the absolute best mints for dry mouth caused by medications or CPAP.</li>
            <li>WONDERFUL MINTS REALLY HELP WITH DRY MOUTH.</li>
            <li>I would give it a higher rating if I didn&#x27;t need so many in mouth at a time.</li>
            <li>Great for dry mouth caused by medications.</li>
            <li>These are great for those of us suffering from dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Xylimelts work great for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Great for dry mouth at night</li>
            <li>The mint-free work great and seem to have almost solved my dry mouth problem at night.</li>
            <li>These worked great to relieve my dry mouth at night</li>
            <li>Great for dry mouth when using CPAP machine.</li>
            <li>Great for dry mouth at night.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product if you suffer from dry mouth while asleep.</li>
            <li>These are great for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Great for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>and it is so easy to have them delivered right to the front door.</li>
            <li>These have been great at preventing dry mouth through the night!</li>
            <li>I had been warned by my dentist that I needed to use special toothpaste and mouthwash, but did not tell me about this product.  </li>
            <li>It is the best product I have used to help me live with dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Great for use with CPAC,  super dry mouth and cancer side effects.</li>
            <li>Xylitol is an amazing natural product.</li>
            <li>I have not tried using two at night, as recommended, so results would most likely improve.&lt;br /&gt;Not 100% effective for me, but worth using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try the mint free for the first time, but I do enjoy the mint too.  </li>
            <li>They stay in place good and last for hrs</li>
            <li>I have tried similar melts that were not as good.</li>
            <li>It seems to need a full 20 seconds of holding the mint there for it to stick well.</li>
            <li>So much so that I have anxiety about not being able to swallow.</li>
            <li>Everything the manufacture states is true.  </li>
            <li>They are slightly sweet tasting but after a couple of minutes</li>
            <li>Love the gentle mint taste.</li>
            <li>Many thanks to who ever thought these up.</li>
            <li>I wish they wouldn&#x27;t make these so sweet.  </li>
            <li>Plus, she enjoys the sweet taste which isn&#x27;t overpowering because she&#x27;s not a candy fan.</li>
            <li>Can get a full night of sleep now.  </li>
            <li>FIND THAT THEY ARE TOO SWEET FOR MY TASTE, AND EXPENSIVE,&lt;br /&gt;CAN&#x27;T</li>
            <li>I never used to get a full nights sleep.</li>
            <li>One or two is probably good enough for someone who doesn&#x27;t have to talk as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They stick to your teeth, and gently keep your mouth moist for many hours.</li>
            <li>Also need one on each side for full coverage.  </li>
            <li>Supposedly, these have a slightly sweet flavor, but I don&#x27;t taste anything</li>
            <li>They are true sleep savers.</li>
            <li>side is tan and sticks to ur teetth or gums to just sit there all night and encourage saliva.&lt;br /&gt;Other products for same are not as good.</li>
            <li>night, I&#x27;ve had no bad side affects.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>These amazing little pills have improved her quality of life greatly, she can get a decent nights rest now.</li>
            <li>If you suffer from dry mouth but are sensitive to mint, these are an excellent choice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is by far the best product for Dry Mouth I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I originally ordered the Xylimelts in Mint and was VERY PLEASED with not only the performance, but the taste.  </li>
            <li>By far the best solution I have found for dry mouth!  </li>
            <li>I have had the mild mint flavored ones and prefer them.</li>
            <li>a lot of lozenges would not work for me because they&#x27;d be gone too quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The &amp;#34;adhesive&amp;#34; is adequate to quite good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>whatever reason, to use these overnight is a lifesaver as far as being able to sleep comfortably through the night, which is what my housemate uses them for.</li>
            <li>i like the mild flavor of the mint-free.&lt;br /&gt;teresa</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li>They melt so quickly that they require popping one every 20 nutes or so.</li>
            <li>I even slept with a water bottle 2 inches from my face to access water quickly.  </li>
            <li>Amazon will get it to you quickly.</li>
            <li>Super easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had tried the gel version of Biotene but that seemed to dissipate quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I forget it&#x27;s there quickly.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t slept so well in about three years when I first experienced dry mouth at night.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products but these are the easiest and most effective.  </li>
            <li>However I am seeing more and more that are completely flat on one side.  </li>
            <li>No unpleasant flavor.</li>
            <li>No unpleasant plastic texture.</li>
            <li>The taste is ever so slightly sweet (non mint variety), and makes my breath feel fresh without the harsher minty taste of toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I use these all the time because my dentist said they were good for dry mouth problems.</li>
            <li>These melts are good if one didn&#x27;t have another source for products for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>They taste good and keep my throat from feeling dry.  </li>
            <li>Good product - helps with dry mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a good &#x27;help&#x27; for dry mouth over night.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes for a peaceful night !</li>
            <li>about I thought it would be nice to be able to drink a beverage without having the slight mint flavor.  </li>
            <li>They are excellent for controlling dry mouth any time but especially during the night.</li>
            <li>This product was a wonderful find next to the dry mouth rinses.</li>
            <li>Well, these little guys are great to put against your gums at night and never have to wake up with that parched misery again.  </li>
            <li>I personally feel they are the best around for dry mouth!</li>
            <li>Lasts much longer that a sugar/typical sugar free mint.</li>
            <li>Might be worth a try if you take a bunch of medicine that dries you up.</li>
            <li>the curvature of the melt fits nicely against one of your back teeth.  </li>
            <li>They really help with the dry mouth situation and have a mild pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>When I sleep with these, although they are gone when I wake, my mouth is relieved, moist and fresh.</li>
            <li>but I rarely need another one at that point for it seems to have a residual effect.</li>
            <li>I have used XyleMelts for several years and was pleased to see them available through Smile.</li>
            <li>He couldn&#x27;t tolerate the Biotene or similar products more readily available.  </li>
            <li>Xylitol is a naturally derived sweetener that helps feed your healthy bacteria in the body.</li>
            <li>If you talk for a living, as I do, they help compliment water, and keep your breath fresh.</li>
            <li>Upon waking the following morning, he was thrilled.</li>
            <li>I could not say enough nice things about this.  </li>
            <li>I use Xylimelts every night I wake up with a feeling of a fresh mouth and</li>
            <li>Keep a supply handy; these are different in that they adhere to your teeth or the side of your jaw.  </li>
            <li>You would have to decide if the cost was worth 10 minutes times 80.</li>
            <li>Use 2 with Cpap and wake up with moist fresh mouth.</li>
            <li>She is much more comfortable when taking these tabs daily - she won&#x27;t go a day without them.</li>
            <li>I tried EVERYTHING on the market without any success.</li>
            <li>Very satisfying for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>I have tried several other products and the Xylimelts have proved to work best.</li>
            <li>No after taste, but you can feel a slight coating in the morning and best of all no dry mouth.</li>
            <li>The one that has a picture of tree bark on the right side of the box.  </li>
            <li>and it is just right for the rest of the night.  </li>
            <li>no bad taste, and they last most of the night.  </li>
            <li>really work and allow him to get a full night sleep and not wake up during the night in search&lt;br</li>
            <li>The taste is OK, not great, but better than most of the sprays I have used.</li>
            <li>so I ordered the mint-free and they had little flavor but it was pleasant.</li>
            <li>BUT for those of us with a dry mouth issue .. I was just grateful to my wonderful dentist who told me about one of these products .. which with research led me to the other solutions.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing antidote for dry mouth .</li>
            <li>I also got a good checkup from my hygenist and she notices less plaque and</li>
            <li>Sometimes I split them in half with a razor blade because they are just that good.</li>
            <li>Mouth was kind of dry and sticky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s effective in treating dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping one something that really made more moisture or soothing action, but these just increase salivation around the site you adhere them.</li>
            <li>Which, for someone with dry mouth is actually a nice thing to experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My radiologist suggested XyliMelts and they have been very, very helpful.</li>
            <li>Other xerostomia sufferers have raved about this product, so I was very hopeful for good results</li>
            <li>Plus, they&#x27;re much less expensive - and a good bargain is always welcome!  </li>
            <li>mild pleasant taste, long lasting.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the stomach issues the next day I would have continued trying to see if it worked better.</li>
            <li>They work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!! .</li>
            <li>Tooth pastes are Ok but do not actually &#x27;fix&#x27; the dry-mouth issue.  </li>
            <li>Everyone (over 50 patients) have reported back to me that they LOVE them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Really does help!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>one on each side to get a higher dose.</li>
            <li>First thing that ever lasted.</li>
            <li>This product really works!  </li>
            <li>Therefore, flavor additives only burn the tissues more.</li>
            <li>The mint free Xylimelts do not irritate the soft tissues at all.</li>
            <li>These really work!</li>
            <li>The Xylimelts are long lasting and stick to your gum, so are a great benefit when sleeping.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this for one of our patients and she says they work really well!</li>
            <li>Not only are they healthy, I no longer wake in the morning</li>
            <li>These Xylimelts really help!</li>
            <li>Not so sure it was encouraging me to salivate enough to keep up with it&#x27;s gel-making qualities, though.  </li>
            <li>These are absolute life savers!</li>
            <li>It would be better if they were all white.</li>
            <li>First, they are a bit tricky to attach to your teeth.  </li>
            <li>The mints do in fact stick to the inside of your mouth, which I was somewhat cautious about at first.</li>
            <li>I just stick one between my cheek and molar on each side, and within a couple of minutes they are stuck pretty well.  </li>
            <li>the first night i used one of these, you can imagine my surprise when i woke up</li>
            <li>Love it for extra moisture when I am exercising or sleeping.</li>
            <li>When i finally located them on-line, I bought many and gave them away as hostess gifts.</li>
            <li>REALLY!</li>
            <li>They are not difficult to remove when you want to do so, but they also do not wash away every time you wash your hands or shower.</li>
            <li>it allows you to wind the bandage below the first knuckle, so it stays on no matter what type of work you</li>
            <li>but this is my first review.  </li>
            <li>but it was not on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>No ill effects from infrequent use.</li>
            <li>I had a bit of difficulty placing them on rear molars and getting them to stay at first, but after the first box I got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>Oral Balance helps but XyliMelts are better and last longer during the night.</li>
            <li>I have been consistently taking this product for almost a year.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to find Xylimelts in our local drug stores.</li>
            <li>It seemed like using only one worked as well - which makes them an even better price alternative to the Biotene gel.</li>
            <li>This product has helped me the most especially at night time.</li>
            <li>have tried many many products for this condition nothing lasts very long except Spry mint gum during the day but chewing gum gets old fast.  </li>
            <li>These work great for those with dry mouth problems, especially those of us with Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome.</li>
            <li>Great product, especially if you find that you wake up during the night with a dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Great for problems with chronic dry mouth, especially if you are using a CPAP machine for sleep apnea.</li>
            <li>If you suffer from dry mouth this works great, especially at night</li>
            <li>Putting one of these in my mouth every night is my new routine, and that&#x27;s cool with me..</li>
            <li>They are such a great thing for my severe dry mouth!  </li>
            <li>The next day thought I would try one more time sipping on more water this time to activate the melt but same thing occurred my mouth became even more dry.  </li>
            <li>The reviews were pretty positive</li>
            <li>Better than nothing, but not a lot better than just sucking on a cough drop or hard candy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure i will be on these as long as i need the machine at night....</li>
            <li>They worked when I first started using them and now, not so much.  </li>
            <li>First product that really worked.  </li>
            <li>After the first night of using product i went straight to the internet to find them.</li>
            <li>--they simply adhere to the roof of your mouth &amp; they make sure there is a steady supply of saliva.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars because of the high cost (one of the reasons why I only use them when absolutely necessary), and I don&#x27;t really like the sweet taste, mild as it is, in my mouth while I&#x27;m trying to sleep, but it&#x27;s more tolerable than a parched, burning mouth.</li>
            <li>These little melts work very good for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>I suffer from dry mouth at night and have tried several dry mouth lozenges and in my opinion these are the best.</li>
            <li>simple concept, leveraging the properties of xylitol that is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed no allergic reactions or side effects.</li>
            <li>I used to wake up at night many times with dry mouth, needing to drink water; then I would wake up to go to the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>but I think there are better ways to deal with dry mouth.</li>
            <li>I tried many products for my dry mouth.</li>
            <li>If you have dry mouth, you will love these.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products for chronic dry mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many dry mouth products and nothing works like XyliMelts!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product did keep a nightly dry mouth more moist ...</li>
            <li>Able to sleep through the night without waking up with dry mouth....</li>
            <li>I first tried Biotene Oralbalance since it was available locally and was recommended by my dentist.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t find a better product for dry mouth on the market today.  </li>
            <li>My husband has struggled with dry mouth at night for many years.  </li>
            <li>Did not alleviate dry mouth any more than sucking on anything else.  </li>
            <li>I love the xylimetls for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>easy to use and last longer than otc products...</li>
            <li>These helped my dry mouth more than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I had no new cavities and may be able to go 4 months rather than every 3 months to have my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li>Use two or more every single night.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without the Xylimelts!!</li>
            <li>Melts are nicely packaged so they don&#x27;t escape and make a mess inside your purse.&lt;br /&gt;Janelle</li>
            <li>good taste and relieves dry mouth for short time</li>
            <li>Far superior to the gel I previously uaed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricy for a sugar cube, but it sure beats a dry mouth!</li>
            <li>I have tried all the regular stuff for dry mouth, lozenges - sugar free of course - but these are so much better.  </li>
            <li>Also, I sleep better because my mouth is not so dry during the night!</li>
            <li>Excellent when water or other beverages are not available!</li>
            <li>XyliMelts for dry mouth really works especially at night.&lt;br /&gt;Allows for a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>These kind of work in that they do produce a little saliva</li>
            <li>But I will go back to the oral gel I had been using, very good but not nearly as effective as this product.</li>
            <li>works great for dry mouth due Cpap machine</li>
            <li>This is one great product for those who suffer with dry, particularly due from medications.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also 100% sure I won&#x27;t be losing any more teeth due to my night time dry mouth because it&#x27;s a thing of the past!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to amazon prime shipping</li>
            <li>My dentist gave me a few samples and I finally slept great during the night.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to find a product that would give me a whole night&#x27;s sleep...</li>
            <li>Xylitol seems to be the answer, it really is.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to anyone who reviewed it</li>
            <li>It was much easier to sleep with the disc adhered to the roof of my mouth.</li>
            <li>These were for my husband and he said they worked really well.</li>
            <li>Nothing much to say here except that these work as advertised.</li>
            <li>These work really well.</li>
            <li>and they work really well</li>
            <li>and I really hoped they&#x27;d work.</li>
            <li>Dont work very well.</li>
            <li>I have Sjogren&#x27;s disease and these really work for me.  </li>
            <li>Same for both  the tablets with mint flavor and the mint free.</li>
            <li>I recommend them, absolutely.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely a miracle.</li>
            <li>They are about the size of an aspirin and the adhesive doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>This really works  </li>
            <li>this has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>These really work well.</li>
            <li>One at night works and doesn&#x27;t have much taste at all.  </li>
            <li>Very unobtrusive.</li>
            <li>taste is very</li>
            <li>When medications keep your mouth from staying moist, these pills really work.  </li>
            <li>and this product really helped her.  </li>
            <li>I really like these Xylimelts.  </li>
            <li>It really does work well.</li>
            <li>These xylimelts works really well.</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR CARRY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>These help me so much at night.</li>
            <li>really helps for sleeping at night</li>
            <li>Keeps mouth from drying up too much.</li>
            <li>The product is convenient to use and has assisted with my lack of saliva by providing much needed moisture.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>XyliMelts are very helpful, mitigating the problem by about 90%.  </li>
            <li>these work very well and are not too &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34</li>
            <li>and I do not drink as much water as I used to</li>
            <li>Worked really well, but caused an allergic reaction in my mouth.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely AMAZING!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it in hopes of finding something that really worked</li>
            <li>Also, they don&#x27;t have much of a taste (thank goodness) which is distracting.</li>
            <li>I put one on either side at night and sleep straight through.  </li>
            <li>and she found it to be very helpful as well.  </li>
            <li>But once the intense dryness is gone, I put one of these in and fall asleep.  </li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>These mints worked very well.</li>
            <li>They really work.</li>
            <li>They really do stay put all night.</li>
            <li>You really forget that they are there.</li>
            <li>Very succelssful.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I take a medication that is very drying to throat and mouth tissues.  </li>
            <li>Really works well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it goes fast....</li>
            <li>The XyliMelts really help.  </li>
            <li>They stay in place and really help the dryness in the mouth.</li>
            <li>Very inconspicuous when used.</li>
            <li>Maybe I was expecting too much.  </li>
            <li>however, the product itself didn&#x27;t really satisfy my needs.  </li>
            <li>so this probably really screwed up saliva glands.  </li>
            <li>Just that it didn&#x27;t really meet my needs.</li>
            <li>I simply keep water and Biotene available.</li>
            <li>I REALLY like it.</li>
            <li>The adhesive side really works and dissolves as well.</li>
            <li>and we kept a really close eye on my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a C-Pap machine and Xylimelts is very helpful with the dryness factor.</li>
            <li>I started trying every &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; OTC product I could find and was very grateful to find this</li>
            <li>Drinking water did not help as mouth dryness continued very soon after drinking, and I would wake up needing to drink again.  </li>
            <li>These work really well.  </li>
            <li>Ask your order pickers to be more careful.</li>
            <li>But they dissolve to fast.</li>
            <li>works VERY well, except that it is cheaper to buy 2 x 40 at Rite-Aid rather Amazon</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t fully accept the whole &#x27;stuck to my gum and let it melt&#x27; thing.</li>
            <li>my life and swollowing much bettter</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li>Only con is the price but worth every penny for the relief you get!</li>
            <li>I would give 5 stars to the mint ones because they add a refreshing flavor and scent to the other benefits of the product.</li>
            <li>I have tried other gels and mints but nothing works better than OraCoat XyliMelts.</li>
            <li>I find that this is better than an other products I have tried...</li>
            <li>After that it&#x27;s fine, as long as you don&#x27;t fool with it with your tongue.</li>
            <li>Most bandages slide off your active fingers</li>
            <li>The first few nights he wasn&#x27;t sure, but he loves them now.</li>
            <li>I got my XyliMelts very quickly, and my nighttime dry mouth is a thing of the past!&lt;br</li>
            <li>These little tablets are great for increasing saliva for dry mouth conditions.</li>
            <li>thanks to other Amazon users reviews ! : )&lt;</li>
            <li>One tablet does not last the whole night but it suffices to keep my mouth adequately lubricated</li>
            <li>So when I am really bothered during the day or as I try to fall asleep, this does not provide quick enough relief.  </li>
            <li>They are the best solution to serious dry mouth that I have found so far.</li>
            <li>They simply have a slightly sweet taste.  </li>
            <li>Mine is outrageously dry due to medications, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a fair trial.</li>
            <li>I went to the dentist to have my teeth cleaned and they gave me a free sample at their office of the Xylimelts because I have dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>My dental hygienist gave me free samples of this product to try when I told her I wake up in the night with a dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>I guess this is a condition that a lot of people have as they grow older.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t know, Xylimelts main ingredietn is xylitol.</li>
            <li>I awake in the morning with a fresh tasting mouth and no dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>Using one tablet each night, a box of 60 Xylimelts will last 2 months and costs only slightly more than a 1.5 oz tube of Biotene OralBalance.</li>
            <li>it has a mild taste and works for several hours.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t create an excessive amount of saliva - just enough for me to be comfortable and able to sing.  </li>
            <li>LOL.)&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, with the price being so high AND the fact that they don&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about 3 months now and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I think that the price is a bit high.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for anyone who has saliva issues.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are good if you breathe out of your mouth, to keep your mouth less dry.</li>
            <li>They came so fast it surprised me too.</li>
            <li>I have been unable to find these in stores in my area, so I was happy to find them online.  </li>
            <li>Within a couple of days I had concrete results.</li>
            <li>I place two melts inside of my mouth on the gums near my back molars; either top or bottom, which I alternate each night.</li>
            <li>As long as I make sure they are secured, they remain in place for the entire night, throughout my sleep.</li>
            <li>and i wake up with my mouth moist and normal</li>
            <li>They last most of the night and by morning my mouth is not so dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried XyliMelts and somewhat finds it okay and pop in two into mouth when I awaken by the dry mouth and soon can go back to sleep again.</li>
            <li>I have tried the mint flavored one, which some don&#x27;t prefer, and I like it more than this plain version.</li>
            <li>Since I started placing one tablet on the upper right molar before going to sleep, sthe dryness has stopped.</li>
            <li>and I put in another one and go right back to sleep.</li>
            <li>I use a cpap machine to sleep at night with a full mask and before Xylimelts my mouth would be so dry .</li>
            <li>My new dental hygienist recommended this product</li>
            <li>I got these to try something new, but was not hopeful.  </li>
            <li>and I cannot live without them.  </li>
            <li>Since I have started using the XyliMelts, I can sleep pretty much all night long.  </li>
            <li>I find that if I use only one, it works as far as preventing dry mouth, though two would probably work better.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately they weren&#x27;t available in the pharmacy I use most often, so their availability on Amazon is another plus for me.</li>
            <li>I love these little things!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes they last only a couple of hours (when I end up not going right to sleep) and most other times up to 3 or 4 hours.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>His medical oncologist from Mass General suggested XyliMelts and it has made tremendous difference...</li>
            <li>Tried another brand but strongly prefers these, and they give him long lasting relief throughout the night</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I use them every night, and voila, the tooth decay went away completely!</li>
            <li>Any other products that I was able to find to help him all had flavor added - especially mint.</li>
            <li>First I thought my mouth was coming open as I slept</li>
            <li>For the first month of use I tried different places to stick them.  </li>
            <li>I am now able to sleep through the night as I do not have the former extreme mouth dryness waking me.</li>
            <li>Have tried many different products from Biotene over the last 10 years, and recently found this online.</li>
            <li>The only product (and I have tried them all) that has worked and brought continuous comfort.&lt;br /&gt;No more dry mouth!!!  </li>
            <li>Am thrilled to finally find something that really works for extreme dry mouth.</li>
            <li>I take a med that causes perpetual dry mouth in the afternoons, this product in both the mint and mint-free takes care of it along with keeping my breath fresh.  </li>
            <li>I pop one in according to directions and it last up to several hours of a sweet tasting moist mouth</li>
            <li>These are hard to find where I live, and I was glad to see that Amazon carried them.  </li>
            <li>They are fairly hard tablets and aren&#x27;t very comfortable to have between you cheeks and gums.  </li>
            <li>I gave her a sleeve of the melts  to try and the next morning she came over early to tell me that it was the first night of complete rest she had had in six years..</li>
            <li>I Really Do Prefer the Slightly Mint Fresh Flavor. .</li>
            <li>Stickey wet feeling is slightly better than completely dry mouth</li>
            <li>I think I would get just as much relief from dry mouth sucking on a much cheaper lozenge.</li>
            <li>I do not get the ultimate 6 hours of benefit, but certainly 2 to 3 hours.  </li>
            <li>It says use 2 at a time, but for me 1 at a time has been fine, I usually wake up and put in a second one after the first is gone.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I think the mint flavored version is a little better -</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m up due to the pain but can fall asleep quickly because of the XyliMelts, they work great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am SO HAPPY I just desperately searched &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; again on Amazon.</li>
            <li>: I want to make it clear that I don&#x27;t have an allergy to xylitol, in fact I try to get 5 servings a day of Xlear products (sweetener, nasal spray), on the recommendation of my dentist.</li>
            <li>I tried one of the &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; put it on my cheek area and it stuck on it with no moistening action at all I had to pull the melt off of the cheek tissue.  </li>
            <li>A dental hygienist told me about the melts - she had seen an article in her professional magazine.  </li>
            <li>Xylitol in the mint is a natural swetener that has antibacterial properties.</li>
            <li>Was surprised though to learn that you need to use two and &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; them to your teeth.  </li>
            <li>So for those with sensitive stomachs ...</li>
            <li>I find these Xylimelts helpful to stay asleep longer instead of waking up frequently to find my tongue stuck to my soft palate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s usually completely melted</li>
            <li>I also developed sleep apnea as a result of all the treatment and now use a c-pap.</li>
            <li>—in other words, I needed to experiment a little; at times the tablets felt a little bulky in my mouth, Overall though, the experience has been great!</li>
            <li>Third, they did absolutely nothing to promote saliva.  </li>
            <li>(once I forgot to put the tablet in and wow, i woke up with my mouth</li>
            <li>My 73-year old Mom is hooked on these things.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the mint ones, as they tend to hurt my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I developed headaches every morning</li>
            <li>I like them so much I tried them 3 separate times, using a smaller dose each time.</li>
            <li>If you have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome, another different product that can be very helpful.</li>
            <li>These last for hours and really do increase the salivary flow.</li>
            <li>The salivation helped, but did not cure the dryness near my throat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is nothing else that comes close to the length  of relief XyliMelts offers.  </li>
            <li>** If you have mildly sensitive stomach, DO NOT use this product.</li>
            <li>so order from Amazon direct....</li>
            <li>especially when I have to give a presentation, I can get through the whole thing without having to &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying them for the last few months now and love them.</li>
            <li>so I have been forced to break off the backing in order to be able to use the rest of the melts.  </li>
            <li>These didn&#x27;t work for me at all, rather they created a thick coating in my mouth which was more troublesome than the problem it was purchased to correct.  </li>
            <li>I would drink some of the water I kept beside my bed and then go back to sleep, only to wake up once again with dry mouth or a very full bladder.  </li>
            <li>Since I started using these, when I wake up in the middle of the night with &amp;#34;cotton mouth&amp;#34; I just pop one in my mouth and go right back to sleep.</li>
            <li>would recommend these to anyone who suffers from dry mouth and wants to find a way to keep their mouth healthy, and their teeth strong.  </li>
            <li>By this time the dry mouth problem returns until I take my first drink of the day.</li>
            <li>thank you Amazon for leading me to a dry mouth solution that really works and works so efficiently !</li>
            <li>I just recommend something a little better tasting and quicker acting for intense bouts of dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Because I take several medications, my mouth is always dry, no matter how much water I drink,  These lozenges work very well to keep my mouth moist, even when I&#x27;m sleeping.  </li>
            <li>I put to capsules in my mouth around 7 PM just outside of my molars and noticed more saliva than usual flowing from my molar area to my tongue.</li>
            <li>only use one tablet, but the directions suggest using two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found these first on Amazon and later was given a sample by my dentist.  </li>
            <li>This product is the first I&#x27;ve tried that actually WORKS, especially at nighttime.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to push the little tab out of the cellophane and just hold it on my gum for ten seconds and voila!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other dry mouth products (Biotene spray, Biotene oral gel, Biotene gum, other xylitol lozenges) that have helped for a short time (a few minutes here and there), but these are just incredible!  </li>
            <li>These have helped greatly in dealing with a dry mouth, which can be detrimental to oral health, as well as uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Xyliment keep my mouth moist thru 90% of the night , and allow me a better night&#x27;s sleep without constantly waking due to dry mouth.</li>
            <li>Sugar free candies usually have sorbitol in them; it does not agree with me.</li>
            <li>I use Xylimelts once in awhile in situations where I can&#x27;t chew gum and don&#x27;t want to drink too much (like long flights, meetings).</li>
            <li>For people with Chronic dry mouth at night I would certainly recommend that you try it.</li>
            <li>This worked really well and lasted a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had chronic dry mouth/nose/sinuses/skin my whole life.  </li>
            <li>She has suffered so much with the dry mouth and Xylimelts help cope her situation.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t really do anything for my dry mouth symptoms; rather than activating my salivary glands, they just turned to slime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am giving the XyliMelts five stars because it really does conquer my dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>This should really help with the cavities I got from the dry mouth condition.</li>
            <li>Works really well overnight to prevent dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>dry mouth was getting to be a real problem including issues with my teeth.</li>
            <li>I am a CPac user and my mouth wants to come&lt;br /&gt;open and dry out.  </li>

            <li>Really helped my dry mouth</li>
            <li>Dry mouth is still very bothersome.  </li>
            <li>I find XyliMelts for Dry Mouth are very convenient (and efficient) to use when I am in Church or in a meeting where I need to speak or sing without it being noticeable that I have something in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for dry mouth sufferers.</li>
            <li>Now I am on medications that dry out my mouth too and may be affecting how fast they dissolve.</li>
            <li>they work very well to keep my mouth from being dry.</li>
            <li>I take a lot of meds that cause dry mouth and Xylimelts really help with that.  </li>
            <li>Now, I place two above my teeth line, they stick really well, and last all night.</li>
            <li>Really prevents dry mouth during night!</li>
            <li>Odd as it may seed, many MD&#x27;s are not aware of some simple aides to the ravishes of throat cancer that are over the counter.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for anyone who suffers from dry mouth due to medications.</li>
            <li>Generally need 2-3 per night.</li>
            <li>For YEARS, she has complained about a terribly dry mouth each night (most likely from her medications) but this is the only thing that has helped her sleep throughout the night (which translates to a steady 4 hours).</li>
            <li>The dryness was affecting my enunciation and diction and clear communication is key.</li>
            <li>The tablets come in blister packs, small enough to fit into a pocket of a jacket or of a purse.</li>
            <li>For night I&#x27;ve always HAD to have some water near my bed for the several times per night</li>
            <li>but at the same time  I developed a chronic nighttime cough.  </li>
            <li>maybe I expected too much.  </li>
            <li>The sticky part is actually made from acacia which is a naturally sticky tree sap.</li>
            <li>I have chronic dry mouth and so far, these are the only product that allow me to get a decent night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>I place one onto the inside of my upper cheek at bedtime and by morning it has completely dissolved.</li>
            <li>I have only used these for two nights so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered from many gum line cavities as a result of medications, and was tired of chewing gum and sucking on cough drops.  </li>
            <li>If you ever get a dry mouth (public speaking, while sleeping, after certain medications, etc.)</li>
            <li>It takes a little time for it to stick to my tooth or gum, and it does not help right away.  </li>
            <li>and he was so interested he began writing down the name of &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34; drug.  </li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering with night time dry mouth.</li>

            <li>It only takes a second to pop a new one in my mouth</li>
            <li>you other smart Amazon users.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Really helpful for dry mouth, especially at night.  </li>
            <li>i had such dry mouth from medications, i woke in the night and my mouth felt like paper; sipping water didn&#x27;t really help.  </li>
            <li>Normally that time frame works as my dry mouth doesn&#x27;t begin until then after I&#x27;ve gone to bed.  </li>
            <li>At least until something more long lasting comes along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Due to medications I have to take, I really need to keep my mouth moist while I&#x27;m on the go during the day and at bedtime.</li>
            <li>I used to get very dehydrated due to taking medications and had to drink a lot of water.</li>
            <li>know they don&#x27;t claim to stop cavities but without the dry mouth and my new commitment to see my dentist three times a year and</li>
            <li>Curad bandages really stick for a long, long time.</li>
            <li>While the brown side does become sticky whe wet, the white tablet side becomes very slippery.  </li>
            <li>My mouth is not dry throughout the night.</li>
            <li>I no long use any of the Biotene products, because they are inferior products now!</li>
            <li>They sort of sit between a molar and your gum, actually last at least an hour, probably would work better on someone without such a dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>I also find the ancillary oral health benefits from the Xylitol to be readily apparent although this is used in conjunction with an overall regiment.</li>
            <li>She can&#x27;t say enough good things about them, and is giving boxes away like crazy for her friends to try them, she is such a fan.</li>
            <li>I have pretty severe dry mouth due to pain medications -- without these tabs</li>
            <li>First for a dry mouth due to some of my medications.  </li>
            <li>At first I was unhappy with this little lump stuck in my cheek but it became barely noticeable after a few minutes and worked great for hours.</li>
            <li>if my chronic pain syndrome and the dry mouth caused by my pain pills.&lt;br /&gt;I got them quickly via Amazon and have not been up again this time of night due to the dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>this seems to have resolved the dry mouth issue completely.</li>
            <li>It has completely cured my dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>I take a handful of meds that dry out my mouth and have need for frequent nighttime water breaks.  </li>
            <li>This product has saved me completely from my dry mouth discomfort.</li>
            <li>wake up with a cool, moist, refreshing mouth rather than a dry, coarse, and sometimes painful one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used my first box of 60 and am a few nights into this, my second order.</li>
            <li>but I can usually get right back to sleep.  </li>
            <li>The short of it is, I developed severely dry mouth from use of medications.</li>
            <li>Very occasionally I still get dry, but no where near the degree I did before</li>
            <li>Good for dry mouth, but sometimes fall off in mouth which can be dangerous for aspiration</li>
            <li>A great solution to an extremely bad case of chronic, constant dry mouth brought on by health issues.</li>
            <li>Got these for my 92 year old mother, she has very dry mouth because of her age and medications she is on.</li>
            <li>The plain and mild mint varieties provide the least amount of irritation to sensitive soft tissue.</li>
            <li>I and a pastor who had tongue cancer and the subsequent radiation was tough but these help when I speak or when I sleep plus my dentist loves them because he says they help prevent tooth decay (extra important with decrease salivary activity).</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m over the moon with joy and relief!.</li>
            <li> Stoppers4 spray and Biotine gel provided the best relief, but now the formulation for Biotine has changed.  </li>
            <li> Awesome product.</li>
            <li> find for nighttime use, the mint melts tended to upset my stomach, but the non-mint is perfect (I do like the mint product for daytime use).</li>

            <li> It is brilliant.</li>
            <li> These tablets work perfectly, as advertised, and this is also the best deal on this item that I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
            <li> They work great for me.</li>
            <li> and I am so happy she did.</li>
            <li> I just wish I could get my insurance to pay for these lol..</li>
            <li> They stay put, taste great and work all night.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t stimulate saliva production and while the sticking the inside of the cheek is a great feature</li>
            <li> My doctor suggested it and it works great.</li>
            <li> And they are great during the day if you take medicine that dries your mouth.</li>
            <li> These are great.</li>

            <li> Very effective at keeping one&#x27;s mouth moist during the night.  </li>
            <li> I really like these and now sleep thru the night!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> These are amazing!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what makes Xylimelts so amazing!</li>
            <li> They are amazing!  </li>
            <li> These things are amazing!</li>
            <li> My mouth is nice and moist all through the night now!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find this in the stores, but Amazon has the best deal, I&#x27;m sure, and that&#x27;s where I stock up.</li>
            <li> One more drop of mint, would be wonderful.</li>
            <li> There are so many excellent reviews on these mints that I hope the price doesn&#x27;t go up.  </li>
            <li> They are truly remarkable.</li>
            <li> My hygienist was so impressed with how easy it was to remove the plaque.</li>
            <li> They are pleasant tasting and good for your teeth.</li>
            <li> A good product and good quality</li>
            <li> It may be a good product if one has some</li>
            <li> and they are fairly inexpensive so I&#x27;ll probably buy them again.</li>
            <li> they taste good</li>
            <li> They taste good and work day or night.</li>
            <li> Good.  </li>
            <li> The best part for him has been that they are available mint-free.</li>
            <li> I uses one tab per night and get a good night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
            <li> This works for a good 2 hours.</li>
            <li> but if you like mint those are good as well.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look good to me either.</li>
            <li> Taste good, too.</li>
            <li> It does work, but not quite as good as you&#x27;d like to see it work.</li>
            <li> These work fairly well.</li>
            <li> All those good ratings are misleading.</li>
            <li> Good idea in theory.</li>
            <li> The taste is good, but I wish it had a stronger minty flavor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and I will use it again.</li>
            <li> Good except I started getting sores on my gum line.</li>
            <li> These work great, mild pleasant taste,stay in place and no sugar!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s always nice and moist and the taste is extremely pleasant</li>
            <li> It continually emits a really pleasant mint taste into the mouth, and makes it fresh and very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results using Xylimelts in conjunction with my CPAP.</li>
            <li> So very glad I found them.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased...</li>
            <li> It adheres real easy.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the xylimelts.</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> My friend is very pleased.  </li>
            <li> am SO glad I found these!  </li>
            <li> I encourage you to learn more about it!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> the* best for your product lines and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I try these, and I am so glad he did!</li>
            <li> His home health care nurse recommended them, and we are glad she did!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found them and can get them from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> Best brand I have found - and really notice the difference if I run out of them!  </li>
            <li> These melts are easy to use, taste great.</li>
            <li> Great result from the very first try, and now I don&#x27;t wake up with the feeling of the Gobi desert in my mouth!</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> this product is just amazing...</li>
            <li> It is amazing how it works.  </li>
            <li> They are kind of sticky, and you can&#x27;t keep one in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Kind of between chalky and slimy?</li>
            <li> Nice to keep some in your pocket for day use too.</li>
            <li> nice to wake up with a moist mouth</li>
            <li> She has many patients who are elderly, and she has recommended Xylimelts to them with good results.</li>
            <li> so nice to  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take two to be effective for me, so I put one on each side of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Mouth was nice and moist till morning.</li>
            <li> This helped, but has to be applied heavily to be effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to not need to drink water all night to keep my mouth from drying.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I is good, but I expect better.  </li>
            <li> If you use this, check with your own dentist first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The time-release system is effective, and I have no problems with my cheeks or gums.</li>
            <li> This is a surprisingly effective product: it sticks well and keeps the mouth moist during the night.</li>
            <li> Handy to carry in my purse to use when an oral rinse is impractical.</li>
            <li> Xylimelts have a special disc for adhering comfortably to the side of my gums and are the perfect size and shape that I don&#x27;t even feel them in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> These are very easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not grainy or gelatiny  like another brand I tried, and although the xylitol is sweet, it&#x27;s not too sweet, and best of all, it won&#x27;t hurt my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These tabs are very easy to use, just slide between teeth and cheek.</li>
            <li> These are the best I have found so far.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worked the best for me so far.</li>
            <li> XyliMelts are natural and totally AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I like the mint-free ones the best, as sensitive mouth lining may be irritated by the mint flavoring.  </li>
            <li> Not too effective,  but better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use too!</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best for my dentures (doesn&#x27;t stick) and 3 pieces will keep me satisfied dry mouth wise, for 3-4 hours..</li>
            <li> It would be nice if they were more minty, and most of all, melted faster in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> The mints are very easy to use and are refreshing.</li>
            <li> Does not solve for the full night but certainly helps a great deal!</li>
            <li> it adhears to the inside of your mouth very securely.</li>
            <li> More doctors should know about this product as it would ease a lot of folks&#x27; suffering.  </li>
            <li> many of the pockets in the gums have disappeared.    </li>
            <li> I have not been able to sleep well because my tongue gets stuck to the top of my mouth within minutes of falling to sleep.</li>
            <li> sometimes I use those xylitol ice chips for dryness and eat too many and my tummy hurts.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to sit through the concert in comfort.  </li>
            <li> Sure helps if one uses a CPAP machine at night.</li>
            <li> so I was sure I had found the solution.  </li>
            <li> so I felt confident in ordering.</li>
            <li> Shopping and officiating at weddings are enjoyable again.</li>
            <li> I do love them; they&#x27;re so portable.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite of the products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Aside from keeping your mouth more moist, Xylitol is supposed to help to prevent tooth decay.</li>
            <li> As with many things this was an impulse buy.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Could you check if they still carry the refreshing Mint?  </li>
            <li> love these melts.  </li>
            <li> Like many consumers of XyliMelts, I have Sjögren&#x27;s Syndrome.</li>
            <li> My mouth has stayed more hydrated as I run races.</li>
            <li> have used these for some time now and love them</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am sure it works for some people, but I have put the box in our medicine cabinet and will wonder why I evern bought it.</li>
            <li> I just wish it had a bit more xylitol for a more anti-cariogenic effect, but I guess you could just pack two of these,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but I have to say this product has saved my sanity.  </li>
            <li> I may wake up once or twice, but many nights don&#x27;t wake up at all.  </li>
            <li> and I got much more relief.  </li>
            <li> I am sure this is to ensure that you do not fall asleep and choke on the melt.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Because I breathe through my mouth at night, I would wake up one or more times a night with cheeks and tongue feeling like sandpaper.  </li>
            <li> Love them</li>
            <li> Under the tongue seems to produce more saliva.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, they aren&#x27;t  cheap!</li>
            <li> Better than Biotene gel.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased that I now can use one while shopping.</li>
            <li> I learned of this product on the Cancer Survivors&#x27; Network, and it has truly been a life-saver for him, as for many others.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product !</li>
            <li> THE MINT FLAVOR BETTER.</li>
            <li> Acacia is known to also help support healthy bacteria in the body.</li>
            <li> They work well I just like the biotene gum better..</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have ordered additional boxes I am so sure I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> and it just wouldn&#x27;t be appropriate to be chewing gum or gulping from my water bottle every two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put one on the roof of my mouth before going to sleep and it lasts most of the night.</li>
            <li> I have started producing more saliva and with the combination of the XyliMelt and c-pap</li>
            <li> I love it and will not be without it ever.</li>
            <li> I love that they attached to your gum.  </li>
            <li> It has helped me sleep better too because I don&#x27;t wake up feeling parched.</li>
            <li> I am able to use one of these to get through the night without waking.  </li>
            <li> I have slept better with them.</li>
            <li> do not understand how this simple, effective (even brilliant)</li>
            <li> This shows that in today&#x27;s media driven society even the better mousetrap needs an advertising campaign.</li>
            <li> I prefer the mint free kind because if I am drinking something the mint taste doesn&#x27;t interfere with that</li>
            <li> I have been using Biotene oral gel for years and these work better.</li>
            <li> Love that they are not minty.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product on the market.</li>
            <li> He has used them for several months and they are still working GREAT!</li>
            <li> To my great surprise it really did work.  </li>
            <li> my body helped more.</li>
            <li> but it does contain Xylitol as its only sweetener, and is not acidic so it is the best night time lozenge for dental health.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too many a day as it includes xylitol.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about this wonderful product several years ago.</li>
            <li> i love them...</li>
            <li> It is Xylitol so checking  to make sure this form of sugar agrees with you would be advised.  </li>
            <li> The package says not to adhere to roof of mouth - but that is my favorite place.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for those with sjogrens and similar issues.</li>
            <li> I like these better.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found these online.</li>
            <li> Friends I gave them to love them.</li>
            <li> Have tried many products and this has been</li>
            <li> These are short lived and works best with Biotene gel.</li>
            <li> Came home, bought them and love them.  </li>
            <li> I use these tablets daily and they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Canker melts are better, but they dont make them anymore unfortunately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She is pleased with the way they help to keep her mouth moist.</li>
            <li> They are the most helpful product I have used.</li>
            <li> This has worked better for me than the spray products of this type.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d probably lose more teeth unless I came in for cleanings and check ups three times a year instead of two</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m confident my dentist won&#x27;t see a tooth loss pattern in my mouth.</li>
            <li> are so much better ...</li>
            <li> you make a great product at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I found the product helping me sleep a bit better.</li>
            <li> More long-lasting than an oral gel and more affordable.</li>
            <li> I prefer the 80 count box for economy, although, I think they cost more than they need to.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the Spry mints for daytime use.</li>
            <li> I have a better nights sleep using xyliments along with my Cpac machine.</li>
            <li> I had tried so many things.</li>
            <li> keep 4 by my bed :)</li>
            <li> worked better some nights than others</li>
            <li> I sleep so much better</li>
            <li> This one is the best I have tried but only lasts about 4 hours.  </li>
            <li> it seems to help more than some others I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The taste is ok</li>
            <li> They have literally made my mother&#x27;s quality of life better.  </li>
            <li> Most drug stores do not carry XyliMelts</li>
            <li> I like this product better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how that works ... but will try that.</li>
            <li> Lasts many hours and moistens mouth as you sleep.</li>
            <li> These tablets help to make his mouth feel better.</li>
            <li> The answer is yes.  :)</li>
            <li> I would be glad to recommend these for anyone, any age</li>
            <li> Tastes OK too.</li>
            <li> Great product to fight gingivitus; highly recommended by my dentist.    </li>
            <li> After trying many ideas to help combat dry mouth symptoms, XyliMelts have been the very best.  </li>
            <li> I tried Biotene spray which is pretty good but is not a spray</li>
            <li> These worked pretty good</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad taste and it makes sense that there would be some kind of flavor.  </li>

            <li> The best part is that if i want to just suck on these like a mint its very easy to break off the sticky layer in one piece with a little pressure from my front teeth before I pop it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I am a Throat Cancer survivor....been clean now for 4 years!</li>
            <li> cavities(I am REALLY on top of my dry mouth, using these at night, sugar free gum during the day, Paleo diet to avoid processed sugar) so I am very happy for this</li>
            <li> Much more comfortable throughout the night since I began using this item.</li>
            <li> These pills soothe me to sleep and take over an hour to melt completely which is great.  </li>
            <li> So far the product has been great.</li>
            <li> It works great so far.</li>
            <li> I wake up in the morning feeling more comfortable.</li>
            <li> The XyliMelts combined with the Waterpik is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> It still is not as good as your real saliva</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the other gels and pills and this product has worked the best for me.</li>
            <li> The taste of these little beauties isn&#x27;t the best, but the job they do more than makes up for it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> They are easy to carry and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic because you can use it comfortably and safely as you sleep.</li>
            <li> They easily adhere to the inside of your cheek and are innocuous during the night (unlike another brand).</li>
            <li> But the mint flavor is very mild and pleasing.</li>
            <li> It is long-lasting and very mildly flavored.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and seem to work well</li>
            <li> ONE of these tablets can easily kill your dog.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to dislodge and throw away.  </li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re easy to put in purse, bed table, etc.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use &amp; stay in place.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and work work for me.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t have a strong mint flavor but there is still something . . .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that there is a need to purchase the mint-free version, though, since the mint version is not too strong.</li>
            <li> It is an absolutely unprecedented essential item for your good health.</li>
            <li> Lasts till morning which is the first product I have found of this kind.  </li>
            <li> For dry mouth these are very good.  </li>
            <li> It is also very good for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Biotene products like toothpaste, mouthwash, moistners have been the most successful for moisturizing my mouth for short periods of time.</li>
            <li> The instructions for night-time use say to use two tablets, one for each side of your mouth, but I just use one, and it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> As for the usage they work just fine.</li>
            <li> it is fine - just drips out of mouth while sleeping once in a while...</li>
            <li> The directions say to use one disk on each side of your mouth, but I find one at a time works fine.  </li>
            <li> works just fine and no side effects.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li> They help tremendously!</li>
            <li> XyliMelts are more convenient for me to use rather than gel based products that dissipate all too quickly.  </li>
            <li> Moved on to Act lozenges,which provide the same relief, have a more pleasant mouth feel</li>
            <li> Love these they are great for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> The tabs help alleviate most of the dry mouth problems I have experienced</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not annoying, taste fine, and do the job.</li>
            <li> These little tablets are wonderful.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to use, relatively unobtrusive, and most of all, they work!!  </li>
            <li> This product has made a huge difference to me at night and during the day.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product that increases saliva production while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> XyliMelts have a light mint taste and you can use them while you sleep.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the ultimate, GREAT breath mint, also.</li>
            <li> Some rave about these, you just have to try what is available.</li>
            <li> I tried everything available, Biotene, mouth devices, etc.  </li>
            <li> Check the manufacturer&#x27;s website for free samples.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE MINT FREE VS.</li>
            <li> Important to me.  </li>
            <li> prefer mint free, and the taste is pleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sleeping soundly.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying the mint version of this product, if you aren&#x27;t against mint flavored products, but this mint free version has an almost neutral taste and lasts for about 3 hours while sleeping.</li>
            <li> i use it during the day if i do not have available water and every night.  </li>
            <li> The instructions says use one on each side; I tried using just one at a time, putting in a second one when I woke up in the night, and this approach worked great.</li>
            <li> They really do adhere nicely.</li>
            <li> I was using sugar free drops.  </li>
            <li> Thank you again for such great service.</li>
            <li> After some experimenting, I confirmed the Xylimelts caused it.</li>
            <li> Before using these I used sugar free life savers, which is a choke hazard.  </li>
            <li> I just think the mint free might help to not upset  my stomach.</li>
            <li> They help a great deal but don&#x27;t last the night</li>
            <li> sugar free cough drops still have sugars and have caused me to have cavities.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I tried these and will definitely keep buying them!</li>
            <li> My daughter in-law gave me a free sample.</li>
            <li> They are mint free, but I don&#x27;t know that I wouldn&#x27;t like mint.</li>
            <li> She says her mouth hasn&#x27;t felt this comfortable in years.  </li>
            <li> Far superior to Act.</li>
            <li> These have been the most successful product for helping to keep away dry mouth.</li>
            <li> You have maybe two seconds to make sure you placed it in the right spot in the mouth.</li>
            <li> The melt lasts an hour, two if you are very calm (asleep or not talking/moving the mouth).</li>
            <li> Very useful solution that I carry with me at all times.</li>
            <li> The Biotene PBF mouth rinse is very nice but doesn&#x27;t last any length of time.</li>
            <li> great for one who has problems with dry mouth, easy to use and apply.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer to use the original formula of Oral Balance because of the protective enzymes, but it is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> They are easy and quick to use, and I find that I prefer the mint-free version.</li>
            <li> After four rounds of radioiodine treatment for thyroid cancer, my salivary glands have mostly put their hands up in mute surrender and stopped producing very much saliva.  </li>
            <li> These are the absolute best mints for dry mouth caused by medications or CPAP.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL MINTS REALLY HELP WITH DRY MOUTH.</li>
            <li> I would give it a higher rating if I didn&#x27;t need so many in mouth at a time.</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth caused by medications.</li>
            <li> These are great for those of us suffering from dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Xylimelts work great for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth at night</li>
            <li> The mint-free work great and seem to have almost solved my dry mouth problem at night.</li>
            <li> These worked great to relieve my dry mouth at night</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth when using CPAP machine.</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth at night.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product if you suffer from dry mouth while asleep.</li>
            <li> These are great for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> and it is so easy to have them delivered right to the front door.</li>
            <li> These have been great at preventing dry mouth through the night!</li>
            <li> I had been warned by my dentist that I needed to use special toothpaste and mouthwash, but did not tell me about this product.  </li>
            <li> It is the best product I have used to help me live with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Great for use with CPAC,  super dry mouth and cancer side effects.</li>
            <li> Xylitol is an amazing natural product.</li>
            <li> I have not tried using two at night, as recommended, so results would most likely improve.&lt;br /&gt;Not 100% effective for me, but worth using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the mint free for the first time, but I do enjoy the mint too.  </li>
            <li> They stay in place good and last for hrs</li>
            <li> I have tried similar melts that were not as good.</li>
            <li> It seems to need a full 20 seconds of holding the mint there for it to stick well.</li>
            <li> So much so that I have anxiety about not being able to swallow.</li>
            <li> Everything the manufacture states is true.  </li>
            <li> They are slightly sweet tasting but after a couple of minutes</li>
            <li> Love the gentle mint taste.</li>
            <li> Many thanks to who ever thought these up.</li>
            <li> I wish they wouldn&#x27;t make these so sweet.  </li>
            <li> Plus, she enjoys the sweet taste which isn&#x27;t overpowering because she&#x27;s not a candy fan.</li>
            <li> Can get a full night of sleep now.  </li>
            <li> FIND THAT THEY ARE TOO SWEET FOR MY TASTE, AND EXPENSIVE,&lt;br /&gt;CAN&#x27;T</li>
            <li> I never used to get a full nights sleep.</li>
            <li> One or two is probably good enough for someone who doesn&#x27;t have to talk as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They stick to your teeth, and gently keep your mouth moist for many hours.</li>
            <li> Also need one on each side for full coverage.  </li>
            <li> Supposedly, these have a slightly sweet flavor, but I don&#x27;t taste anything</li>
            <li> They are true sleep savers.</li>
            <li> side is tan and sticks to ur teetth or gums to just sit there all night and encourage saliva.&lt;br /&gt;Other products for same are not as good.</li>
            <li> night, I&#x27;ve had no bad side affects.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> These amazing little pills have improved her quality of life greatly, she can get a decent nights rest now.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry mouth but are sensitive to mint, these are an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is by far the best product for Dry Mouth I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered the Xylimelts in Mint and was VERY PLEASED with not only the performance, but the taste.  </li>
            <li> By far the best solution I have found for dry mouth!  </li>
            <li> I have had the mild mint flavored ones and prefer them.</li>
            <li> a lot of lozenges would not work for me because they&#x27;d be gone too quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The &amp;#34;adhesive&amp;#34; is adequate to quite good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> whatever reason, to use these overnight is a lifesaver as far as being able to sleep comfortably through the night, which is what my housemate uses them for.</li>
            <li> i like the mild flavor of the mint-free.&lt;br /&gt;teresa</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> They melt so quickly that they require popping one every 20 nutes or so.</li>
            <li> I even slept with a water bottle 2 inches from my face to access water quickly.  </li>
            <li> Amazon will get it to you quickly.</li>
            <li> Super easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had tried the gel version of Biotene but that seemed to dissipate quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I forget it&#x27;s there quickly.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t slept so well in about three years when I first experienced dry mouth at night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products but these are the easiest and most effective.  </li>
            <li> However I am seeing more and more that are completely flat on one side.  </li>
            <li> No unpleasant flavor.</li>
            <li> No unpleasant plastic texture.</li>
            <li> The taste is ever so slightly sweet (non mint variety), and makes my breath feel fresh without the harsher minty taste of toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I use these all the time because my dentist said they were good for dry mouth problems.</li>
            <li> These melts are good if one didn&#x27;t have another source for products for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> They taste good and keep my throat from feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> Good product - helps with dry mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a good &#x27;help&#x27; for dry mouth over night.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes for a peaceful night !</li>
            <li> about I thought it would be nice to be able to drink a beverage without having the slight mint flavor.  </li>
            <li> They are excellent for controlling dry mouth any time but especially during the night.</li>
            <li> This product was a wonderful find next to the dry mouth rinses.</li>
            <li> Well, these little guys are great to put against your gums at night and never have to wake up with that parched misery again.  </li>
            <li> I personally feel they are the best around for dry mouth!</li>
            <li> Lasts much longer that a sugar/typical sugar free mint.</li>
            <li> Might be worth a try if you take a bunch of medicine that dries you up.</li>
            <li> the curvature of the melt fits nicely against one of your back teeth.  </li>
            <li> They really help with the dry mouth situation and have a mild pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> When I sleep with these, although they are gone when I wake, my mouth is relieved, moist and fresh.</li>
            <li> but I rarely need another one at that point for it seems to have a residual effect.</li>
            <li> I have used XyleMelts for several years and was pleased to see them available through Smile.</li>
            <li> He couldn&#x27;t tolerate the Biotene or similar products more readily available.  </li>
            <li> Xylitol is a naturally derived sweetener that helps feed your healthy bacteria in the body.</li>
            <li> If you talk for a living, as I do, they help compliment water, and keep your breath fresh.</li>
            <li> Upon waking the following morning, he was thrilled.</li>
            <li> I could not say enough nice things about this.  </li>
            <li> I use Xylimelts every night I wake up with a feeling of a fresh mouth and</li>
            <li> Keep a supply handy; these are different in that they adhere to your teeth or the side of your jaw.  </li>
            <li> You would have to decide if the cost was worth 10 minutes times 80.</li>
            <li> Use 2 with Cpap and wake up with moist fresh mouth.</li>
            <li> She is much more comfortable when taking these tabs daily - she won&#x27;t go a day without them.</li>
            <li> I tried EVERYTHING on the market without any success.</li>
            <li> Very satisfying for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other products and the Xylimelts have proved to work best.</li>
            <li> No after taste, but you can feel a slight coating in the morning and best of all no dry mouth.</li>
            <li> The one that has a picture of tree bark on the right side of the box.  </li>
            <li> and it is just right for the rest of the night.  </li>
            <li> no bad taste, and they last most of the night.  </li>
            <li> really work and allow him to get a full night sleep and not wake up during the night in search&lt;br</li>
            <li> The taste is OK, not great, but better than most of the sprays I have used.</li>
            <li> so I ordered the mint-free and they had little flavor but it was pleasant.</li>
            <li> BUT for those of us with a dry mouth issue .. I was just grateful to my wonderful dentist who told me about one of these products .. which with research led me to the other solutions.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing antidote for dry mouth .</li>
            <li> I also got a good checkup from my hygenist and she notices less plaque and</li>
            <li> Sometimes I split them in half with a razor blade because they are just that good.</li>
            <li> Mouth was kind of dry and sticky.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s effective in treating dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping one something that really made more moisture or soothing action, but these just increase salivation around the site you adhere them.</li>
            <li> Which, for someone with dry mouth is actually a nice thing to experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My radiologist suggested XyliMelts and they have been very, very helpful.</li>
            <li> Other xerostomia sufferers have raved about this product, so I was very hopeful for good results</li>
            <li> Plus, they&#x27;re much less expensive - and a good bargain is always welcome!  </li>
            <li> mild pleasant taste, long lasting.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the stomach issues the next day I would have continued trying to see if it worked better.</li>
            <li> They work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product!! .</li>
            <li> Tooth pastes are Ok but do not actually &#x27;fix&#x27; the dry-mouth issue.  </li>
            <li> Everyone (over 50 patients) have reported back to me that they LOVE them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Really does help!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> one on each side to get a higher dose.</li>
            <li> First thing that ever lasted.</li>
            <li> This product really works!  </li>
            <li> Therefore, flavor additives only burn the tissues more.</li>
            <li> The mint free Xylimelts do not irritate the soft tissues at all.</li>
            <li> These really work!</li>
            <li> The Xylimelts are long lasting and stick to your gum, so are a great benefit when sleeping.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for one of our patients and she says they work really well!</li>
            <li> Not only are they healthy, I no longer wake in the morning</li>
            <li> These Xylimelts really help!</li>
            <li> Not so sure it was encouraging me to salivate enough to keep up with it&#x27;s gel-making qualities, though.  </li>
            <li> These are absolute life savers!</li>
            <li> It would be better if they were all white.</li>
            <li> First, they are a bit tricky to attach to your teeth.  </li>
            <li> The mints do in fact stick to the inside of your mouth, which I was somewhat cautious about at first.</li>
            <li> I just stick one between my cheek and molar on each side, and within a couple of minutes they are stuck pretty well.  </li>
            <li> the first night i used one of these, you can imagine my surprise when i woke up</li>
            <li> Love it for extra moisture when I am exercising or sleeping.</li>
            <li> When i finally located them on-line, I bought many and gave them away as hostess gifts.</li>
            <li> REALLY!</li>
            <li> They are not difficult to remove when you want to do so, but they also do not wash away every time you wash your hands or shower.</li>
            <li> it allows you to wind the bandage below the first knuckle, so it stays on no matter what type of work you</li>
            <li> but this is my first review.  </li>
            <li> but it was not on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> No ill effects from infrequent use.</li>
            <li> I had a bit of difficulty placing them on rear molars and getting them to stay at first, but after the first box I got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> Oral Balance helps but XyliMelts are better and last longer during the night.</li>
            <li> I have been consistently taking this product for almost a year.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to find Xylimelts in our local drug stores.</li>
            <li> It seemed like using only one worked as well - which makes them an even better price alternative to the Biotene gel.</li>
            <li> This product has helped me the most especially at night time.</li>
            <li> have tried many many products for this condition nothing lasts very long except Spry mint gum during the day but chewing gum gets old fast.  </li>
            <li> These work great for those with dry mouth problems, especially those of us with Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome.</li>
            <li> Great product, especially if you find that you wake up during the night with a dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Great for problems with chronic dry mouth, especially if you are using a CPAP machine for sleep apnea.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry mouth this works great, especially at night</li>
            <li> Putting one of these in my mouth every night is my new routine, and that&#x27;s cool with me..</li>
            <li> They are such a great thing for my severe dry mouth!  </li>
            <li> The next day thought I would try one more time sipping on more water this time to activate the melt but same thing occurred my mouth became even more dry.  </li>
            <li> The reviews were pretty positive</li>
            <li> Better than nothing, but not a lot better than just sucking on a cough drop or hard candy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure i will be on these as long as i need the machine at night....</li>
            <li> They worked when I first started using them and now, not so much.  </li>
            <li> First product that really worked.  </li>
            <li> After the first night of using product i went straight to the internet to find them.</li>
            <li> --they simply adhere to the roof of your mouth &amp; they make sure there is a steady supply of saliva.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars because of the high cost (one of the reasons why I only use them when absolutely necessary), and I don&#x27;t really like the sweet taste, mild as it is, in my mouth while I&#x27;m trying to sleep, but it&#x27;s more tolerable than a parched, burning mouth.</li>
            <li> These little melts work very good for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry mouth at night and have tried several dry mouth lozenges and in my opinion these are the best.</li>
            <li> simple concept, leveraging the properties of xylitol that is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed no allergic reactions or side effects.</li>
            <li> I used to wake up at night many times with dry mouth, needing to drink water; then I would wake up to go to the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> but I think there are better ways to deal with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I tried many products for my dry mouth.</li>
            <li> If you have dry mouth, you will love these.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products for chronic dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many dry mouth products and nothing works like XyliMelts!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product did keep a nightly dry mouth more moist ...</li>
            <li> Able to sleep through the night without waking up with dry mouth....</li>
            <li> I first tried Biotene Oralbalance since it was available locally and was recommended by my dentist.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find a better product for dry mouth on the market today.  </li>
            <li> My husband has struggled with dry mouth at night for many years.  </li>
            <li> Did not alleviate dry mouth any more than sucking on anything else.  </li>
            <li> I love the xylimetls for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> easy to use and last longer than otc products...</li>
            <li> These helped my dry mouth more than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I had no new cavities and may be able to go 4 months rather than every 3 months to have my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li> Use two or more every single night.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without the Xylimelts!!</li>
            <li> Melts are nicely packaged so they don&#x27;t escape and make a mess inside your purse.&lt;br /&gt;Janelle</li>
            <li> good taste and relieves dry mouth for short time</li>
            <li> Far superior to the gel I previously uaed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricy for a sugar cube, but it sure beats a dry mouth!</li>
            <li> I have tried all the regular stuff for dry mouth, lozenges - sugar free of course - but these are so much better.  </li>
            <li> Also, I sleep better because my mouth is not so dry during the night!</li>
            <li> Excellent when water or other beverages are not available!</li>
            <li> XyliMelts for dry mouth really works especially at night.&lt;br /&gt;Allows for a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> These kind of work in that they do produce a little saliva</li>
            <li> But I will go back to the oral gel I had been using, very good but not nearly as effective as this product.</li>
            <li> works great for dry mouth due Cpap machine</li>
            <li> This is one great product for those who suffer with dry, particularly due from medications.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also 100% sure I won&#x27;t be losing any more teeth due to my night time dry mouth because it&#x27;s a thing of the past!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to amazon prime shipping</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a few samples and I finally slept great during the night.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to find a product that would give me a whole night&#x27;s sleep...</li>
            <li> Xylitol seems to be the answer, it really is.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to anyone who reviewed it</li>
            <li> It was much easier to sleep with the disc adhered to the roof of my mouth.</li>
            <li> These were for my husband and he said they worked really well.</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say here except that these work as advertised.</li>
            <li> These work really well.</li>
            <li> and they work really well</li>
            <li> and I really hoped they&#x27;d work.</li>
            <li> Dont work very well.</li>
            <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s disease and these really work for me.  </li>
            <li> Same for both  the tablets with mint flavor and the mint free.</li>
            <li> I recommend them, absolutely.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely a miracle.</li>
            <li> They are about the size of an aspirin and the adhesive doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> This really works  </li>
            <li> this has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> These really work well.</li>
            <li> One at night works and doesn&#x27;t have much taste at all.  </li>
            <li> Very unobtrusive.</li>
            <li> taste is very</li>
            <li> When medications keep your mouth from staying moist, these pills really work.  </li>
            <li> and this product really helped her.  </li>
            <li> I really like these Xylimelts.  </li>
            <li> It really does work well.</li>
            <li> These xylimelts works really well.</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR CARRY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> These help me so much at night.</li>
            <li> really helps for sleeping at night</li>
            <li> Keeps mouth from drying up too much.</li>
            <li> The product is convenient to use and has assisted with my lack of saliva by providing much needed moisture.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> XyliMelts are very helpful, mitigating the problem by about 90%.  </li>
            <li> these work very well and are not too &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34</li>
            <li> and I do not drink as much water as I used to</li>
            <li> Worked really well, but caused an allergic reaction in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely AMAZING!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it in hopes of finding something that really worked</li>
            <li> Also, they don&#x27;t have much of a taste (thank goodness) which is distracting.</li>
            <li> I put one on either side at night and sleep straight through.  </li>
            <li> and she found it to be very helpful as well.  </li>
            <li> But once the intense dryness is gone, I put one of these in and fall asleep.  </li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> These mints worked very well.</li>
            <li> They really work.</li>
            <li> They really do stay put all night.</li>
            <li> You really forget that they are there.</li>
            <li> Very succelssful.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I take a medication that is very drying to throat and mouth tissues.  </li>
            <li> Really works well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it goes fast....</li>
            <li> The XyliMelts really help.  </li>
            <li> They stay in place and really help the dryness in the mouth.</li>
            <li> Very inconspicuous when used.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was expecting too much.  </li>
            <li> however, the product itself didn&#x27;t really satisfy my needs.  </li>
            <li> so this probably really screwed up saliva glands.  </li>
            <li> Just that it didn&#x27;t really meet my needs.</li>
            <li> I simply keep water and Biotene available.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like it.</li>
            <li> The adhesive side really works and dissolves as well.</li>
            <li> and we kept a really close eye on my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a C-Pap machine and Xylimelts is very helpful with the dryness factor.</li>
            <li> I started trying every &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; OTC product I could find and was very grateful to find this</li>
            <li> Drinking water did not help as mouth dryness continued very soon after drinking, and I would wake up needing to drink again.  </li>
            <li> These work really well.  </li>
            <li> Ask your order pickers to be more careful.</li>
            <li> But they dissolve to fast.</li>
            <li> works VERY well, except that it is cheaper to buy 2 x 40 at Rite-Aid rather Amazon</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t fully accept the whole &#x27;stuck to my gum and let it melt&#x27; thing.</li>
            <li> my life and swollowing much bettter</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work for me.</li>
            <li> Only con is the price but worth every penny for the relief you get!</li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars to the mint ones because they add a refreshing flavor and scent to the other benefits of the product.</li>
            <li> I have tried other gels and mints but nothing works better than OraCoat XyliMelts.</li>
            <li> I find that this is better than an other products I have tried...</li>
            <li> After that it&#x27;s fine, as long as you don&#x27;t fool with it with your tongue.</li>
            <li> Most bandages slide off your active fingers</li>
            <li> The first few nights he wasn&#x27;t sure, but he loves them now.</li>
            <li> I got my XyliMelts very quickly, and my nighttime dry mouth is a thing of the past!&lt;br</li>
            <li> These little tablets are great for increasing saliva for dry mouth conditions.</li>
            <li> thanks to other Amazon users reviews ! : )&lt;</li>
            <li> One tablet does not last the whole night but it suffices to keep my mouth adequately lubricated</li>
            <li> So when I am really bothered during the day or as I try to fall asleep, this does not provide quick enough relief.  </li>
            <li> They are the best solution to serious dry mouth that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> They simply have a slightly sweet taste.  </li>
            <li> Mine is outrageously dry due to medications, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a fair trial.</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist to have my teeth cleaned and they gave me a free sample at their office of the Xylimelts because I have dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> My dental hygienist gave me free samples of this product to try when I told her I wake up in the night with a dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I guess this is a condition that a lot of people have as they grow older.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t know, Xylimelts main ingredietn is xylitol.</li>
            <li> I awake in the morning with a fresh tasting mouth and no dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> Using one tablet each night, a box of 60 Xylimelts will last 2 months and costs only slightly more than a 1.5 oz tube of Biotene OralBalance.</li>
            <li> it has a mild taste and works for several hours.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t create an excessive amount of saliva - just enough for me to be comfortable and able to sing.  </li>
            <li> LOL.)&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, with the price being so high AND the fact that they don&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 3 months now and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I think that the price is a bit high.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for anyone who has saliva issues.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are good if you breathe out of your mouth, to keep your mouth less dry.</li>
            <li> They came so fast it surprised me too.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to find these in stores in my area, so I was happy to find them online.  </li>
            <li> Within a couple of days I had concrete results.</li>
            <li> I place two melts inside of my mouth on the gums near my back molars; either top or bottom, which I alternate each night.</li>
            <li> As long as I make sure they are secured, they remain in place for the entire night, throughout my sleep.</li>
            <li> and i wake up with my mouth moist and normal</li>
            <li> They last most of the night and by morning my mouth is not so dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried XyliMelts and somewhat finds it okay and pop in two into mouth when I awaken by the dry mouth and soon can go back to sleep again.</li>
            <li> I have tried the mint flavored one, which some don&#x27;t prefer, and I like it more than this plain version.</li>
            <li> Since I started placing one tablet on the upper right molar before going to sleep, sthe dryness has stopped.</li>
            <li> and I put in another one and go right back to sleep.</li>
            <li> I use a cpap machine to sleep at night with a full mask and before Xylimelts my mouth would be so dry .</li>
            <li> My new dental hygienist recommended this product</li>
            <li> I got these to try something new, but was not hopeful.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot live without them.  </li>
            <li> Since I have started using the XyliMelts, I can sleep pretty much all night long.  </li>
            <li> I find that if I use only one, it works as far as preventing dry mouth, though two would probably work better.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they weren&#x27;t available in the pharmacy I use most often, so their availability on Amazon is another plus for me.</li>
            <li> I love these little things!  </li>
            <li> Sometimes they last only a couple of hours (when I end up not going right to sleep) and most other times up to 3 or 4 hours.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> His medical oncologist from Mass General suggested XyliMelts and it has made tremendous difference...</li>
            <li> Tried another brand but strongly prefers these, and they give him long lasting relief throughout the night</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I use them every night, and voila, the tooth decay went away completely!</li>
            <li> Any other products that I was able to find to help him all had flavor added - especially mint.</li>
            <li> First I thought my mouth was coming open as I slept</li>
            <li> For the first month of use I tried different places to stick them.  </li>
            <li> I am now able to sleep through the night as I do not have the former extreme mouth dryness waking me.</li>
            <li> Have tried many different products from Biotene over the last 10 years, and recently found this online.</li>
            <li> The only product (and I have tried them all) that has worked and brought continuous comfort.&lt;br /&gt;No more dry mouth!!!  </li>
            <li> Am thrilled to finally find something that really works for extreme dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I take a med that causes perpetual dry mouth in the afternoons, this product in both the mint and mint-free takes care of it along with keeping my breath fresh.  </li>
            <li> I pop one in according to directions and it last up to several hours of a sweet tasting moist mouth</li>
            <li> These are hard to find where I live, and I was glad to see that Amazon carried them.  </li>
            <li> They are fairly hard tablets and aren&#x27;t very comfortable to have between you cheeks and gums.  </li>
            <li> I gave her a sleeve of the melts  to try and the next morning she came over early to tell me that it was the first night of complete rest she had had in six years..</li>
            <li> I Really Do Prefer the Slightly Mint Fresh Flavor. .</li>
            <li> Stickey wet feeling is slightly better than completely dry mouth</li>
            <li> I think I would get just as much relief from dry mouth sucking on a much cheaper lozenge.</li>
            <li> I do not get the ultimate 6 hours of benefit, but certainly 2 to 3 hours.  </li>
            <li> It says use 2 at a time, but for me 1 at a time has been fine, I usually wake up and put in a second one after the first is gone.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I think the mint flavored version is a little better -</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m up due to the pain but can fall asleep quickly because of the XyliMelts, they work great!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am SO HAPPY I just desperately searched &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> : I want to make it clear that I don&#x27;t have an allergy to xylitol, in fact I try to get 5 servings a day of Xlear products (sweetener, nasal spray), on the recommendation of my dentist.</li>
            <li> I tried one of the &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; put it on my cheek area and it stuck on it with no moistening action at all I had to pull the melt off of the cheek tissue.  </li>
            <li> A dental hygienist told me about the melts - she had seen an article in her professional magazine.  </li>
            <li> Xylitol in the mint is a natural swetener that has antibacterial properties.</li>
            <li> Was surprised though to learn that you need to use two and &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; them to your teeth.  </li>
            <li> So for those with sensitive stomachs ...</li>
            <li> I find these Xylimelts helpful to stay asleep longer instead of waking up frequently to find my tongue stuck to my soft palate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usually completely melted</li>
            <li> I also developed sleep apnea as a result of all the treatment and now use a c-pap.</li>
            <li> —in other words, I needed to experiment a little; at times the tablets felt a little bulky in my mouth, Overall though, the experience has been great!</li>
            <li> Third, they did absolutely nothing to promote saliva.  </li>
            <li> (once I forgot to put the tablet in and wow, i woke up with my mouth</li>
            <li> My 73-year old Mom is hooked on these things.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the mint ones, as they tend to hurt my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> I developed headaches every morning</li>
            <li> I like them so much I tried them 3 separate times, using a smaller dose each time.</li>
            <li> If you have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome, another different product that can be very helpful.</li>
            <li> These last for hours and really do increase the salivary flow.</li>
            <li> The salivation helped, but did not cure the dryness near my throat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is nothing else that comes close to the length  of relief XyliMelts offers.  </li>
            <li> ** If you have mildly sensitive stomach, DO NOT use this product.</li>
            <li> so order from Amazon direct....</li>
            <li> especially when I have to give a presentation, I can get through the whole thing without having to &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying them for the last few months now and love them.</li>
            <li> so I have been forced to break off the backing in order to be able to use the rest of the melts.  </li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work for me at all, rather they created a thick coating in my mouth which was more troublesome than the problem it was purchased to correct.  </li>
            <li> I would drink some of the water I kept beside my bed and then go back to sleep, only to wake up once again with dry mouth or a very full bladder.  </li>
            <li> Since I started using these, when I wake up in the middle of the night with &amp;#34;cotton mouth&amp;#34; I just pop one in my mouth and go right back to sleep.</li>
            <li> would recommend these to anyone who suffers from dry mouth and wants to find a way to keep their mouth healthy, and their teeth strong.  </li>
            <li> By this time the dry mouth problem returns until I take my first drink of the day.</li>
            <li> thank you Amazon for leading me to a dry mouth solution that really works and works so efficiently !</li>
            <li> I just recommend something a little better tasting and quicker acting for intense bouts of dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Because I take several medications, my mouth is always dry, no matter how much water I drink,  These lozenges work very well to keep my mouth moist, even when I&#x27;m sleeping.  </li>
            <li> I put to capsules in my mouth around 7 PM just outside of my molars and noticed more saliva than usual flowing from my molar area to my tongue.</li>
            <li> only use one tablet, but the directions suggest using two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found these first on Amazon and later was given a sample by my dentist.  </li>
            <li> This product is the first I&#x27;ve tried that actually WORKS, especially at nighttime.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to push the little tab out of the cellophane and just hold it on my gum for ten seconds and voila!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other dry mouth products (Biotene spray, Biotene oral gel, Biotene gum, other xylitol lozenges) that have helped for a short time (a few minutes here and there), but these are just incredible!  </li>
            <li> These have helped greatly in dealing with a dry mouth, which can be detrimental to oral health, as well as uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Xyliment keep my mouth moist thru 90% of the night , and allow me a better night&#x27;s sleep without constantly waking due to dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Sugar free candies usually have sorbitol in them; it does not agree with me.</li>
            <li> I use Xylimelts once in awhile in situations where I can&#x27;t chew gum and don&#x27;t want to drink too much (like long flights, meetings).</li>

            <li> They didn&#x27;t really do anything for my dry mouth symptoms; rather than activating my salivary glands, they just turned to slime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am giving the XyliMelts five stars because it really does conquer my dry mouth.  </li>

            <li> you other smart Amazon users.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Really helpful for dry mouth, especially at night.  </li>
            <li> i had such dry mouth from medications, i woke in the night and my mouth felt like paper; sipping water didn&#x27;t really help.  </li>
            <li> Normally that time frame works as my dry mouth doesn&#x27;t begin until then after I&#x27;ve gone to bed.  </li>
            <li> At least until something more long lasting comes along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Due to medications I have to take, I really need to keep my mouth moist while I&#x27;m on the go during the day and at bedtime.</li>
            <li> I used to get very dehydrated due to taking medications and had to drink a lot of water.</li>
            <li> know they don&#x27;t claim to stop cavities but without the dry mouth and my new commitment to see my dentist three times a year and</li>
            <li> Curad bandages really stick for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> While the brown side does become sticky whe wet, the white tablet side becomes very slippery.  </li>
            <li> My mouth is not dry throughout the night.</li>
            <li> I no long use any of the Biotene products, because they are inferior products now!</li>
            <li> They sort of sit between a molar and your gum, actually last at least an hour, probably would work better on someone without such a dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I also find the ancillary oral health benefits from the Xylitol to be readily apparent although this is used in conjunction with an overall regiment.</li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t say enough good things about them, and is giving boxes away like crazy for her friends to try them, she is such a fan.</li>
            <li> I have pretty severe dry mouth due to pain medications -- without these tabs</li>
            <li> First for a dry mouth due to some of my medications.  </li>
            <li> At first I was unhappy with this little lump stuck in my cheek but it became barely noticeable after a few minutes and worked great for hours.</li>
            <li> if my chronic pain syndrome and the dry mouth caused by my pain pills.&lt;br /&gt;I got them quickly via Amazon and have not been up again this time of night due to the dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> this seems to have resolved the dry mouth issue completely.</li>
            <li> It has completely cured my dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I take a handful of meds that dry out my mouth and have need for frequent nighttime water breaks.  </li>
            <li> This product has saved me completely from my dry mouth discomfort.</li>
            <li> wake up with a cool, moist, refreshing mouth rather than a dry, coarse, and sometimes painful one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used my first box of 60 and am a few nights into this, my second order.</li>
            <li> but I can usually get right back to sleep.  </li>
            <li> The short of it is, I developed severely dry mouth from use of medications.</li>
            <li> Very occasionally I still get dry, but no where near the degree I did before</li>
            <li> Good for dry mouth, but sometimes fall off in mouth which can be dangerous for aspiration</li>
            <li> A great solution to an extremely bad case of chronic, constant dry mouth brought on by health issues.</li>
            <li> Got these for my 92 year old mother, she has very dry mouth because of her age and medications she is on.</li>
            <li> The plain and mild mint varieties provide the least amount of irritation to sensitive soft tissue.</li>
            <li> I and a pastor who had tongue cancer and the subsequent radiation was tough but these help when I speak or when I sleep plus my dentist loves them because he says they help prevent tooth decay (extra important with decrease salivary activity).</li>
            <li> The other side of the tablet slowly dissolves, creating a fine saliva-like (or combination of) moisture throughout your entire mouth and it stays that way for hours!</li>
            <li> My mouth became so dry that I could barely make it through a shift.  </li>
            <li> Does a decent job for my wife&#x27;s extreme dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Now I stopped all the fussing and just push one tab on the upper side gum and one tab on the other side and let the tab settle into a natural spot.</li>
            <li> (they usually tend to anyway even if positive).  </li>
            <li> I stick two on my upper gums before bed and that usually lasts the whole night.  </li>
            <li> It does not last long enough.</li>
            <li> Simply place one alongside the gum and it sticks instantly and moisturizers the mouth all night long as it melts.</li>
            <li> They last as long as a regular lifesaver mint.</li>
            <li> I use two every night and they last long enough to provide the relief advertised.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for anyone who suffers with dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> They work for about 3 to 4 hours at night to keep enough saliva flowing to prevent dry mouth, and if you wake up you can take a second tablet.</li>
            <li> I first started using them when my dental hygienist noticed I had a small amount of tooth decay from dry mouth.</li>

            <li> I have autoimmune disease that causes dry mouth as well as medications that I take daily with the same side effect.</li>
            <li> After using  a dry mouth gel every night for many years (expensive and needing re-application through the night) I&#x27;ve now been using&lt;br /&gt;XyliMelts</li>
            <li> I purchased these thinking they would be fairly flat and would adhere to my gums (as stated).</li>
            <li> /&gt;They don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> These work quite well and last a long time while I&#x27;m sleeping.  </li>
            <li> Last a long time.</li>
            <li> so they last long</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t keeping my mouth moist long enough.  </li>
            <li> In my case, they last 7-8 hours long.  </li>
            <li> Was putting sugar free hard candy in my mouth at bedtime that was a little bulky.  </li>
            <li> I am no long waking up with a very dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I know this is a chemical, and I&#x27;m careful about ingesting chemicals, but XyliMelts are the only thing I&#x27;ve found so far that can keep my mouth moist for any length of time, due to the meds I am taking.</li>
            <li> Unless I have had a lot of water to drink during the day, I wake up with an extremely dry mouth in the middle of the night and the tablets have not dissolved.</li>
            <li> I have tried several mouthwash products for dry mouth with short-term effect.</li>
            <li> and it left me with extremely dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> My mouth is just too dry and my salivary glands don&#x27;t work enough for Xylimelts to stimulate any sort of moisture in my mouth at all.</li>
            <li> Because my mouth was constantly so dry, I got a cut on the inside of my lip that had not healed for several weeks.  </li>

            <li> i have had problems with dry mouth for several years.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that if my mouth gets too dry, you have to tease it with your tongue to get it going.  </li>
            <li> my husband uses this just about daily for his dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from dry mouth, especially at night.  </li>
            <li> Without the xylimelts I have to sip water constantly during the day, and am awakened with dry mouth pain at night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found it useful if you don&#x27;t like to chew gum during the day, get tired of the Biotene mouthwash, or if you are in a situation like a lecture or concert or movie, where the disc will easily last a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to bring along too since the package is broken down into aluminum wrapped, po-thru sheets.</li>

            <li> tablet dissolves completely, not like another product I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s usually long cough.  </li>
            <li> pop them all day long.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it is not completely dissolved when I wake in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Have to have these at night for moist Ness and works well lasts long and will purchase again</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never really been the same since.</li>

            <li> What a relief to find a product that gives relatively long term relief.  </li>
            <li> Even though they dissolve long before 8 hours they coat my mouth so it doesn&#x27;t get irritated.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;glue&#x27; side sticks where you put it and lasts a long time into the night.</li>

            <li> They stay attached to the inside if your mouth very well &amp; melt slowly over hours to help dry mouth.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re not perfect, but they&#x27;ve made a significant difference.</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re reading this review, then I would think that you are suffering with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> you are a mouth breather at night and have a known problem with dry mouth when you wake</li>
            <li> I was using the gel, which also worked but was messy and much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I was worried that having the lozenge in my mouth would feel weird or uncomfortable but I barely noticed it after the first night, and the taste is not bad either.</li>
            <li> Limited ingredients.</li>
            <li> so I normally do not have to get up to urinate during the night like when I was chugging water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Getting up in the middle of the night discs to reapply is not fun.  </li>
            <li> SWEET AND EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> One does me at night &amp; lasts for hours--never comes loose.  </li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry mouth, this stuff works!</li>
            <li> If you have Sjogren&#x27;s or another condition that causes severe dry mouth, you might want to give these a try!</li>
            <li> So if you get dry mouth in the night, you might want to try this!</li>
            <li> (Your dentist will like it too because a chronic dry mouth can lead to tooth decay!)</li>
            <li> Between that and the salivary stimulation from the slight mint flavor they should be a big help for my dental health.</li>
            <li> Since it only comes in a small (1.5 oz) tube, a tube lasts me only about 10 days.</li>
            <li> I prefer the no-mint one, although there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the mint (which are otherwise exactly the same).  </li>
            <li> So I only use one and occasionally if I wake up during the night with excessive thirst, I add 1/2 of a disc.</li>
            <li> and my dentist said it was due to the dry mouth and that he sees patterns like this in patients with dry mouth</li>
            <li> have very dry mouth in the winter and keep these in my pocket.  </li>
            <li> So for anyone with a very dry mouth I recommend Xylimelts.  </li>

            <li> I have a very dry mouth after cancer treatment.  </li>
            <li> are now very dry.  </li>
            <li> They are very hard and have an unusual taste.</li>
            <li> XyliMelts melt slowly and because the small adhesive pad on each &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; keeps it securely attached where I put it on my upper gum, the Xylimelt stays put and dissolves slowly through the night.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough about these little things that have been a life-changer for me.</li>
            <li> These little discs just stick to the inside or your mouth and help keep your mouth moist for several hours at a time.  </li>
            <li> Have had dry mouth issues due to a medication.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like a natural feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been teseted for Sjogren&#x27;s and other possible problems that could cause chronic dry mouth, always comes back negative</li>
            <li> These are small and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I would be in deep trouble without them.  </li>
            <li> A side-effect of these treatments has been a loss of his salivary glands so he has absolutely no saliva production.</li>
            <li> This product does work and keeps mouth wet, without water.</li>
            <li> It feels a bit rough there until it smooths out with some melting.</li>
            <li> The flavor is minimal.  </li>
            <li> I have a medical condition that has dried my mouth out, and my teeth were becomming affected.</li>
            <li> I used to wear wrapped around my head to keep my mouth closed.</li>
            <li> My salivary gland was partially severed when I had my wisdom tooth</li>
            <li> so I use them carefully and prudently, but they are a life save for me.</li>
            <li> Xylitol is deadly for pets, especially to dogs.</li>
            <li> The docs have told me that there is nothing we can really do about it (save some prescription drugs that they do not want to use because the side effects are worse than the lack of saliva) except treat the symptoms.  </li>
            <li> I followed every suggestion to self remedy (consciously closed mouth sleeping, no fans in room, hydration, etc.)</li>
            <li> put one in my mouth and wet it.</li>
            <li> No worries about it slipping or causing choking, etc.</li>
            <li> They are not as annoying as it sounds as if they would be, but continuously dissolve  to last longer and work better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar products with little if any help.  </li>

            <li> I keep a small spray bottle next to my bed, because I wake up in the night, and my mouth is extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I share them and this info with other who complain of dry mouth and have gotten other hooked.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, when they finally dissolved, my gums felt raw where they used to be.</li>
            <li> Perhaps due to some ornery syndrome you never heard of or certainly never thought would apply to you?  </li>
            <li> The brown backing on the mint that apparently makes it stick in place while you are sleeping does taste like tree bark and it gets so STUCK that it was hard to get it off the roof of my mouth.       </li>
            <li> I wanted to use this when I am drinking alcohol in social settings (I have dry mouth issues in general but it gets quite bad when drinking), but it tends to last even less than an hour when I am constantly drinking.  </li>
            <li> On top of feeling like crap, my mouth is dry</li>
            <li> Tried other products.</li>
            <li> No vanilla, mint, cinnamon, or other flavor.  </li>
            <li> The bacteria that cause cavities don&#x27;t metabolize xylitol like other sugars.</li>
            <li> I chose the mint-free because the flavored version was too sharp to my taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other things too.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the toothpastes, gum, mouthwashes, sprays, and other melts and lozenges, but NOTHING did the trick - as soon as the lozenges melted, that was the end of relief.</li>
            <li> No more getting up in the middle of the night to drink water!</li>
            <li> I am going to try other options.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have said it well.  </li>
            <li> I found them to be way too sweet in an artificial way.  </li>
            <li> They work for about six hours which means I usually need to supplement them with a rinse for the last two hours.</li>
            <li> Small enough to ignore it when talking on the phone all day for work!</li>
            <li> Now we have these on an auto-ship subscription because she never wants to be without them!</li>
            <li> If I wake up in the middle of the night I usually add another one.  </li>
            <li> I had tried other rinses and nothing work until I found these</li>
            <li> I expect that he will recommend them to other patients in addition to the Rx-strength Fluoride toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Not only do the melts work, but they are small and enable talking while using.</li>
            <li> he prefers this over other brands.</li>
            <li> Stick to the tooth or gum for like a minute-would never use at bedtime due to choking hazard.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have not found any other product that works this well.</li>
            <li> (no more Rolos in bed after I&#x27;ve done my final teeth brushing)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the other yet.</li>
            <li> me...there is no taste or flavor, but my doctor says it is due to my lack of saliva.</li>
            <li> I tried Biotene products, (gel, mouthwash, spray, gum) plus some other remedies to no avail.</li>
            <li> I had radiation for cancer a couple years ago that destroyed two of my salivary glands and shrunk the other two.  </li>
            <li> One tab usually lasts me up to four hours, so I now only wake up once at night.  </li>

            <li> No more dry mouth.</li>
            <li> No more waking up with a dry, sandy feeling</li>
            <li> No more dry mouth!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I cough half the night</li>
            <li> It is the ONLY sweetener (artificial or natural) that is not harmful to teeth.</li>
            <li> I have even lost teeth, tooth, by tooth, some with a previous crown or root canal.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;ve noticed less plaque on my teeth</li>
            <li> and it lasts about half the night.</li>
            <li> Slight after taste in morning.</li>
            <li> She finds that it helps keep her mouth moist, less difficulty with throat dryness in AM</li>
            <li> Leaves a bland, sticky film in mouth.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t care, but they have turned slightly brownish where I stick them in my mouth at night.  </li>
            <li> w/ less tablets</li>
            <li> I even put 2 in as the directions suggest but they were gone in less than an hour.</li>
            <li> The cost is less than at the store.</li>
            <li> no more dry mouth!  </li>
            <li> Minor negative issues</li>
            <li> It does anchor tightly to the gums as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I am a singer (choir and solos) and my mouth would get so dry I could hardly sing.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t chew gum at work and my mouth gets so dry that I can hardly talk.</li>
            <li> My mouth would be so dry at night, I would have a hard time sleeping.  </li>
            <li> But by the time I get up after 7 hours of sleep, they have melted, my guess, at least an hour or two before as my mouth is feeling dry again.</li>
            <li> Also helpful during meditation and while undergoing acupuncture where my body relaxes and my jaw slowly opens up as I relax causing dry mouth and detracting from healing sessions.</li>
            <li> It does leave my mouth a little gummy</li>
            <li> At night my mouth stays moist from using two of these easy-to-use little tablets.  </li>
            <li> It increases the moisture in my mouth a little bit.</li>
            <li> These little discs work as advertised.  </li>
            <li> It was a little tricky to get it to stick to the interior gum line, but it worked.  </li>
            <li> The Drug Store remedies provided little relief.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little concerned about one reviewer who had problems and was told by her dentist to stop using them, and will plan on asking mine in a month when I see him.</li>
            <li> I took the package along to my appointment and she was not familiar with the product.</li>
            <li> After a little internet search I came across a product called Xylimelts and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> : Sometimes they felt a little messy in my mouth...</li>
            <li> These little disks are made with xylitol with a thin vegetable gum on the backside that allows it to stick to the outside of your gum, sometimes I&#x27;ll stick one to the roof of my mouth.</li>
            <li> The other night I forgot them and in the early morning hours my dry mouth was so bad it had awoken me.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t mean to say I have a lot of saliva,  because I don&#x27;t, but my mouth is NO longer dry at night when I use these!</li>
            <li> Dry mouth is a serious health issue  for me.  </li>
            <li> but after a few days I felt I was getting soar spots where they were attached to the gums.</li>
            <li> I know this may seem like a lot of trouble ..</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, however, my tongue became quite sore on the side where the Xylimelts tablet was placed.</li>
            <li> Of course I bought two boxes and they are wasted money.</li>
            <li> Now after a few weeks, the cut has healed and I don&#x27;t wake up with a mouth feeling like sandpaper.  </li>
            <li> Not parched but not comfortable, either.</li>
            <li> When I wake, my mouth is not all dried out like it used to be.  </li>
            <li> If they are not on firmly, they will pop off while you sleep.  </li>
            <li> I saw this product recommended by another Sjogren&#x27;s person on the Sjogren&#x27;s foundation website, and gave it a try (had to buy it from Amazon as it is not available in NZ).</li>
            <li> DO NOT FIT IN MY MOUTH, LIKE THE ONES I BOUGHT IN THE STORE.  </li>
            <li> Liver cleanses and detoxing the heavy metals</li>
            <li> When I use them at night as I go to bed, they last approximately four hours</li>
            <li> I have been using xylimelts for a few years</li>
            <li> but I need about 4 or 5 tablets in my mouth every few hours during my work shift</li>
            <li> It takes just a few minutes to acclimate to their presence and for them to conform to your gum shape.</li>
            <li> A few people mentioned the taste----</li>
            <li> They stay in place firmly once they are applied.</li>
            <li> Have to skip a few nights.</li>
            <li> I can stick one of the Xylimelts to my gums (or cheek) and it stays put all night until dissolved (usually 5 hours or so while asleep, less</li>
            <li> So dry that it&#x27;s hard to close it!  </li>
            <li> These things make me salivate like crazy but didn&#x27;t help the dry throat and back of my mouth I get from my medications.</li>
            <li> I take a few medications that make my mouth extremely dry and use c-pap with nasal mask at night that makes the problem even worse.  </li>
            <li> shut tight from dryness!</li>
            <li> so they slowly dissolve and won&#x27;t go down your throat and choke you while you&#x27;re asleep.</li>
            <li> The only downside is it&#x27;s a little difficult to talk with the product in your mouth.</li>
            <li> They made my gums raw and did not add any help to the problem.  </li>
            <li> Xylitol is the only remedy for bad breath and this is the easiest way to take care of your morning coffee breath after you have brushed your teeth.</li>
            <li> I find that without this product I wake up with an extremely dry mouth and a poor nights sleep</li>
            <li> In fact, I still have just a little bit still on my teeth when I wake up in the morning!</li>
            <li> I was so tired of prying my tongue loose from the roof of my mouth every morning!</li>
            <li> I have been using biotene gel and pilocarpine (it&#x27;s a prescription) for the past three years.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely unbelievable.</li>
            <li> only do they not work well, but it&#x27;s difficult to sleep with them adhered to the side of the gums as instructed.</li>
            <li> I think peppermint work just as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> returned making it difficult to get any uninterrupted REM sleep.  </li>
            <li> No more sore throat when i wake.</li>
            <li> not sure what.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t usually like mint.</li>
            <li> I usually use one at night before beforeI go to bed  </li>
            <li> Not sure why they have to be colored at all.</li>
            <li> No more worrying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if any retail store in our area carries this product, so I went to Amazon&#x27;s web site.  </li>
            <li> It helped a small amount.  </li>
            <li> No more waking up with desert tongue.</li>
            <li> In my case, I use them when hauling around a water bottle is not appropriate.</li>
            <li> No more waking up with a mouth</li>
            <li> (sorry for the graphic)</li>
            <li> Moderately helpful, but quite expensive.</li>
            <li> They last long and dont taste like a flavor you would get sick of.</li>
            <li> The tablets were a little firm and when I went to lie down on my pillow they pushed against the pillow and caused an uncomfortable feeling in my gums.</li>
            <li> As well, the dry mouth is so bad that I often have difficulty simply *speaking,* and end up sounding like a drunk as I try to be articulate and stumble through teeth-sticking, tongue gymnastics.</li>
            <li> She is 79 and suffers from sever dry mouth due to some heart meds.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I followed directions, too (for some reason people always ask that question first, like I&#x27;m an idiot or something,</li>
            <li> I could poor water down my throat</li>
            <li> I use these mainly at night, but only when I&#x27;m completely miserable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did nothing for my dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I also use a dry mouth spray &amp; a gel (worst of all; you salivate, then swallow it, thus starting all over again with a dry mouth).  </li>
            <li> After 5 months of using these, I no longer feel like I am suffocating from my mouth being dry at night.  </li>
            <li> It is hard talk.</li>
            <li> Hard to describe.</li>
            <li> The sticky side that adheres to my teeth is hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time sleeping before my daughter introduced them to me.</li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist, and these are hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Due to several prescription medications I take, I have terrible dry mouth all day and all night.  </li>
            <li> I have used Xylimelts for @ least 3 years.  </li>
            <li> I have been using them for at least six months now.  </li>
            <li> Before using product my gums were burning, my teeth felt dirty &amp; were yellow.</li>
            <li> I no longer wake up with a parched mouth, at least to the degree I used to.</li>
            <li> They stick to your gums, and slowly melt.</li>
            <li> It slowly dissolves and keeps your mouth moist.</li>
            <li> They dissolve slowly promoting saliva production and preventing plaque and bacterial buildup in your mouth.</li>
            <li> She also said to start slowly until your stomach gets used to the product.  </li>
            <li> It desolves slowly</li>
            <li> It is in tablet form, and you use it by sticking it to the side of your molars--somehow it manages to stay there while it slowly melts over a period of hours.</li>
            <li> The tablet adheres to your cheek, gum or roof of mouth and slowly dissolves.  </li>
            <li> Just tuck one on the inside of your cheek and it slowly melts during the day or night.  </li>
            <li> Then it just slowly melts and keeps your mouth from drying out.  </li>
            <li> and it will slowly melt through the night helping you to keep some moisture in your mouth and not wake up with a sore throat.  </li>
            <li> To expensive may not order again due to cost.</li>
            <li> The first few months were terrible and all I could do was keep plenty of water on my nightstand.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a LOT less expensive for me to purchase S/F-F/F hard candy and use that once in a while</li>
            <li> and all day long anytime I feel that dry, uncomfortable - even painful - feeling in my mouth and throat.   </li>
            <li> Has the least amount of bad stuff and xylitol actually HELPS teeth.  </li>
            <li> Tried a similar product and left a nasty residue in my mouth, these do not.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my husband who suffers from Dry Mouth as a side effect from medication.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> The dry mouth issue was getting me up 3-5 times a night and was getting me crazy.</li>
            <li> you are a oral cancer survivor who suffers from dry mouth this product is probably for you.</li>
            <li> My wife often suffers with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> At bedtime, I use the mild mint discs and never wake up with horrible morning breath.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who suffers from dry mouth should use Xylimelts because they work!</li>
            <li> It is a little weird to wake up with a minty taste in your mouth</li>
            <li> It prevents the build up of plaque, bacteria, bad breath overnight while I sleep with my mouth open.</li>
            <li> and it is as bad as dry mouth for keeping me awake.  </li>
            <li> I have had an exceedingly bad problem with dry mouth for years, after having come out of cancer treatment twice and having been given a regimen of drugs that would make a desert of a lake.</li>
            <li> My Dentist recommended these because my mouth got dry overnight (bad for teeth, it seems), and gave me a sample to try.</li>
            <li> I already have a tough time falling asleep and these just kept me thinking about them in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> They adhere to your gum or cheek, and dissolve very slowly over time, stimulating saliva production and keeping your mouth from drying out.  </li>
            <li> The last few years have been terrible, both for discomfort and ongoing tooth loss.  </li>
            <li> It got so much worse when I moved to the desert.  </li>
            <li> not effective and difficult to use</li>
            <li> Alas, I am one of the obscure people for whom they give canker sores.</li>
            <li> I never dreamt this &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; would be so frustrating and stressful.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands that taste so bad, they would never make me salivate.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and they haven&#x27;t worked for they leave a bad after taste, but these melts take care of my symptoms and leave no after taste.</li>
            <li> I have terribly severe dry mouth due to 14 medications fighting an incurable disease.</li>
            <li> The amount of xylitol in each sticker is not impressive, it hardly stays in place and it is WAY too expensive.</li>
            <li> I hate waking up with a dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Before I knew of these I would wake up with my mouth and throat dried out so bad that my throat would stick shut for a minute when I swallowed.  </li>
            <li> A 50 year old never having had a cavity, I was BUMMED when I got three of them as a result of this cruel dry-mouth punishment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sadly, the canker sores were worse each time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The way that the pills stick to your mouth is very weird and makes speaking hard (during the day) and makes me nervous that I will choke (at night)</li>
            <li> He had very bad dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I take medications that give me very bad dry mouth at night.</li>
            <li> The worst part was the next day when I had terrible stomach cramps and diarrhea which the label warns can happen but with a much larger dose than I</li>
            <li> I have had Sjogrens Syndrome for three years and have been extremely ill.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I tend to breath through my mouth at night and use a face mask with the CPAP.</li>
            <li> My E.N.T. doctor advised me to shy away from these types of products.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and I find it difficult to sleep at night.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had an allergy to this product ands</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  </li>
            <li> Seems like a useless way to get your xyltiol.</li>
            <li> This makes this an expensive solution.</li>
            <li> Not perfect - still have some dryness</li>
            <li> Unfortunately none did.</li>
            <li> Falling asleep can be difficult and I would wake often needing to take a sip of water.  </li>
            <li> They are expensive</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after about 2 months, the inside of my mouth and my lips got inflamed and sore.</li>
            <li> cure was to switch medications, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Skeptical?  </li>
            <li> Once I got that unfortunate diagnosis</li>
            <li> to the roof of your mouth from your medications it is difficult to</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird feeling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed in the least.</li>
            <li> since putting them in at night, I have not had to use my spray bottle, and I do NOT wake up with a dry, miserable mouth!</li>
            <li> I was so miserable with dry mouth and throat.  </li>
            <li> It is not an artificial sweetener.</li>
            <li> Was afraid to use at night because of swallowing hazard.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> They are expensive but work!</li>
            <li> Found this product unpleasant to use.  </li>
            <li> Just a very faint sweetness that doesn&#x27;t interfere with my daytime beverages, and is never cloying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ...and very difficult to find.</li>
            <li> If placed in the wrong spot they don&#x27;t move and they become annoying.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommend these to me, but very expensive in drugstores.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible.</li>
            <li> For those of you whose Sjögren&#x27;s Syndrome isn&#x27;t too bad, maybe this will help you.</li>
            <li> If you suffer badly, just know that these may not help at all.</li>
            <li> I had a bad case of ginigivitis, but xylimelts have helped the condtion of my mouth to stablize in addtion to brushing flossing, and mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Bad idea</li>
            <li> Bad ones.</li>
            <li> They gave me a bit of diarrhea, but it was not too bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I am not saying the product is bad.  </li>
            <li> But when I&#x27;m having a flare-up, it can be REALLY bad for a couple of months at a time.</li>
            <li> , so bad that sometimes I cannot talk.</li>
            <li> It was so bad for me that I was robbed of sleeping.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful, but thought &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very unpleasant condition to have, and these make it tolerable.</li>
            <li> suffered of mouth sores all the time it was very painful.</li>
            <li> One of the worst parts of the disease is the dryness in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> They are disgusting and the taste made me gag and want to puke.</li>
            <li> My neck injury medications make my mouth terribly dry,which leads to cavities.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last the entire night.</li>
            <li> These tablets work perfectly, as advertised, and this is also the best deal on this item that I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
            <li> I suffer from extremely dry mouth. Tried other products. They didn&#x27;t work for me. I use one or two of these each night. They work great for me. Have used one during the day also. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. I will say that I only used it once so take this into consideration. I put to capsules in my mouth around 7 PM just outside of my molars and noticed more saliva than usual flowing from my molar area to my tongue. The tablets were a little firm and when I went to lie down on my pillow they pushed against the pillow and caused an uncomfortable feeling in my gums. Furthermore, when they finally dissolved, my gums felt raw where they used to be. The worst part was the next day when I had terrible stomach cramps and diarrhea which the label warns can happen but with a much larger dose than I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I didn&#x27;t have the stomach issues the next day I would have continued trying to see if it worked better.</li>
            <li> I have used these for about a year.  They really dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Really helpful for dry mouth, especially at night.  My Dentist recommended these and I am so happy she did.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Works when Biotene won&#x27;t.  Delivery as promised.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results using Xylimelts in conjunction with my CPAP. Much more comfortable throughout the night since I began using this item.</li>
            <li> this product is helpful.  I use it at night.  I&#x27;d like to find a product that would give me a whole night&#x27;s sleep...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had chronic dry mouth/nose/sinuses/skin my whole life.  It got so much worse when I moved to the desert.  I&#x27;ve been teseted for Sjogren&#x27;s and other possible problems that could cause chronic dry mouth, always comes back negative (they usually tend to anyway even if positive).  I&#x27;ve been looking for solutions for years.  Xylitol seems to be the answer, it really is.  At least until something more long lasting comes along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the daytime, I chew Spry gum.  It&#x27;s the best for my dentures (doesn&#x27;t stick) and 3 pieces will keep me satisfied dry mouth wise, for 3-4 hours..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t chew gum at night though.  For night I&#x27;ve always HAD to have some water near my bed for the several times per night I&#x27;d wake up with desert mouth.  I can stick one of the Xylimelts to my gums (or cheek) and it stays put all night until dissolved (usually 5 hours or so while asleep, less if awake).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t ever wake up from dry mouth anymore.  Putting one of these in my mouth every night is my new routine, and that&#x27;s cool with me.. I just wish I could get my insurance to pay for these lol..</li>
            <li> They work pretty well. They stick to your gums, and slowly melt. They are kind of sticky, and you can&#x27;t keep one in your mouth. They irritate, but if your mouth is dry, like mine, it helps to have on hand, when you can&#x27;t drink water.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product that increases saliva production while sleeping.  I am no longer awakened because of dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m well-rested and healthier.</li>
            <li> I wake up without a dry mouth.  Use one or two tabs at bed time.  You don&#x27;t even know they are in your mouth.</li>
            <li> These are the best I have found so far.  I guess this is a condition that a lot of people have as they grow older. I will reorder when my supply gets low.</li>
            <li> Dry mouth has been a problem for years. Sugar free candies usually have sorbitol in them; it does not agree with me. After a month using the xylimelts @ night, I&#x27;ve had no bad side affects.</li>
            <li> They worked when I first started using them and now, not so much.  Unless I have had a lot of water to drink during the day, I wake up with an extremely dry mouth in the middle of the night and the tablets have not dissolved. It&#x27;s almost as if they have changed the formula.</li>
            <li> I have sjogrens syndrome and this product was recommended by my dentist.  I found that it works for me at night. I&#x27;m  not getting  up in the middle of the night for water. I use one tablet instead of the recommended 2 and get relief from the nighttime dry mouth.</li>
            <li> These have been a saving grace for my mouth!  Due to several prescription medications I take, I have terrible dry mouth all day and all night.  I&#x27;ve tried other dry mouth products (Biotene spray, Biotene oral gel, Biotene gum, other xylitol lozenges) that have helped for a short time (a few minutes here and there), but these are just incredible!  They adhere to your gum or cheek, and dissolve very slowly over time, stimulating saliva production and keeping your mouth from drying out.  At bedtime, I use the mild mint discs and never wake up with horrible morning breath.  Instead, I wake up with minty breath.  During the day, I use the mint-free discs. They simply have a slightly sweet taste.  No vanilla, mint, cinnamon, or other flavor.  Just a very faint sweetness that doesn&#x27;t interfere with my daytime beverages, and is never cloying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone who suffers from dry mouth and wants to find a way to keep their mouth healthy, and their teeth strong.  They help tremendously!</li>
            <li> If you ever get a dry mouth (public speaking, while sleeping, after certain medications, etc.) you need these.  Easy to use--they simply adhere to the roof of your mouth &amp; they make sure there is a steady supply of saliva.  One does me at night &amp; lasts for hours--never comes loose.  If it&#x27;s especially dry, I pop another in as needed.  More doctors should know about this product as it would ease a lot of folks&#x27; suffering.  Only con is the price but worth every penny for the relief you get!</li>
            <li> Xylitol is the only remedy for bad breath and this is the easiest way to take care of your morning coffee breath after you have brushed your teeth.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered the Xylimelts in Mint and was VERY PLEASED with not only the performance, but the taste.  When I placed another order I accidentally ordered the \\&quot;original\\&quot; XyliMelts.  The one that has a picture of tree bark on the right side of the box.  The brown backing on the mint that apparently makes it stick in place while you are sleeping does taste like tree bark and it gets so STUCK that it was hard to get it off the roof of my mouth.       I made the mistake of ordering two boxes in order to save on shipping so I have been forced to break off the backing in order to be able to use the rest of the melts.  Once the backing is off the rest of the tablet does stimulate saliva.  I also got a good checkup from my hygenist and she notices less plaque and many of the pockets in the gums have disappeared.    Looking forward to ordering Mint next time[[ASIN:B001A40M1M Orahealth Xylimelts Mints, 80-Count Boxes]]</li>
            <li> I have had Sjogrens Syndrome for three years and have been extremely ill.  One of the worst parts of the disease is the dryness in my mouth.  On top of feeling like crap, my mouth is dry and I get sores all through my mouth, tongue, and gums.  I have not been able to sleep well because my tongue gets stuck to the top of my mouth within minutes of falling to sleep. I have been using biotene gel and pilocarpine (it&#x27;s a prescription) for the past three years. I wake up in the night to reapply the gel and try to go back to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;Three nights ago used these XyliMelts along with my biotene gel and pilocarpine.  I have actually slept  for 3 nights without waking up. I put one disk on both sides of my mouth and slept like a baby.  My gums and tongue are not sore and are actually healing. My tummy does not hurt from the xylitol...sometimes I use those xylitol ice chips for dryness and eat too many and my tummy hurts.  I used the mint xylimelts about a year ago and the mint bothered my gum and cheek tissue and I did not know there were mint-free xylimelts.  Last night I went to a concert and stuck one in and I was able to sit through the concert in comfort.  It still is not as good as your real saliva but it&#x27;s worked the best for me so far.</li>
            <li> Tablet stays attached to your teeth or gums and seems to relieve dry mouth some.</li>
            <li> I use these regularly. I hate waking up with a dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother that has Sjogren Syndrome. She has suffered so much with the dry mouth and Xylimelts help cope her situation. I have already order another one.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely unbelievable. They stay put, taste great and work all night. I was using the gel, which also worked but was messy and much more expensive. These tabs are no muss no fuss. I&#x27;m definitely sold.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well. Sure helps if one uses a CPAP machine at night.</li>
            <li> I had hoped these would remedy my dry mouth caused by medication.  The reviews were pretty positive so I was sure I had found the solution.  These didn&#x27;t work for me at all, rather they created a thick coating in my mouth which was more troublesome than the problem it was purchased to correct.  They didn&#x27;t stimulate saliva production and while the sticking the inside of the cheek is a great feature, it was the only advantage for me.  I&#x27;ll go back to my hard candy sours.</li>
            <li> Because I take several medications, my mouth is always dry, no matter how much water I drink,  These lozenges work very well to keep my mouth moist, even when I&#x27;m sleeping.  I had been warned by my dentist that I needed to use special toothpaste and mouthwash, but did not tell me about this product.  Thanks to anyone who reviewed it so I felt confident in ordering.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that keeps my mouth moist. Otherwise my mouth is sooooo dry It is hard talk. My doctor suggested it and it works great.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! I put 2 in my mouth, one on each side and they stick to your teeth and help you salivate through the nite! No more dry mouth! And they are great during the day if you take medicine that dries your mouth. A good product and good quality</li>
            <li> These have been great at preventing dry mouth through the night!</li>
            <li> I have Sjorgren&#x27;s disease and do NOT have any saliva in my mouth. After reading reviews I thought I would try the product always seeking a product to moisten my mouth during the day and night. I tried one of the &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; put it on my cheek area and it stuck on it with no moistening action at all I had to pull the melt off of the cheek tissue.  The next day thought I would try one more time sipping on more water this time to activate the melt but same thing occurred my mouth became even more dry.  This product was not helpful for my total loss of of saliva.  It may be a good product if one has some saliva.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many many products for this condition nothing lasts very long except Spry mint gum during the day but chewing gum gets old fast.  Biotene products like toothpaste, mouthwash, moistners have been the most successful for moisturizing my mouth for short periods of time.</li>
            <li> I receive this item is a timely manner...they helped me with my dry mouth at night.</li>
            <li> These have been a life saver! I couldn&#x27;t sleep with out using 2 on the roof of my mouth every night and talking with clients through the day-</li>
            <li> These did NOT work for me. Yes, I followed directions, too (for some reason people always ask that question first, like I&#x27;m an idiot or something, LOL.)&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, with the price being so high AND the fact that they don&#x27;t work well, it&#x27;s a LOT less expensive for me to purchase S/F-F/F hard candy and use that once in a while</li>
            <li> I am a singer (choir and solos) and my mouth would get so dry I could hardly sing.  My dentist recommended XyliMelts so I immediately ordered a couple of boxes.  They&#x27;re GREAT!!!!  They don&#x27;t create an excessive amount of saliva - just enough for me to be comfortable and able to sing.  I have them everywhere:  my bathroom, my purse, my choir folder.  They last about two hours in a singing situation.  I HIGHLY recommend this product!! .</li>
            <li> I know this is a chemical, and I&#x27;m careful about ingesting chemicals, but XyliMelts are the only thing I&#x27;ve found so far that can keep my mouth moist for any length of time, due to the meds I am taking. Shopping and officiating at weddings are enjoyable again. I do love them; they&#x27;re so portable. Mentioned them to a friend who is a pain management doctor, and she has already begun suggesting them to patients.</li>
            <li> good taste and relieves dry mouth for short time</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t really do anything for my dry mouth symptoms; rather than activating my salivary glands, they just turned to slime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only do they not work well, but it&#x27;s difficult to sleep with them adhered to the side of the gums as instructed. It was much easier to sleep with the disc adhered to the roof of my mouth.</li>
            <li> The XyliMelts keep my mouth moisturized during the night.</li>
            <li> nothing works with dry mouth</li>
            <li> does keep mouth moist but we found that after several days the inside skin of your check peels, so keep switching sides each night</li>
            <li> I found the texture off putting. Kind of between chalky and slimy? Hard to describe. The sticky side that adheres to my teeth is hard to remove. It does work as advertised. Could only give it 3 stars because of the texture, taste, and residue issue. That was enough to keep me looking for something else. Moved on to Act lozenges,which provide the same relief, have a more pleasant mouth feel but are more expensive.</li>
            <li> I am a Throat Cancer survivor....been clean now for 4 years! I cannot do without my Xylimelts! How I wish I had known about them for the last 4 years...My dry mouth is a chronic condidtion and I have had thousands of dollars of dental work done because of it. Sleeping was a challenge and a dry-mouth cough was constant.  A dental hygienist told me about the melts - she had seen an article in her professional magazine.  I wish the company would go on a campaign to inform Radiologists and ENT physicians about these tablets.  I do use 2 at night...and all day long anytime I feel that dry, uncomfortable - even painful - feeling in my mouth and throat.   I have tried several mouthwash products for dry mouth with short-term effect.Tooth pastes are Ok but do not actually &#x27;fix&#x27; the dry-mouth issue.  Since I also feel &#x27;pain&#x27; and discomfort in my mouth all the time, I also use Sensadyne toothpaste - - but I do find the melts also  help the discomfort part of my problem.   This is not a puffed-up review - - my mouthand throat are dry and sore all the time and the only relief is get is from these melts!</li>
            <li> I have dry mount at night.  These kind of work in that they do produce a little saliva so my mouth isn&#x27;t completely dry.  However, they only work for about 2 to 3 hours before you have to apply another.  They do stick to the roof of your mouth well and they are fairly inexpensive so I&#x27;ll probably buy them again.</li>
            <li> These are these best thing I have found if you have a dry mouth problem.  My dentist recommended them and I use them every night.  I couldn&#x27;t do without them.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite of the products I have tried. they taste good</li>
            <li> These were for my husband and he said they worked really well.</li>
            <li> In all sincerity this product is a life changer for me.  It allows me to sleep without being woken up by dry mouth.  I found nothing else that will work.  Xylimelts have a special disc for adhering comfortably to the side of my gums and are the perfect size and shape that I don&#x27;t even feel them in my mouth.  If I put two in when I go to bed, they last all night.</li>
            <li> I rely on xylimelts for keeping moisture in my mouth bog during the day and night.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these especially for use at night because my mouth gets very dry, which can promote tooth decay. Aside from keeping your mouth more moist, Xylitol is supposed to help to prevent tooth decay.</li>
            <li> Helps fight the night dry mouth an improves oral health.</li>
            <li> I have tried the mints during the day, only. I didn&#x27;t  get any relief. I think peppermint work just as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry mouth at night and have tried several dry mouth lozenges and in my opinion these are the best. They stay in place good and last for hrs</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say here except that these work as advertised. I place two melts inside of my mouth on the gums near my back molars; either top or bottom, which I alternate each night. As long as I make sure they are secured, they remain in place for the entire night, throughout my sleep. What is also great is that they dissolve completely and are safe to ingest. No need to &amp;#34;remove&amp;#34; anything from your mouth the following morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wake up with a cool, moist, refreshing mouth rather than a dry, coarse, and sometimes painful one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple concept, leveraging the properties of xylitol that is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed no allergic reactions or side effects.</li>
            <li> My problem with dry mouth has been solved with XyliMelts.  I take them at night and do not have to wake up during the night trying to swallow.  I recommend this product to everyone who has a dry mouth problem.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time because my dentist said they were good for dry mouth problems. They taste good and work day or night.</li>
            <li> I use a CPAP at night for my sleep apnea. Unfortunately I tend to breath through my mouth at night and use a face mask with the CPAP. This has resulted in \\&quot;dry mouth\\&quot; when I wake up. I&#x27;d tried various ways to get around this (sprays, mouthwashes, etc) but nothing seemed to help.    I found Xylimelts and gave them a try. They make a big difference. You put two in your mouth when you go to sleep. They have a gum side which helps keep them in place so you don&#x27;t choke on them. They last most of the night and by morning my mouth is not so dry. They&#x27;re not perfect, but they&#x27;ve made a significant difference.</li>
            <li> A great solution to an extremely bad case of chronic, constant dry mouth brought on by health issues. It does leave my mouth a little gummy but it&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t deal with.</li>
            <li> wow! My E.N.T. doctor advised me to shy away from these types of products. I suffer from virtually constant dry mouth due to the interaction of medications I use. I tried Biotene spray which is pretty good but is not a spray but in fact a &#x27;stream&#x27; so it makes it difficult covering the whole inside of your mouth evenly a bit of a challenge. As with many things this was an impulse buy. I read the instructions and they direct you to put the tan side of the tablet on your molar and the wide side facing the check (it does adhere to the molar.) At first I was unhappy with this little lump stuck in my cheek but it became barely noticeable after a few minutes and worked great for hours. Sometimes I split them in half with a razor blade because they are just that good. I also wear a night retainer so often my mouth falls open while sleeping and it causes dry mouth. Also helpful during meditation and while undergoing acupuncture where my body relaxes and my jaw slowly opens up as I relax causing dry mouth and detracting from healing sessions. These are great. If you buy them and don&#x27;t like them let me know....I will buy them from you.</li>
            <li> These are a great answer to my lack of saliva . . . two- or three-a-day!  And at night also!!</li>
            <li> I used the XyLiMelts for about three weeks. Then  I used Three in the same spot in the same day and Gums started to pill off and they were sore . I&#x27;m wondering Why this happened.They did work for me.Now I&#x27;m off this item..</li>
            <li> Was putting sugar free hard candy in my mouth at bedtime that was a little bulky.  These are small and long lasting.  Generally need 2-3 per night.</li>
            <li> I am giving the XyliMelts five stars because it really does conquer my dry mouth.  At night my mouth stays moist from using two of these easy-to-use little tablets.  They stay put on the side of your mouth and you wake up without the dryness.  This should really help with the cavities I got from the dry mouth condition. Nice to keep some in your pocket for day use too.</li>
            <li> used for 30 days but did not feel it was helping my situation</li>
            <li> These work really well. I had cancer of the tonsil and the radiation fried my salivary glands plus I use a c-pap machine that also dries your mouth. This has been a God sent for me.</li>
            <li> For cpap users, this is an excellent product.  My dentist started me on this and I have used it ever since.  Love it.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work for me. You have to have moisture for them to work; all I get is slime.</li>
            <li> Last year I had radiation to treat throat cancer and it left me with extremely dry mouth.  Started using Xylimelts in November of last year and they work really well but at the same time  I developed a chronic nighttime cough.  Sometimes I cough half the night and it is as bad as dry mouth for keeping me awake.  Has anyone else had this experience?</li>
            <li> Due to medications I have to take, I really need to keep my mouth moist while I&#x27;m on the go during the day and at bedtime. You can place them on your gums or even Dental Plates, I don&#x27;t fear choking as I drift off to sleep. .  I Really Do Prefer the Slightly Mint Fresh Flavor. . I use them so often I like to Get the 80 count.  Could you check if they still carry the refreshing Mint?  Please........?</li>
            <li> Work great. Help me sleep well thru the night as I sleep with CPAA machine.</li>
            <li> love these melts.  have very dry mouth in the winter and keep these in my pocket.  mild and effective melt</li>
            <li> These worked pretty good but after a few days I felt I was getting soar spots where they were attached to the gums. BTW, I used these with my CPAP machine.</li>
            <li> A LIFE SAVER FOR ME!&lt;br /&gt;I am SO glad I found these!  With the various meds I take .. and have taken I have a serious problem with dry mouth at night.  I have followed others recommendation of rotating around to the four corners of the mouth each night and it has made such a difference for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start my nightly routine with 4 sprays of  Xlear Spry Rain Oral Mist with Xylitol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Xlear-Spry-Xylitol-4-5oz-Packages/dp/B0019LU5K4/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1437084989&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;spry+rain+oral+mist&amp;pebp&#x3D;1437085105397&amp;perid&#x3D;1P73CG40RF5H9AG62CQD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; .. then a dab of  Biotene Oral Balance Gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0064QVBFC/ref&#x3D;sr_ph_1?m&#x3D;ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1437085266&amp;sr&#x3D;1&amp;keywords&#x3D;biotene+oral+balance+gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;then off to bed with a button of the XyliMelts for Dry Mouth.  I know this may seem like a lot of trouble .. BUT for those of us with a dry mouth issue .. I was just grateful to my wonderful dentist who told me about one of these products .. which with research led me to the other solutions.  Does not solve for the full night but certainly helps a great deal!</li>
            <li> Works great. Don&#x27;t wakeup to drink water all night.</li>
            <li> I had radiation for squamous cell tumors in my neck January-March 2014.  My taste buds and salivary glands are nonexistent. I could poor water down my throat and as soon a I swallowed the dry throat returned making it difficult to get any uninterrupted REM sleep.  I met a fellow who had similar cancer and treatment and recommended XyliMelts. They have given me such relief that I now sleep well and uninterrupted due to a parched throat.  I passed some on to a lady I met at a wedding in Connecticut who, six after her radiation was sill plagued by the dryness in her throat.  I gave her a sleeve of the melts  to try and the next morning she came over early to tell me that it was the first night of complete rest she had had in six years..On the last visit to my Oncologist I began to tell him about it and he was so interested he began writing down the name of &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34; drug.  I saved him some time and gave him a box with one sleeve in it to give to some of his patients.  Odd as it may seed, many MD&#x27;s are not aware of some simple aides to the ravishes of throat cancer that are over the counter.</li>
            <li> These work very well but are expensive.</li>
            <li> I have had the mild mint flavored ones and prefer them. These little tablets are great for increasing saliva for dry mouth conditions. I would give 5 stars to the mint ones because they add a refreshing flavor and scent to the other benefits of the product. If you suffer from dry mouth but are sensitive to mint, these are an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> Have had dry mouth issues due to a medication. I cannot exist without xylimelts. Use two or more every single night.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth from surgery and radiation. I use two tabs when going to bed, It works for several hours. Best thing I can find.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I would like these and I really hoped they&#x27;d work. They are disgusting and the taste made me gag and want to puke. I woke up in the middle of the night and the thing fully dissolved and I had a coating of chalkiness in my mouth. I don&#x27;t recommend these! GROSS</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry mouth, this stuff works! The tablets stick you your gum during the night (you place between your cheek and gum, and it stays in place as it melts. I have tried the mint flavored one, which some don&#x27;t prefer, and I like it more than this plain version. It&#x27;s a bit pricy for a sugar cube, but it sure beats a dry mouth!</li>
            <li> No more sore throat when i wake. Has improved my cough and throat feels moistened.</li>
            <li> Good.  Cheaper than some forever mints</li>
            <li> I take a med that causes perpetual dry mouth in the afternoons, this product in both the mint and mint-free takes care of it along with keeping my breath fresh.  Lasts much longer that a sugar/typical sugar free mint.</li>
            <li> Dont work very well. Would not purchase again</li>
            <li> For someone suffering from dry mouth there is nothing else that comes close to this product. I use it nightly. One tablet does not last the whole night but it suffices to keep my mouth adequately lubricated so I&#x27;ve never needed to use a second one.</li>
            <li> Like many consumers of XyliMelts, I have Sjögren&#x27;s Syndrome. Other xerostomia sufferers have raved about this product, so I was very hopeful for good results and I didn&#x27;t have any doubt that it would help. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t. My mouth is just too dry and my salivary glands don&#x27;t work enough for Xylimelts to stimulate any sort of moisture in my mouth at all. In fact, because of the dryness, they don&#x27;t even melt! For those of you whose Sjögren&#x27;s Syndrome isn&#x27;t too bad, maybe this will help you. If you suffer badly, just know that these may not help at all.</li>
            <li> The product helped me the way I intended it to.  My mouth has stayed more hydrated as I run races.</li>
            <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s disease and these really work for me.  I was a 10 year user of Biotene products especially the Oral Balance.  When they reformulated it and took out the enzymes and made it thinner, it no longer worked for me.  Now I use Xylimelts at night and they last anywhere from 4 to 8 hours.  I would prefer to use the original formula of Oral Balance because of the protective enzymes, but it is no longer available.  So for anyone with a very dry mouth I recommend Xylimelts.  I no long use any of the Biotene products, because they are inferior products now!</li>
            <li> I just returned from having my teeth cleaned. My hygienist is jumping for joy. I have been plagued with a dry mouth for years due to the medications I take. I use an electric toothbrush, a WaterPik, Rx fluoride toothpaste, take Pilocarpine tablets 3 times a day, and have my teeth cleaned every 3 months with a fluoride varnish. I have tried other gels and mints but nothing works better than OraCoat XyliMelts. I can&#x27;t chew gum at work and my mouth gets so dry that I can hardly talk. I tried a sample of XyliMelts last November. I have ordered and used them ever since. They are easy to carry and easy to use. No fears of a mint flying out my mouth or my mouth feeling pasty. I use 1 Xylimelt while I am at work and 2 at bedtime. My hygienist was so impressed with how easy it was to remove the plaque. We can only attribute this to the XyliMelts. I had no new cavities and may be able to go 4 months rather than every 3 months to have my teeth cleaned. XyliMelts are natural and totally AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I use this product quite regularly. It has helped me with my over oral health. I had a bad case of ginigivitis, but xylimelts have helped the condtion of my mouth to stablize in addtion to brushing flossing, and mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist and I have been recommending these to my patients to help with the discomfort of dry mouth for almost a year. Everyone (over 50 patients) have reported back to me that they LOVE them.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these to send to my grandpa when I learned that he has been sleeping with a cough drop in his cheek every night for years. He is so happy, he has been telling everyone. Now his friends are calling me to find out more.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t know, Xylimelts main ingredietn is xylitol. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol that is found in nature. Its in foods we already eat: raspberries, mushrooms, lettuce and others. It is not an artificial sweetener. It is the ONLY sweetener (artificial or natural) that is not harmful to teeth. That&#x27;s what makes Xylimelts so amazing! They are pleasant tasting and good for your teeth. The bacteria that cause cavities don&#x27;t metabolize xylitol like other sugars. Xylitol is an amazing natural product. I encourage you to learn more about it!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Helps with post radiation dry mouth at night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found for dry mouth.  They last about four hours in my mouth at night. My dentist and my hygienist told me lack of saliva can increase bacteria  in the mouth.  Xylitol in the mint is a natural swetener that has antibacterial properties. Between that and the salivary stimulation from the slight mint flavor they should be a big help for my dental health.</li>
            <li> have used these for some time now and love them</li>
            <li> Excellent for alleviating dry mouth.  Before using these, I would wake up with the feeling that everything in my mouth had turned into a brick.  Since I started placing one tablet on the upper right molar before going to sleep, sthe dryness has stopped. The tablet has a coating that keeps it in place while it gradually melts.  I chose the mint-free because the flavored version was too sharp to my taste.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good.  They stick in your mouth and keep it moist when sleeping.  I use a CPAP machine which drys my mouth.  These do help but do not last all night.</li>
            <li> They work for about 3 to 4 hours at night to keep enough saliva flowing to prevent dry mouth, and if you wake up you can take a second tablet. After a few weeks, however, my tongue became quite sore on the side where the Xylimelts tablet was placed. The soreness was relieved only by not taking the tablet for several days, but returned when I started taking them again. Same for both  the tablets with mint flavor and the mint free.</li>
            <li> Great product to fight gingivitus; highly recommended by my dentist.    It is great tasting and I use it nightly...</li>
            <li> nice to wake up with a moist mouth</li>
            <li> I have tried all the regular stuff for dry mouth, lozenges - sugar free of course - but these are so much better.  It says use 2 at a time, but for me 1 at a time has been fine, I usually wake up and put in a second one after the first is gone.  The Xytrol works to kill bacteria as well as sweeten the melt so you have a win - win.  So very glad I found them.  They came so fast it surprised me too. I recommend them, absolutely.</li>
            <li> Xylimelts are awesome! I first started using them when my dental hygienist noticed I had a small amount of tooth decay from dry mouth. I use them every night, and voila, the tooth decay went away completely! Also, I sleep better because my mouth is not so dry during the night!</li>
            <li> It increases the moisture in my mouth a little bit. It does not last long enough.</li>
            <li> The best product for chronic dry mouth</li>
            <li> I have severe dry mouth due to medication.  XyliMelts is the best product I&#x27;ve found.  Biotene mouthwash, spray, and gel alleviate the dryness for about 15 minutes.  Xylimelts last several hours.  The only downside is it&#x27;s a little difficult to talk with the product in your mouth.</li>
            <li> My son, my dentist, recommended these. Highly recommend this for anyone suffering from dry mouth.  Really does help!  They are easy to use too!</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do, but it is not too convenient nor is the taste good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it works for some people, but I have put the box in our medicine cabinet and will wonder why I evern bought it.</li>
            <li> I have terribly severe dry mouth due to 14 medications fighting an incurable disease. I have even lost teeth, tooth, by tooth, some with a previous crown or root canal. I have tried every product I hear about or research. I found the only products that help me have xylitol in them.  Even so, they only give temporary relief. I am SO HAPPY I just desperately searched &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; again on Amazon. I&#x27;ve tried other things too. This is absolutely a miracle. The effect lasts for hours and your talking isn&#x27;t effected at all. I know a person can use 2 at night, but I only NEED ONE!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Thanks!</li>
            <li> First product that really worked.  With Sjogrens I&#x27;d been waking several times a night needing mouth gel or water or ?  That hasn&#x27;t happened since using these tablets!  Amazing.</li>
            <li> I love these little things!  They are such a great thing for my severe dry mouth!  I would be in deep trouble without them.  If you suffer from dry mouth, get some of these little jewels and get relief!  I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed in the least.</li>
            <li> Tried a similar product and left a nasty residue in my mouth, these do not. Seems to only last a few hours and didn&#x27;t really help me(dry mouth for two or three weeks while sleeping after septoplasty surgery).</li>
            <li> Worked well, especially if two are used at bedtime.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended them.  They are amazing!  They work wonders for a dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I like them quite well.</li>
            <li> This worked really well and lasted a very long time.  Might be worth a try if you take a bunch of medicine that dries you up.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about  a year.  I used to wake up at night many times with dry mouth, needing to drink water; then I would wake up to go to the bathroom.  Xylimelts has practically eliminated the need for the waking at night.  I have shared this product with several friends, and recommended them to my daughter who is a physician.  She has many patients who are elderly, and she has recommended Xylimelts to them with good results.</li>
            <li> I am a victim of autoimmune disease and take several meds that create dry mouth.  This is the best,portable application of an oral aid on the market.  I put one in my lower gum area and it melts away during the night.  My peanut-butter-tasting morning mouth is gone! This just works. period.</li>
            <li> I have not tried using two at night, as recommended, so results would most likely improve.&lt;br /&gt;Not 100% effective for me, but worth using.</li>
            <li> I tend to chew anything up I put into my mouth, so a lot of lozenges would not work for me because they&#x27;d be gone too quickly. This product adheres on your gums and stays there un-noticed. It slowly dissolves and keeps your mouth moist. I just wish it had a bit more xylitol for a more anti-cariogenic effect, but I guess you could just pack two of these, one on each side to get a higher dose.</li>
            <li> First thing that ever lasted. Even with the C pap</li>
            <li> dentist recommended thses for my dry mouth. works great</li>
            <li> Got these for my mom. She is 79 and suffers from sever dry mouth due to some heart meds.  She felt that these were a gift from God.  So they work !</li>
            <li> Great product.  Had dry mouth resulting from chemo and radiation to throat area.  This product really works!  Just put two in each side of mouth at night and can finally sleep through the entire night.  Great for sports also.</li>
            <li> Works really well overnight to prevent dry mouth.  Lasts till morning which is the first product I have found of this kind.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but I have to say this product has saved my sanity.  I was suffering from severe dry mouth each night when I went to bed, and started dreading having to try to sleep because I was waking up every couple of hours from the dry mouth.  I had tried several other &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; products with no relief.  Since I have started using the XyliMelts, I can sleep pretty much all night long.  I may wake up once or twice, but many nights don&#x27;t wake up at all.  I love this product!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these thinking they would be fairly flat and would adhere to my gums (as stated). They are about the size of an aspirin and the adhesive doesn&#x27;t really work. So you lay there trying to go to sleep with these two &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34; between your cheek and gums. Maybe this won&#x27;t bother some people but I think there are better ways to deal with dry mouth. They do help if you can get used to it. Also. they tend to move around in your mouth and you end up thinking &amp;#34;screw it&amp;#34; and just chew them up.</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth caused by medications.</li>
            <li> These little melts work very good for dry mouth. I have tried other brands that taste so bad, they would never make me salivate. XyliMelts have a light mint taste and you can use them while you sleep. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to get these, obviously he has not tried them.  They made my gums raw and did not add any help to the problem.  Try BIotene products especially the gel and I got much more relief.  Of course I bought two boxes and they are wasted money.</li>
            <li> This really works  Was surprised though to learn that you need to use two and &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; them to your teeth.  You do not use paste and the curvature of the melt fits nicely against one of your back teeth.  I am sure this is to ensure that you do not fall asleep and choke on the melt. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried many products for my dry mouth. Suffering from Sjogrens  syndrome means trying every product to get relief.  I tried xylimelts and now I can&#x27;t leave home without them.  I use two before bedtime and they last all night. It is the perfect product for relief of dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review for Biafine cream that I purchased for my husband who has undergone radiation and chemotherapy for throat cancer. A side-effect of these treatments has been a loss of his salivary glands so he has absolutely no saliva production. These tablets have been heaven-sent! Nothing else has provided him relief from his extremely dry mouth like XyliMelts. The best part for him has been that they are available mint-free. Any other products that I was able to find to help him all had flavor added - especially mint. Well, the flavor additives greatly increased his throat pain. The cancer treatments have caused the soft tissues of his throat to be like raw meat. Therefore, flavor additives only burn the tissues more. The mint free Xylimelts do not irritate the soft tissues at all. Right now we are waiting the lastest delivery of Xylimelts and thank God they will arrive today as he is *desperate* without them. Do not hesitate to purchase these little miracles if you have dry mouth or know someone who has. Thank you, Amazon! You are *the* best for your product lines and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> These melts are good if one didn&#x27;t have another source for products for dry mouth. I have found another product that I am real happy with.</li>
            <li> this has worked very well for me. I use a CPAP to sleep and dry mouth was getting to be a real problem including issues with my teeth. this seems to have resolved the dry mouth issue completely.</li>
            <li> I have Sj&amp;ouml;gren&#x27;s syndrome and I use these at bedtime. They really help with the dry mouth situation and have a mild pleasant taste. I have tried similar melts that were not as good.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth due to Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome and use to wake up during the night needing to sip water.  Now, I just put two of these things in and no problems!  They taste good and keep my throat from feeling dry.  I will keep these in my bed side table for the foreseeable future!</li>
            <li> These really work well. Especially at night. I used to get very dehydrated due to taking medications and had to drink a lot of water. This totally takes the place of that. I love them.</li>
            <li> Has the least amount of bad stuff and xylitol actually HELPS teeth.  One at night works and doesn&#x27;t have much taste at all.  I really like these and now sleep thru the night!!!!!!  It stays in place and I have to check in the morning to see if any is left.  Very unobtrusive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand this product.&lt;br /&gt;The taste is very unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to help my dry mouth caused as a side effect of a medication I take.&lt;br /&gt;The way that the pills stick to your mouth is very weird and makes speaking hard (during the day) and makes me nervous that I will choke (at night)</li>
            <li> This product does work and keeps mouth wet, without water. It adheres to gums and melts. I used it on roof of mouth and my tongue kept rubbing it causing pain. I would still use it when I have a dry mouth, just place elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Wife uses these for dry mouth relief during sleep. They do help. Xylitol supposedy gives an added benefit of tooth decay prevention</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth due to using an antihistamine and a few prescription meds.  My mouth would be so dry at night, I would have a hard time sleeping.  And obviously, drinking a ton of water in the middle of the night is not a great idea.  These pills soothe me to sleep and take over an hour to melt completely which is great.  Also I&#x27;ve noticed less plaque on my teeth so that&#x27;s just an added bonus.  I&#x27;ve even used these pills during the day while talking and they didn&#x27;t bother me.  If you have dry mouth, you will love these.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing antidote for dry mouth .</li>
            <li> When medications keep your mouth from staying moist, these pills really work.  I&#x27;ve suffered from many gum line cavities as a result of medications, and was tired of chewing gum and sucking on cough drops.  My dentist suggested I try these, and I am so glad he did!</li>
            <li> xlnt!  I sleep with them every night, but if your mouth is really dry, you might have to augment with sugar-free lifesavers or the like.</li>
            <li> They sort of sit between a molar and your gum, actually last at least an hour, probably would work better on someone without such a dry mouth.  Mine is outrageously dry due to medications, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a fair trial.</li>
            <li> They are very hard and have an unusual taste. I have tried many products for chronic dry mouth. I cannot recommend these.</li>
            <li> I thought there was NO solution. I have had an exceedingly bad problem with dry mouth for years, after having come out of cancer treatment twice and having been given a regimen of drugs that would make a desert of a lake. As well, the dry mouth is so bad that I often have difficulty simply *speaking,* and end up sounding like a drunk as I try to be articulate and stumble through teeth-sticking, tongue gymnastics. I have tried all the toothpastes, gum, mouthwashes, sprays, and other melts and lozenges, but NOTHING did the trick - as soon as the lozenges melted, that was the end of relief. This was an extremely frustrating state to live with. A 50 year old never having had a cavity, I was BUMMED when I got three of them as a result of this cruel dry-mouth punishment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xylimelts are the answer to my prayers. They do everything that the information states. I would say that you have to get used to sticking it to the teeth/gums; I put it on the upper back gum/molar. It seems to need a full 20 seconds of holding the mint there for it to stick well. It feels a bit rough there until it smooths out with some melting. After that it&#x27;s fine, as long as you don&#x27;t fool with it with your tongue. The melt lasts an hour, two if you are very calm (asleep or not talking/moving the mouth). It continually emits a really pleasant mint taste into the mouth, and makes it fresh and very pleasant. When I sleep with these, although they are gone when I wake, my mouth is relieved, moist and fresh. It stimulates a wetter, nicer mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the ultimate, GREAT breath mint, also. Had I known about these when I was dating, I would have been thrilled...to know that for hours, my mouth would have been mint-fresh...ahhh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough about these little things that have been a life-changer for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Changed LIFE!  Don&#x27;t wake up with paper mouth anymore.</li>
            <li> The mints help me at night to keep my mouth moist.</li>
            <li> I use 1 and it does a great job. Far superior to the gel I previously uaed.</li>
            <li> Because I breathe through my mouth at night, I would wake up one or more times a night with cheeks and tongue feeling like sandpaper.  That meant going for a drink of water every time I woke up.  Because my mouth was constantly so dry, I got a cut on the inside of my lip that had not healed for several weeks.  I had just about given up until I tried this product.  Now after a few weeks, the cut has healed and I don&#x27;t wake up with a mouth feeling like sandpaper.  Hopefully my dental checkups will also improve, not having a dry mouth all night.</li>
            <li> These really work! I will not do without them.  My mouth is dry due to medication and it is damaging my teeth so I tried these.  My mouth is nice and moist all through the night now! Love them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the mint flavored Xylimelts and decided to give the mint-free ones a try.  I usually only use them at night but on those occasions when I use them while out and about I thought it would be nice to be able to drink a beverage without having the slight mint flavor.  These don&#x27;t have a strong mint flavor but there is still something . . . not sure what.  It&#x27;s not a bad taste and it makes sense that there would be some kind of flavor.  So, I will probably continue to use them during the day.  I don&#x27;t know that there is a need to purchase the mint-free version, though, since the mint version is not too strong.</li>
            <li> The Xylimelts are long lasting and stick to your gum, so are a great benefit when sleeping.  Also terrific when exercising.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for one of our patients and she says they work really well!</li>
            <li> Really prevents dry mouth during night!</li>
            <li> I have severe dry mouth and I find it difficult to sleep at night. So much so that I have anxiety about not being able to swallow. Since using this product, my anxiety level has been greatly reduced. My mouth is not dry throughout the night. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These little disks are made with xylitol with a thin vegetable gum on the backside that allows it to stick to the outside of your gum, sometimes I&#x27;ll stick one to the roof of my mouth. They dissolve slowly promoting saliva production and preventing plaque and bacterial buildup in your mouth.</li>
            <li> had mouth cancer, you don;t know what dry mouth is.....these truly help!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many dry mouth products and nothing works like XyliMelts!!!&lt;br /&gt;Its so nice to  not wake up in the middle of the night with a dry mouth!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar products with little if any help.  ylimelts seem to provide relief..  I use them in addition to Biotene mouthwash</li>
            <li> I went thru radiation around my neck area and has dry mouth.  I&#x27;ve tried XyliMelts and somewhat finds it okay and pop in two into mouth when I awaken by the dry mouth and soon can go back to sleep again.</li>
            <li> I bought it twice and I will continue buying it.  Good product - helps with dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Pricey, that&#x27;s why 4 stars</li>
            <li> This product did keep a nightly dry mouth more moist ... however found that it caused stomach bloat.  So for those with sensitive stomachs ...it might not work well.</li>
            <li> Better than nothing, but not a lot better than just sucking on a cough drop or hard candy. Some rave about these, you just have to try what is available. Dry mouth relief varies from person to person.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with chronic dry mouth at night for years. My dentist recommended the xylimelts so I ordered them as soon as I got home. They were at my door the next day!! Now, I place two above my teeth line, they stick really well, and last all night. I now do not wake up every couple of hours to drink water! In fact, I never have to drink water during the night. I&#x27;m extremely please with these miracle melts!</li>
            <li> These disks are a blessing for dry mouth and I use one every night and sometime in church.</li>
            <li> My husband pops one of these in his mouth before bedtime and avoids the dry mouth in the morning. He uses a C-Pap machine so these are a big help. Best thing he&#x27;s found &amp; he&#x27;s tried lots of others!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic because you can use it comfortably and safely as you sleep. I&#x27;m very happy I found this product</li>
            <li> I take a medication that leaves me with an annoyingly dry mouth, especially at night. I find these Xylimelts helpful to stay asleep longer instead of waking up frequently to find my tongue stuck to my soft palate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take two to be effective for me, so I put one on each side of my mouth. I&#x27;ve tried under the tongue as well as between my gums and cheek. Under the tongue seems to produce more saliva.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;adhesive&amp;#34; is adequate to quite good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the xylitol helps reduce cavities, that&#x27;s just a bonus!</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my husband who suffers from Dry Mouth as a side effect from medication.&lt;br /&gt;They really work and allow him to get a full night sleep and not wake up during the night in search&lt;br /&gt;of something to drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes for a peaceful night ! Yeah!</li>
            <li> My mom is 90 &amp; had problems at night with dry mouth and this product really helped her.  She is a regular user now.</li>
            <li> These are great for those of us suffering from dry mouth.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; and now I depend on them. Not only are they healthy, I no longer wake in the morning feeling as though I&#x27;ve trekked across the desert.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had an allergy to this product ands I am tolerating  my dry mouth.</li>
            <li> These Xylimelts really help! They easily adhere to the inside of your cheek and are innocuous during the night (unlike another brand). The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I think the mint flavored version is a little better - and I don&#x27;t usually like mint. But the mint flavor is very mild and pleasing. I find I go to sleep with one and it lasts about half the night. If I get up around 3 or 4am it&#x27;s usually completely melted but I rarely need another one at that point for it seems to have a residual effect.</li>
            <li> XyliMelts for dry mouth really works especially at night.&lt;br /&gt;Allows for a good night&#x27;s sleep. I have learned that I can&lt;br /&gt;gradually cut  down on the number of XyliMelts I need each day. JMH</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended these to me. They are excellent for controlling dry mouth any time but especially during the night.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found....Able to sleep through the night without waking up with dry mouth....Thought that might never happen again....Very pleased...</li>
            <li> I like the idea of the product, as I have a really dry mouth at night because of my medication.  It would be nice if they were more minty, and most of all, melted faster in your mouth.  You are supposed to put them on the side of your cheeks before you fall asleep.  I found myself awake longer than I would have been, waiting for them to dissolve.  They are fairly hard tablets and aren&#x27;t very comfortable to have between you cheeks and gums.  I have used them since.  Plus, they aren&#x27;t  cheap!</li>
            <li> It is long-lasting and very mildly flavored.  Not so sure it was encouraging me to salivate enough to keep up with it&#x27;s gel-making qualities, though.  Mouth was kind of dry and sticky.  Not parched but not comfortable, either.</li>
            <li> I use them at night and they work.  I am a CPac user and my mouth wants to come&lt;br /&gt;open and dry out.  My dental hygienist recommend them I tried them and they do&lt;br /&gt;work.  They stick to your gum/teeth when brown side placed against them and they&lt;br /&gt;stay there.</li>
            <li> I have used XyleMelts for several years and was pleased to see them available through Smile.Amazon.  I will continue to order them through Amazon because they work so well and it is so easy to have them delivered right to the front door.</li>
            <li> As a dental hygienist and now nightly user I really like these Xylimelts.  I am a CPAP user and my mouth gets very dry at night. I&#x27;ve tried other products but these are the easiest and most effective.  Simply place one alongside the gum and it sticks instantly and moisturizers the mouth all night long as it melts.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t slept so well in about three years when I first experienced dry mouth at night.  I uses one tab per night and get a good night&#x27;s sleep.  My dental hygienist recommended them😊</li>
            <li> maybe I expected too much.  I was hoping it would like 2 - 3 hours.  It lasts about an hour for me.  I wanted to use this when I am drinking alcohol in social settings (I have dry mouth issues in general but it gets quite bad when drinking), but it tends to last even less than an hour when I am constantly drinking.  I am trying Forever Mints next - although I don&#x27;t want to taste mint when consuming alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s effective in treating dry mouth.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  I just wished that it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> These work very well for ny dry mouth. I use them as needed during the day &amp; use 2 when I&#x27;m going to sleep. They stay attached to the inside if your mouth very well &amp; melt slowly over hours to help dry mouth. I tried the mouth spray but it only lasts for a very short time</li>
            <li> Extremely helpful when one has to take medication which causes dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them to everyone who has this problem.</li>
            <li> These are the best. My dentist recommended these for my dry mouth and they really work. No more getting up in the middle of the night to drink water! Better than Biotene gel.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that has a problem with dry mouth. I don&#x27;t wake up in the morning with a dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist to have my teeth cleaned and they gave me a free sample at their office of the Xylimelts because I have dry mouth.  I used the samples every night and I could tell immediate relief didn&#x27;t feel like I woke up in the desert.</li>
            <li> I have Dry Mouth and these are the best lozenges I&#x27;ve found .They adhere well to my teeth and cheek, and last for hours. I like the mint-free version. They last almost through the night when I sleep. They come in a blister pack so you only open one at a time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who underwent aggressive chemotherapy and radiation, which resulted in no saliva production.  He had very bad dry mouth.  These melts are a life-saving thing for him.  They soothe his discomfort of dry mouth.  He loves that they are mint-free, which do not lead to any laryngeal spams.</li>
            <li> I do like this product for dry mouth. It really does work well. just doesnt last as long as I expected. To expensive may not order again due to cost.</li>
            <li> These xylimelts works really well. I have been looking for something to help me with my dry mouth symptoms for a long time.  I have tried other products and they haven&#x27;t worked for they leave a bad after taste, but these melts take care of my symptoms and leave no after taste.</li>
            <li> These have been the most successful product for helping to keep away dry mouth. My dentist had suggested another Xyli product.  She said one ingredient actually helps oral health.  She also said to start slowly until your stomach gets used to the product.  I started with one in my cheek at night.  I was so pleased that I now can use one while shopping.</li>
            <li> The amount of xylitol in each sticker is not impressive, it hardly stays in place and it is WAY too expensive. Seems like a useless way to get your xyltiol. Just go with gum or mints in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband. One year following his radiation for neck cancer, he still struggle with dry mouth. He had to wake up every hour to drink during night time because of it. We tried biotin from gel, mouth spray, mouth wash, but it didn&#x27;t help. Until we went back to doctor for check up, they gave us sample of this xylimelts to try.&lt;br /&gt;It works great. At night he could have at least 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep. And before, he also often had soar gum problem due to the dryness of the mouth, now it less frequent.&lt;br /&gt;The dose said, take 1 to put on each inside of between cheek and gum. But he just put in just 1 side. And it is enough for him.&lt;br /&gt;So even I don&#x27;t use this product, I witness it help improve my husband mouth problem.</li>
            <li> My husband is recovering from head and neck cancer treatments, one result of which is extreme dry mouth.  I learned of this product on the Cancer Survivors&#x27; Network, and it has truly been a life-saver for him, as for many others.  He couldn&#x27;t tolerate the Biotene or similar products more readily available.  XyliMelts allowed him to return to teaching and sleeping.  We couldn&#x27;t do without them!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to mint so this was a great find. I use them every night even with my mouth inserts for sleep apnea.</li>
            <li> Purchased these on recommendation from my dental hygentist. Used two last night in my inside cheeks.Mouth was nice and moist till morning.My neck injury medications make my mouth terribly dry,which leads to cavities. Signed up for the subscribe and save on this item.</li>
            <li> I have had dry mouth fr 2 years.  I tried everything available, Biotene, mouth devices, etc.  Xylimelts are a perfect solution.  I use 1 per night. It lasts through the night. Once placed in the mouth it takes 1-1 1/2 hours before they seem to begin to work.  Normally that time frame works as my dry mouth doesn&#x27;t begin until then after I&#x27;ve gone to bed.  Once placed it seems as though there is nothing in my mouth.  The flavor is minimal.  I awake in the morning with a fresh tasting mouth and no dry mouth.  Great product.  I&#x27;ve not used it long enough to see if an irritation occurs within my mouth due to extended usage.  I&#x27;m hoping not.  Everything I read about xylitol suggests there are no symptoms which would prohibit my usage.</li>
            <li> Since being diagnosed with Sjögren&#x27;s Syndrome , i understood why i had to constantly have a water bottle with me , &amp; why i woke up parched in the middle of the night . These Xylimelts work wonders - i only use them at night - &amp; haven&#x27;t awakened with a parched mouth since i started using them. Fantastic product !</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to last the entire night, but it just melts away within couple hours. For this price I&#x27;d expect it to last all night. I am going to try other options.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 3 months now and highly recommend it. I have dry mouth but only at night.  This has resulted in high dental bills during the past couple years. I first tried Biotene Oralbalance since it was available locally and was recommended by my dentist.  This helped, but has to be applied heavily to be effective. Since it only comes in a small (1.5 oz) tube, a tube lasts me only about 10 days. This makes this an expensive solution. I found these Orahealth Xylimelts time released Domed mints ONLINE and decided to try them. They work perfectly. In the last 3 months the only occurance I&#x27;ve had of night time dry mouth was on the only night I FORGOT to take my Xylimelt tablet before going to bed. The instructions say to use 2 tablets at night, one on each side of the mouth. I find that if I use only one, it works as far as preventing dry mouth, though two would probably work better. Using one tablet each night, a box of 60 Xylimelts will last 2 months and costs only slightly more than a 1.5 oz tube of Biotene OralBalance. I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering with night time dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and thought it was gum, my mistake.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have said it well.  It just sits there in your mouth, sticks to your gums and provides some measure of moisture overnight.  I do notice that my inner cheek is all wrinkly in the spot where I use the tablets,(kinda like your fingers get wrinkled in water).  I can minimize this if I vary the placement each night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use one tablet, but the directions suggest using two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found these first on Amazon and later was given a sample by my dentist.  I have been unable to find these in stores in my area, so I was happy to find them online.  Check the manufacturer&#x27;s website for free samples.</li>
            <li> My partner has dry mouth every morning and these mints really work.  She has not had a problem with dry mouth since she started taking these mints.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT WHEN YOU SUFFER FROM DRY MOUTH. GREAT INVENTION, TOO. IT ADHERES TO THE INSIDE OF YOUR MOUTH SO YOU DO NOT CHOCK. HELPS TO KEEP MOISTURE IN YOUR MOUTH AS YOU SLEEP. I LIKE THE MINT FREE VS. THE MINT FLAVOR BETTER. THANKS FOR CARRY THIS PRODUCT. WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time sleeping before my daughter introduced them to me. She is dental hygenist for my dry mouth. Because i &#x27;m a mouth breather.  And I introduced it to another friend.</li>
            <li> These help me so much at night. No more CPAP dry mouth after I tuck one in each cheek at night.</li>
            <li> These are the best. They last long and dont taste like a flavor you would get sick of. Xylitol is a naturally derived sweetener that helps feed your healthy bacteria in the body. The sticky part is actually made from acacia which is a naturally sticky tree sap. Acacia is known to also help support healthy bacteria in the body. I have very sensitive teeth and these have never bothered them or left marks.  The best part is that if i want to just suck on these like a mint its very easy to break off the sticky layer in one piece with a little pressure from my front teeth before I pop it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Important to me.  I have sleep apnea and wear a CPAP at night.  Melts keep my mouth moist.</li>
            <li> really helps for sleeping at night</li>
            <li> My mouth stays moist overnight with one or two tablets.  It&#x27;s nice to not need to drink water all night to keep my mouth from drying.&lt;br /&gt;The tablet dissolves completely, not like another product I used to use.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer mint free, and the taste is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;No graininess.  Limited ingredients.</li>
            <li> These work great for those with dry mouth problems, especially those of us with Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome. I use them every night and sometimes during the day.</li>
            <li> They work well I just like the biotene gum better..it lasts longer.  Just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> Keeps mouth from drying up too much. Slight after taste in morning.</li>
            <li> I purchased XyliMelts for dry mouth and to change the pH in my mouth. It&#x27;s working well for both. I highly recommend this product to anyone with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> My scripts for asthma, heart disease, chronic pain, bladder, prostate, etc. diseases dry out my saliva.  Buy this and be happy.</li>
            <li> Great for when going through RAI during the isolation period I would use 2 a night. It helps a lot!</li>
            <li> I have a medical condition that has dried my mouth out, and my teeth were becomming affected. These arw great for nighttime because they adhere to your teeth and you won&#x27;t choke. If you talk for a living, as I do, they help compliment water, and keep your breath fresh. I recommend these for dry-mouth sufferers.</li>
            <li> My dentist recently suggested I try XyliMelts to help me with severe dry mouth (caused from radiation of the oral cavity).  The product is convenient to use and has assisted with my lack of saliva by providing much needed moisture.  XyliMelts are more convenient for me to use rather than gel based products that dissipate all too quickly.  I do not get the ultimate 6 hours of benefit, but certainly 2 to 3 hours.  The plain and mild mint varieties provide the least amount of irritation to sensitive soft tissue.</li>
            <li> These little discs work as advertised.  When I wake, my mouth is not all dried out like it used to be.  I am a fan! I am ordering my third box.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> If you have dry mouth from Sjogrens or medications or whatever reason, to use these overnight is a lifesaver as far as being able to sleep comfortably through the night, which is what my housemate uses them for. She can&#x27;t say enough good things about them, and is giving boxes away like crazy for her friends to try them, she is such a fan. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> when you have a dry mouth like my husband does, because he&#x27;s on antibiotics that make his mouth so dyed out. This stuff is great!!!</li>
            <li> Have Sjogrens and so have bought almost everything on the market for dry mouth.  Use these at night for that is the worst time for me.  I find one tablet works well.  Not perfect - still have some dryness but that is a result of the condition that I don&#x27;t believe any over the counter product will &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;.  This product helps me enough that I would not consider not using it.  I have ordered additional boxes I am so sure I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This is the only product my husband has tried that actually works and we have tried a lot of them.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dentist while giving me a sample to try.  If you are taking medications where dry mouth can be a side effect, this product hits the spot. It was a little tricky to get it to stick to the interior gum line, but it worked.  I woke up in the morning without the furry dry mouth feeling.</li>
            <li> I and a pastor who had tongue cancer and the subsequent radiation was tough but these help when I speak or when I sleep plus my dentist loves them because he says they help prevent tooth decay (extra important with decrease salivary activity).</li>
            <li> It really works. No more waking to a dry mouth that keeps you from speaking well.</li>
            <li> By far the best solution I have found for dry mouth!  These little discs just stick to the inside or your mouth and help keep your mouth moist for several hours at a time.  They are easy to use, relatively unobtrusive, and most of all, they work!!  I usually use one at night before beforeI go to bed  It helps me get to sleep without a lot of coughing.  I&#x27;ll occasionally use one during the day if I am going to be in a meeting or presentation  -- or when I will be in a situation that involves a lot of talking and it just wouldn&#x27;t be appropriate to be chewing gum or gulping from my water bottle every two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t last long.  I would say about two hours, three hours  tops -- and that&#x27;s if you leave them alone in your mouth.  But that&#x27;s usually long cough.  If you have Sjogren&#x27;s or another condition that causes severe dry mouth, you might want to give these a try!</li>
            <li> Helps me sleep every night. It desolves slowly and I do not even realize I have then. At night I use two melts, and during the day I might use  only 1.</li>
            <li> The only thing that allows me to sleep after having had radiation to my jaw and loosing a lot of my saliva production.  These are absolute life savers!</li>
            <li> I take a few medications that make my mouth extremely dry and use c-pap with nasal mask at night that makes the problem even worse.  XyliMelts are very helpful, mitigating the problem by about 90%.  I&#x27;ll never be without this product.</li>
            <li> My only concern is the &#x27;brown&#x27; side of the tablets stain my teeth. Not sure why they have to be colored at all. It would be better if they were all white. They work great, so I keep using them every night.</li>
            <li> I get dry mouth from meds I take.  these work very well and are not too &amp;#34;minty&amp;#34;  This is my 3rd order</li>
            <li> I had cancer in my tonsil and a neck surgery and then radiation.  The radiation killed my taste buds and salivary glands, after 18 months of very dry mouth at night I found these little gems.  Easy to use and seem to work well, I am now waking without my mouth feeling like sandpaper.  I will be reordering these.</li>
            <li> pop them all day long.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find a better product for dry mouth on the market today.  They&#x27;re easy to bring along too since the package is broken down into aluminum wrapped, po-thru sheets.</li>
            <li> I had my final radiation treatment on my neck on 1/30/2013. The dry mouth issue was getting me up 3-5 times a night and was getting me crazy. The first few months were terrible and all I could do was keep plenty of water on my nightstand. I also developed sleep apnea as a result of all the treatment and now use a c-pap. My radiologist suggested XyliMelts and they have been very, very helpful. I put one on the roof of my mouth before going to sleep and it lasts most of the night. I now may wake one time to take a sip of water and pop in another XyliMelt. I have started producing more saliva and with the combination of the XyliMelt and c-pap I am sleeping soundly. Added benefits are I do not have to be concerned about using this with my c-pap and I do not drink as much water as I used to so I normally do not have to get up to urinate during the night like when I was chugging water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a oral cancer survivor who suffers from dry mouth this product is probably for you. I&#x27;ve tried all the other gels and pills and this product has worked the best for me.</li>
            <li> These work great!  I have a really dry mouth from meds. and this is the best product I&#x27;v  found..</li>
            <li> Did almost nothing for me... or nothing at all... bummer</li>
            <li> Worked really well, but caused an allergic reaction in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Very satisfying for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely AMAZING!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No longer do I have to suck on something that does nothing after it is gone in about 20 minutes. XyliMelts last about 2 hours in the mouth. It keeps your mouth moistened and no more dry mouth. No more spray that works for only a few minutes, if even that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best product for Dry Mouth I have ever used. I bought it in hopes of finding something that really worked and I would not have to suck on something continually. This works for a good 2 hours. It adheres real easy. You do not have to hold it in place for any length of time. It just sticks. I love it and will not be without it ever. I have Dry Mouth due to medications and have worried about my teeth due to it. No more worrying. However, I do find one sufficient enough for overnight. If you sleep with your mouth open, 2 may cause you to drool through the night.If you want something thet does what it says it will do, this is the product for you. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product after another patient suggested it.  I suck on this domes several times a day for dry mouth relief. I&#x27;m not sure if any retail store in our area carries this product, so I went to Amazon&#x27;s web site.  I am very pleased with the xylimelts.</li>
            <li> I find that this is better than an other products I have tried... I is good, but I expect better.  My Doctor recommended the product.....  I does the job about half as well as I expected....  Carol Usay</li>
            <li> This product works !  Everything the manufacture states is true.  It is the best product I have used to help me live with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> use them all the time</li>
            <li> These work quite well and last a long time while I&#x27;m sleeping.  They aren&#x27;t as gummy as others I have used.  Also, they don&#x27;t have much of a taste (thank goodness) which is distracting.</li>
            <li> Xylimelts have proved very helpful for my dry mouth problems.  Used at bedtime, they prevent me from being awakened and having to have a drink of water during the night.  I have tried several other products and the Xylimelts have proved to work best.</li>
            <li> Due to long-lasting shoulder impingement and strayed shoulder tendons I had to sleep on my back which resulted in dry mouth, which in turn big dental expenditures. I needed a dry mouth remedy that really works. Unfortunately none did.I  tried the well-known over -the- counter dry-mouth toothpaste, a brand-name toothpaste prescribed by my dentist, and a spray on Amazon that had plenty of stars. But to repeat, none worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried XyliMelts. Bingo! Within a couple of days I had concrete results. Minor negative issues: Sometimes they felt a little messy in my mouth... sometimes I needed one, sometimes two—in other words, I needed to experiment a little; at times the tablets felt a little bulky in my mouth, Overall though, the experience has been great! No more dry mouth.</li>
            <li> They work very well for dry mouth from a cpap machine.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth syndrome from medication.  These are the best to help resolve the issue.  I love that they attached to your gum.  I put one on either side at night and sleep straight through.  Very useful solution that I carry with me at all times.</li>
            <li> I have a condition called Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome.  It causes dry mouth and eyes.  I keep a small spray bottle next to my bed, because I wake up in the night, and my mouth is extremely dry. So dry that it&#x27;s hard to close it!  On my last teeth cleaning, the hygienists recommended these. I was doubtful, but thought &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34;. Well, let me tell you....since putting them in at night, I have not had to use my spray bottle, and I do NOT wake up with a dry, miserable mouth! I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does! Now I don&#x27;t mean to say I have a lot of saliva,  because I don&#x27;t, but my mouth is NO longer dry at night when I use these! They DO adhere to your teeth (you are suppose to put on upper teeth on both sides), but they do! You can NOT swallow them during the night or choke on them. It&#x27;s impossible. In fact, I still have just a little bit still on my teeth when I wake up in the morning! So if you get dry mouth in the night, you might want to try this! I told my dentist, and he wanted the name so he could recommend them to his patients with same condition as me, or who have dry mouth due to medication. I am so glad my hygienist told me about these!!</li>
            <li> My husband has been suffering from dry  mouth for some time.  These are great for nighttime sleep relief.  His home health care nurse recommended them, and we are glad she did!</li>
            <li> works great for dry mouth due Cpap machine</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended Xylimelts because I breath through my mouth when I sleep and my mouth gets dry as a desert, They work great!</li>
            <li> I sleep with a CPAP that tends to leave me with dry mouth by morning.  I thought these might help but I can only say &amp;#34;YUCK.&amp;#34;  First, they are a bit tricky to attach to your teeth.  While the brown side does become sticky whe wet, the white tablet side becomes very slippery.  It becomes quite a challenge to press and hold them until they adhere.  If they are not on firmly, they will pop off while you sleep.  Second, they claim to be unsweetened.  That&#x27;s not how they taste to me.  I found them to be way too sweet in an artificial way.  Third, they did absolutely nothing to promote saliva.  Every evening I used them my mouth just felt like it was coated with a sticky goo in the morning.  As I said...YUCK!</li>
            <li> Husband has been using this product for his throat every since he had cancer</li>
            <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome and usually have a horribly dry mouth at night because of the condition. I saw this product recommended by another Sjogren&#x27;s person on the Sjogren&#x27;s foundation website, and gave it a try (had to buy it from Amazon as it is not available in NZ). Great result from the very first try, and now I don&#x27;t wake up with the feeling of the Gobi desert in my mouth! It has helped me sleep better too because I don&#x27;t wake up feeling parched. I was worried that having the lozenge in my mouth would feel weird or uncomfortable but I barely noticed it after the first night, and the taste is not bad either.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for a relative with a extremely dry mouth due to medications and disease process. It was recommended by her dentist and she tried, but I found it hard to find locally. Now she tells me to get all the time. She finds that it helps keep her mouth moist, less difficulty with throat dryness in AM and hopefully will cut down on the cavitities she has been getting every 6 months. So far the product has been great. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Purchased for mother &amp; aunt. Perfect.</li>
            <li> This product was a wonderful find next to the dry mouth rinses. I decided to try one package and was amazed. They work for about six hours which means I usually need to supplement them with a rinse for the last two hours. But they are miles ahead of that awful thing  I used to wear wrapped around my head to keep my mouth closed. Unfortunately they weren&#x27;t available in the pharmacy I use most often, so their availability on Amazon is another plus for me.</li>
            <li> Great!  I pop one in according to directions and it last up to several hours of a sweet tasting moist mouth</li>
            <li> Great product, especially if you find that you wake up during the night with a dry mouth. The mints do in fact stick to the inside of your mouth, which I was somewhat cautious about at first. I would recommend buying the mint version of this product, if you aren&#x27;t against mint flavored products, but this mint free version has an almost neutral taste and lasts for about 3 hours while sleeping.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth and I suggested this to a friend who has &amp;#34;burning tongue&amp;#34; from chemo and she found it to be very helpful as well.  it has a mild taste and works for several hours.  i use it during the day if i do not have available water and every night.  it adhears to the inside of your mouth very securely.</li>
            <li> This products is excellent and has served it&#x27;s purpose well. I have reccomended this to several of my family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> This has been helpful for nighttime use.  I take some medications that dry my mouth.  Falling asleep can be difficult and I would wake often needing to take a sip of water.  I am able to use one of these to get through the night without waking.  Sometimes it is not completely dissolved when I wake in the morning.  It takes a little time for it to stick to my tooth or gum, and it does not help right away.  So when I am really bothered during the day or as I try to fall asleep, this does not provide quick enough relief.  At those times I prefer a xylitol lozenge or a throat spray like Oasis.  But once the intense dryness is gone, I put one of these in and fall asleep.  I have slept better with them. I just recommend something a little better tasting and quicker acting for intense bouts of dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for three nights and it does seem to make a difference in keeping my mouth moist.  They are slightly sweet tasting but after a couple of minutes I don&#x27;t notice the sweetness.  I just stick one between my cheek and molar on each side, and within a couple of minutes they are stuck pretty well.  If I try, I can get them off, but they don&#x27;t just slide off once they are stuck.</li>
            <li> My parotid glands were knocked out by radiation and chemo therapy last year. This product has made a huge difference to me at night and during the day. They help to keep the mouth lubricated when you have reduced saliva. They stick to your palate and are unobtrusive when you speak or drink. I can&#x27;t recommend them highly enough for anyone with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> not effective and difficult to use</li>
            <li> i had such dry mouth from medications, i woke in the night and my mouth felt like paper; sipping water didn&#x27;t really help.  the first night i used one of these, you can imagine my surprise when i woke up and there was moisture in my mouth.  it&#x27;s terrific.  i like the mild flavor of the mint-free.&lt;br /&gt;teresa</li>
            <li> Love the gentle mint taste. Last a long time. Love it for extra moisture when I am exercising or sleeping.</li>
            <li> If you have dry mouth and it is affecting your sleep, try these mints, which attach to the side of your cheek. The instructions says use one on each side; I tried using just one at a time, putting in a second one when I woke up in the night, and this approach worked great. I can sleep again!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with these. They really do adhere nicely. I use one at night and it seems to help quite a bit with the dry mouth issues. I&#x27;ll be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> ...and very difficult to find. When i finally located them on-line, I bought many and gave them away as hostess gifts. REALLY! I like them that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Curad bandages really stick for a long, long time. They are not difficult to remove when you want to do so, but they also do not wash away every time you wash your hands or shower. Most bandages slide off your active fingers immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The shape is perfect. The extra length stands up to all activity. it allows you to wind the bandage below the first knuckle, so it stays on no matter what type of work you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not understand how this simple, effective (even brilliant) concept did not catch on. This shows that in today&#x27;s media driven society even the better mousetrap needs an advertising campaign.</li>
            <li> Love these they are great for dry mouth.  I take a medication that makes my mouth severely dry and these are the best !!  They will adhere to you gums to keep your mouth moist at night for hours.  I prefer the mint free kind because if I am drinking something the mint taste doesn&#x27;t interfere with that but if you like mint those are good as well.</li>
            <li> Helps some but that&#x27;s about it!</li>
            <li> These mints worked very well. I have Sjogrens, which causes me to have a dry mouth. I have been using Biotene oral gel for years and these work better.</li>
            <li> Have to have these at night for moist Ness and works well lasts long and will purchase again</li>
            <li> THEY SEEM TO ME SECONDS.  DO NOT FIT IN MY MOUTH, LIKE THE ONES I BOUGHT IN THE STORE.  DON&#x27;T LAST ALL NIGHT EITHER&#x27;</li>
            <li> These are the best. Since I started using these, when I wake up in the middle of the night with &amp;#34;cotton mouth&amp;#34; I just pop one in my mouth and go right back to sleep. Love that they are not minty.</li>
            <li> Got these for my 92 year old mother, she has very dry mouth because of her age and medications she is on. she could not sleep through the night because her excessive dry mouth kept waking her up. These amazing little pills have improved her quality of life greatly, she can get a decent nights rest now. Many thanks to who ever thought these up.</li>
            <li> this product is just amazing...I am in chemo therapy and have extremely dry mouth during the night. all I need is one tablet per night and i wake up with my mouth moist and normal (once I forgot to put the tablet in and wow, i woke up with my mouth shut tight from dryness! I did not ever forget again!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;whoever invented these tablets....thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I have severe dry mouth due to radiation treatments on my neck, destroying all the saliva glands.  I couldn&#x27;t live without the Xylimelts!!</li>
            <li> They work just as they were advertised</li>
            <li> These work well to keep your mouth moist overnight with no fear of swallowing the lozenge. It adheres to the side of your tooth and stays in place while it melts over night. No drying peppermint and you can use it during the day as well. Small enough to ignore it when talking on the phone all day for work!</li>
            <li> best thing i received for dry mouth</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry mouth related to an autoimmune illness. This is my favorite product on the market. if you have dry mouth, try them. You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> My husband has struggled with dry mouth at night for many years.  The Drug Store remedies provided little relief. While looking for remedies online he found XyliMelts ordered one box and gave them a try. Upon waking the following morning, he was thrilled. He had slept through the night without waking to drink water.  He has used them for several months and they are still working GREAT!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these because my mouth is very dry. He actually gave me some samples to try. I&#x27;ve been buying them for the last few months now and love them. They&#x27;re not annoying, taste fine, and do the job.</li>
            <li> I wish they wouldn&#x27;t make these so sweet.  I have never found one of these product that works.</li>
            <li> My 73-year old Mom is hooked on these things. I have no idea what they feel like or taste like, but she swears by them so that&#x27;s all that matters! For YEARS, she has complained about a terribly dry mouth each night (most likely from her medications) but this is the only thing that has helped her sleep throughout the night (which translates to a steady 4 hours). Plus, she enjoys the sweet taste which isn&#x27;t overpowering because she&#x27;s not a candy fan. Now we have these on an auto-ship subscription because she never wants to be without them!</li>
            <li> I am using a cpap and have for several years.  I also have pulmonary hypertension.  The pulmonary doctor gave me a prescription to boast my energy and it caused very dry mouth at night on my cpap.  First I thought my mouth was coming open as I slept so I got a chin strap.  Didn&#x27;t help.  Next I went to Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash.  It helped a small amount.  I added Biotene gel and Act lozenges.  Still dealing with dry mouth issues.  My sleep apnea doctor said that it was probably caused by medication and to stop taking meds.  Bad idea, Energy gone if I stopped the meds.  I read online that someone with the same problem was using XyliMelts and that it cured the problem so I thought what was there to lose.  To my great surprise it really did work.  I put one on each side of mouth between gums and cheek when I go to bed.  If I wake up in the middle of the night I usually add another one.  It has completely cured my dry mouth.  I have bought hundreds of things on internet but this is my first review.  I hope it helps someone else.</li>
            <li> About 4 years ago, my doctor gave me a prescription for cholesterol medicine.  I had an allergic reaction and my mouth and tongue swelled and affected my saliva glands.  Ever since I have had very dry mouth - have even lost some teeth because of it.  I was using sugar free drops.  My dentist told me about XyliMelts.  They are so better!!!!  One will last up to 1 and 1/2 hours and keep my mouth moist.  I am so glad that I found them and can get them from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Xylimelts work great for dry mouth.Best product I&#x27;ve ever used!I use it every night.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for people with dry mouths.</li>
            <li> I only used the tablets at night. I had difficulty getting the tablets to stick to my teeth. They worked part of the time but it was not on a consistent basis. I do not care for mint so I ordered the mint-free and they had little flavor but it was pleasant.</li>
            <li> Not bad. They seem to help.</li>
            <li> Great for problems with chronic dry mouth, especially if you are using a CPAP machine for sleep apnea. I put a disc on my gum, then put on the CPAP mask, and do not wake up with dry mouth. Sometimes if I wake up in the middle of the night, I will use an additional one. I&#x27;ve also found it useful if you don&#x27;t like to chew gum during the day, get tired of the Biotene mouthwash, or if you are in a situation like a lecture or concert or movie, where the disc will easily last a couple of hours. I&#x27;m a little concerned about one reviewer who had problems and was told by her dentist to stop using them, and will plan on asking mine in a month when I see him. But in the meantime, will keep using the XyliMelts.</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth at night</li>
            <li> [See update below] This would be a 5 star review, but today I was told by my dentist to stop using Xylimelts. I used my first box of 60 and am a few nights into this, my second order. I took the package along to my appointment and she was not familiar with the product. She showed me the changes in my cheek and gum tissue and sides of tongue in the area where the discs stick. She said she has never seen this in my prior exams and didn&#x27;t like the looks of it. It didn&#x27;t look good to me either. My last dental exam and cleaning was in June before I started using Xylimelts. I have go back to get checked in 3 weeks. I am so disappointed because the product is as good as all the other reviews say it is. But I will go back to the oral gel I had been using, very good but not nearly as effective as this product. If you use this, check with your own dentist first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Condition on the inside of my mouth improved after discontinuing use of Xylimelts for 3 weeks. I have since gone back to using Biotene&#x27;s OralBalance gel at night and it is working equally as well as Xylimelts did for me. I recommend it if Xylimelts doesn&#x27;t work for you. [[ASIN:B003XIXH38 Biotene Oral Balance Gel, 1.5-Ounce (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2/25/14: I want to make it clear that I don&#x27;t have an allergy to xylitol, in fact I try to get 5 servings a day of Xlear products (sweetener, nasal spray), on the recommendation of my dentist. The Oral Balance is still working at night but not as well as before they reformulated it. I use Xylimelts once in awhile in situations where I can&#x27;t chew gum and don&#x27;t want to drink too much (like long flights, meetings). No ill effects from infrequent use. Wish I could use it nightly!</li>
            <li> I use a cpap machine to sleep at night with a full mask and before Xylimelts my mouth would be so dry . They really work. My son-in-law is a Dentist and he was the one who put me on to them. I had tried other rinses and nothing work until I found these</li>
            <li> I get dry mouth when I sleep and these work great. I don&#x27;t use the mint ones, as they tend to hurt my sensitive teeth.  The mint-free work great and seem to have almost solved my dry mouth problem at night.</li>
            <li> I have a dry-mouth problem because of having a salivary gland removed. This product works well throughout the night. I&#x27;ve tried Biotene and the effect was temporary.</li>
            <li> These work great. No more waking up with desert tongue. Use as directed. They really do stay put all night. It is a little weird to wake up with a minty taste in your mouth but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Did not alleviate dry mouth any more than sucking on anything else.  They don&#x27;t stick to teeth.  Liver cleanses and detoxing the heavy metals my body helped more.</li>
            <li> Does a decent job for my wife&#x27;s extreme dry mouth. She uses in between Pilocarpine pills she takes for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> This product does not work as well as some others in assisting saliva production but it does contain Xylitol as its only sweetener, and is not acidic so it is the best night time lozenge for dental health.  It does anchor tightly to the gums as advertised.  I think that the price is a bit high.</li>
            <li> My salivary gland was partially severed when I had my wisdom tooth and I&#x27;ve never really been the same since. These XyliMelts are great. Just don&#x27;t use too many a day as it includes xylitol.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly wrote a review for the mint flavored Xyliments.  Both work well for me, though I prefer the mint-free ones.  I ordered them to keep my mouth moist while I sleep with a CPAP that tends to dry our my mouth and promote tooth decay.  Only time will tell if these work to protect my teeth.  I had a bit of difficulty placing them on rear molars and getting them to stay at first, but after the first box I got the hang of it.  I showed them to my dentist, and he was impressed with the idea.  I expect that he will recommend them to other patients in addition to the Rx-strength Fluoride toothpaste.</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best mints for dry mouth caused by medications or CPAP. Hands down.</li>
            <li> I use them every night for dry mouth.  They last about 2 hours, so just use one at a time, then when I wake up during the night I use another one.</li>
            <li> These really do help with dry mouth.  I only have problems when I sleep.  I put them in at bedtime......no bad taste, and they last most of the night.  You really forget that they are there.</li>
            <li> The only product (and I have tried them all) that has worked and brought continuous comfort.&lt;br /&gt;No more dry mouth!!!  Mary</li>
            <li> This actually works, use it at bedtime, lasts through the night.</li>
            <li> Very succelssful.  Leaves sticky a.m. Feeling.</li>
            <li> A tooth and gum saver if there ever was one. You can&#x27;t afford to be without this product if you use a CPAP. The melts last at least four hours, keep your mouth moist and irrigated so bacteria can&#x27;t attack your gum line. I wish I had known about this wonderful product several years ago. It is an absolutely unprecedented essential item for your good health.</li>
            <li> My Dentist recommended these because my mouth got dry overnight (bad for teeth, it seems), and gave me a sample to try. They worked for me, (unlike the rinses and gels I sampled), lasted through the night, and continue to do so 3 months later. The time-release system is effective, and I have no problems with my cheeks or gums. They are easy and quick to use, and I find that I prefer the mint-free version.</li>
            <li> I just started to get dry mouth especially when I take a sinus pill. I tried these and they did the trick. Taste good, too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  I recommend to to everyone I know -- even my doctor.</li>
            <li> Anyone who suffers from dry mouth should use Xylimelts because they work!</li>
            <li> I love the xylimetls for dry mouth.  I was constantly spraying Biotene but these seem to keep my mouth dry enough&lt;br /&gt;to talk.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry mouth use, both day and night.    Thank you so much for filling the missing box of XyliMelts that I had ordered.  The were promised for delivery tonight 8/8 and were on the doorstep by 9 a.m. I only had a couple left and was worried about what I would do when I ran out. This is one great product for those who suffer with dry, particularly due from medications. Thank you again for such great service.</li>
            <li> my speech therapist recommended this product..i love them...easy to use and last longer than otc products...</li>
            <li> Nothing else has worked.  I can&#x27;t do without them.</li>
            <li> My husband has been plagued with dry mouth at night since radiation treatment last summer for cancer of the epiglottis. His medical oncologist from Mass General suggested XyliMelts and it has made tremendous difference...he now sleeps all night no longer waking two or three times to spray with  Biotene. He uses two discs each night and we order on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I use this product at night because I tend to sleep with my mouth open, and often wake up with a really dry mouth. It is in tablet form, and you use it by sticking it to the side of your molars--somehow it manages to stay there while it slowly melts over a period of hours. I don&#x27;t understand how, but it does keep your mouth feeling normal/moist. The instructions for night-time use say to use two tablets, one for each side of your mouth, but I just use one, and it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work for me. You have maybe two seconds to make sure you placed it in the right spot in the mouth. If placed in the wrong spot they don&#x27;t move and they become annoying. They also don&#x27;t last through the night. They last as long as a regular lifesaver mint.</li>
            <li> Does help, but do not keep using in the same spot all the time or your gum will get sore.</li>
            <li> Very effective at keeping one&#x27;s mouth moist during the night.  It is Xylitol so checking  to make sure this form of sugar agrees with you would be advised.  After a couple of months of use I developed headaches every morning so I discontinued its use.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product as it does help with the dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry mouth and so far, these are the only product that allow me to get a decent night&#x27;s sleep. I put two lozenges inside my mouth as directed at bedtime and they last until 2 a.m.  I may wake up and need a drink of water at that point but I can usually get right back to sleep.  They are a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> I have a syndrome which causes extreme dry mouth and also take some medication that make my mouth even drier. I rely on these to keep to my mouth from drying out and cracking on the inside too! They are expensive but work! A must have for me - I never run out of them! I share them and this info with other who complain of dry mouth and have gotten other hooked.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended days I bought them at rite aid store they were $20 for 20 tablets and had to be ordered!!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s deal was incredible my hygienist is now recommending Amazon. As for the usage they work just fine.</li>
            <li> Great for use with CPAC,  super dry mouth and cancer side effects. I even have dry mouth when I try to speak and have found a way to tuck on of these on the side of my mouth and get through a long conversation. They are expensive so I use them carefully and prudently, but they are a life save for me.</li>
            <li> Great product.I could not sleep if I did not have them.I will use them again when I need them.I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using just 1 per night, although the directions say to use 2. I seems to work sufficiently to maintain moisture in the mouth.</li>
            <li> The XyliMelts for Dry Mouth work as advertised.  The tablet adheres to your cheek, gum or roof of mouth and slowly dissolves.  I have had them last for 2 hours or up to 4 hours.  The package says not to adhere to roof of mouth - but that is my favorite place.  I could not say enough nice things about this.  The Mint-Free have a wonderful taste.  When I have one of these in my mouth - I have a &amp;#34;moist&amp;#34; mouth.  Wonderful</li>
            <li> For night time dry mouth.  Can get a full night of sleep now.  Perfect for those with sjogrens and similar issues.</li>
            <li> Just pop one in your mouth between your cheek and gum, brown side on your gum. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;These are minty, as opposed to a competing brand that&#x27;s tart. I like these better.</li>
            <li> I take a medication that is very drying to throat and mouth tissues.  It was such a relief when my dentist told me about Xylimelts.  My mouth used to be so dry that I could not swallow if I woke up during the night).  By using two Xylimelts when I go to bed at night,  I wake up without the discomfort and sore throat that had plagued me previously/  (Your dentist will like it too because a chronic dry mouth can lead to tooth decay!)</li>
            <li> Glad to have found these online. I moved from Pittsburgh to Florence recently.  I could not find these in any shop in Florence.</li>
            <li> These worked great to relieve my dry mouth at night and I recommend them for anyone with this condition. Alas, I am one of the obscure people for whom they give canker sores. Bad ones. I like them so much I tried them 3 separate times, using a smaller dose each time. Sadly, the canker sores were worse each time. Friends I gave them to love them.</li>
            <li> These helped my dry mouth more than anything I have ever used. They gave me a bit of diarrhea, but it was not too bad. Unfortunately, after about 2 months, the inside of my mouth and my lips got inflamed and sore. After some experimenting, I confirmed the Xylimelts caused it. Too bad.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products for dry mouth but they don&#x27;t work like these do. My Son-in-law who is a periodontist recomended them to me . They work well with a C-Pap Machine</li>
            <li> This product is a great problem solver.  I take a handful of meds that dry out my mouth and have need for frequent nighttime water breaks.  These melts work like &amp;#34;dream&amp;#34; .  You can literally count  on having dreams because you fall asleep and stay a asleep!</li>
            <li> Wish I had been informed of this product years ago.  Really works well.  My new dental hygienist recommended this product</li>
            <li> The only dry-mouth product that works for me at night. I have pretty severe dry mouth due to pain medications -- without these tabs, I will wake up with my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth These are very easy to use and effective. I use between 1-2 tabs a night.</li>
            <li> Really helped my dry mouth</li>
            <li> it is fine - just drips out of mouth while sleeping once in a while...&lt;br /&gt;it goes fast.... i think i am out...</li>
            <li> The XyliMelts really help.  I use them just about every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Thayers Slippery Elm tablets were unsatisfactory.  Not nearly &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; enough.  As an aide to &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34;....they did not work out for me.</li>
            <li> SWEET AND EXPENSIVE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I FIND THAT THEY ARE TOO SWEET FOR MY TASTE, AND EXPENSIVE,&lt;br /&gt;CAN&#x27;T AFFORD.  I FIND THAT BIOTENE DOES WELL FOR ME.</li>
            <li> i have had problems with dry mouth for several years. Have tried many products and this has been&lt;br /&gt;the only one that has helped me. So happy I found it.</li>
            <li> These are excellent when using my cpap machine.</li>
            <li> The XyliMelts are excellent - I use them every day!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> This is the best price I have found.  My dentist recommend these to me, but very expensive in drugstores.  They work great!</li>
            <li> These tabs are very easy to use, just slide between teeth and cheek. They stay in place and really help the dryness in the mouth. Very inconspicuous when used.I recommend these for anyone who has a dry mouth due to medicine or medical condition.</li>
            <li> It does work, but not quite as good as you&#x27;d like to see it work. For people with Chronic dry mouth at night I would certainly recommend that you try it. I think the effectiveness varies from person to person.</li>
            <li> These work fairly well. Two will almost get you through the night. I prefer using these to the chemical in the oral rinse whose brand name I will not mention.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize you would have to hold the mint in your mouth for quite some time before it dissolved.  For that reason, I did not care for the product.</li>
            <li> Not working for me. Does not stop my pain and dry mouth at all. It might last one minute while in you mouth. All those good ratings are misleading.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was expecting too much.  Everything with the order went great however, the product itself didn&#x27;t really satisfy my needs.  Dry mouth is still very bothersome.  I had cancer surgery so this probably really screwed up saliva glands.  I am not saying the product is bad.  Just that it didn&#x27;t really meet my needs.</li>
            <li> What a relief to find a product that gives relatively long term relief.  The only downside is that if my mouth gets too dry, you have to tease it with your tongue to get it going.  Also helps with dry throat.</li>
            <li> Diagnosed with dry mouth 9 months ago, I&#x27;ve been trying everything from gum to dental rinse and nothing works like XyliMelts.  I use two at bedtime, putting them at the back of my lower jaw on each side, and forget them.  The other night I forgot them and in the early morning hours my dry mouth was so bad it had awoken me.</li>
            <li> XYLIMELTS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffered of mouth sores all the time it was very painful. I use Xylimelts every night I wake up with a feeling of a fresh mouth and the mouth sores are history. I have been using Xylimelts for over two years</li>
            <li> These are short lived and works best with Biotene gel. I am weening myself off of these.</li>
            <li> Stickey wet feeling is slightly better than completely dry mouth</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did nothing for my dry mouth. I tried it for a good month or more, but despite that it just didn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li> Good idea in theory. Terrible taste. Could not use them.</li>
            <li> Just what I have been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Effective, mild pleasant taste, long lasting.</li>
            <li> My wife often suffers with dry mouth. Our dentist gave us samples of these and they were great. We ordered the 80 count and she carries several with her all the time. Excellent when water or other beverages are not available!</li>
            <li> These are hard to find where I live, and I was glad to see that Amazon carried them.  Before using these I used sugar free life savers, which is a choke hazard.  The taste of these little beauties isn&#x27;t the best, but the job they do more than makes up for it.  And I don&#x27;t have a crappy taste in my mouth in the morning.</li>
            <li> For dry mouth these are very good.  Keep a supply handy; these are different in that they adhere to your teeth or the side of your jaw.  They are not as annoying as it sounds as if they would be, but continuously dissolve  to last longer and work better.  You can sing with one in place; I do it every Sunday.</li>
            <li> They are the best solution to serious dry mouth that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> best product i have found on the market for dry mouth. have informed my hygenists at all my dentists about this product so they can share with others that suffer from this condition.</li>
            <li> I was so miserable with dry mouth and throat.  While in the hospital, a nurse told me about Xylimelt.  Came home, bought them and love them.  I&#x27;m going to try the mint free for the first time, but I do enjoy the mint too.  I just think the mint free might help to not upset  my stomach.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth and have difficulty sleeping through the night.  Oral Balance helps but XyliMelts are better and last longer during the night.</li>
            <li> These have helped greatly in dealing with a dry mouth, which can be detrimental to oral health, as well as uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have autoimmune disease that causes dry mouth as well as medications that I take daily with the same side effect. I use these tablets daily and they work wonderfully. I am also an equestrian and am frequently riding outdoors in heat, wind and a dusty arena. I keep them with my helmet and breeches and always have extra in my tack box. I do wish the product would be labeled with a warning for dog owners.Xylitol is deadly for pets, especially to dogs. ONE of these tablets can easily kill your dog. I always keep them inside a zip-loc bag and if I ever want to finish one before it melts, I swallow it. Other than that, this product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist gave me free samples of this product to try when I told her I wake up in the night with a dry mouth.  I tried mouthwashes that were supposed to help, but didn&#x27;t.  This product is AWESOME and worth every penny.  It is amazing how it works.  The directions say to use one disk on each side of your mouth, but I find one at a time works fine.  Sometimes they last only a couple of hours (when I end up not going right to sleep) and most other times up to 3 or 4 hours.  When I wake up in the night I&#x27;ll pop another one in to take over (alternating sides).  I end up using 2 - 3 disks per night.  No problem getting used to this at all.  If I still have some disk left when I get up in the morning it&#x27;s easy to dislodge and throw away.  I can&#x27;t seem to find this in the stores, but Amazon has the best deal, I&#x27;m sure, and that&#x27;s where I stock up.</li>
            <li> Not only do the melts work, but they are small and enable talking while using. No unpleasant flavor. No unpleasant plastic texture. Separated into sections so they&#x27;re easy to put in purse, bed table, etc. Melts are nicely packaged so they don&#x27;t escape and make a mess inside your purse.&lt;br /&gt;Janelle Meraz Hooper, author</li>
            <li> I am a dental hygienist, and these are hard to find.  I personally feel they are the best around for dry mouth!</li>
            <li> No more waking up with dry mouth and a wad of phlem in my throat.  Helps to keep the saliva flowing at night and which is neede to prevent tooth decay.  Changed my life.</li>
            <li> Jerry has had trouble with dry mouth with his Parkinson&#x27;s meds and then using a CPAP and now oxygen wtih it.  The first few nights he wasn&#x27;t sure, but he loves them now.</li>
            <li> Xylimelts work great for me!  I use a&lt;br /&gt;C-pap machine nightly and need something to keep my mouth moist.  Xylimelts do the trick!</li>
            <li> If you have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome, another different product that can be very helpful. My sister uses them religiously. In my case, I use them when hauling around a water bottle is not appropriate. My sister likes them for night time use. I simply keep water and Biotene available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a couple years and haven&#x27;t switched because I haven&#x27;t found anything else that sticks to the roof of the mouth. They do the job, but just work and taste &amp;#34;ok.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth due to diabetes and use XyliMelts every night when I go to bed.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> my husband uses this just about daily for his dry mouth.  he prefers this over other brands.</li>
            <li> Canker melts are better, but they dont make them anymore unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;These are good if you breathe out of your mouth, to keep your mouth less dry. They give you alot so they last long</li>
            <li> Work like a champ for Capp user</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these to help with dry mouth which can cause decay problems.  They help a great deal but don&#x27;t last the night so I have to reinsert when I awake in the middle of the night. But they do the job well.</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth when using CPAP machine. Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> These are used by my wife at night to prevent dry mouth. She is pleased with the way they help to keep her mouth moist.</li>
            <li> I have severe dry mouth that strikes the moment I enter sleep.  I have no problem during the day, only during sleep. I like the mint-free ones the best, as sensitive mouth lining may be irritated by the mint flavoring.  They stay stuck to the inside of your cheek, all night, &amp; do help with saliva production. It is still not the total answer for me, as they don&#x27;t work as well as I need.  I also use a dry mouth spray &amp; a gel (worst of all; you salivate, then swallow it, thus starting all over again with a dry mouth).  My dentist told me about XyliMelts when I asked what might help night time dry mouth. They are the most helpful product I have used.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like it. One more drop of mint, would be wonderful. The adhesive side really works and dissolves as well. I had been looking for a xylitol lozenge to fight periodontal bacteria buildup after having extensive gum opening, tooth &amp; bone scraping surgery to remove all the infection that had accumulated over time. Of course for 6 weeks you cannot even brush after this type of procedure. Since my gums are healing I actually put the adhesive side to the roof of my mouth and it works rather well.</li>
            <li> These last for hours and really do increase the salivary flow. The taste is good, but I wish it had a stronger minty flavor.</li>
            <li> This has worked better for me than the spray products of this type.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as directed, one in each cheek, at night and it helps a lot.  No more waking up with a mouth so dry I can&#x27;t swallow.&lt;br /&gt;The culprit for me is Gapapentin that causes my dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Stick to the tooth or gum for like a minute-would never use at bedtime due to choking hazard. Leaves a bland, sticky film in mouth.  A total waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have been consistently taking this product for almost a year. The prescription meds I rely on are known to produce this problem as one of the side effects. I place one onto the inside of my upper cheek at bedtime and by morning it has completely dissolved. By this time the dry mouth problem returns until I take my first drink of the day. I have not found any other product that works this well. I would recommend this product without any reservation.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL MINTS REALLY HELP WITH DRY MOUTH.</li>
            <li> XyliMelts were recommended by my new dental hygienist who said she was told about them at a dental conference by a well known hygienist &amp;#34;guru&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered them at around four in the morning because I was up as usual because if my chronic pain syndrome and the dry mouth caused by my pain pills.&lt;br /&gt;I got them quickly via Amazon and have not been up again this time of night due to the dry mouth.  Now I&#x27;m up due to the pain but can fall asleep quickly because of the XyliMelts, they work great!&lt;br /&gt;I only use one at a time and it lasts around four hours and I put in another one and go right back to sleep. It&#x27;s so easy to push the little tab out of the cellophane and just hold it on my gum for ten seconds and voila!  No more dry mouth. I used to wake up with my mouth so dry there was no saliva at all in my mouth and parched was an understatement, my mouth felt like sandpaper!&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s always nice and moist and the taste is extremely pleasant (I didn&#x27;t get the mint). I had to have two teeth extracted four days before Christmas and my dentist said it was due to the dry mouth and that he sees patterns like this in patients with dry mouth and I&#x27;d probably lose more teeth unless I came in for cleanings and check ups three times a year instead of two and we kept a really close eye on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been using Biotene gel but it wasn&#x27;t keeping my mouth moist long enough.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with XyliMelt! I&#x27;m also 100% sure I won&#x27;t be losing any more teeth due to my night time dry mouth because it&#x27;s a thing of the past!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to amazon prime shipping I got my XyliMelts very quickly, and my nighttime dry mouth is a thing of the past!&lt;br /&gt;I know they don&#x27;t claim to stop cavities but without the dry mouth and my new commitment to see my dentist three times a year and to always always brush my teeth before I fall asleep (no more Rolos in bed after I&#x27;ve done my final teeth brushing), I&#x27;m confident my dentist won&#x27;t see a tooth loss pattern in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products out there for dry mouth because you can use it in your sleep.  Before I knew of these I would wake up with my mouth and throat dried out so bad that my throat would stick shut for a minute when I swallowed.  I would drink some of the water I kept beside my bed and then go back to sleep, only to wake up once again with dry mouth or a very full bladder.  This would happen multiple times a night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding these was such a relief!  I stick two on my upper gums before bed and that usually lasts the whole night.  Even though they dissolve long before 8 hours they coat my mouth so it doesn&#x27;t get irritated.  I also have yet to develop any cavities(I am REALLY on top of my dry mouth, using these at night, sugar free gum during the day, Paleo diet to avoid processed sugar) so I am very happy for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of warning is that these have stained my invisalign retainer.  I don&#x27;t wear it out so I don&#x27;t care, but they have turned slightly brownish where I stick them in my mouth at night.  My teeth have not been stained by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please PLEASE don&#x27;t every stop making this product!  I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;d sleep without it!</li>
            <li> After using  a dry mouth gel every night for many years (expensive and needing re-application through the night) I&#x27;ve now been using&lt;br /&gt;XyliMelts for about 4 months...thanks to other Amazon users reviews ! : )&lt;br /&gt;XyliMelts are so much better ...easier to use, no re-applications through the night, less expensive (I only need to use one a night)&lt;br /&gt;no yucky sweet taste and totally reliable.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you XyliMents you make a great product at a reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;Thank you other smart Amazon users.&lt;br /&gt;And thank you Amazon for leading me to a dry mouth solution that really works and works so efficiently !</li>
            <li> I have used Xylimelts for @ least 3 years.  First for a dry mouth due to some of my medications.  Then recently I had radiation for cancer.  After the radiation my mouth was so so dry.  The Xylimelts don&#x27;t take all the dryness away, but the majority. They are the best help. A hint: I also use another product named Oasis Moisturizing Mouth Spray.It is also very good for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Works for about 10 minutes. You would have to decide if the cost was worth 10 minutes times 80. I think I would get just as much relief from dry mouth sucking on a much cheaper lozenge.</li>
            <li> My husband has dry mouth issues, and cannot be without these.  Tried another brand but strongly prefers these, and they give him long lasting relief throughout the night</li>
            <li> These things make me salivate like crazy but didn&#x27;t help the dry throat and back of my mouth I get from my medications. I was hoping one something that really made more moisture or soothing action, but these just increase salivation around the site you adhere them. The salivation helped, but did not cure the dryness near my throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cure was to switch medications, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> This is a surprisingly effective product: it sticks well and keeps the mouth moist during the night. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great for your teeth too. These melts are easy to use, taste great. Especially good for sleeping. Keeps your mouth moist through the night. Thank you xylimelts for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I do not think this purchase was very wise.  I tried it and I guess I was looking for a different output.</li>
            <li> Has been a great benfit to me.As i use a c pap at night. Will order this product agian when needed.</li>
            <li> The best relief for dry mouth, that I have found. The mints are very easy to use and are refreshing.</li>
            <li> I would have hoped that each tab would melt slower giving longer relief. They melt so quickly that they require popping one every 20 nutes or so. They have a very pleasant taste Wish they lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works perfectly for nighttime use.  Definitely will keep this on hand.</li>
            <li> I use a C-Pap machine and Xylimelts is very helpful with the dryness factor. There are times that the Xylimelts liquid will end up on my jowels and it is a just another step in having to getting cleaned up. I have never been able to find Xylimelts in our local drug stores.</li>
            <li> There are so many excellent reviews on these mints that I hope the price doesn&#x27;t go up.  I use two tabs every night and wake without a dry throat.  I think they last about six hours, but the moisture they provide lasts all night.  For the first month of use I tried different places to stick them.  Now I stopped all the fussing and just push one tab on the upper side gum and one tab on the other side and let the tab settle into a natural spot. I never wear them during the day.  Talking and smiling makes them melt faster.  I would be happy if they were offered on Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found for dry mouth to date. I had radiation treatment to my neck and mouth over a year ago. Dry mouth is a serious health issue  for me.  Xyliment keep my mouth moist thru 90% of the night , and allow me a better night&#x27;s sleep without constantly waking due to dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Dry mouth?  Perhaps due to some ornery syndrome you never heard of or certainly never thought would apply to you?  Damn.  Well, these little guys are great to put against your gums at night and never have to wake up with that parched misery again.  Skeptical?  Don&#x27;t be.  They have a slight minty taste and cause absolutely no discomfort.  I swear by them.</li>
            <li> After four rounds of radioiodine treatment for thyroid cancer, my salivary glands have mostly put their hands up in mute surrender and stopped producing very much saliva.  The docs have told me that there is nothing we can really do about it (save some prescription drugs that they do not want to use because the side effects are worse than the lack of saliva) except treat the symptoms.  Once I got that unfortunate diagnosis I started trying every &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; OTC product I could find and was very grateful to find this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works.  It keeps the mouth from drying out, day or night, and keeps my lips from being horribly dry as well.  It sticks to the inside of my mouth and stays out of the way (I&#x27;m a teacher, so I talk a lot, and this has kept me in the classroom).  I prefer the no-mint one, although there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the mint (which are otherwise exactly the same).  It&#x27;s not grainy or gelatiny  like another brand I tried, and although the xylitol is sweet, it&#x27;s not too sweet, and best of all, it won&#x27;t hurt my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for anyone who has saliva issues.</li>
            <li> I take medications that give me very bad dry mouth at night. I never used to get a full nights sleep. These things work!!! I only use one a night and I sleep like a baby.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with the product,  would recommend for people with sjogrins......</li>
            <li> works just fine and no side effects.</li>
            <li> the only thing that works to keep my mouth from drying up like the sahara and continue to use my apnea machine..  However i have woken up having to cough and a bit phlemy (sorry for the graphic) I have alot of ailments: apnea / chronic sinus issues..  EITHER way it is a relief from the PAIN from the dry mouth and the feeling of my tongue cracking and forcing my mouth to rewet itself.. I&#x27;m pretty sure i will be on these as long as i need the machine at night....</li>
            <li> I use XyliMelts instead of cough drops to keep my mouth moist at night.&lt;br /&gt;The sugar free cough drops still have sugars and have caused me to have cavities.</li>
            <li> My initial response was for this product. I haven&#x27;t used the other yet. I found the product helping me sleep a bit better.</li>
            <li> After trying many ideas to help combat dry mouth symptoms, XyliMelts have been the very best.  I have been using them for at least six months now.  They are also recommended by my dental hygienist for dry mouth.  When I use them at night as I go to bed, they last approximately four hours and I wake up without the distress of cotton tongue or a sour mouth from other products.  I do repeat them about two in the morning and it is just right for the rest of the night.  There is nothing else that comes close to the length  of relief XyliMelts offers.  The ingredient of xylitol does not affect my digestion like the sorbitol and maltodextrin in TheraBreath or isomalt in Act lozenges.  The Biotene PBF mouth rinse is very nice but doesn&#x27;t last any length of time.</li>
            <li> I am no long waking up with a very dry mouth. Drinking water did not help as mouth dryness continued very soon after drinking, and I would wake up needing to drink again.  XyliMelts have improved the quality of my sleep immensely. I am now able to sleep through the night as I do not have the former extreme mouth dryness waking me. I am also aware that dry mouth is not good for dental health as carries increase as a result of dry mouth. XyliMelts melt slowly and because the small adhesive pad on each &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; keeps it securely attached where I put it on my upper gum, the Xylimelt stays put and dissolves slowly through the night.  The adhesive pad also melts as the lubricant does and is gone when the melt is dissolved. It is brilliant.</li>
            <li> Best saliva substitute I have found.  More long-lasting than an oral gel and more affordable.</li>
            <li> They stay in place between gum and upper lip, last from 2 to 5 hours depending on where you place them front to back.  I prefer the 80 count box for economy, although, I think they cost more than they need to.  I especially like that they contain no sugar-causing tooth decay.</li>
            <li> These work the best for me. I have been using xylimelts for a few years</li>
            <li> These actually do help some. I have Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome and with it, always a dry mouth. But when I&#x27;m having a flare-up, it can be REALLY bad for a couple of months at a time. I use these mainly at night, but only when I&#x27;m completely miserable. Maybe that&#x27;s why even the slightest bit of relief feels like a lot. I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars because of the high cost (one of the reasons why I only use them when absolutely necessary), and I don&#x27;t really like the sweet taste, mild as it is, in my mouth while I&#x27;m trying to sleep, but it&#x27;s more tolerable than a parched, burning mouth.</li>
            <li> These work really well.  I don&#x27;t have dry mouth anymore</li>
            <li> The doctor told me to stick 2 to my inner cheeks at bedtime to keep my mouth from drying out.  I have severe dry mouth from Sjogrens Syndrome, and these are made to stick to the inside of your mouth so they slowly dissolve and won&#x27;t go down your throat and choke you while you&#x27;re asleep.</li>
            <li> I find XyliMelts for Dry Mouth are very convenient (and efficient) to use when I am in Church or in a meeting where I need to speak or sing without it being noticeable that I have something in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth at night.  The tablets have one side that sticks to your gum so it stays in place while it dissolves during the night.  The taste is OK, not great, but better than most of the sprays I have used.</li>
            <li> These little tablets are wonderful.  I no longer wake up every few hours with a dry mouth.  I love them!</li>
            <li> a good &#x27;help&#x27; for dry mouth over night. The &#x27;glue&#x27; side sticks where you put it and lasts a long time into the night. Very helpful for dry mouth sufferers. I LOVE the Spry mints for daytime use.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Great Price.</li>
            <li> I have a better nights sleep using xyliments along with my Cpac machine. I find that without this product I wake up with an extremely dry mouth and a poor nights sleep</li>
            <li> I work as a CSR rep for an insurance company and I have to talk for 8-10 hours a day 5-6 days a week. My mouth became so dry that I could barely make it through a shift.  The dryness was affecting my enunciation and diction and clear communication is key. Gum was not helping. After a little internet search I came across a product called Xylimelts and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. It does work but I need about 4 or 5 tablets in my mouth every few hours during my work shift and I&#x27;m fine. That&#x27;s only because I&#x27;m talking for 8-10 hours a day. One or two is probably good enough for someone who doesn&#x27;t have to talk as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would give it a higher rating if I didn&#x27;t need so many in mouth at a time. It&#x27;s a good product and I will use it again. But I am still in search of something that will keep my mouth lubricated for longer stretches of time w/ less tablets</li>
            <li> xylimelts have solved my dry-mouth while sleeping problem. You put two in your mouth at bedtime. They stick to your teeth, and gently keep your mouth moist for many hours. I had tried so many things. I found them on Amazon while looking for something else.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth for some reason. My dentist gave me a few samples and I finally slept great during the night.  I put two in my mouth by my gums and they actually stick on until they melt several hours later.  I am so happy I tried these and will definitely keep buying them!</li>
            <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome! I cut up the pack so I can always have 4 with me when I go out! I use~ 3-4 while sleeping! keep 4 by my bed :) I learned to use my tongue so it sticks to the roof of my mouth! Wasn&#x27;t a fan of on my teeth sides…</li>
            <li> worked better some nights than others</li>
            <li> These things are amazing! I sleep so much better and I only use one!</li>
            <li> Ordered one mint and one mint-free, but your packer didn&#x27;t read the instructions and sent me two mints.  I elected not to press the issue.  Ask your order pickers to be more careful.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and it works.  Have recommended to friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I am seeing a trend I don&#x27;t like.  The discs are supposed to be concave on one side so it stays in place until dissolved.  However I am seeing more and more that are completely flat on one side.  The manufacturer needs to fix this or I will no longer order them.</li>
            <li> My dry mouth is caused by my BiPap machine.  I have tried several mouth moisteners.  This one is the best I have tried but only lasts about 4 hours.  Getting up in the middle of the night discs to reapply is not fun.  Also need one on each side for full coverage.  Gets pricey.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use &amp; stay in place. My daughter in-law gave me a free sample. After the first night of using product i went straight to the internet to find them. Before using product my gums were burning, my teeth felt dirty &amp; were yellow. I had horrible breath. All that was gone after 1 use. If I forget to put them in I noticed a big difference. I order theses regularly so I don&#x27;t run out. They are on my travel list.</li>
            <li> They recommend you use two tablets, one on each side of your mouth. It works great, almost feel like I&#x27;m drooling with them. But by the time I get up after 7 hours of sleep, they have melted, my guess, at least an hour or two before as my mouth is feeling dry again. Can&#x27;t wait for them to come up for a extended version or a timed release version.</li>
            <li> Great product for sleep apnea dental appliance users.  Using the dental appliance has a tendency  to keep your mouth open, thus drying the mouth out.  The tabs help alleviate most of the dry mouth problems I have experienced</li>
            <li> I use this product every night &amp; it helps keep my mouth moist. It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found. I tell everyone on oxygen to try it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these in hope that they&#x27;d help with the dry mouth I get when using my ASV machine while I sleep. But they dissolve to fast. I even put 2 in as the directions suggest but they were gone in less than an hour. Also, they may be mint-free but they are sugary and makes my saliva &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34;. Now I am on medications that dry out my mouth too and may be affecting how fast they dissolve.</li>
            <li> works VERY well, except that it is cheaper to buy 2 x 40 at Rite-Aid rather Amazon</li>
            <li> Use all the time.....great price</li>
            <li> I seldom comment, and this may be my most enthusiastic review ever; it&#x27;s worth taking the time to write. The short of it is, I developed severely dry mouth from use of medications. I never dreamt this &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; would be so frustrating and stressful.  I followed every suggestion to self remedy (consciously closed mouth sleeping, no fans in room, hydration, etc.) but nothing worked, and I&#x27;d wake up choking several times a night, exasperated. I even slept with a water bottle 2 inches from my face to access water quickly.  This product has saved me completely from my dry mouth discomfort. I no longer wake up several times a night and I&#x27;m over the moon with joy and relief!. They are eraser size tabs that have an &amp;#34;adhesive&amp;#34; (food grade) side that adheres to your gums. It takes just a few minutes to acclimate to their presence and for them to conform to your gum shape. The other side of the tablet slowly dissolves, creating a fine saliva-like (or combination of) moisture throughout your entire mouth and it stays that way for hours! In my case, they last 7-8 hours long.  The taste is ever so slightly sweet (non mint variety), and makes my breath feel fresh without the harsher minty taste of toothpaste.  I am truly grateful to have found this product; it&#x27;s worth every penny and more!</li>
            <li> it seems to help more than some others I&#x27;ve used.  The taste is ok</li>
            <li> These work great. Am thrilled to finally find something that really works for extreme dry mouth. Use 2 with Cpap and wake up with moist fresh mouth. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions. You place one tablet between molar and cheek on both sides. No after taste, but you can feel a slight coating in the morning and best of all no dry mouth. I would recommend this product to anyone. I was so tired of prying my tongue loose from the roof of my mouth every morning! They are mint free, but I don&#x27;t know that I wouldn&#x27;t like mint.</li>
            <li> My mother has suffered with dry mouth for years due to medications.  The last few years have been terrible, both for discomfort and ongoing tooth loss.  We&#x27;ve tried everything.  Stoppers4 spray and Biotine gel provided the best relief, but now the formulation for Biotine has changed.  I got these to try something new, but was not hopeful.  They have literally made my mother&#x27;s quality of life better.  She still uses the Stoppers4, but now often relies on these also, especially at night.  She says her mouth hasn&#x27;t felt this comfortable in years.  If you suffer from or know someone who suffers from extreme dry mouth, I highly recommend giving these a try.  We&#x27;re now on subscribe &amp; save so we never run out!</li>
            <li> ***Warning*** If you have mildly sensitive stomach, DO NOT use this product. I tried it for 5 nights, woke up each night to a stomach cramp.</li>
            <li> It works great so far.</li>
            <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome, a disease where the fluids in my head (eyes, and mouth) don&#x27;t produce like they should.  I use one tablet EVERY night and it gets me through the night.  Awesome product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a miracle!! Unless you have gotten up in the morning with your tongue&lt;br /&gt;stuck to the roof of your mouth from your medications it is difficult to&lt;br /&gt;understand. Once the melt is in your mouth relief is almost instantaneous. Most drug stores do not carry XyliMelts so order from Amazon direct....No second or third sellers.Amazon will get it to you quickly. It comes in mint flavor too. It is a temporary fix, however, as time went on I needed fewer except when I got up in the morning. It&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
            <li> I buy these for an elderly relative who has dry mouth due to her medications. She is much more comfortable when taking these tabs daily - she won&#x27;t go a day without them.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry mouth, especially at night.  This product does stick to your teeth as advertised, but it does not generate enough saliva to provide moisture relief.  A few people mentioned the taste---- I can&#x27;t get enough of it floating / moving through my mouth to even notice the taste!  I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dry mouth this works great, especially at night</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for anyone who suffers with dry mouth.  A life saver for me. Far superior to Act.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t make it without them!</li>
            <li> It helps with dry mouth. My ENT doctor recommended this product for dry mouth. I put one on a back molar on either side before sleep (total of 2 per day). It prevents the build up of plaque, bacteria, bad breath overnight while I sleep with my mouth open. I wake up in the morning feeling more comfortable. No more waking up with a dry, sandy feeling mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put one in my mouth and wet it. Then I stick it to my back, upper molar (brown side against the tooth, white side out). I hold it in place until it is stuck. Then I do the same thing with the second one. Then I go to sleep. Super easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me...there is no taste or flavor, but my doctor says it is due to my lack of saliva. My taste buds have changed since I don&#x27;t have enough saliva to taste things properly. Supposedly, these have a slightly sweet flavor, but I don&#x27;t taste anything sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Waterpik in the morning and before bed to help with mouth health. The XyliMelts combined with the Waterpik is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry mouth.  My wife and I both use these melts when we go to sleep.  They stick to the roof of your mouth for about 30 minutes or so, and when you wake up, no morning dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I have only used these for two nights so far but they appear to be working well.  I had tried the gel version of Biotene but that seemed to dissipate quickly.  These Xylimelts seem to elicit the production of saliva for a longer period of time than the Biotene gel I tried.  Plus, they&#x27;re much less expensive - and a good bargain is always welcome!  The directions say to apply two of the melts.  I tried two one night and then used only one on the second, as a result of another review.  It seemed like using only one worked as well - which makes them an even better price alternative to the Biotene gel.</li>
            <li> My friend is very pleased.  It&#x27;s the only relief she has had in months</li>
            <li> Have tried others and these work!  Suggested by my dentist.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I can use for my dry mouth.  I insert one disk between my gum and cheek, as recommended, and I sleep all night.  Before, I used to wake up in he middle of the night or in the morning with cankers in my mouth, due to the dryness of my mouth.  Now, I don&#x27;t have this problem anymore.</li>
            <li> Have to use these nightly for dry mouth.  I no longer wake up with a sore throat.  Learned about them from a dentist.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews. I didn&#x27;t fully accept the whole &#x27;stuck to my gum and let it melt&#x27; thing. Man, I gotta tell you, I can put one of these on my gums and take call after call at work and it keeps my mouth moist yet doesn&#x27;t interfere with my diction at all! Love love love!</li>
            <li> Good for dry mouth, but sometimes fall off in mouth which can be dangerous for aspiration</li>
            <li> my life and swollowing much bettter</li>
            <li> Perfect to prevent dry mouth while sleeping.</li>
            <li> Just had extensive dental work. Thought these were lozenges, didn&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth due to Sjogrens syndrome, which has been getting worse the last year or two. I tried Biotene products, (gel, mouthwash, spray, gum) plus some other remedies to no avail. This product is the first I&#x27;ve tried that actually WORKS, especially at nighttime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions suggest using two of the melts, but I find that one does the trick. They stay in place firmly once they are applied. No worries about it slipping or causing choking, etc. I no longer wake up with a parched mouth, at least to the degree I used to. Sometimes I actually wake up to find myself drooling. Which, for someone with dry mouth is actually a nice thing to experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find for nighttime use, the mint melts tended to upset my stomach, but the non-mint is perfect (I do like the mint product for daytime use). One melt lasts several hours, not all through the night, but enough that I am not waking up with cotton mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Xylimelts for daytime use as well. They last a shorter period of time when speaking or such throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heartily recommend this to someone with dry mouth. It&#x27;s a very unpleasant condition to have, and these make it tolerable.</li>
            <li> Handy to carry in my purse to use when an oral rinse is impractical. I have chronic dry mouth (probably from medications I take), so bad that sometimes I cannot talk. These stick to the gums or the roof of the mouth, wherever I want them to stick, and remain out of the way, adding moisture over a time and restoring moisture to the mouth. The tablets come in blister packs, small enough to fit into a pocket of a jacket or of a purse.</li>
            <li> they work very well to keep my mouth from being dry.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for anyone who suffers from dry mouth due to medications. I highly recommend using this product. It arrived as promised as well.</li>
            <li> I put a tablet in my mouth at bedtime and it keeps my mouth lubricated all night so I don&#x27;t wake up.</li>
            <li> These work well for my dry mouth.  The cost is less than at the store.</li>
            <li> Keep my mouth moist while using CPAC machine</li>
            <li> Good except I started getting sores on my gum line. Have to skip a few nights.</li>
            <li> Moderately helpful, but quite expensive.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended these and I cannot live without them.  I take a lot of meds that cause dry mouth and Xylimelts really help with that.  Just tuck one on the inside of your cheek and it slowly melts during the day or night.  No need to worry about swallowing it in your sleep.  It sticks to the side of your cheek and stays there.  Then it just slowly melts and keeps your mouth from drying out.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have a cough that won&#x27;t stop and I use these at night to ease it somewhat. Have worked great, I know when I haven&#x27;t used them!</li>
            <li> I like this product better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> XyliMelts has become an essential for me after radiation therapy! Have tried many different products from Biotene over the last 10 years, and recently found this online. This product has helped me the most especially at night time. I have only used one tablet at night. They recommend 2. I&#x27;m not quite sure how that works ... but will try that.</li>
            <li> If using a CPAP machine, these are excellent for keeping your mouth moist....no more dry mouth!  Easy to use!</li>
            <li> I use as a last resort</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you suffer from dry mouth while asleep. Pop one in and stick it to your gum where it adheres quite well. Lasts many hours and moistens mouth as you sleep.</li>
            <li> After 5 months of using these, I no longer feel like I am suffocating from my mouth being dry at night.  Very occasionally I still get dry, but no where near the degree I did before</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work for me. I already have a tough time falling asleep and these just kept me thinking about them in my mouth.  It&#x27;s a weird feeling. It&#x27;s hard to explain, but it doesn&#x27;t feel like a natural feeling.</li>
            <li> These are great for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry mouth after cancer treatment.  These allow me to sleep through the night without waking up to an uncomfortably dry mouth. They are true sleep savers.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reading this review, then I would think that you are suffering with dry mouth. It was so bad for me that I was robbed of sleeping. Talk about dying of thirst on a desert! I tried EVERYTHING on the market without any success. Thank the Lord I found these discs because it is the ONLY product that works for me. I started with two discs....but found that they caused me to cough. So I only use one and occasionally if I wake up during the night with excessive thirst, I add 1/2 of a disc. They are truly remarkable. If you are suffering and feel like your in the desert, XyliMetls is your oaisis! Definitely give it a try!</li>
            <li> My husband had radiation therapy for throat cancer and his mouth and throat are now very dry.  These tablets help to make his mouth feel better.</li>
            <li> These work great, mild pleasant taste,stay in place and no sugar!  Keeps my mouth moist all night.</li>
            <li> Just in case you were wondering if you could engage in kissing with a xylimelt in place and have it stay put/be unobtrusive.  The answer is yes.  :)</li>
            <li> Great for dry mouth.  Stick o.ne to the roof of your mouth before you go to bed at night.  They don&#x27;t move so you won&#x27;t choke on it and it will slowly melt through the night helping you to keep some moisture in your mouth and not wake up with a sore throat.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Found this product unpleasant to use.  Did not stay stuck to my teeth. Was afraid to use at night because of swallowing hazard.</li>
            <li> Meh. Not too effective,  but better than anything else I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I had radiation for cancer a couple years ago that destroyed two of my salivary glands and shrunk the other two.  Without the xylimelts I have to sip water constantly during the day, and am awakened with dry mouth pain at night.  One tab usually lasts me up to four hours, so I now only wake up once at night.  It only takes a second to pop a new one in my mouth so it minimizes sleep disruption.  I also I use them during the day, especially when I have to give a presentation, I can get through the whole thing without having to &amp;#34;wet my whistle&amp;#34;. They stick to the inside of a tooth or your gum and I forget it&#x27;s there quickly.  The only problem is the obvious one:  take them out before you eat!</li>
            <li> THESE ARE GREAT!  THESE HELP ME AT NIGHT FOR CPAP!</li>
            <li> I wish I would have known about these ten years ago. I use two every night and they last long enough to provide the relief advertised. I also find the ancillary oral health benefits from the Xylitol to be readily apparent although this is used in conjunction with an overall regiment.</li>
            <li> great for one who has problems with dry mouth, easy to use and apply.  I would be glad to recommend these for anyone, any age</li>
            <li> I ruined a lot of teeth with &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; from some cardiac meds I used to take.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a mouth breather at night and have a known problem with dry mouth when you wake up- try this.&lt;br /&gt;One side is tan and sticks to ur teetth or gums to just sit there all night and encourage saliva.&lt;br /&gt;Other products for same are not as good. My dental hygenist asked me about these as they were pushing them at a dental convention. Yes-this product does what it claims. Tastes OK too.</li>
            <li> Best brand I have found - and really notice the difference if I run out of them!  Easy to use and work work for me.</li>
