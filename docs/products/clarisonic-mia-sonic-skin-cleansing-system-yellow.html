    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>to do with ur skin though, what doesn&#x27;t work for me could be awesome for someone else.</li>
            <li>She had perfect skin to begin with, but now she swears by this and tells me how I need to use it as well.</li>
            <li>This product is a perfect size to hold in your hand or take in the shower with you.  </li>
            <li>Best investment for my skin ever!!</li>
            <li>I have great skin and often am told that I don&#x27;t look as &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; as I am!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li>He surprisingly said yes!</li>
            <li>Great cleaning product, everyone should invest in one.</li>
            <li>It does a great job exfoliating, but the battery runs out so quick(about 2~3 time use) and it takes 20 hours to re-charge.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product for the great job it does cleaning your face.</li>
            <li>This machine is great.</li>
            <li>The price was so great</li>
            <li>LOVE this product but beware!!</li>
            <li>While I am not quite sure how it works, the Mia is one of the best items I have baught all year!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasant to use and my skin is softer already.</li>
            <li>With that aside though, I am very pleased with the results that the product provides and I am happy that I decided to make the purchase.</li>
            <li>my neighbor uses this and her skin is gorgeous...</li>
            <li>I think it does a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li>He loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She specifically mentioned how great this is at removing makeup, much better than towelettes alone.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my skin looks any better, but it feels great</li>
            <li>Great gift idea for someone you love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dropped it many times before in the shower and there has never been a problem!</li>
            <li>Well........I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>It takes a minute to clean my face and throat and works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing</li>
            <li>I welcome any thoughtful suggestions.</li>
            <li>There comes my clarisonic mia, I was thrilled and hoped it works for my flakiness, guess what?</li>
            <li>Order this at your own risk.</li>
            <li>I use all kinds of soap with it too and it always makes it nice and foamy.</li>
            <li>After using it for 3 weeks, I started to have my friends ask what kind of makeup I was using or what had I done to my face - none and nothing except wash it with this and a soothing clenser by Murad...</li>
            <li>I also use my own cleanser.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser that is included smells really nice and foams up well.</li>
            <li>I love this \\&quot;magic wand\\&quot; and cannot imagine my life without it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get ripped off very often, but it doesn&#x27;t feel very good.</li>
            <li>My mother, fiance, and best friends have all commented about how clear my skin looks.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts (I heard some people did when they first started this).</li>
            <li>My skin feels good after I clean it with the Mia, but I don&#x27;t think my face looks any better than it did before.  </li>
            <li>so glad I bought</li>
            <li>If you have flaky skin, make sure you get this.</li>
            <li>Love it, love this color.</li>
            <li>I am SO glad I made the decision.  </li>
            <li>However, I was still getting blackheads and blemishes on top of the skin.</li>
            <li>It gives your skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Make sure you moisturize after using or</li>
            <li>I kept with it for a couple of months, in case I was &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34;, but it never got better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>COULDN&#x27;T HAVE PICKED A BETTER GIFT.</li>
            <li>On top of making my skin feel very clean</li>
            <li>This is a counterfeit product - this is NOT the real Clarisonic MIA!!!!  </li>
            <li>At first glance, the product looks authentic - it has good packaging and charges fully.</li>
            <li>I could see it was becoming damaged.</li>
            <li>I have very fair, super sensitive, somewhat acne-prone</li>
            <li>So I waited a good couple months to write this review as I had high hopes that I could rave about it.</li>
            <li>I have been using for over a month and have not noticed any changes to my fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Recently, I&#x27;ve been using Olive oil at night, and it worked nice and amazing, yet flakes takes time to leave.</li>
            <li>It is fully waterproof which is a huge plus for using in the shower.</li>
            <li>The reason why I bought it is because I have flaky skin, whenever I apply liquid or creamy foundation, my skin screams \\&quot;Look, she got flakes on her skin\\&quot;, thus foundation do not go smooth</li>
            <li>, I used it about a week now and my skin is smooth and I couldn&#x27;t believe I can apply foundation with 0 flakiness.     </li>
            <li>It makes a clicking sound when you put it on the charger and won&#x27;t charge.  </li>
            <li>it was free shipping with my Prime account.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous device for cleansing skin.</li>
            <li>My face always feels smooth and clean now.  </li>
            <li>I remember trying but not being able to register my device on the clarisonic website when I first got it.</li>
            <li>It worked ok at first, stopped working after I had to charge it.</li>
            <li>Worth Every dime!</li>
            <li>Which always makes me laugh!</li>
            <li>I can feel the difference in how clean my skin feels after using this product vs just using my hands.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>The only thing I take away from using it is my face feeling nice and clean after its use, better than just washing with my hands.</li>
            <li>First off, the price here in amazon is much cheaper, such an awesome deal.  </li>
            <li>I have super dry cheeks but an oily porous T-zone and am happy to report the Clarisonic has resolved that problem.</li>
            <li>SHE SAID IT DOES SUCH A GOOD JOB AND YOUR FACE FEELS SO CLEAN AFTER USING IT..</li>
            <li>I have been using the Mia for a full month and my skin has never been clearer.</li>
            <li>I bought this product, loved it for several months, and then when I tried to recharge it, it wouldn&#x27;t charge.</li>
            <li>so I cant really say whether or not it has made my skin any better.</li>
            <li>This product leaves your skin super clean.</li>
            <li>It seems to absorb my daytime lotion quickly.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The combination of the two helped clear most of my cystic acne.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I have started using it only at night to get all my makeup off because using it morning and night it kind of stripping my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So worth the money.</li>
            <li>I use the Clarisonic every morning, it makes my skin feel soft and very clean.</li>
            <li>So my search continues to find the right skin care product to get the changes I want, meanwhile I&#x27;ll continue using this for what it is, a sonic toothbrush for your face.</li>
            <li>I dont use it every night consistently</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel it would be necessary to pay more to get the Mia 2...</li>
            <li>I purchased the yellow and it is such a nice light butter color.</li>
            <li>Definitely learn when to turn this OFF :)</li>
            <li>The first one I ordered didn&#x27;t charge, so Amazon sent me another one.</li>
            <li>Use it daily and skin is noticeably better.  </li>
            <li>Within about two weeks, his skin was much clearer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week, and I love it!</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s easy enough to count to 60.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft, not super abrasive, so great for daily use.</li>
            <li>but honestly, i need that little gnome...</li>
            <li>I treated it very well but there was already signs of rust on the metal nodules before it broke.</li>
            <li>I found the yellow one for $103 with free shipping here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I use in at night and in the morning with the cleanser that came with the system or a gentle foaming makeup removing cleanser.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>I have noticed I don&#x27;t use as much makeup or moisturizer after using the Mia.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Clarisonic has softened my skin so much.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my girlfriend for Christmas, she really wanted it.</li>
            <li>do they really truly work?  </li>
            <li>(I finally broke down and bought him his own!).</li>
            <li>The yellow is still a very nice color, but I would have preferred a little shimmer in it.</li>
            <li>It is small enough that I&#x27;ll be able to easily take it with me when I travel, and it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom and paid full price - the same price Clarisonic was offering on their website.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it everyday because I do tend to have sensitive skin but every 2-3 days I&#x27;ll use it to have a nice cleanse.</li>
            <li>skin was very soft and very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hoped it would help clear the mild acne I had, smooth my skin from those pesky little bumps that I can feel, and clear/shrink my pores.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Mia if you are looking for a forever change in your skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I actually left my first Clarisonic at a hotel and was devastated, called immediately and was told it wasn&#x27;t there</li>
            <li>I love this small machine.  </li>
            <li>Her skin is noticeablely cleaner and clear.</li>
            <li>Buy the product directly FROM clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I used this product for 10 months before it completely malfunctioned.</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really think that was necessary now.  </li>
            <li>Worked great for about a year, then the battery slowly went dead</li>
            <li>I still get a little break out but that has significantly improved from using this.</li>
            <li>My acne is the same, those pesky bumps the same, pretty much nothing noticeably different after using it.</li>
            <li>The green one is great for acne (it is softer and gentler on the delicate acne irritated skin)!</li>
            <li>This little baby is worth every dime.</li>
            <li>The results are simply not noticeable enough to warrant the high cost.</li>
            <li>old and still get an occasional breakout.  </li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical about spending this much on something like this, but I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>It did break me out in a couple of cystic type pimples upon the first few uses, but hasn&#x27;t since.</li>

            <li> but honestly, i need that little gnome...</li>
            <li> I treated it very well but there was already signs of rust on the metal nodules before it broke.</li>
            <li> I found the yellow one for $103 with free shipping here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use in at night and in the morning with the cleanser that came with the system or a gentle foaming makeup removing cleanser.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> I have noticed I don&#x27;t use as much makeup or moisturizer after using the Mia.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic has softened my skin so much.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend for Christmas, she really wanted it.</li>
            <li> do they really truly work?  </li>
            <li> (I finally broke down and bought him his own!).</li>
            <li> The yellow is still a very nice color, but I would have preferred a little shimmer in it.</li>
            <li> It is small enough that I&#x27;ll be able to easily take it with me when I travel, and it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom and paid full price - the same price Clarisonic was offering on their website.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday because I do tend to have sensitive skin but every 2-3 days I&#x27;ll use it to have a nice cleanse.</li>
            <li> skin was very soft and very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hoped it would help clear the mild acne I had, smooth my skin from those pesky little bumps that I can feel, and clear/shrink my pores.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Mia if you are looking for a forever change in your skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I actually left my first Clarisonic at a hotel and was devastated, called immediately and was told it wasn&#x27;t there</li>
            <li> I love this small machine.  </li>
            <li> Her skin is noticeablely cleaner and clear.</li>
            <li> Buy the product directly FROM clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 10 months before it completely malfunctioned.</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really think that was necessary now.  </li>
            <li> Worked great for about a year, then the battery slowly went dead</li>
            <li> I still get a little break out but that has significantly improved from using this.</li>
            <li> My acne is the same, those pesky bumps the same, pretty much nothing noticeably different after using it.</li>
            <li> The green one is great for acne (it is softer and gentler on the delicate acne irritated skin)!</li>
            <li> This little baby is worth every dime.</li>
            <li> The results are simply not noticeable enough to warrant the high cost.</li>
            <li> old and still get an occasional breakout.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about spending this much on something like this, but I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> It did break me out in a couple of cystic type pimples upon the first few uses, but hasn&#x27;t since.</li>
            <li> This is my first negative review on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I plugged it in to charge it started up again with constantly running and strange beeping noises.</li>
            <li> The inner head has little knobs that have completely rusted.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I&#x27;m not rating it lower is that I got a great price on it between a sale and a gift card, otherwise I would be outraged at paying over $100 for it.</li>
            <li> It seems to stay charged for quite a long time before I need to charge again.</li>
            <li> Have been wanting one of these for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Also, I expected the brush to spin for some reason, perhaps I read that another model spins, but it simply vibrates and you have to rotate it in circles around your face.</li>
            <li> I tried using it twice a day, once a day, every other day, different cleansers, but nada.</li>
            <li> else you will break out from dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had no other trouble with the Mia.</li>
            <li> Not sure if i didn&#x27;t use it long enough, But it broke me out initially and the facewash i was using with this&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> So I of course like many was a little skeptical of products like this #1 due to the price and #2</li>
            <li> It ran constantly making strange beeping noises before the battery went dead and shut off.</li>
            <li> So I will be less Likely to purchase&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> They were getting ready to put him on the strong antibiotic (I can&#x27;t remember the name, but it comes with all kinds of potential horrible side effects).</li>
            <li> but i wish there was an attachment like a little gnome that would sit on my shoulder and make me actually USE it.</li>
            <li> the product broke, became rusty, and she was told that it must be purchased through certified clarisonic dealers to be legit -- big fat waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I have to be extremely careful what I use on my face.</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;m busy AND lazy!  </li>
            <li> The real Carisonic bristles are softer and the real brush head does not fit onto the fake product!</li>
            <li> That saved me $16 and shipping charges from other retailers.   </li>
            <li> Therefore, there is no warranty and now I have an imitation product.  </li>
            <li> This sucked all the moisture out of my skin, even though I try every single heavy moisturizers, they work a bit.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that the product was severely discounted because it was a fake, if I had known, I would have splurged for the real thing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have come away disappointed, liking it as a great tool to cleanse my face each day, but nothing beyond that.</li>
            <li> DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED that Amazon allows impostures to pass JUNK off on their website as real when it&#x27;s a complete scam.  </li>
            <li> (much less costly)</li>
            <li> skin stayed irritated and broken out the entire time that I used it.</li>
            <li> work well with the clarisonic, made me dry along my chin and over-all just not good for me.</li>
            <li> Black heads have been eliminated and my pores appear to have even shrunk!</li>
            <li> While other have complained of skin purging, my skin had about three hard bumps that disappeared within days.</li>
            <li> It would turn on and off at random times, and finally, it quit charging.    </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m  so lazy about stuff like this.</li>
            <li> We tried him on proactive (nope...way too harsh!).</li>
            <li> I use it at least 2-3times a week!</li>
            <li> When I called Clarisonic customer service and read them the number printed on the bottom of the handle, they said it was a fake.  </li>
            <li> clarisonic said its serial numbers are not authentic! !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reading its probably a fake.</li>
            <li> Worst $100 spent!</li>
            <li> [...]  RetailOnline Stores:  [...]</li>
            <li> Very disappointing considering it was over $100.</li>
            <li> They examined it and IT&#x27;S A FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great cleaning product, everyone should invest in one.</li>
            <li> I never ever write reviews for anything but when I found out that my clarisonic mia was a counterfeit, I was/still am fuming. I didn&#x27;t realize that the product was severely discounted because it was a fake, if I had known, I would have splurged for the real thing. I have had this device for about 6 months and it just decided to break out of nowhere. I treated it very well but there was already signs of rust on the metal nodules before it broke. I remember trying but not being able to register my device on the clarisonic website when I first got it. I didn&#x27;t think anything of it at the time because I thought their website was just acting up. DO NOT BUY A CLARISONIC FROM ANYWHERE THAT IS NOT AN AUTHORIZED DEALER!!</li>
            <li> First off, the price here in amazon is much cheaper, such an awesome deal.  The reason why I bought it is because I have flaky skin, whenever I apply liquid or creamy foundation, my skin screams \\&quot;Look, she got flakes on her skin\\&quot;, thus foundation do not go smooth and I had to stick to powder foundation. This sucked all the moisture out of my skin, even though I try every single heavy moisturizers, they work a bit. Recently, I&#x27;ve been using Olive oil at night, and it worked nice and amazing, yet flakes takes time to leave. There comes my clarisonic mia, I was thrilled and hoped it works for my flakiness, guess what? It did, so glad I bought, I used it about a week now and my skin is smooth and I couldn&#x27;t believe I can apply foundation with 0 flakiness.     If you have flaky skin, make sure you get this.</li>
            <li> My face has cleared up big time. I use it at least 2-3times a week! Love it, love this color. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This item broke within a month. It would turn on and off at random times, and finally, it quit charging.    Clarisonic wouldn&#x27;t honor the warranty, because I bought it through an amazon reseller. Reseller wouldn&#x27;t take the return, and Amazon said they couldn&#x27;t help me.    Order this at your own risk.</li>
            <li> While I am not quite sure how it works, the Mia is one of the best items I have baught all year! My skin looks amazing and I could not be happier!</li>
            <li> A bunch of my co-workers had purchased the Clarisonic and raved about it, but I wasn&#x27;t convinced - especially for the money - and I&#x27;m not opposed to spending money on my face (even though I&#x27;ll pay for high-end cosmetics and facials).  I am SO glad I made the decision.  I don&#x27;t even use it with the regularity that you&#x27;re supposed to ... because I&#x27;m busy AND lazy!  And yet, the girl who does my facials says she can STILL see a difference in my skin - the texture, the color, just an overall glow.  This little baby is worth every dime.</li>
            <li> I researched purchasing a Clarisonic Mia for about four months before my initial purchase. I found the yellow one for $103 with free shipping here on Amazon. That saved me $16 and shipping charges from other retailers.   Since I was 11, (I am not 22) my skin has been plagued with moderate acne. I am currently taking birth control and another prescription drug that regulates my hormones. The combination of the two helped clear most of my cystic acne. However, I was still getting blackheads and blemishes on top of the skin. I have been using the Mia for a full month and my skin has never been clearer. While other have complained of skin purging, my skin had about three hard bumps that disappeared within days. I had no other trouble with the Mia. I use in at night and in the morning with the cleanser that came with the system or a gentle foaming makeup removing cleanser. My skin feels so much smoother and softer. I have noticed I don&#x27;t use as much makeup or moisturizer after using the Mia.  My mother, fiance, and best friends have all commented about how clear my skin looks. The system hasn&#x27;t lightened any of my acne scars, but it has prevented future acne from happening.  I highly recommend the Mia if you are looking for a forever change in your skin. I would repurchase this once a month if I had to! It&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product but beware!! The same thing happened to me that has happened to others! I bought this product, loved it for several months, and then when I tried to recharge it, it wouldn&#x27;t charge. I contacted clarisonic to get a replacement, they ask you to register it to get the warranty, and they won&#x27;t validate the code on my clarisonic as valid! Buy the product directly FROM clarisonic. NOT from this vendor!</li>
            <li> I was DUPED and LURED by the lower price point on this product. At first glance, the product looks authentic - it has good packaging and charges fully. After several uses the metal prongs that hold the brush head in place began to RUST. I bought a replacement head at Sephora to compare the bristles on the brush head. The real Carisonic bristles are softer and the real brush head does not fit onto the fake product! TERRIBLE. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my girlfriend. She absolutely loves it. Her skin is noticeablely cleaner and clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mia on my face and neck for about three weeks.  My skin feels good after I clean it with the Mia, but I don&#x27;t think my face looks any better than it did before.  I am enjoying this product, but I would not necessarily recommend it to others because I think it is too expensive. The results are simply not noticeable enough to warrant the high cost.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 10 months before it completely malfunctioned. All of the sudden it just wouldn&#x27;t shut off. It ran constantly making strange beeping noises before the battery went dead and shut off. As soon as I plugged it in to charge it started up again with constantly running and strange beeping noises. Very disappointing considering it was over $100.</li>
            <li> ... but i wish there was an attachment like a little gnome that would sit on my shoulder and make me actually USE it. i&#x27;m  so lazy about stuff like this. my neighbor uses this and her skin is gorgeous... which is why i got one for myself... but honestly, i need that little gnome...</li>
            <li> BE WARNED!!!!!  This is a counterfeit product - this is NOT the real Clarisonic MIA!!!!  I purchased this as a gift for my sister - within a year the product broke -- when she called the company they asked her for the numeric code on the bottom and it was a fraud - the product broke, became rusty, and she was told that it must be purchased through certified clarisonic dealers to be legit -- big fat waste of money.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic has softened my skin so much. I&#x27;ve used it for 3 years now and any opportunity I get, I&#x27;ll recommend it to my friends or gift it. Its like a quasi-microdermabrasion. All the dead skin is scrubbed off gently and my face always feels so refreshed everytime I use it. I don&#x27;t use it everyday because I do tend to have sensitive skin but every 2-3 days I&#x27;ll use it to have a nice cleanse. It is very sturdy. I&#x27;ve dropped it many times before in the shower and there has never been a problem!</li>
            <li> It worked for almost one year then quit working. It makes a clicking sound when you put it on the charger and won&#x27;t charge.  Doesn&#x27;t anything last anymore?</li>
            <li> Not sure if i didn&#x27;t use it long enough, But it broke me out initially and the facewash i was using with this&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t work well with the clarisonic, made me dry along my chin and over-all just not good for me. I know it all&lt;br /&gt;has to do with ur skin though, what doesn&#x27;t work for me could be awesome for someone else.</li>
            <li> did not think it cleaned as well as a battery (much less costly) one I bought at the drug store</li>
            <li> This is my first negative review on Amazon.  I ordered this product 7 months ago and it stopped working.  When I called Clarisonic customer service and read them the number printed on the bottom of the handle, they said it was a fake.  Therefore, there is no warranty and now I have an imitation product.  Bum deal.  I don&#x27;t get ripped off very often, but it doesn&#x27;t feel very good.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about a year, then the battery slowly went dead</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend for Christmas, she really wanted it. She had perfect skin to begin with, but now she swears by this and tells me how I need to use it as well. She specifically mentioned how great this is at removing makeup, much better than towelettes alone. The bristles are super soft, not super abrasive, so great for daily use.</li>
            <li> It does a great job exfoliating, but the battery runs out so quick(about 2~3 time use) and it takes 20 hours to re-charge.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the cleanser that the system came with yet, but using my daily cleanser I can feel the difference in how clean my skin feels after using this product vs just using my hands. It is fully waterproof which is a huge plus for using in the shower. I can only wipe it across my cheeks twice before my skin becomes irritated but that is plenty. On top of making my skin feel very clean it is probably exfoliating my face as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item through Amazon and now I have to return it and pay for return shipping myself because I just got a response back from Clarisonic.Amazon is not an approved authized dealer of the Mia skincare products, therefore if you buy it from amazon and then later discover that the unit is defective/needs replacing, Clarisonic will not honor the 2 year manufacturer&#x27;s agreement that you would normaly get if you buy it at Sephora.com, Dermstore.com or any number of authorized dealers. Buyer beware. Here is Clarisonic&#x27;s official statement:  Hello,  Thankyou for your inquiry.

Withkind regards,  Clarisonic Customer Care  ApprovedOnline Accounts:  [...]  RetailOnline Stores:  [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week, and I love it! I don&#x27;t know if my skin looks any better, but it feels great and I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts (I heard some people did when they first started this). It&#x27;s pleasant to use and my skin is softer already. It is small enough that I&#x27;ll be able to easily take it with me when I travel, and it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in my bathroom. I was a little skeptical about spending this much on something like this, but I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> I have super dry cheeks but an oily porous T-zone and am happy to report the Clarisonic has resolved that problem. I actually left my first Clarisonic at a hotel and was devastated, called immediately and was told it wasn&#x27;t there (I&#x27;m convinced the maid stole it!) and repurchased the smaller MIA version to save some money. I see no drawbacks to owning the MIA verses the larger one (maybe a shorter battery life). My skin glows after using this product. Black heads have been eliminated and my pores appear to have even shrunk! I love this \\&quot;magic wand\\&quot; and cannot imagine my life without it!</li>
            <li> I think it does a good job cleaning. I dont use it every night consistently so I cant really say whether or not it has made my skin any better. I do like the charger. It seems to stay charged for quite a long time before I need to charge again. I use all kinds of soap with it too and it always makes it nice and foamy.</li>
            <li> Purchased a clarisonic Mia from an individual .&lt;br /&gt;It runs but unsure of its ability. This item I tried to register with clarisonic as the manual instructions requested. Unsuccessful ---- clarisonic said its serial numbers are not authentic! !!! They will not  apply warranty to my&lt;br /&gt;Purchase. Contacted seller and he has not responded !!  So I will be less Likely to purchase&lt;br /&gt;From an indiividual again!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use the Clarisonic every morning, it makes my skin feel soft and very clean. It seems to absorb my daytime lotion quickly. I have been using for over a month and have not noticed any changes to my fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for the great job it does cleaning your face.</li>
            <li> It worked ok at first, stopped working after I had to charge it. The inner head has little knobs that have completely rusted. I&#x27;m reading its probably a fake. Worst $100 spent!</li>
            <li> I love this small machine.  After using it for 3 weeks, I started to have my friends ask what kind of makeup I was using or what had I done to my face - none and nothing except wash it with this and a soothing clenser by Murad...I never paid attention to this stuff but my friends that do insist my pores are smaller and I have a radiant glow..WHoo Hoo</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive and I have to be extremely careful what I use on my face. This machine is great. I have only had it for about 2 weeks, my skin feels so cleaner and the skin&#x27;s appearance has improved. It gives your skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> So I of course like many was a little skeptical of products like this #1 due to the price and #2 do they really truly work?  Well........I love this product!  I am 35 yrs. old and still get an occasional breakout.  I was looking for something that may help to stop that.  I have been using this for almost 2 months now twice a day (morning and night).  I purchased the acne brush attachment to use instead but I don&#x27;t really think that was necessary now.  I also use my own cleanser.  If you have one you like, donâ€™t worry about buying theirs!  My face always feels smooth and clean now.  I still get a little break out but that has significantly improved from using this. I highly recommend this product.  It is worth the price.  I don&#x27;t feel it would be necessary to pay more to get the Mia 2...you don&#x27;t need a timer.  Itâ€™s easy enough to count to 60.  This product is a perfect size to hold in your hand or take in the shower with you.  I purchased the yellow and it is such a nice light butter color.</li>
            <li> I dig this a lot. I went with this over cheaper drugstore brands because it actually has rotation where the others only have vibration. Or something like that. I have started using it only at night to get all my makeup off because using it morning and night it kind of stripping my skin. Definitely learn when to turn this OFF :)</li>
            <li> This product leaves your skin super clean. Make sure you moisturize after using or else you will break out from dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very fair, super sensitive, somewhat acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;My skin was very soft and very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;My skin stayed irritated and broken out the entire time that I used it. I kept with it for a couple of months, in case I was &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34;, but it never got better. I tried using it twice a day, once a day, every other day, different cleansers, but nada. Finally sold it to a friend of a friend.</li>
            <li> The first one I ordered didn&#x27;t charge, so Amazon sent me another one. I LOVE IT.  It takes a minute to clean my face and throat and works beautifully.  It has held a charge for 3 weeks!  Can&#x27;t say enough about it and wish I would have purchased it sooner!  I use it twice a day and have had no issues with irritation or dryness.  The cleanser that is included smells really nice and foams up well.</li>
            <li> i BOUGHT IT FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS AND SHE LOVES LOVES LOVES IT!!! SHE SAID IT DOES SUCH A GOOD JOB AND YOUR FACE FEELS SO CLEAN AFTER USING IT.. COULDN&#x27;T HAVE PICKED A BETTER GIFT.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom and paid full price - the same price Clarisonic was offering on their website.  I bought it here b/c it was free shipping with my Prime account.  Clarisonic even let my mom register it on their website!  It rusted in a month and when my mom called Clarisonic to replace it, they asked her to send it in.  They examined it and IT&#x27;S A FAKE!!! Clarisonic doesn&#x27;t put anything in their devices that can rust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED that Amazon allows impostures to pass JUNK off on their website as real when it&#x27;s a complete scam.  I&#x27;ll be dealing with Amazon Customer service on this one, BUT DON&#x27;T BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!</li>
            <li> Have been wanting one of these for a long time.  The price was so great and it works so well!</li>
            <li> Fabulous device for cleansing skin. Use it daily and skin is noticeably better.  Pores smaller, no spots.  Great gift idea for someone you love.</li>
            <li> I bought this through Amazon.  It broke the 2nd time I used it.  Now how am I supposed to get my money back???  Any suggestions??  It&#x27;s in a box under my desk at work. I welcome any thoughtful suggestions.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed. However in the picture, the yellow looks like it has a pearly shimmer to it and that is not the case. The yellow is still a very nice color, but I would have preferred a little shimmer in it. Also, I expected the brush to spin for some reason, perhaps I read that another model spins, but it simply vibrates and you have to rotate it in circles around your face. With that aside though, I am very pleased with the results that the product provides and I am happy that I decided to make the purchase.</li>
            <li> Best investment for my skin ever!! I use it twice a day!!!</li>
            <li> So I waited a good couple months to write this review as I had high hopes that I could rave about it. Unfortunately I have come away disappointed, liking it as a great tool to cleanse my face each day, but nothing beyond that. I hoped it would help clear the mild acne I had, smooth my skin from those pesky little bumps that I can feel, and clear/shrink my pores. It did break me out in a couple of cystic type pimples upon the first few uses, but hasn&#x27;t since. The only thing I take away from using it is my face feeling nice and clean after its use, better than just washing with my hands. My acne is the same, those pesky bumps the same, pretty much nothing noticeably different after using it. The only reason why I&#x27;m not rating it lower is that I got a great price on it between a sale and a gift card, otherwise I would be outraged at paying over $100 for it. So my search continues to find the right skin care product to get the changes I want, meanwhile I&#x27;ll continue using this for what it is, a sonic toothbrush for your face.</li>
            <li> Worth Every dime! And not just for mommy! My husband uses mine (I finally broke down and bought him his own!). We got one for our son who was battling teenage acne. I was so concerned about the integrity of his skin. I could see it was becoming damaged. He went to the dermatologist every month (cha ching), was on prescription face wash (cha ching) and a prescription cream (double cha ching for epiduo!) and a prescription antibiotic! We tried him on proactive (nope...way too harsh!). They were getting ready to put him on the strong antibiotic (I can&#x27;t remember the name, but it comes with all kinds of potential horrible side effects). Then one day while walking through the mall the Mia lady asked if she could demonstrate on him. He surprisingly said yes! She used the green acne brush on him with the Clinique gentle face bar. He loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness for holiday season...because Santa brought him one! Within about two weeks, his skin was much clearer! He was off of the epiduo and prescription face wash (monthly savings there!) and his visits (and copays) to the dermatologist have gone from once a month to every 6 months! Another savings there! Which has in turn paid for the Mia several times over by now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So worth the money. It&#x27;s not just for mommy! Everyone loves the Mia. Next on the list to get one is our daughter. Check out all the different brush attachments they have! The green one is great for acne (it is softer and gentler on the delicate acne irritated skin)! There is even a body brush to exfoliate!! That&#x27;s also in my shopping cart to pick up sometime soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about purchasing a Mia, but you&#x27;re apprehensive because of the cost, make the investment in your skin! It will pay for itself. I have great skin and often am told that I don&#x27;t look as &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; as I am! Which always makes me laugh!</li>
