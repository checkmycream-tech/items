            <li>This product is excellent.</li>
            <li>It is excellent.  </li>
            <li>This might not be the best smelling cream</li>
            <li>after 4 weeks I have seen a great improvement!</li>
            <li>Cheers to good business practices!</li>
            <li>This is great for mosturizing and evens out skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Great product to use on cracking heels and finger tips.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Lac-Hydrin Five Moisturizing Lotion is the best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever used ... and I&#x27;ve tried and used many.  </li>
            <li>And I was rewarded with the most awesome product ever!</li>
            <li>tried almost all, and forgot about how wonderful this product was until I opened boxes that were in storage for 9 months,and used the remaining bit to refresh my memory..dashed out to Wally worlds to find non on the shelves, I&#x27;m sure that was because the size verses the amount 1 had to pay.</li>
            <li>I have used it successfully for years.</li>
            <li>Good for day and night use.  </li>
            <li>This product is a good product</li>
            <li>and it works good</li>
            <li>as my better lotion, when I needed my skin to feel its best, but the results with using this lotion is much better than when using Ceptaphil.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>I was so glad!</li>
            <li>Very light and feels good on your face and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>And amazingly it also started to help my ingrowns.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Lac Hydrin for 19 years and it is absolutely the best.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if I had gone longer it would help, but I was kind of over it.  </li>
            <li>(my skin cells didn&#x27;t slough off on their own).  </li>
            <li>This may very well be the best lotion I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I always liked to use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This reasonably priced moisturizer is perfect</li>
            <li>but it is definitely effective.</li>
            <li>How wonderful it would be to find it helping as much as Lancome&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>this lotion feels great going on , and goes in quickly , and the most amazing of all after all day</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and the fact that it&#x27;s unscented (I like to use perfume) makes it perfect.</li>
            <li>The price was right and it works great.  </li>
            <li>It is unscented and non-greasy -- two very important things for me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like magic.  </li>
            <li>this is a miracle lotion for sure.</li>
            <li>I wanted magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>My skin started to get softer and look better.</li>
            <li>Much better.  </li>
            <li>But, since I&#x27;ve gotten Lac-Hydrin Five moisturizing Lotion, I can&#x27;t do the magic trick anymore.  </li>
            <li>One thing that I wish was better about</li>
            <li>Overall an excellent product I buy every two months.</li>
            <li>I like it better than AmLactin.</li>
            <li>After using this lotion for a couple of weeks, it has mostly cleared up.</li>
            <li>This lotion works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that if I applied the lotion more often, they&#x27;d be gone.</li>
            <li>I looked at all the reviews of many products but something told me to buy this one</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>The lotion arrived packaged safely and undamaged.  </li>
            <li>,you have to use it  more then once a day though.</li>
            <li>It would be good for general use to moisturize and soften skin for most people, but it isn&#x27;t good for my KP.</li>
            <li>It is very light and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Works wonderfully for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>okay fine, what the heck, might as well.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent moisturizer for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell which makes it good for me to use on my face without irritation.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless I think its a pretty effective lotion.</li>
            <li>Very good for really dry skin on arms and legs.</li>
            <li>We were able to notice a difference after the first time using this product and it just gets better every day we use it.</li>
            <li>B003AY3QWW \\&quot;Galderma Laboratories Inc 0299-391716 Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream, Fragrance Free</li>
            <li>I used to buy this by prescription from my dermatologist, but now it is available for over the counter purchase.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thankful Amazon has this available for me to purchase.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth a couple of patches which heal up</li>
            <li>I use it primarily on my hands and feet, elbow and knees</li>
            <li>guess-ta-ment to run more than 15.00 a week provided shipping cost was more reasonable.</li>
            <li>Great for those little bumps on legs and arms, also awesome for dry heels.</li>
            <li>It is a great lotion - better than your average lotion..</li>
            <li>I suppose that makes it worth it for me!  </li>
            <li>This was originally prescription lotion, but eventually OTC and</li>
            <li>Worth a shot!</li>
            <li>Its light, soaks in quickly and does not leave your skin oily or sticky.</li>
            <li>Lac-hydrin does a great job of moisturizing dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It arrives quickly when Prime shipping is available.</li>
            <li>I have tried this on my face and it does clear my skin, giving it a nice glow....</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good balance for my skin type (combination skin) and in conjunction with topical acne meds</li>
            <li>I have used it for a month just to try it, and I am getting ready to buy some more :</li>
            <li>So when one works, it&#x27;s such a pure joy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Nice, creamy, fast absorbing, unscented lotion.</li>
            <li>It is light in consistency, non-greasy in feeling, and dries very fast on your skin.  </li>
            <li>love this lotion and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Fragrance free and how it moisturize my face and the fact that i can use it with my face regimen is very much a plus..</li>
            <li>If you have really dry skin or would like something fairly inexpensive to help even out skin tone</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great everyday lotion</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>After just one application, my face was more moist and soft than it had been in years.</li>
            <li>But, its worth it.</li>
            <li>but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I somehow doubt it will, but given the difference in cost, it is worth trying...  </li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Was In Wal-Mart last year looking for a new lotion as Aveno ( A great Prod.) wasn&#x27;t doin the trick ,I work with core samples and Dirt bare handed, sure we all have the pic.</li>
            <li>One arm is good, the other no difference.</li>
            <li>My skin looks good and generally gets admiring remarks when people find out how old I am (71.)     </li>
            <li>This lotion is great for really sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe the manufacturer will raise prices which is what usually happens when I find a great product.    </li>
            <li>Truly an amazing product, keeps my skin from feeling dry and has reduced both redness and irritation over the long-term.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing for the dry skin condition on my arms.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have THAT dry of heels, to be honest.</li>
            <li>though - not greasy, nice and light without a heavy scent.  </li>
            <li>Nothing we have tried before has even been half as good as this lotion.</li>
            <li>Brilliant as a solution for dry skin, except on more delicate areas like your face.</li>
            <li>This is a gerat lotion for keeping skin moist and nice to touch----have used it for years, and can not live without it!  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>and I was pleased with the cost and shipping as well as the actual lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve subsequently been using this creme on my elbows and knees, and had beautiful results minus the disadvantage I had with my face</li>
            <li>I know for a fact that it was the first time in my life that I had ever felt any sweat on my legs and arms.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more at a later date.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers.</li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell like other lotions you might prefer applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, I thought, if it&#x27;s all about the lactic acid, I&#x27;m sure I can find it in a different form and much cheaper,</li>
            <li>No other moisturizer has made my skin so smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>tried to use this for my KP (which I have on my back, arms, upper buttocks) and while this is very light and spreads easily on the skin it didnt make much of a difference for the appearance of KP.</li>
            <li>It works as well for preventing fine lines as many more expensive products.</li>
            <li>I have always had extremely sensitive and dry skin which is prone to breaking out with most moisturizers (even those said to be for the most sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>it is the scent, it is not bad, just kind of very plain.  </li>
            <li>The reason I even bought it in the first place is that I&#x27;d gotten a facial a couple of weeks ago, and while in general my skin is great, my facialist said I was lacking \\&quot;brightness\\&quot; and tried to sell me a $150 lactic acid serum, the lactic acid being the key.</li>
            <li>It certainly has made my skin softer but after a month or so of use I don&#x27;t see the slightest bit of improvement.  </li>
            <li>Just a reiteration of what others have said: this product does a good job of moisturizing but will dry out your face if you use it daily.  </li>
            <li>but I was so startled at my complexion this morning that I really felt compelled.</li>
            <li>It does make your skin really sensetive with sun exposure so protection is recommended.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well</li>
            <li>I have had skin issues and rashes my whole life and nothing has treated them as well as Lac-Hydrin Five.</li>
            <li>It really helps with in-grown hairs.</li>
            <li>Fast forward -</li>
            <li>and I told her that while I was growing up there was absolutely nothing they could do to relieve it, and that&#x27;s why I hadn&#x27;t mentioned it.  </li>
            <li>For those with the skin condition KP (the tiny chicken-bumps skin), Lac-Hydrin sooths and makes your skin feel so smooth and velvety.  </li>
            <li>But you&#x27;ll find that once you apply it to your skin, the smell goes away fast.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes, my hands would be so rough that microfiber dusting cloths would appear to cling to them as if by magic.  </li>
            <li>Better than I would have expected.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very dry---after using Lac-Hydrin</li>
            <li>This lotion has done much for my eczema though.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this lotion!</li>
            <li>The only product which makes my feet, elbow, and knees soft, and callous free!  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this after getting it recommended for use on my acne-prone facial skin.</li>
            <li>I was able to tell a difference after only using several days.  </li>
            <li>While it is not completely gone, my skin is significantly clearer.</li>
            <li>A few people mentioned using it on their face with excellent results, and I am now thinking of trying it on a small inconspicuous area near the side of my cheek along my hairline to see if it would help moisturize my skin without causing my skin to breakout.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for all ages.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>that part of the skin is gonna be so much better in so little time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard trying to find a product that will work effectively for my daughter&#x27;s Keratosis Pilaris.</li>
            <li>worth the wait of finding something that actually works.</li>
            <li>I used it in conjunction with coconut oil on my face (cannot live without coconut oil)</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>I just wanted it to clear up my skin</li>
            <li>This one helps to keep my face clear as well as moisturized.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old who still has her baby soft skin compliments me for having &amp;#34;the softest skin ever,&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I only really started seeing an improvement when I coupled this with an exfoliating scrub on my legs.</li>
            <li>hasn&#x27;t completely cured my k.p.,</li>
            <li>my legs are waaaay soft before and after shaving.</li>
            <li>At age 32 I developed rosacea (on my face)  and went to a dermatologist for years to treat it.  </li>
            <li>And it makes your skin feel so soft and smooth--unbelievably baby soft.  </li>
            <li>One of them incudes making my hands soft with this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>So far I would say it has reduced them and improved the skin texture, but not removed them.</li>
            <li>me to have soft hands even with psoriasis.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have used much nicer smelling but less effective lotions in the past.  </li>
            <li>I have had adult acne which mainly presents on my face for several years.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is a little hard to rub in but works many times better than other lotions.  </li>
            <li>Shows how AHA&#x27;s can really soften dry skin.  </li>
            <li>have to be honest and admit that I&#x27;ve been forgetful lately and haven&#x27;t applied it as often</li>
            <li>Yes, it is expensive when compared with other over-the-counter lotions, but I happily buy it again each time I run out.</li>
            <li>It has little to no scent, and really makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>Everyones skin is a little different, but in my opinion it&#x27;s worth buying to try.  </li>
            <li>This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve used, so far, that actually lasts!</li>
            <li>I no longer can find it locally in drugstores or general merchandise stores.</li>
            <li>It has almost no scent which is good because I heard similar lotions have an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I currently use a prescription acne cream that can really make my skin dry and flaky and this is the only lotion to actually get rid of those dry flakes.</li>
            <li>If you use this as directed you WILL see results very soon - I personally saw results in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I told the dermatologist that I couldn&#x27;t tolerate my dry skin any more (as it was growing worse).  </li>

            <li> ,you have to use it  more then once a day though.</li>
            <li> It would be good for general use to moisturize and soften skin for most people, but it isn&#x27;t good for my KP.</li>
            <li> It is very light and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Works wonderfully for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> okay fine, what the heck, might as well.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell which makes it good for me to use on my face without irritation.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless I think its a pretty effective lotion.</li>
            <li> Very good for really dry skin on arms and legs.</li>
            <li> We were able to notice a difference after the first time using this product and it just gets better every day we use it.</li>
            <li> B003AY3QWW \\&quot;Galderma Laboratories Inc 0299-391716 Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream, Fragrance Free</li>
            <li> I used to buy this by prescription from my dermatologist, but now it is available for over the counter purchase.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thankful Amazon has this available for me to purchase.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth a couple of patches which heal up</li>
            <li> I use it primarily on my hands and feet, elbow and knees</li>
            <li> guess-ta-ment to run more than 15.00 a week provided shipping cost was more reasonable.</li>
            <li> Great for those little bumps on legs and arms, also awesome for dry heels.</li>
            <li> It is a great lotion - better than your average lotion..</li>
            <li> I suppose that makes it worth it for me!  </li>
            <li> This was originally prescription lotion, but eventually OTC and</li>
            <li> Worth a shot!</li>
            <li> Its light, soaks in quickly and does not leave your skin oily or sticky.</li>
            <li> Lac-hydrin does a great job of moisturizing dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It arrives quickly when Prime shipping is available.</li>
            <li> I have tried this on my face and it does clear my skin, giving it a nice glow....</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good balance for my skin type (combination skin) and in conjunction with topical acne meds</li>
            <li> I have used it for a month just to try it, and I am getting ready to buy some more :</li>
            <li> So when one works, it&#x27;s such a pure joy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice, creamy, fast absorbing, unscented lotion.</li>
            <li> It is light in consistency, non-greasy in feeling, and dries very fast on your skin.  </li>
            <li> love this lotion and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free and how it moisturize my face and the fact that i can use it with my face regimen is very much a plus..</li>
            <li> If you have really dry skin or would like something fairly inexpensive to help even out skin tone</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great everyday lotion</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> After just one application, my face was more moist and soft than it had been in years.</li>
            <li> But, its worth it.</li>
            <li> but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I somehow doubt it will, but given the difference in cost, it is worth trying...  </li>
            <li> Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Was In Wal-Mart last year looking for a new lotion as Aveno ( A great Prod.) wasn&#x27;t doin the trick ,I work with core samples and Dirt bare handed, sure we all have the pic.</li>
            <li> One arm is good, the other no difference.</li>
            <li> My skin looks good and generally gets admiring remarks when people find out how old I am (71.)     </li>
            <li> This lotion is great for really sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe the manufacturer will raise prices which is what usually happens when I find a great product.    </li>
            <li> Truly an amazing product, keeps my skin from feeling dry and has reduced both redness and irritation over the long-term.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing for the dry skin condition on my arms.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have THAT dry of heels, to be honest.</li>
            <li> though - not greasy, nice and light without a heavy scent.  </li>
            <li> Nothing we have tried before has even been half as good as this lotion.</li>
            <li> Brilliant as a solution for dry skin, except on more delicate areas like your face.</li>
            <li> This is a gerat lotion for keeping skin moist and nice to touch----have used it for years, and can not live without it!  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> and I was pleased with the cost and shipping as well as the actual lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve subsequently been using this creme on my elbows and knees, and had beautiful results minus the disadvantage I had with my face</li>
            <li> I know for a fact that it was the first time in my life that I had ever felt any sweat on my legs and arms.  </li>
            <li> Will buy more at a later date.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers.</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell like other lotions you might prefer applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I thought, if it&#x27;s all about the lactic acid, I&#x27;m sure I can find it in a different form and much cheaper,</li>
            <li> No other moisturizer has made my skin so smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> tried to use this for my KP (which I have on my back, arms, upper buttocks) and while this is very light and spreads easily on the skin it didnt make much of a difference for the appearance of KP.</li>
            <li> It works as well for preventing fine lines as many more expensive products.</li>
            <li> I have always had extremely sensitive and dry skin which is prone to breaking out with most moisturizers (even those said to be for the most sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> it is the scent, it is not bad, just kind of very plain.  </li>
            <li> The reason I even bought it in the first place is that I&#x27;d gotten a facial a couple of weeks ago, and while in general my skin is great, my facialist said I was lacking \\&quot;brightness\\&quot; and tried to sell me a $150 lactic acid serum, the lactic acid being the key.</li>
            <li> It certainly has made my skin softer but after a month or so of use I don&#x27;t see the slightest bit of improvement.  </li>
            <li> Just a reiteration of what others have said: this product does a good job of moisturizing but will dry out your face if you use it daily.  </li>
            <li> but I was so startled at my complexion this morning that I really felt compelled.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin really sensetive with sun exposure so protection is recommended.  </li>
            <li> It worked very well</li>
            <li> I have had skin issues and rashes my whole life and nothing has treated them as well as Lac-Hydrin Five.</li>
            <li> It really helps with in-grown hairs.</li>
            <li> Fast forward -</li>
            <li> and I told her that while I was growing up there was absolutely nothing they could do to relieve it, and that&#x27;s why I hadn&#x27;t mentioned it.  </li>
            <li> For those with the skin condition KP (the tiny chicken-bumps skin), Lac-Hydrin sooths and makes your skin feel so smooth and velvety.  </li>
            <li> But you&#x27;ll find that once you apply it to your skin, the smell goes away fast.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, my hands would be so rough that microfiber dusting cloths would appear to cling to them as if by magic.  </li>
            <li> Better than I would have expected.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very dry---after using Lac-Hydrin</li>
            <li> This lotion has done much for my eczema though.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> The only product which makes my feet, elbow, and knees soft, and callous free!  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this after getting it recommended for use on my acne-prone facial skin.</li>
            <li> I was able to tell a difference after only using several days.  </li>
            <li> While it is not completely gone, my skin is significantly clearer.</li>
            <li> A few people mentioned using it on their face with excellent results, and I am now thinking of trying it on a small inconspicuous area near the side of my cheek along my hairline to see if it would help moisturize my skin without causing my skin to breakout.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for all ages.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> that part of the skin is gonna be so much better in so little time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard trying to find a product that will work effectively for my daughter&#x27;s Keratosis Pilaris.</li>
            <li> worth the wait of finding something that actually works.</li>
            <li> I used it in conjunction with coconut oil on my face (cannot live without coconut oil)</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I just wanted it to clear up my skin</li>
            <li> This one helps to keep my face clear as well as moisturized.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old who still has her baby soft skin compliments me for having &amp;#34;the softest skin ever,&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I only really started seeing an improvement when I coupled this with an exfoliating scrub on my legs.</li>
            <li> hasn&#x27;t completely cured my k.p.,</li>
            <li> my legs are waaaay soft before and after shaving.</li>
            <li> At age 32 I developed rosacea (on my face)  and went to a dermatologist for years to treat it.  </li>
            <li> And it makes your skin feel so soft and smooth--unbelievably baby soft.  </li>
            <li> One of them incudes making my hands soft with this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> So far I would say it has reduced them and improved the skin texture, but not removed them.</li>
            <li> me to have soft hands even with psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have used much nicer smelling but less effective lotions in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have had adult acne which mainly presents on my face for several years.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is a little hard to rub in but works many times better than other lotions.  </li>
            <li> Shows how AHA&#x27;s can really soften dry skin.  </li>
            <li> have to be honest and admit that I&#x27;ve been forgetful lately and haven&#x27;t applied it as often</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive when compared with other over-the-counter lotions, but I happily buy it again each time I run out.</li>
            <li> It has little to no scent, and really makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Everyones skin is a little different, but in my opinion it&#x27;s worth buying to try.  </li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve used, so far, that actually lasts!</li>
            <li> I no longer can find it locally in drugstores or general merchandise stores.</li>
            <li> It has almost no scent which is good because I heard similar lotions have an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I currently use a prescription acne cream that can really make my skin dry and flaky and this is the only lotion to actually get rid of those dry flakes.</li>
            <li> If you use this as directed you WILL see results very soon - I personally saw results in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I told the dermatologist that I couldn&#x27;t tolerate my dry skin any more (as it was growing worse).  </li>
            <li> Thanks to all who have previously reviewed Lac-Hydrin Five!</li>
            <li> I have found TREMENDOUS success with Lancome&#x27;s Visionare and Genefique serums though they are very expensive.  </li>
            <li> It was like a miracle, and I would swear to you that I felt I lost at least 5 layers of skin in the first weeks</li>
            <li> Used regularly it prevents your skin from getting dry and flaky and helps to minimize seborrheic keratoses.</li>
            <li> I was born with severely dry skin (can&#x27;t remember the technical term for it), eczema and contact dermatitis.  </li>
            <li> Someone once told me that the ONLY thing which will help for dry, scaly skin on the legs is one with lactic acid in it.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily, and it is hard to find in stores where I live.  </li>
            <li> also, every dry skin condition i&#x27;ve had has vanished....</li>
            <li> So I had almost given up on finding something for my cracked dry heels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every dry skin product on the market</li>
            <li> I have spots on my skin that dry out an crack.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly 2 months, daily and results were slow.</li>
            <li> Smoothness was helped but its not easy to reduce the appearance of the red dots on my fair skin. :(</li>
            <li> and since use, I have not had a single dry patch on my face.</li>
            <li> It does have a very light (and somewhat unpleasant) smell to it (which may be due to the urine ingredient).  </li>
            <li> My feet were dry and cracked badly and are now baby smooth after using it regularly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion for my fathers extremely dry skin due to years of Chemotherapy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen any improvement in my skin regarding KP, but I have noticed my skin is so much less dry.</li>
            <li> It is extremely hydrating.  </li>
            <li> Some of the other reviewers mentioned that the lotion stings (like after you shave or something).  </li>
            <li> While that amazed my grandson, it was pretty uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I looked online to see if other people had found any solution to this problem</li>
            <li> as I should so there are a few little bumps in the back of my arm</li>
            <li> I found my skin got more violent breakouts</li>
            <li> it was not only painful and stupid, they came back quickly and I wasn&#x27;t willing to rub them off</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worked for other people, so don&#x27;t give up!</li>
            <li> Not to worry, though, I have other tricks up my grammie sleeves!  </li>
            <li> I used this on my arms and now there&#x27;s hardly any little bumps left.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a month and half ago.</li>
            <li> Really helped improve the quality of my skin and decreased my Keratosis pilaris (ker-uh-TOE-sis pih-LAIR-is), which is a common skin condition that causes rough patches and small, acne-like bumps, usually on the arms, thighs, cheeks and buttocks.</li>
            <li> The bumps on her legs are almost gone while it is taking a little longer for her arms.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had those ugly red bumps in the back of my arm and legs for as long as I can remember...</li>
            <li> It feels a little too heavy for my skin type for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> &quot; It took a few seconds for me</li>
            <li> however if I use it everyday it has the reverse affect.  </li>
            <li> I have learned to wait a few days between uses on the face</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I forget to use it every day, but if I did my KP would nearly be invisible.</li>
            <li> A few applications and your skin gets softer with each one.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty bad KP on my forearms.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is exactly the same product that was previously prescription, but if not, it is awfully close.  </li>
            <li> Even though I hated using it (the stuff smells something awful) and to be honest it didn&#x27;t really solve my dry heel problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
            <li> no more hang-nails and messed up cuticles...</li>
            <li> No more cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Lately I had settled on Bag Balm.</li>
            <li> I cannot think of anything negative about this product.  </li>
            <li> my instant gratification self was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, though, it made it too delicate, as well.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of feeling these bumps on my skin</li>
            <li> Bought all the weird creams.</li>
            <li> These medications dryout your skin horribly to the point where it leaves white scaly patches on the face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, don&#x27;t worry...</li>
            <li> Give this product a try; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> It is so annoying putting it in the body.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was not going to write a review yet, as I&#x27;ve only used the product for literally one night--put it on before I went to bed last night--but I was so startled at my complexion this morning that I really felt compelled. You see, when I woke up this morning, I had totally forgotten that I&#x27;d used the lotion the night before. I got up, looked in the mirror and thought \\&quot;why does the skin on my face all of a sudden look amazing?\\&quot; It took a few seconds for me remember I&#x27;d used this lotion! I used it in conjunction with coconut oil on my face (cannot live without coconut oil) but it&#x27;s plenty moisturizing by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, on day 1, it&#x27;s great! The reason I even bought it in the first place is that I&#x27;d gotten a facial a couple of weeks ago, and while in general my skin is great, my facialist said I was lacking \\&quot;brightness\\&quot; and tried to sell me a $150 lactic acid serum, the lactic acid being the key. Well, I thought, if it&#x27;s all about the lactic acid, I&#x27;m sure I can find it in a different form and much cheaper, so here I am.  I will update this review in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> This is great for mosturizing and evens out skin tone.  I use this in conjunction with lighter moisturizers in the summer and with AmLactin 12% in the winter.  It has little to no scent, and really makes your skin feel soft. It feels a little too heavy for my skin type for everyday use.  I have had adult acne which mainly presents on my face for several years.  I have tried this on my face and it does clear my skin, giving it a nice glow....however if I use it everyday it has the reverse affect.  I have learned to wait a few days between uses on the face and it&#x27;s a good balance for my skin type (combination skin) and in conjunction with topical acne meds it&#x27;s like magic.  It does make your skin really sensetive with sun exposure so protection is recommended.  My 4 year old who still has her baby soft skin compliments me for having &amp;#34;the softest skin ever,&amp;#34; when I use this product.  I suppose that makes it worth it for me!  If you have really dry skin or would like something fairly inexpensive to help even out skin tone this should do the trick.  Everyones skin is a little different, but in my opinion it&#x27;s worth buying to try.  Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion for my fathers extremely dry skin due to years of Chemotherapy. It worked very well and I was pleased with the cost and shipping as well as the actual lotion. I would definitely purchase again!! Cheers to good business practices!</li>
            <li> Lac-Hydrin Five Moisturizing Lotion is the best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever used ... and I&#x27;ve tried and used many.  It was recommended to me by a pharmacist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lac Hydrin for 19 years and it is absolutely the best.  My skin is so soft and the fact that it&#x27;s unscented (I like to use perfume) makes it perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly 2 months, daily and results were slow. I only really started seeing an improvement when I coupled this with an exfoliating scrub on my legs. Not sure if I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
            <li> shipping-wise, totally got here on time. this is a super-duper moisturizer...hasn&#x27;t completely cured my k.p., but it&#x27;s improved it (it&#x27;s only been a couple weeks and i&#x27;ve heard you have to be religious about applications). also, every dry skin condition i&#x27;ve had has vanished....no more hang-nails and messed up cuticles...my legs are waaaay soft before and after shaving. this is a miracle lotion for sure. worth the price. worth the wait of finding something that actually works. yay!</li>
            <li> This is a gerat lotion for keeping skin moist and nice to touch----have used it for years, and can not live without it!  Lac-Huddrin Five is the lotion&#x27;s name</li>
            <li> I originally bought this after getting it recommended for use on my acne-prone facial skin. After just one application, my face was more moist and soft than it had been in years. Unfortunately, though, it made it too delicate, as well. I found my skin got more violent breakouts and they lasted longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve subsequently been using this creme on my elbows and knees, and had beautiful results minus the disadvantage I had with my face stated above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO. Brilliant as a solution for dry skin, except on more delicate areas like your face.</li>
            <li> I have used Lac-Hydrin Five for over 10 years on the advice of my doctor. I have had skin issues and rashes my whole life and nothing has treated them as well as Lac-Hydrin Five. It is unscented and non-greasy -- two very important things for me. Yes, it is expensive when compared with other over-the-counter lotions, but I happily buy it again each time I run out.</li>
            <li> This product fulfills its claim and  keeps the skin from scaling.  I no longer can find it locally in drugstores or general merchandise stores.</li>
            <li> So I had almost given up on finding something for my cracked dry heels. I don&#x27;t even have THAT dry of heels, to be honest. But I&#x27;m totally obsessed with getting them soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve tried everything. Bought all the weird creams. Lately I had settled on Bag Balm. Even though I hated using it (the stuff smells something awful) and to be honest it didn&#x27;t really solve my dry heel problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then my facialist friend recommended I try LacHydrinFive. I thought, okay fine, what the heck, might as well. And I was rewarded with the most awesome product ever! It actually worked. That&#x27;s all I want when I buy a product. For it to work. And 9 times out of 10, they don&#x27;t. So when one works, it&#x27;s such a pure joy. LacHydrinFive took about three weeks of me applying it to my heels every couple of days and then I saw a difference. No more cracked heels. That&#x27;s as simple as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So heres the bonus from this lotion. It really helps with in-grown hairs. This is another problem that I&#x27;ve been suffering from for about a year. And tried everything. Nothing was working. I started using LacHydrinFive on my legs just cause I like to lotion up my legs. And amazingly it also started to help my ingrowns. I LOVE THIS STUFF! It&#x27;s a Lactic Acid AHA so that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s working. Salicylic Acid wasn&#x27;t working for me, but who knew Lactic Acid works!</li>
            <li> One arm is good, the other no difference. It has no smell and is not greasy, so there is that. I wanted magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Was In Wal-Mart last year looking for a new lotion as Aveno ( A great Prod.) wasn&#x27;t doin the trick ,I work with core samples and Dirt bare handed, sure we all have the pic. tried almost all, and forgot about how wonderful this product was until I opened boxes that were in storage for 9 months,and used the remaining bit to refresh my memory..dashed out to Wally worlds to find non on the shelves, I&#x27;m sure that was because the size verses the amount 1 had to pay. not a big seller...this lotion feels great going on , and goes in quickly , and the most amazing of all after all day and  your close are removed  (ME) legs and where ever else one would use lotion would look like the Sahara desert at days end.. Not with Lac- five..you feel like  u just put it on . and feels and looks 10 years younger.. Wish it was cheaper so one could cover in it ,at 8 oz. guess-ta-ment to run more than 15.00 a week provided shipping cost was more reasonable. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I bought this product a month and half ago. I have been using it once and twice a day. and yes it is working. My skin started to get softer and look better. It is so annoying putting it in the body. But, its worth it. that part of the skin is gonna be so much better in so little time.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer for very dry skin. Its light, soaks in quickly and does not leave your skin oily or sticky. Used regularly it prevents your skin from getting dry and flaky and helps to minimize seborrheic keratoses.</li>
            <li> Great for those little bumps on legs and arms, also awesome for dry heels. I use it every time out of the shower and every night, it&#x27;s the best lotion I&#x27;ve found for those areas.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would help with keratosis pilaris on my upper arms, but I didn&#x27;t seen an improvement.  I faithfully applied morning and night for three weeks without seeing a difference, and gave up.  Perhaps if I had gone longer it would help, but I was kind of over it.  It&#x27;s a great everyday lotion though - not greasy, nice and light without a heavy scent.  I just wanted it to clear up my skin and it didn&#x27;t, so my instant gratification self was disappointed.  But it&#x27;s worked for other people, so don&#x27;t give up!</li>
            <li> I was born with severely dry skin (can&#x27;t remember the technical term for it), eczema and contact dermatitis.  When I was a child there was nothing they could do about any of it.  Fast forward - At age 32 I developed rosacea (on my face)  and went to a dermatologist for years to treat it.  When I was about 40 I told the dermatologist that I couldn&#x27;t tolerate my dry skin any more (as it was growing worse).  She couldn&#x27;t believe I had never mentioned it before and I told her that while I was growing up there was absolutely nothing they could do to relieve it, and that&#x27;s why I hadn&#x27;t mentioned it.  She prescribed Lac-Hydrin (at that time it was by prescription only).  It was like a miracle, and I would swear to you that I felt I lost at least 5 layers of skin in the first weeks I used it (my skin cells didn&#x27;t slough off on their own).  I know for a fact that it was the first time in my life that I had ever felt any sweat on my legs and arms.  It is extremely hydrating.  I cannot think of anything negative about this product.  I don&#x27;t know if this is exactly the same product that was previously prescription, but if not, it is awfully close.  I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> This may very well be the best lotion I have ever used.  It is light in consistency, non-greasy in feeling, and dries very fast on your skin.  And it makes your skin feel so soft and smooth--unbelievably baby soft.  I always liked to use [[ASIN:B003AY3QWW \\&quot;Galderma Laboratories Inc 0299-391716 Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream, Fragrance Free 16 oz (453 g)\\&quot;]] as my better lotion, when I needed my skin to feel its best, but the results with using this lotion is much better than when using Ceptaphil.  Much better.  For those with the skin condition KP (the tiny chicken-bumps skin), Lac-Hydrin sooths and makes your skin feel so smooth and velvety.  I highly recommend it for KP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lac-Hydrin is virtually scent-less, though not entirely so.  It does have a very light (and somewhat unpleasant) smell to it (which may be due to the urine ingredient).  But you&#x27;ll find that once you apply it to your skin, the smell goes away fast.  Some of the other reviewers mentioned that the lotion stings (like after you shave or something).  I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a couple of months now, and it has never stung my skin.  I guess people&#x27;s skin react differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this lotion and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very light and feels good on your face and not greasy.  Good for day and night use.  Highly recommend for all ages.</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended this so Amazon had it listed and I bought it.  The price was right and it works great.  Will buy more at a later date.</li>
            <li> Lac-hydrin does a great job of moisturizing dry skin.  It is odorless and feels silky to the skin.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because people have said it worked to reduce their KP issue, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  It certainly has made my skin softer but after a month or so of use I don&#x27;t see the slightest bit of improvement.  In fact, my KP which had spread to my forearm prior to using this product, became irritable and itchy when I use it.  My KP on the forearm is actually swelling and itching, and turning very red so I have stopped use of it.  It would be good for general use to moisturize and soften skin for most people, but it isn&#x27;t good for my KP.</li>
            <li> I was able to tell a difference after only using several days.  I used this on my arms and now there&#x27;s hardly any little bumps left.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. No other moisturizer has made my skin so smooth and silky.  Give this product a try; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers. This one helps to keep my face clear as well as moisturized. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Great product to use on cracking heels and finger tips.  I&#x27;ve used it for years. I have used it successfully for years.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, my hands would be so rough that microfiber dusting cloths would appear to cling to them as if by magic.  While that amazed my grandson, it was pretty uncomfortable.  But, since I&#x27;ve gotten Lac-Hydrin Five moisturizing Lotion, I can&#x27;t do the magic trick anymore.  Not to worry, though, I have other tricks up my grammie sleeves!  One of them incudes making my hands soft with this lotion.  (and my feet, too)</li>
            <li> I used to buy this by prescription from my dermatologist, but now it is available for over the counter purchase.  Truly an amazing product, keeps my skin from feeling dry and has reduced both redness and irritation over the long-term.  Has also minimized the number of ingrown hairs, although it is not advertised for this purpose at all.  One thing that I wish was better about it is the scent, it is not bad, just kind of very plain.  I have used much nicer smelling but less effective lotions in the past.  Overall an excellent product I buy every two months.</li>
            <li> Just a reiteration of what others have said: this product does a good job of moisturizing but will dry out your face if you use it daily.  Start by using it twice weekly, or mixing it into your moisturizer, then work your way up to a larger dose.  My arms and legs have no problems with this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for really sensitive dry skin. I currently use a prescription acne cream that can really make my skin dry and flaky and this is the only lotion to actually get rid of those dry flakes.</li>
            <li> This was originally prescription lotion, but eventually OTC and I was so glad! Very good for really dry skin on arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion for KP on my arms. It&#x27;s not greasy and it absorbs quickly. It makes my skin so soft! Unfortunately I forget to use it every day, but if I did my KP would nearly be invisible. I like it better than AmLactin.</li>
            <li> I heard of this through my doctor.  It is excellent.  A few applications and your skin gets softer with each one.  If you go barefoot this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully for dry skin.  Better than I would have expected.  Very moisturizing.  Shows how AHA&#x27;s can really soften dry skin.  I do not know any lotions that compare with this one.  Pricey but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard trying to find a product that will work effectively for my daughter&#x27;s Keratosis Pilaris. I read about this product online and decided to give it a try. We were able to notice a difference after the first time using this product and it just gets better every day we use it. The bumps on her legs are almost gone while it is taking a little longer for her arms. Nothing we have tried before has even been half as good as this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad KP on my forearms. After using this lotion for a couple of weeks, it has mostly cleared up. While it is not completely gone, my skin is significantly clearer. This lotion works better than anything else I have tried. Worth a shot!</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing for the dry skin condition on my arms.  I use it daily, and it is hard to find in stores where I live.  I&#x27;m thankful Amazon has this available for me to purchase.  It arrives quickly when Prime shipping is available.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a little hard to rub in but works many times better than other lotions.  My feet were dry and cracked badly and are now baby smooth after using it regularly.</li>
            <li> The only product which makes my feet, elbow, and knees soft, and callous free!  I&#x27;ve been using it for 20 years now.  Will the patent ever run out so I can buy a cheaper generic???</li>
            <li> This reasonably priced moisturizer is perfect so I worry about letting everyone know.  Maybe the manufacturer will raise prices which is what usually happens when I find a great product.    Anyway, I have extremely sensitive skin.  I use this on hands, face, arms &amp; legs.  My skin looks good and generally gets admiring remarks when people find out how old I am (71.)     It is unscented.  It is very light and easy to apply.  It works as well for preventing fine lines as many more expensive products.</li>
            <li> This might not be the best smelling cream but it is definitely effective. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, don&#x27;t worry... it just doesn&#x27;t have a nice smell like other lotions you might prefer applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had those ugly red bumps in the back of my arm and legs for as long as I can remember... Once I even had the &amp;#34;brilliant&amp;#34; idea to rub them off with a a pumice stone... it was not only painful and stupid, they came back quickly and I wasn&#x27;t willing to rub them off again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked online to see if other people had found any solution to this problem and that&#x27;s when I bumped into the reviews for Lac-Hydrin. If you use this as directed you WILL see results very soon - I personally saw results in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to be honest and admit that I&#x27;ve been forgetful lately and haven&#x27;t applied it as often as I should so there are a few little bumps in the back of my arm but I&#x27;m sure that if I applied the lotion more often, they&#x27;d be gone.</li>
            <li> Nice, creamy, fast absorbing, unscented lotion. I got it hoping to get rid of the red bumps on the backs of my arms. So far I would say it has reduced them and improved the skin texture, but not removed them.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  My skin is very dry---after using Lac-Hydrin it stays moisturized near;y all day.  I&#x27;ve used it for years</li>
            <li> It is a great lotion - better than your average lotion.. I have been using it for years but didn&#x27;t know where to find it until now.</li>
            <li> All I can say it works.. I was so tired of feeling these bumps on my skin I went to Amazon (which I go for everything just about). I looked at all the reviews of many products but something told me to buy this one and I am so glad I did. My skin feels so smooth a couple of patches which heal up but my fault for scratching them. I had no idea what these bumps for from and then I googled which led me to this product.... you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought this to help treat my KP. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen any improvement in my skin regarding KP, but I have noticed my skin is so much less dry. This is the only lotion I&#x27;ve used, so far, that actually lasts! I&#x27;m not constantly reapplying all day. It&#x27;s been a miracle for my \\&quot;winter hands\\&quot;; keeping my skin from cracking and peeling. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell which makes it good for me to use on my face without irritation.</li>
            <li> Someone once told me that the ONLY thing which will help for dry, scaly skin on the legs is one with lactic acid in it.  Ichose this one because it doesn&#x27;t contain the same harmful ingredients as another similar lotion.</li>
            <li> I have always had extremely sensitive and dry skin which is prone to breaking out with most moisturizers (even those said to be for the most sensitive skin).  Rather than reiterating what others have expressed here, I will simply state that it was recommended by a dermatologist I had seen over twenty years ago, and I can not recommended it enough.  I use it primarily on my hands and feet, elbow and knees though I&#x27;d never considered using it on my face.  I have found TREMENDOUS success with Lancome&#x27;s Visionare and Genefique serums though they are very expensive.  A few people mentioned using it on their face with excellent results, and I am now thinking of trying it on a small inconspicuous area near the side of my cheek along my hairline to see if it would help moisturize my skin without causing my skin to breakout.  How wonderful it would be to find it helping as much as Lancome&#x27;s products.  I somehow doubt it will, but given the difference in cost, it is worth trying...  Thanks to all who have previously reviewed Lac-Hydrin Five!</li>
            <li> This product is a good product but it did not work well for me because of my survive callus skin. I was using it on my feet and it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free and how it moisturize my face and the fact that i can use it with my face regimen is very much a plus..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every dry skin product on the market and I am allergic to them.  Lac-hydrin 5allows me to have soft hands even with psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I have spots on my skin that dry out an crack.  This is the only product that works for those spots.&lt;br /&gt;The cracks heal up in one overnight application.</li>
            <li> Lac-Hydrin was recommended to me by a cosmetic dermatologist. This lotion has saved my husband&#x27;s skin on his arms and feet.  The lotion arrived packaged safely and undamaged.  The order arrived on time.  I will definitely be reordering, because Walgreen&#x27;s nor CVS carries it any longer.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend!!! Really helped improve the quality of my skin and decreased my Keratosis pilaris (ker-uh-TOE-sis pih-LAIR-is), which is a common skin condition that causes rough patches and small, acne-like bumps, usually on the arms, thighs, cheeks and buttocks. I have it on my arms and after 4 weeks I have seen a great improvement!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and it&#x27;s the only product that won&#x27;t  cause me to break out. Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris on my upper arms and I can say that i DO see some progress since I have been using it about 3weeks ago. It has almost no scent which is good because I heard similar lotions have an unpleasant smell. The keratosis pilaris on my upper arms is still visible but has diminished in appearance. This lotion has done much for my eczema though. Nevertheless I think its a pretty effective lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a combination on topical clindamycin and BP to treat my acne. These medications dryout your skin horribly to the point where it leaves white scaly patches on the face. My Dr. prescriped Lac-Hydrin Five and since use, I have not had a single dry patch on my face. I use it twice a day (in the morning and before bed) about 15 minutes after I have rubbed my acne meds on. It has not caused any break outs, and my faces actually looks dewy and youthful. I highly reccommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> I have used it for a month just to try it, and I am getting ready to buy some more :-)&lt;br /&gt;treats KP with continued used.</li>
            <li> i use this on my legs i have edema  and it works good ,you have to use it  more then once a day though.</li>
            <li> tried to use this for my KP (which I have on my back, arms, upper buttocks) and while this is very light and spreads easily on the skin it didnt make much of a difference for the appearance of KP. Smoothness was helped but its not easy to reduce the appearance of the red dots on my fair skin. :(</li>
