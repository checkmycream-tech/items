            <li>excellent buyer and  product, thank you</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and it&#x27;s the best I have found.</li>
            <li>I am happy.  </li>
            <li>and I am THRILLED with the results!</li>
            <li>Good product, as advertised</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Great light weight feel.</li>
            <li>great product did exactly what it said it would..</li>
            <li>and I love using it.  </li>
            <li>I love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved Obaji products and so far this one seems to be doing a good job.</li>
            <li>I will say this product does make your eyes seem more awake.</li>
            <li>your price was great and shipment fast...</li>
            <li>I contacted a friend who uses your brand and told her the price was so much better than she was paying...</li>
            <li>Great product, fast delivery</li>
            <li>This product is smooth and applies easily.</li>
            <li>This eye cream is so light on the skin and absorbs so quickly!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still am a huge fan of Obagi and will continue to use the line, but will not reorder this eye cream.</li>
            <li>This eye cream goes on smoothly and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Getting it at 50% off what I would pay locally makes me happy too.</li>
            <li>Concealer goes on smooth without drying up and looking cracked.</li>
            <li>So long as she looks beautiful and feels that way...</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for the first time although I  have used the Obagi Nu-Derm system for more than 10 years.  </li>
            <li>This is as good as or better than the other eye creams I have used.</li>
            <li>I can really tell a huge difference in the appearance of the lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>as can everyone else!&lt;br /&gt;Obagi products are WELL worth the money...</li>
            <li>Wanted to try this brand it was nice but not much different than I use...</li>
            <li>So far the product seems to be fine.  </li>
            <li>This really made a difference!</li>
            <li>what is this exactly for? does not help my eye area at all with anything.</li>
            <li>This was one of many Obagi purchases I made recently from Amazon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d consider my skin sensitive/normal and this is by far my favorite eye cream thus far.</li>
            <li>It is a little tiny tube and travels just great too.</li>
            <li>It will probably be about six weeks before the real results are known.</li>
            <li>And in closing do I really need to review everything I buy from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real pita.</li>
            <li>that was greatly appreciated...</li>
            <li>They look so much brighter and lifted.</li>
            <li>and it sure doesn&#x27;t help if I have to apply concealer to hide my dark circles.</li>
            <li>Just a tiny dab below each eye in the morning, I was very pleased that the puffiness were hardly visible by the time I was ready to leave for work.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and other products are to strong and burn.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and do not find this product to be an irritant.</li>
            <li>My undereye area is pretty dry</li>
            <li>but I live in a very arid, dry climate.</li>
            <li>I have used other eye creams that I like better and cost less.  </li>
            <li>My wife is currently 51 years old, however people look at her and guess 30.  </li>
            <li>Thick, rich, absorbs with no shine.</li>
            <li>This is the only eye cream I have found so far that does not make my concealer look dry.</li>

            <li> You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.  I&#x27;d consider my skin sensitive/normal and this is by far my favorite eye cream thus far.</li>
            <li> This really made a difference!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my medical esthetician and it smooths out the little puffiness and I love using it.  It is a little tiny tube and travels just great too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for the first time although I  have used the Obagi Nu-Derm system for more than 10 years.  I was using the Obagi 5% vitamin C for the eyes but decided to purchase this once I saw it listed.  I will purchase it again.  I continue to use the 5%C solution but have added this eye cream to my regime. I very tiny bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Did not notice a difference at all</li>
            <li> So far the product seems to be fine.  I have other Obagi Products.  It will probably be about six weeks before the real results are known.</li>
            <li> Be believer in obagi products. Great light weight feel.</li>
            <li> I love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it, love it.  And in closing do I really need to review everything I buy from Amazon.  It&#x27;s a real pita.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Obaji products and so far this one seems to be doing a good job. At this point I don&#x27;t have anything negative to&lt;br /&gt;say about it.</li>
            <li> what is this exactly for? does not help my eye area at all with anything.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost ten years and I pray that it is working for me and helps me with my wrinkles</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi products for about 3 years and this is one of my least favorites.  I have used other eye creams that I like better and cost less.  I&#x27;m still am a huge fan of Obagi and will continue to use the line, but will not reorder this eye cream.</li>
            <li> I have used obagi for years. This item smells rancid.  It may be that it is outdated. Unable to use</li>
            <li> great product did exactly what it said it would..</li>
            <li> Good product, as advertised</li>
            <li> I am an Obagi fan and introduced to this product line by my dermatologist.  This eye cream goes on smoothly and is not greasy.  I have sensitive eyes and do not find this product to be an irritant.</li>
            <li> This was one of many Obagi purchases I made recently from Amazon and I am THRILLED with the results! In less than three weeks of using their products twice a day, as directed, I can see a difference...as can everyone else!&lt;br /&gt;Obagi products are WELL worth the money...my only regret: that I waited so long to begin!</li>
            <li> Instead of nu-derm eye cream I got a elastiderm eye cream in the box!!!</li>
            <li> My wife is currently 51 years old, however people look at her and guess 30.  She says this product has a lot to do with it...and I think the other dozen or so Obagi products she uses also help.  So long as she looks beautiful and feels that way...I am happy.  Getting it at 50% off what I would pay locally makes me happy too.</li>
            <li> I will say this product does make your eyes seem more awake. But no improvement on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Thick, rich, absorbs with no shine. I&#x27;ve been using it since January and just now on my second tube. A little bit goes a long way. In drier months I find myself reapplying it half way through the day... but I live in a very arid, dry climate.</li>
            <li> excellent buyer and  product, thank you</li>
            <li> This is as good as or better than the other eye creams I have used. It is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try this brand it was nice but not much different than I use...your price was great and shipment fast...that was greatly appreciated...I contacted a friend who uses your brand and told her the price was so much better than she was paying...</li>
            <li> 4th time purchasing this cream. I love it! My undereye area is pretty dry and it sure doesn&#x27;t help if I have to apply concealer to hide my dark circles. This is the only eye cream I have found so far that does not make my concealer look dry. Concealer goes on smooth without drying up and looking cracked.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is so light on the skin and absorbs so quickly!  I can really tell a huge difference in the appearance of the lines around my eyes.  They look so much brighter and lifted.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny dab below each eye in the morning, I was very pleased that the puffiness were hardly visible by the time I was ready to leave for work.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it&#x27;s the best I have found. I have sensitive skin and other products are to strong and burn.  This product is smooth and applies easily.</li>
