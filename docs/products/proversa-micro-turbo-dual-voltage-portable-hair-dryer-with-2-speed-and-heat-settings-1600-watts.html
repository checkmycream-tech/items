            <li>or so I have used it, has been excellent.  </li>
            <li>Worked perfectly with 240v.</li>
            <li>Great size and does a good job.</li>
            <li>I used it at a motel in Point Pleasant,</li>
            <li>so it was great to have this tool along, especially in a very humid climate.</li>
            <li>As one who likes to travel light, I was impressed by how light this hairdryer is.   </li>
            <li>I discovered this hair dryer at a motel and liked it.</li>
            <li>(I liked the motel, too.)</li>
            <li>It has two power/temperature settings, which is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>N.J. I could not wait to purchase my own.</li>
            <li>I would surely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I love this little,lightweight hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This one is the nice true compact type I like.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t review this dryer honestly as Amazon has perversed my review of the \\&quot;First</li>
            <li>It worked just fine in Ireland, Wales, and England.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also light weight for travel.  </li>
            <li>It is fairly light, which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again, and no stupid folding handle to try and get &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I very rarely use a hairdryer, but when camping, traveling etc there is a need.</li>
            <li>Nor does the look-alike older unit I own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great tiny yet powerful hair dryer for its price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for getting your hair dry in a hurry, but if you&#x27;re used to styling with a blow dryer it presents a bit of a challenge.</li>
            <li>This is very easy to store and to use and it does a good job on both the high and low settings.  </li>
            <li>This is a super dryer.  </li>
            <li>However I can say that while traveling domestically, this little dryer has been great.</li>
            <li>More powerful than my other dryer with a lot more voltage.</li>
            <li>The high speed is good, but my older dryer is just a little more powerful.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit scared of ordering it, in fear that it would be crappy and cheap, but i must admit I was definitely surprised!</li>
            <li>However, this one is good enough and the controls are set up for easy one-handed usage, with high, then &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; then &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; all on one simple power button.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to take that trade off.</li>
            <li>but it said \\&quot;First</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen First Class dryers in hotels</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother looking for a transformer for your 110v blow dryer if it&#x27;s more than 1600w because you will have problems and possibly even damage your appliance from home.</li>
            <li>Not disappointed so far.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this little hair dryer!</li>
            <li>I have really thick, long hair and am very happy w/ the purchase.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I wrote down the name and looked it up.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s neither as powerful nor as quiet, it&#x27;s plenty adequate.</li>
            <li>b/c the power is much stronger.</li>
            <li>Really like the supplied cone for directed drying.</li>
            <li>My hands are arthritic and this is much easier button placement than having the buttons on the front of the handle.  </li>
            <li>but I typically just use the highest heat possible and this can do a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair.</li>
            <li>Good little blow dryer for travel internationally.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer is tiny, yet powerful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this now for a few months I think, &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>I know the differences are small, but to me, the lighter is better for travel.  </li>
            <li>A little heavier than a similar model I have, and more bulky.  </li>
            <li>My old Conair Baby, that was ancient, bit the dust.</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the nearest thing to my old Conair Baby that I found.</li>
            <li>It also has decent quality of wire (some of that cheap wire nowadays hardly bends), and the cord is a generous 6 feet.</li>
            <li>Pros: quiet, small and portable, cute, works well.    </li>
            <li>It is a bit less powerful than I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li>It is very powerful for the small size and low price.  </li>
            <li>It is small, yet powerful, and not quite as noisy as my previous, powerful dryer.</li>
            <li>Also when on the hi setting, it isn&#x27;t nearly high enough for me to dry my hair efficiently.</li>
            <li>My requirements were: relatively light weight, doesn&#x27;t sound like a jet engine, larger than usual air blowing surface, long enough cord, a little less than 1800 watts.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is very easy to store and to use and it does a good job on both the high and low settings.  I&#x27;m very happy with it. It&#x27;s also light weight for travel.  I discovered it on our last cruise, it was provided in our room.  I would surely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Pros: quiet, small and portable, cute, works well.    Cons: needs a setting that blows just air and not heat.</li>
            <li> As one who likes to travel light, I was impressed by how light this hairdryer is.   It is a bit less powerful than I&#x27;m used to but I&#x27;m willing to take that trade off.</li>
            <li> I stayed at a hotel that had these hair dryers. I liked it so much that I wrote down the name and looked it up. It is small, yet powerful, and not quite as noisy as my previous, powerful dryer. Not disappointed so far.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this little hair dryer! I was a bit scared of ordering it, in fear that it would be crappy and cheap, but i must admit I was definitely surprised! It&#x27;s a great tiny yet powerful hair dryer for its price.I would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because I needed a dual voltage dryer to bring on my study abroad trip to Spain. This hair dryer worked when using the outlet in Spain but not for long. It would start drying then stop. I wouldn&#x27;t even use it for long. I guess the dryer couldn&#x27;t handle the power t&#x3D;for too long and I&#x27;d have to wait until I could use it again when it cooled off. Also when on the hi setting, it isn&#x27;t nearly high enough for me to dry my hair efficiently. Maybe if you have thin hair this would be the hair dryer for you.</li>
            <li> A little heavier than a similar model I have, and more bulky.  They both do the same drying, so there is no difference.  In the future, I will buy the other brand to get the smaller size and lesser weight.  I know the differences are small, but to me, the lighter is better for travel.  I wish this unit had a coiling cord, but it doesn&#x27;t. Nor does the look-alike older unit I own.</li>
            <li> I discovered this hair dryer at a motel and liked it. (I liked the motel, too.) I&#x27;ve \\&quot;always\\&quot; wanted a small dryer for travel; it&#x27;s probably half the volume and weight of the Conair I use at home. While it&#x27;s neither as powerful nor as quiet, it&#x27;s plenty adequate. It has two power/temperature settings, which is a nice feature. While the handle does not fold, it&#x27;s not a detriment when packed in a suitcase.</li>
            <li> This is a super dryer.  It is very powerful for the small size and low price.  It worked just fine in Ireland, Wales, and England.  At home I use it to dry my dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update July 2013:&lt;br /&gt;My review was not for this ProVersa Dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a dryer in Summer 2011 but it said \\&quot;First Class\\&quot; on it.  I&#x27;ve seen First Class dryers in hotels so I decided to buy it because it must be dependable.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t review this dryer honestly as Amazon has perversed my review of the \\&quot;First Class\\&quot; Dryer by playing switcheroo with ProVersa.  I call BS.</li>
            <li> Great size and does a good job. The detachable black diffuser piece is extremely hard to get off (at least mine was) so consider whether you will take it off and on often.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet when traveling abroad so I can&#x27;t speak on the voltage changes. However I can say that while traveling domestically, this little dryer has been great. I typically bring it with me just in case the hotel doesn&#x27;t offer one but I sometimes use this anyways b/c the power is much stronger. There aren&#x27;t any fancy settings but I typically just use the highest heat possible and this can do a pretty good job. I have really thick, long hair and am very happy w/ the purchase.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is tiny, yet powerful. It has two speeds and and attachment to extend the dryer. Build quality appears to be similar to big brand name hair dryers.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer has two settings... \\&quot;hurricane\\&quot; or \\&quot;puff of breath\\&quot;. Not much in between. It&#x27;s great for getting your hair dry in a hurry, but if you&#x27;re used to styling with a blow dryer it presents a bit of a challenge. It is fairly light, which is why I bought it. Overall, it is \\&quot;OK\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love this little,lightweight hair dryer. I used it at a motel in Point Pleasant, N.J. I could not wait to purchase my own. More powerful than my other dryer with a lot more voltage.</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair. I very rarely use a hairdryer, but when camping, traveling etc there is a need. Having dual voltage is a plus. This one is simple, reliable, dries my hair nicely on low, and in short does what it should do. Really like the supplied cone for directed drying.</li>
            <li> After purchasing several other dryers, this is the one! My old Conair Baby, that was ancient, bit the dust. The newer versions were a pale comparison, so I started searching. My requirements were: relatively light weight, doesn&#x27;t sound like a jet engine, larger than usual air blowing surface, long enough cord, a little less than 1800 watts. This is, by far, the nearest thing to my old Conair Baby that I found. I actually went back and ordered another for a spare. I&#x27;ve been using this now for a few months I think, &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace and supplement a 1980s version of these compact hairdryers after trying one that advertised as &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; but really only featured a folding handle that was prone to folding while in use! This one is the nice true compact type I like.  It also has decent quality of wire (some of that cheap wire nowadays hardly bends), and the cord is a generous 6 feet. The long cord is also a big selling point since a lot of the newer dryers have 4 foot cords.  I cannot comment on the international power settings since this will probably only be used in North America.  It does have 2 separate blowing speeds. The high speed is good, but my older dryer is just a little more powerful.  However, this one is good enough and the controls are set up for easy one-handed usage, with high, then &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; then &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; all on one simple power button. My hands are arthritic and this is much easier button placement than having the buttons on the front of the handle.  Also has a hanging loop as shown in the photo and I will be using that rather than folding the cord up after each use to store it.  Overall, this feels like a high quality product and over the past month or so I have used it, has been excellent.  I would buy it again, and no stupid folding handle to try and get &amp;#34;compact&amp;#34; rating.</li>
            <li> Dryer works well, but it is a very awkward shape for travel. I gave it away to someone who uses it at home.</li>
            <li> Good little blow dryer for travel internationally. Worked perfectly with 240v. I have never found a hotel blow dryer that works on my curly frizzy hair so it was great to have this tool along, especially in a very humid climate. Lots of air volume and heat. Don&#x27;t bother looking for a transformer for your 110v blow dryer if it&#x27;s more than 1600w because you will have problems and possibly even damage your appliance from home.</li>
            <li> Does everything it should do to dry hair, beards, chest hair, back hair, and any other hair you need dried.</li>
