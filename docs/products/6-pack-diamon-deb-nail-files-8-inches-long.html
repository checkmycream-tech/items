            <li>Can&#x27;t have too many.</li>
            <li>diamon debs are the best I&#x27;ve found, and this was by far the cheapest per file available.  </li>
            <li>Good product and fast delivery</li>
            <li>These are the best nail files hands down!  </li>
            <li>My favorite files, I have long natural nails and these have always been the best files.</li>
            <li>I still have the original but now have one in every room and purse.  </li>
            <li>You can file corners better because it is not thick.</li>
            <li>6 metal files is a good deal but again, not what I expected.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li>I bought my first one in 1969 and I still have it and use it weekly.</li>
            <li>amazing that anything would last that long and still work, even the cheap plastic sleeve.</li>

            <li>The seller wants to charge me for the opened one, and a restocking fee of 15%.  </li>
            <li>They are thin, lightweight, and have a nice pointed end to clean underneath your nail tips.  </li>
            <li>The cover on mine is a light blue and the newer ones are a royal blue...</li>
            <li>I agree with the other person who wrote about the tips:  the old diamond deb file which was a US product had a precisely cut pointed tip,</li>
            <li>They last for a LONG time, but over the years, we grow a lot of nails, and occasionally, we have to refill :)</li>
            <li>My old file, diamond deb, is not in this shape.  </li>

            <li> The thin point allows you to clean under your nails well.</li>
            <li> Seems as tho they cut it off of the adjoining one without the tip and then failed to smooth the tip that was left.  </li>
            <li> the pointed tip of the file that I opened was extremely rough and not finished off.  </li>
            <li> the tip is so jagged and rough that it is not useable.  </li>
            <li> These tips on the ones I got, marked &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34;  are rounded and bent, totally useless for nail cleaning, which was 50% of the use I had for my old ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> DIAMOND DEB WILL CUT IT DOWN TO SIZE.</li>
            <li> I had 1 for 30 years but had a hard time locating it in stores to get another.  </li>
            <li> AND IT IS HARD TO GET WITH THE DREMAL</li>
            <li> It is hard to find.</li>
            <li> am quite disappointed actually.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely unhappy with both the seller and the product.  </li>
            <li> Well, hard to believe!!!!!</li>

            <li> After I ordered a six pack of these wonderful files, I found the one I lost.&lt;br /&gt;Not to worry. I will have plenty now. Can&#x27;t have too many. These are the best files I have found.</li>
            <li> I really like these nail files.  Don&#x27;t use anything else...</li>
            <li> These are the best nail files hands down!  They are thin, lightweight, and have a nice pointed end to clean underneath your nail tips.  Excellent product.  Price is excellent.  Seller got them here in timely fashion.</li>
            <li> We always buy Diamon Deb.  They last for a LONG time, but over the years, we grow a lot of nails, and occasionally, we have to refill :)&lt;br /&gt;These are a great product.</li>
            <li> I keep buying these and losing them, so I hope you guys don&#x27;t stop making them.  They&#x27;re the best at what they do and I&#x27;ll use them forever.</li>
            <li> I am perfectly happy with the way they file, and hope they hold up.&lt;br /&gt;But----- I agree with the other person who wrote about the tips:  the old diamond deb file which was a US product had a precisely cut pointed tip, perfect for cleaning under the nail.  These tips on the ones I got, marked &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34;  are rounded and bent, totally useless for nail cleaning, which was 50% of the use I had for my old ones.&lt;br /&gt;I am quite disappointed actually.  6 metal files is a good deal but again, not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Good product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I had 1 for 30 years but had a hard time locating it in stores to get another.  Thank-you Amazon.  I still have the original but now have one in every room and purse.  Best nail file ever.  Never wears out.</li>
            <li> My favorite files, I have long natural nails and these have always been the best files.</li>
            <li> DIAMOND DEB - THE VERY BEST FOR DOING NAILS, YOURS, OR YOUR DOGS.. OR BOTH.. SOMETIMES A PUPPY GETS A CURLED NAIL AND IT IS HARD TO GET WITH THE DREMAL.. DIAMOND DEB WILL CUT IT DOWN TO SIZE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  It is hard to find. The thin point allows you to clean under your nails well. You can file corners better because it is not thick.</li>
            <li> been using them for years, best nailfile</li>
            <li> diamon debs are the best I&#x27;ve found, and this was by far the cheapest per file available.  oh, oh, oh</li>
            <li> These nail files last forever.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was advertised.</li>
            <li> I gave 15 of these away for Christmas. I bought my first one in 1969 and I still have it and use it weekly. The cover on mine is a light blue and the newer ones are a royal blue...amazing that anything would last that long and still work, even the cheap plastic sleeve. This product should be in every ladies&#x27; vanity drawer.</li>
            <li> the pointed tip of the file that I opened was extremely rough and not finished off.  the tip is so jagged and rough that it is not useable.  The seller wants to charge me for the opened one, and a restocking fee of 15%.  I am extremely unhappy with both the seller and the product.  My old file, diamond deb, is not in this shape.  The tip on the ones I ordered is not pointed nor is it finished.  Seems as tho they cut it off of the adjoining one without the tip and then failed to smooth the tip that was left.  Totally unacceptable in my opinion.  Seller says all are made that way????!!!!!  Well, hard to believe!!!!!</li>
