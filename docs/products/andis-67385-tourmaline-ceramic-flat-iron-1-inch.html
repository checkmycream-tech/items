            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as some others I&#x27;ve had, and that&#x27;s why I have to go over my hair so many times.</li>

            <li>They became very hot with each use</li>
            <li>It does not get hot enought to go through your hair smooth.</li>

            <li> My daughter loves her new flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have been using this flat iron for about two weeks now</li>
            <li> this Andis brand flat iron just keeps going.  </li>
            <li> I got this flat iron because I wanted one I could take with me to travel.</li>
            <li> I find that after about 5 minutes the heat cools and after I check the flat iron has shut off.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this flat iron a few times to straighten my niece&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> My other andis flat iron I had lasted 6 years until the plates started popping out!</li>
            <li> When I actually use it to curl my hair, the friction takes hold and it is impossible to run through my hair smoothly.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t snag, works as expected.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 1 month or so now and even after I dropped it off my counter (which killed my last one of another brand)</li>
            <li> so you can store it closed.</li>
            <li> I like the black with different colors instead of a bland color.</li>
            <li> soo I have thick islander hair the flat iron works but will take a lot of time id have to keep going over and over on that piece of hair to go flat</li>
            <li> but it doesnt burn it like other irons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this iron quite a few times since I got it</li>
            <li> I tried using it a few times but every time I had to switch to my sister&#x27;s nicer GHD to finish the job.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair, and it&#x27;s getting thick again, but it only takes me at least 10 minutes to straighten it all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed</li>
            <li> This makes for a very difficult session with straightening you hair if the heating fails to remain consistent due to shutting off.  </li>
            <li> It leaves creases and leaves it looking dull.</li>
            <li> so im giving it to a friend with thin hair .</li>
            <li> The end result is a sloppy, stinky (from my hair burning) and kinky</li>
            <li> The only thing I hate is when you straighten your hair it smells weird.</li>

            <li> Purchased this for use in Europe as it claimed to be dual voltage. It burned up on first use in Switzerland</li>
            <li> No joke!  This flat iron heats up fast and works perfect.  I have been using it for about 1 month or so now and even after I dropped it off my counter (which killed my last one of another brand) this Andis brand flat iron just keeps going.  Love the colors too!</li>

            <li> Got it for a birthday gift for my niece and she loves it.  She picked it out, so it was great that we had Amazon so she could find which one she wanted and was at a great price also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it and she also agrees.</li>
            <li> I received the item in perfect conditions, I loved the way the item was described. It was everything I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love Andis products. They are made really well and last for quite a while. I have this iron, and it heats up in about a minute. It straightens great and the heat settings are extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> This flat iron was very nice and the tourmaline ceramic feature was the selling point for me. My daughter loves it and uses it often.</li>

            <li> Beautiful design and straightens very well. Fast heat up and has a lock so you can store it closed. I totally recommend this item.</li>

            <li> This product really helps my hair shine and bounce! Very satisfied. Take the everywhere I go and use them a lot!</li>
            <li> This iron does the job, but I just have to go over my hair about 3 times.  It doesn&#x27;t get as hot as some others I&#x27;ve had, and that&#x27;s why I have to go over my hair so many times.</li>

When I actually use it to curl my hair, the friction takes hold and it is impossible to run through my hair smoothly. The end result is a sloppy, stinky (from my hair burning) and kinky (not in a good way) almost curl. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed but I guess I got what I paid for. In the future I will invest in a nicer styling iron.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with how fast I received my order! I give the flat iron 3 stars, its not the best flat iron I&#x27;ve used, but its okay!! Love the design and also how quickly it heats up!! I would recommend it to friends and family!!!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife because I have a set of Andi&#x27;s clippers and I love their products, recommended!!!  Five stars well deserved</li>
            <li> Had it for about a year and 1/2 and its still working great!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves her new flat iron. I really wish I had one like it for my wife :P Great Amazon.com purchase. Great seller. Fast shipping. Happy kid. Thank you for a smooth online purchase. Take care</li>
            <li> Loved it for about 9 months for my very fine, over-processed, frizzy, caucasian hair and then the gold plate coating startyed to wear off and it burned my hair. It really was terrific for a short period of time but it certainly did not last. Guess it was too cheap to last.  Going to try the Rusk brand next.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron ever. My best friend purchased a flat iron for over a $100 and hers is useless compared to mine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for only a month but so far I am impressed with it. They have a nice feature where you can protect your thumb and cord doesn&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li> I love it, it came on time and in very good condition brand new. Works really good on my hair. I recommend it definitely</li>
            <li> They lived up to their, product I use andis products all the time Great! I would tell others about my flatirons.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Cool design! Heats up very fast and holds the temp. A great deal for twice the price</li>
            <li> It does not get hot enought to go through your hair smooth. It leaves creases and leaves it looking dull. That being said for under 20.00 its not bad if you need an inexpensive hot iron. Mine is going back and I&#x27;m going to keep using my instyler.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as expected. So i have to do it over and over. I&#x27;m not a fan of doing that because I&#x27;m scared I&#x27;m damaging my hair more than doing it. The color is nice, the size is perfect for travelling.</li>
            <li> I have only used this flat iron a few times to straighten my niece&#x27;s hair.  I am natural and haven&#x27;t used it on my own yet.  I find that after about 5 minutes the heat cools and after I check the flat iron has shut off.  This makes for a very difficult session with straightening you hair if the heating fails to remain consistent due to shutting off.  I wish I had realized and used it earlier as my deadline to return or exchange has expired.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to use in Germany and she has used it in the States and so far it does what it is supposed to do.  the price was also good.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my gf and she loves it. She said to whomever buys this &amp;#34; You wont be disappointed!&amp;#34;</li>
