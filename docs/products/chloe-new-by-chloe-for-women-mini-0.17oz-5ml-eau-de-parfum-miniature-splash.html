            <li>The smell is okay...</li>
            <li>Not in LOVE</li>
            <li>The fragrance wasn&#x27;t even close to Chloe (I&#x27;ve used Chloe for 25 or more years) and it just evaporated to nothing in about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>The bottle top seemed disturbed.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I shop another online site and they are slower and I have not been satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I just  love  </li>
            <li>Fragrance fades after several hours, residual is weaker but gets more pleasant.</li>
            <li>It is lovely, and the true test was when my husband, who rarely compliments me on perfume, said \\&quot;you smell nice\\</li>
            <li>This is exactly the scent I fell in love with after I found it in a magazine sample.</li>
            <li>, this small bottle is perfect size to carry in a purse!</li>
            <li>It has good lasting strength and stays thru the day..  </li>
            <li>kind of gives me a headache after awhile because it&#x27;s so strong (you only need a dab).</li>
            <li>Arrive quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li>The scent is very strong and it lasts for hours and it is not any different from the original bottle which I got from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>so it was still worth it for me.</li>
            <li>Did not smell right.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it is supposed to smell like that, or if this isn&#x27;t the real thing!</li>
            <li>The scent does linger but is not overpowering, and I find that it stays better if you put a bit in your hair or on a small cottonball tucked in a pocket or cami top.</li>
            <li>I like it so much!</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like if you were to buy it in the store.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance so much and the tiny bottle as I</li>
            <li>This perfume is clean, classic, feminine, and a little bit sexy.</li>
            <li>The box looked like the real thing, but it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>so they evaporate fast.</li>
            <li>seriously this perfume smeels so good</li>
            <li>Thanks for this little gift, it really worths much more than the price I paid and</li>
            <li>I also appreciate the fast shipping and tracking information that amazon offers.</li>
            <li>It is my wife&#x27;s&#x27; favorite and the sample smaller size last a pretty good amount of time with casual use!</li>
            <li>&quot; (and I hadn&#x27;t even told him I had gotten this or was wearing anything new).</li>
            <li>Amazon is my new go</li>
            <li>I was surprised!</li>
            <li>A light, every so slightly floral scent.</li>
            <li>Like soft flowers.  </li>
            <li>This is a old fragrance</li>
            <li>About 15 minutes later, after spraying more than is usual, I can&#x27;t smell it at all.  </li>
            <li>I keep this little one in my makeup bag for a quick fix.</li>
            <li>I spray it on my neck and wrists, and it is barely there after a while.  .</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t be freaked out by the other reviews.</li>
            <li> so I wanted a small sample before making a big purchase</li>
            <li> This is legit, and besides, I would rather spend a small amount on something to see if it works with my body chemistry first, instead of spending $80 on a large bottle at the dept. store and then end up with an expensive paper weight cuz it doesn&#x27;t, which I have learned the hard way in the past.</li>
            <li> the size too small.</li>
            <li> When they say mini, they mean it....</li>
            <li> Beyond annoyed at the comments complaining of how small the bottle is.</li>
            <li> I have Chloe Eau De Parfum already at home, and something is wrong with this bottle.  </li>
            <li> Nothing is wrong with my nose.  </li>
            <li> Nothing is wrong with the perfume.....</li>
            <li> Made the mistake of buying without ever having tried the fragrance before, think it smells awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> When they say mini, they mean it....lol&lt;br /&gt;But I love Chloe so it was still worth it for me. lol</li>
            <li> Love it.  Smells like I just got out of the shower.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay...kind of gives me a headache after awhile because it&#x27;s so strong (you only need a dab). Not in LOVE but my dad says it smells good which is very rare lol. Beyond annoyed at the comments complaining of how small the bottle is. WHAT DID YOU EXPECT? Read the sizing description people! Don&#x27;t you know your measurements!?</li>
            <li> The box looked like the real thing, but it wasn&#x27;t.  The fragrance wasn&#x27;t even close to Chloe (I&#x27;ve used Chloe for 25 or more years) and it just evaporated to nothing in about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought it would be. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li> Made the mistake of buying without ever having tried the fragrance before, think it smells awful. Don&#x27;t know if it is supposed to smell like that, or if this isn&#x27;t the real thing!</li>
            <li> This is exactly the scent I fell in love with after I found it in a magazine sample. It is lovely, and the true test was when my husband, who rarely compliments me on perfume, said \\&quot;you smell nice\\&quot; (and I hadn&#x27;t even told him I had gotten this or was wearing anything new). The scent does linger but is not overpowering, and I find that it stays better if you put a bit in your hair or on a small cottonball tucked in a pocket or cami top. Don&#x27;t be freaked out by the other reviews. This is legit, and besides, I would rather spend a small amount on something to see if it works with my body chemistry first, instead of spending $80 on a large bottle at the dept. store and then end up with an expensive paper weight cuz it doesn&#x27;t, which I have learned the hard way in the past. And sprays always have lots if alcohol so they evaporate fast. This is the way to go, it&#x27;s concentrated, and smells amazing. I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> seriously this perfume smeels so good, this small bottle is perfect size to carry in a purse!</li>
            <li> Did not smell right.  Did not smell like Chloe Parfum.  The bottle top seemed disturbed.  I have Chloe Eau De Parfum already at home, and something is wrong with this bottle.  Nothing is wrong with my nose.  About 15 minutes later, after spraying more than is usual, I can&#x27;t smell it at all.  I truly believe this bottle has been tampered with.</li>
            <li> I found this fragrance to be very nice.. It has good lasting strength and stays thru the day..  Like soft flowers.  It&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li> A light, every so slightly floral scent. Purchased 1st bottle while rushing to a gate at an airport in Europe. Turned out to be a wise purchase. Prices on Amazon are excellent for this item.</li>
            <li> The mini bottle I received is really tiny but guess what! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now like once a week. The scent is very strong and it lasts for hours and it is not any different from the original bottle which I got from Macy&#x27;s. I love the fragrance so much and the tiny bottle as I it&#x27;s very easy to carry everywhere. Thanks for this little gift, it really worths much more than the price I paid and the customer service is very good too...</li>
            <li> I tried it out of a magazine so I wanted a small sample before making a big purchase and I love it. I also appreciate the fast shipping and tracking information that amazon offers. I shop another online site and they are slower and I have not been satisfied. Amazon is my new go to!&lt;br /&gt;-Megan</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Bought for girl friend. Smells good, but not as sexy as I remember years ago. Fragrance fades after several hours, residual is weaker but gets more pleasant.</li>
            <li> This perfume is clean, classic, feminine, and a little bit sexy. I&#x27;d recommend it to any femme girl and this inexpensive mini is a great way to try it out.</li>
            <li> This scent is amazing! My friend described it at Earthy and every man that has smelled it loves it. I wear it for myself I like it so much!</li>
            <li> Nothing is wrong with the perfume..... the size too small. I wish there is something like 1 oz</li>
            <li> This bottle is miniscule!  It turned out to be MUCH smaller than what I expected and is certainly not worth what I paid for it!</li>
            <li> Very nice, but gives me headache. Arrive quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells jus like it... I was surprised!</li>
            <li> Im buying the big ones!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like if you were to buy it in the store. I keep this little one in my makeup bag for a quick fix. I love it.</li>
            <li> I just  love  when asked what perfume am I wearing.and with this one,it stole the cake. Mmmmmmm</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling rose fragrance.  It is my wife&#x27;s&#x27; favorite and the sample smaller size last a pretty good amount of time with casual use!</li>
            <li> I like scent this because it does not knock you over, but I wish it were a bit longer lasting.  I spray it on my neck and wrists, and it is barely there after a while.  .</li>
            <li> This is a old fragrance and I stil like it.</li>
