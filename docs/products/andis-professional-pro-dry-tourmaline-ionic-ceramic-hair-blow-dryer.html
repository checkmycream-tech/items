            <li>Wonderful!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent blow dryer...</li>
            <li>I have to say it is impressive!  </li>
            <li>Customer service was excellent!</li>
            <li>Excellent value - good product!</li>
            <li>great blowdryer..</li>
            <li>Works great might want earplugs.</li>
            <li>So happy I found this item.  </li>
            <li>Even though, that is the case, I decided to get this product anyway because the company has a good reputation and the specs indicated that this hair dryer has a list of quality features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The buttons on the handle appear sturdy and give a good &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; when pressed &amp;#34;on or off&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>very good, but too strong.</li>
            <li>, I wanted something better and the Andis is much better!  </li>
            <li>it dries hair fast... love it!</li>
            <li>The cool button works fine.</li>
            <li>I was willing to pay more for something better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no way this was worth the $46 they charge!</li>
            <li>I discovered the warm switch turns hot on high and the hot switch turns warm on low??????</li>
            <li>Although it was powerful</li>
            <li>However it does dry fast and the attachments are good.</li>
            <li>nothing different, maybe even more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even hot after it warms up a bit.</li>
            <li>This was the only blow dryer I found with all the important features (ionic, ceramic, cool shot) that had the pick, concentrator and diffuser.</li>
            <li>(It was well loved and used everyday.)</li>
            <li>It easily blows twice as much air as my last two dryers.  </li>
            <li>Love the blow dryer and it has a high-speed not real hot to burn your hair</li>
            <li>works really well.  </li>
            <li>Since this is the &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; model, I wanted to see how much air this hair dryer pumps out.  </li>
            <li>Very noisy and very bulky to use.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful, even on low.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t normally spend this much on a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>So you can dry on high warm or low</li>
            <li>I have to put on HIGH setting which sounds like</li>
            <li>High speed-</li>
            <li>Even on high heat</li>
            <li>And as far as the reviews I really think they must have been from family or employees of whoever sent it.</li>
            <li>fast, but not harsh on the hair</li>
            <li>I thought no worries, I&#x27;ll pop on Amazon and get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Remember, the heat helps dry your hair, but if you want your hair done fast, it has to &amp;#34;blow&amp;#34; good and hard.  </li>
            <li>It is very very loud.</li>
            <li>in my opinion, if you&#x27;re looking for a new blowdryer to replace your old one?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavier than most and the buttons are in an awkward spot that makes it easy to accidentally turn off while using.</li>
            <li>I really like the dryer, especially the attachments.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the whole experience left my hair looking lackluster and limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found it to be incredibly loud.  </li>
            <li>But it definitely cuts down drying time tremendously</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s barely lukewarm.</li>
            <li>It does not dry well.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> short, I can see why it is called the PRO DRY+.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as well as advertised.</li>
            <li> An upgrade from the Cheapo dryers like Conair and Revlon  from my past 2 that blew up after a few months, Amazon Prime because I needed it immediately, mostly positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy and loud...</li>
            <li> First, there is one other review (at this time) and it is very negative.  </li>
            <li> Works well as expected</li>
            <li> The only downside is it&#x27;s a bit heavy and can slip out your hand.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair in minutes, with less frizz!</li>
            <li> So imagine my disappointment 4 years later when it died.</li>
            <li> Plus, they both had the same problem - a bad cord.  </li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to replace and Andis I already had that had failed after 5 years.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Dryer stopped working after one month. I haven&#x27;t received any response from the seller</li>
            <li> very good, but too strong.</li>
            <li> great blowdryer.. it dries hair fast... love it!</li>
            <li> It is very very loud. It&#x27;s heavier than most and the buttons are in an awkward spot that makes it easy to accidentally turn off while using. However it does dry fast and the attachments are good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!!! Dries my hair in minutes, with less frizz!</li>
            <li> Excellent value - good product!</li>
            <li> Here is the criteria that was utmost in my search for  a blow dryer: ceramic, ioni, blow dryer to minimize frizz. An upgrade from the Cheapo dryers like Conair and Revlon  from my past 2 that blew up after a few months, Amazon Prime because I needed it immediately, mostly positive reviews. I was willing to pay more for something better.&lt;br /&gt;First of all,instead of arriving during the 2 day Delivery of &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34;, it took a week to arrive w/o any explanation or notice why. I checked and it actually was &amp;#34;delivered to carrier&amp;#34; in 5 states!????&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived I tried it out immediately. I discovered the warm switch turns hot on high and the hot switch turns warm on low?????? So you can dry on high warm or low heat- not the 4 heat it describes . The cool button works fine. Also my hair DID have the same amount of frizz as the cheaper brands- nothing different, maybe even more. And as far as the reviews I really think they must have been from family or employees of whoever sent it. There&#x27;s no way this was worth the $46 they charge! Wished I would have gone to Kmart and just gotten another cheapo!</li>
            <li> Excellent blow dryer... It is very heavy and loud... But it definitely cuts down drying time tremendously</li>
            <li> Works great might want earplugs. It&#x27;s noisy</li>
            <li> Works well as expected</li>
            <li> works really well.  fast, but not harsh on the hair</li>
            <li> Does everything it is said to do!</li>
            <li> It does not dry well.</li>
            <li> Do not buy.  Heating element burned out after 2 months, was used 3x a week.  Junk</li>
            <li> First, there is one other review (at this time) and it is very negative.  Even though, that is the case, I decided to get this product anyway because the company has a good reputation and the specs indicated that this hair dryer has a list of quality features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I don&#x27;t normally spend this much on a hair dryer.  My recent experience with some other hair dryers is such that the last two I had to throw away.  Plus, they both had the same problem - a bad cord.  I don&#x27;t know if my wife and I caused this to happen.  We don&#x27;t believe this is the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I wanted something better and the Andis is much better!  It is not something I have to throw it in the trash, after 6 months or so, even if it is the #1 seller.  This Andis hair dryer is sleek and shiny.  The buttons on the handle appear sturdy and give a good &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; when pressed &amp;#34;on or off&amp;#34;.  Since this is the &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; model, I wanted to see how much air this hair dryer pumps out.  I have to say it is impressive!  It easily blows twice as much air as my last two dryers.  Remember, the heat helps dry your hair, but if you want your hair done fast, it has to &amp;#34;blow&amp;#34; good and hard.  This hair dryer does just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I can see why it is called the PRO DRY+.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as well as advertised. To straighten my hair I have to put on HIGH setting which sounds like a plane is about to take off!  Very noisy and very bulky to use. Will be replacing soon.</li>
            <li> Love the blow dryer and it has a high-speed not real hot to burn your hair I give it five stars</li>
            <li> I really like the dryer, especially the attachments. I just wish the high speed was a little quieter. Other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li> My last hair dryer was an Andis and I loved it. It was a little loud but the quality of drying just couldn&#x27;t be beat. So imagine my disappointment 4 years later when it died. (It was well loved and used everyday.) I thought no worries, I&#x27;ll pop on Amazon and get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except they don&#x27;t carry it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried another Andis- received it, only one speed worked. This should&#x27;ve been my clue to just find a different brand but I&#x27;m an optimist. So I ordered this one. Both speeds work- that&#x27;s a plus. But low speed sounds like a mini jet powering up. High speed- even if you wear ear plugs you&#x27;ll be blowing out your eardrums. It left my ears ringing for 5 minutes after I turned it off. And the heat- meh.Even on high heat it&#x27;s barely lukewarm. It&#x27;s not even hot after it warms up a bit. Not to mention the whole experience left my hair looking lackluster and limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in my opinion, if you&#x27;re looking for a new blowdryer to replace your old one? Keep looking. This is NOT the one for you. Andis needs to go back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> This was the only blow dryer I found with all the important features (ionic, ceramic, cool shot) that had the pick, concentrator and diffuser. It is very powerful, even on low. The only downside is it&#x27;s a bit heavy and can slip out your hand. I needed a glove with grip after prolonged use. It should have a rubber handle.</li>
            <li> So happy I found this item.  Looked everywhere for a hair dryer that included all three attachments that did not cost a fortune.  Customer service was excellent!</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to replace and Andis I already had that had failed after 5 years.  I thought it would be the same but it wasn&#x27;t.  Although it was powerful I found it to be incredibly loud.  I actually believe that prolonged use will cause hearing loss. After two weeks I replaced it with a store bought brand.</li>
