            <li>Excellent product that arrived as promised.</li>
            <li>Still the best toothpick around.</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT 6 packages of these wonderful picks.  </li>
            <li>Perfect!  </li>
            <li>These toothpicks are the best ever!</li>
            <li>So happy to have found these again!</li>
            <li>These are very good toothpicks.</li>
            <li>and these are great for me.  </li>
            <li>These are great.....</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find them online.</li>
            <li>Products are great.</li>
            <li>VERY PLEASED WITH SERVICE AND GREAT PICKS.</li>
            <li>I prefer the MicroPick because it doesn&#x27;t break as easily as the ProPick, but they are both excellent products.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and a good value.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>I have used these for years and loved them.</li>
            <li>Happy that I was able to order the MicroPicks.</li>
            <li>I love these things!</li>
            <li>The joke was on me - she absolutely loved them - which sent me scrounging around the internet in search of more when the original supply ran out.  </li>
            <li>They are better.</li>
            <li>I almost always use the angled end, as it is thinner and more tapered.</li>
            <li>Much better than wood toothpicks.</li>
            <li>This pick works better then flossing.  </li>
            <li>being more flemsy than before.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find them anywhere any more.  </li>
            <li>LOVE them.</li>
            <li>Better than wood.</li>
            <li>They are also thinner and more flexible than floss picks, so they fit between teeth easily.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, your dentist will love you,  and your teeth will love you even more.</li>
            <li>the way, did you see their ad during the Super Bowl?</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>If they switch back to a better material I will buy more.</li>
            <li>However, it is obvious that they have changed the material to a more flexible plastic that breaks easily.</li>
            <li>About a year ago I noticed that the tips seemed to be softer and more bendable, as others have noted (although someone at the company denied there was a change), making it harder to get between teeth, and the tips wore out more quickly because of this.</li>
            <li>I can not say enough about them, they work better then</li>
            <li>They really get between the teeth better than wooden toothpicks.</li>
            <li>They are not brittle and, yet, strong enough to remove debris from the teeth without damaging the gums.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, if they will fit between your teeth, the increased flexibility makes it easier to clean the teeth and gums in a floss-like manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ProPicks always work more effectively for me than ordinary toothpicks and in most instances even better than flossing because they allow me to easily access places in my mouth that are very difficult to reach with floss!  </li>
            <li>Finally, I found them again and breathed a huge sigh of relief.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>This chain will go out of their way to special order things for you, but I was told by a manager that when he tried to get them from a large distributor he was told that Armonds now only sells them online.</li>
            <li>The older ones were stronger than this one</li>
            <li>I used to only be able to find them at a specific grocery chain, but it appears that they no longer sell them.</li>
            <li>--I used to put a piece of clear packing tape over the hinge to strengthen it.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t the old white picks I got used to buying in local stores years ago when they suddenly disappeared.</li>
            <li>The straight end is a little chunky.</li>

            <li> , they do not break or get caught in my teeth, the tapered end gets between all my teeth really well, even the back ones that are very tight.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t loose them they last forever!!!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I ordered 6pak of these green and 6pak of the clear and received 12 clear paks.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these at my local grocery store, but that changed a few months back.  </li>
            <li> try to turn on other people to these toothpicks, but it&#x27;s hard to get people excited about a toothpick, and they were probably hard to find in a lot of areas.</li>
            <li> any other pick I have tried</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife a few years ago - almost as a joke.  </li>
            <li> A few people I know have asked where to purchase the picks as we all had purchased them in our neighborhood Publix.</li>
            <li> Im not sure what others are talking about in regards to them</li>
            <li> I have a hard time using floss</li>
            <li> Hard to find item that we use every day.</li>
            <li> When I could no longer find them at a local store, I desperately searched the internet.  </li>
            <li> I can only speculate that they do this to maximize profits by cutting out distributor and the retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I bookmarked the page!</li>

            <li> These aren&#x27;t the old white picks I got used to buying in local stores years ago when they suddenly disappeared. They are better.</li>
            <li> VERY PLEASED WITH SERVICE AND GREAT PICKS.</li>
            <li> I cannot take care of my teeth and gums properly without this product.  When I could no longer find them at a local store, I desperately searched the internet.  At that time they were temporarily out of stock.  Finally, I found them again and breathed a huge sigh of relief.  ProPicks always work more effectively for me than ordinary toothpicks and in most instances even better than flossing because they allow me to easily access places in my mouth that are very difficult to reach with floss!  I hope I never have to be without them.  I prefer the MicroPick because it doesn&#x27;t break as easily as the ProPick, but they are both excellent products.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time using floss and these are great for me.  I ordered the antibacterial ones and they are the same as the regular ones so I dont have any problems at all.</li>
            <li> These are great..... Just what my husband has been looking for and finally found them on your website.  Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Sturdy and a good value.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a number years after I discovered them in my local supermarket chain. They really get between the teeth better than wooden toothpicks. I almost always use the angled end, as it is thinner and more tapered. About a year ago I noticed that the tips seemed to be softer and more bendable, as others have noted (although someone at the company denied there was a change), making it harder to get between teeth, and the tips wore out more quickly because of this. On the other hand, if they will fit between your teeth, the increased flexibility makes it easier to clean the teeth and gums in a floss-like manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple years ago I spoke to someone at Armonds by way of suggesting they make the hinge for the plastic case stronger so that it doesn&#x27;t wear out halfway through using the contents--I used to put a piece of clear packing tape over the hinge to strengthen it. In the course of our conversation he told me that the genesis of their tooth pick was a steel instrument calibration tool that they manufactured. It&#x27;s shape was converted to the Pro Pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to turn on other people to these toothpicks, but it&#x27;s hard to get people excited about a toothpick, and they were probably hard to find in a lot of areas. I suppose I should start making birthday presents of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding availability, for years, as I mentioned, my local supermarket chain carried them, but they have been recently discontinued. This chain will go out of their way to special order things for you, but I was told by a manager that when he tried to get them from a large distributor he was told that Armonds now only sells them online. I can only speculate that they do this to maximize profits by cutting out distributor and the retailers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, did you see their ad during the Super Bowl? Just kidding.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> The weight of the picks is different from my last order of this item. Not as sturdy. Still the best toothpick around.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife a few years ago - almost as a joke.  The joke was on me - she absolutely loved them - which sent me scrounging around the internet in search of more when the original supply ran out.  Finally found them here on Amazon (whew!).  Needless to say, I bookmarked the page!</li>
            <li> Introduced to product in Florida.  Could not longer locate it anywhere.....thank goodness for Amazon, they are outstandingt!</li>
            <li> Good price. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Happy that I was able to order the MicroPicks. A few people I know have asked where to purchase the picks as we all had purchased them in our neighborhood Publix.</li>
            <li> The angled end gets between the teeth quite well.  The straight end is a little chunky.</li>
            <li> These pics definitely serve the purpose. They are not brittle and, yet, strong enough to remove debris from the teeth without damaging the gums. Much better than wood toothpicks.</li>
            <li> These are very good toothpicks. I like the fact that these are made out of plastic insted of wood. I don&#x27;t have a breakage problem with these like I do with wooden ones.</li>
            <li> Finally I found this one. The older ones were stronger than this one but it&#x27;s works.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these at my local grocery store, but that changed a few months back.  I can only find them online.....urggggg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I BOUGHT 6 packages of these wonderful picks.  I can not say enough about them, they work better then any other pick I have tried, they do not break or get caught in my teeth, the tapered end gets between all my teeth really well, even the back ones that are very tight.  This pick works better then flossing.  I highly recommend it, your dentist will love you,  and your teeth will love you even more.</li>
            <li> I love these things! The angled shape allows them to reach all the areas a traditional toothpick cannot. They are also thinner and more flexible than floss picks, so they fit between teeth easily. I used to only be able to find them at a specific grocery chain, but it appears that they no longer sell them. I was so happy to find them online.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  These toothpicks are the best ever!</li>
            <li> Products are great. Im not sure what others are talking about in regards to them being more flemsy than before. My only complaint is that I ordered 6pak of these green and 6pak of the clear and received 12 clear paks.</li>
            <li> Used to get them at walmart. Can&#x27;t find them anywhere any more.  BUT, they are here. LOVE them. Have them in my purse, my wallet, husbands wallet, glove box, pocket find them in the washer.  If you don&#x27;t loose them they last forever!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and loved them. However, it is obvious that they have changed the material to a more flexible plastic that breaks easily. If they switch back to a better material I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Hard to find item that we use every day. Better than wood.</li>
            <li> So happy to have found these again!</li>
