            <li>I know for sure I will be buying more!</li>

            <li>so awesome they are great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>and I think they will be fine for that!</li>
            <li>and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Still a fabulous deal at 10 pairs for a dollar!</li>
            <li>Love that it came in 2 different styles for a great price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten soo many compliments with both styles.</li>

            <li>I used them on clients and they love how they look.</li>
            <li>Love these lashes.</li>
            <li>I love wearing eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Cheap!</li>
            <li>I tried the thinner ones and may keep the thicker ones for nights out :)</li>
            <li>Love these lashes.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Pay attention when ordering things so cheap!</li>
            <li>There cheap and everyone likes them!</li>
            <li>Better to get twenty pairs for four dollars than one pair for five dollars.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li>, just more plastic to the touch.</li>
            <li>Wish I could have got them faster but still love them.</li>
            <li>And I LOVE the way it makes me looks P:</li>
            <li>but I was pleased with it</li>
            <li>so I ordered more</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re okay for me though</li>
            <li>so I will probably have to get more</li>
            <li>you may need some practice and you will like #2 better.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>You can also use them more than once.</li>
            <li>Long beautiful lashes!!!!</li>
            <li>First off, this is an insanely good deal for the amount of pairs that came in the boxes.  </li>
            <li>the time to deliver was pretty good</li>
            <li>i guess i thought they will look better and have more of a stable curve to them to fit the eye linner</li>
            <li>However when they got to me some lashes were distorted but over all can&#x27;t get lashes like these for this cheap :)</li>
            <li>Lashes were easy to use with its bendable band.</li>
            <li>They will hurt your eye lids and they come off easily.</li>
            <li>Also, they do not bend easily to your eyelid.</li>
            <li>The thinner eyelashes can be trimmed to shape easily but the thicker pair</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and easy to clean the glue off and wear more then once.</li>
            <li>Took a while to get them in the mail, but not a big deal otherwise - great to have so many on hand.</li>
            <li>One pair was faulty but with a bit of trimming with a nail clipper it was fine.</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>but for the price you get what you pay for and if it is an occasion then they are fine.  </li>
            <li>Fine for extravagant events like Marci gras or Halloween.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, I am very pleased with how QUICKLY i received my order.</li>
            <li>The quality is cheap but that&#x27;s what you pay for.</li>
            <li>They are cheap plastic that I would not even wear at halloween.</li>
            <li>they are light weight but the texture of the lashes can improve.</li>
            <li>price was so cheap</li>
            <li>These are junk, can&#x27;t cut to fit.</li>
            <li>so that is why they are so cheap.</li>
            <li>Overall great value.</li>
            <li>They came securely wrapped in a bubble like package.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t bend very easily to fit on eye.</li>
            <li>the look of the think ones are really nice but the quality is cheap cause the lashes arent really flexible.</li>
            <li>They were prime available so made it more worth the purchasing.</li>
            <li>Packaging is plain but who cares because the eyelashes are great!</li>
            <li>And like most eyelashes, these can be reused over and over with the right care.</li>
            <li>The lashes aren&#x27;t exactly Ardell or Red cherry material, but they do the job and look great on, and since they&#x27;re so affordable, and come with so many, they can be used as practice lashes for beginners.</li>
            <li>They are going to be so much fun!</li>
            <li>So Much Fun!</li>
            <li>but well worth it!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re exactly as shown, and unlike a previous buyer, arrived in perfect condition, not a &amp;#34;lash out of place&amp;#34;, so to speak.</li>
            <li>Again, I am pleased with the quality, but mainly, how quickly i receive my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>I loved the product , better than expected !</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t feel like i lost anything, but all 4 boxes are full sitting under my sink.  </li>
            <li>I like how you can see the individual hair from the lashes and they look good</li>
            <li>Good price for basic eyelashes.</li>
            <li>these are not bad but they are not on a track like the lashes</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering them again in the future :) thank you!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re now my &#x27;pretty&#x27; day uses!</li>
            <li>well they are a little cheap feeling but good priced</li>
            <li>The thinner lashes are quite nice, especially for this cosplayer.</li>
            <li>My friend laugh about me when I wear it at home just to see how it looks like...</li>
            <li>The thinner ones look more natural.</li>
            <li>but they are definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I gave these as a gift to someone who does a lot of fun makeup</li>
            <li>still Totally worth it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The darker for evening and drama while the others are nice enough to wear without mascara!</li>
            <li>but it was definitely worth the wait .</li>
            <li>if you just want to take cute photos, then these are good :) but definitely not for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>good quality definetly worth the money I spent on them.</li>
            <li>Packaging was good, might of had little dents but considering that their shipped from Hong Kong, not bad at all.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t bend right and just...</li>
            <li>The dark ones only, they&#x27;re beautiful!</li>
            <li>These are completely plastic and super cheap.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect them to get here as fast as they did , but so far I love them .</li>
            <li>I love them its easy to put on 20 pair will last me a long i really like might order more</li>
            <li>maybe it was to make them stick,  but overall very cheap and too legit to pass by.</li>
            <li>Some people tend to say that they aren&#x27;t great quality and kinda hard to put on, but I would have to disagree.</li>
            <li>You definitely get more than what you pay for.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using eyelashes</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t you will be able to see the thread, and apply extra glue or it will not stick.  </li>
            <li>I love these lashes especially the price!</li>
            <li>It was what I had ordered, and as advertised exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>The thinner ones look real when on!</li>
            <li>Delivered fast!</li>
            <li>Look real!</li>
            <li>You get full and bold plus long and more natural all in one package.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised when i received these because i thought they were going to be like normal eyelash from a drug store to my surprise,they were even better there the real thing,well to me they look like it,i can cut to to adjust my eye size and curl a bit of mascara and all set.</li>
            <li>especially if your eye is like a hill shape, not a straight line lol</li>
            <li>but if someone where to look at you they would be able to tell they definitely are not you real lashes.</li>
            <li>I am actually quite surprised at how nice these are.</li>
            <li>the thinner ones come with a white lining on the top of the eyelash and it is very visible</li>
            <li>but I really love them, They make my dark eyes pop and look very pretty.</li>
            <li>I wear them on certain occasions.</li>
            <li>Next time I will spend a little more money and buy a better quality.</li>
            <li>For the amazing g low price I&#x27;m getting a bargain if only use the thinner set.</li>
            <li>Too much plastic.</li>
            <li>The thicker lashes though are just way too much, even for photos, though it could just be my face type.</li>
            <li>(I gave the rejects to my sister, who still appreciated them).  </li>
            <li>But for the price you cant really expect anything else.</li>
            <li>I really cant complain.</li>
            <li>i tought it took for ever but not reall thanks &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>There is a really drastic difference between the two lashes in thickness, both of which have their place in day/night wear.</li>
            <li>Come on for few bucks, these are incredibly nice.  </li>
            <li>and the other one I still haven&#x27;t gotten to wear it yet :3</li>
            <li>dont see a point in the think ones unless u stack them on top of each other for a noticeable look.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product any day to friends and family thanks Kristen.</li>
            <li>The light ones not really natural.</li>
            <li>I just grab four lashes, place two on top of each other and make new lashes instead to match my style.</li>
            <li>The suck and absolutely do not line up easily with my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>these lashes are good for co-play, but not good for normal wear.</li>
            <li>I go through these like water, so the value is decent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li>The quality is fine, they are what I expected</li>
            <li>They were very easy to apply and not sure if it was the glue or the lashes</li>
            <li>I ordered these lashes and they came in exactly two weeks, which is super fast given the fact that they were supposed to be here in a month and a half since the came all the way from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li>These absolutely suck don&#x27;t look natural at all</li>
            <li>Well these are not like the normal strips you get out in the US.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was fun to experiment with different looks.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste a lot of money.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if they require a special super glue, but these babies do not stay on...or even go on to begin with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 5 since I&#x27;m new to the eyelashes buying</li>
            <li>The thinner pair look so natural!</li>
            <li>Love the eyelashes and price, just wish it sent all different types of eyelashes, instead of multiple ones of the same type.</li>
            <li>but thats only because I had to cut them into peices to apply them at first in order to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>The lashes are strong and the bands are firm.</li>
            <li>would splurge for a little bit more personally if you are looking to wear these everyday.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I guess I didn&#x27;t expect much for the cost of them, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t ever buy them again.</li>
            <li>The natural ones don&#x27;t look natural at all.</li>
            <li>These lashes look so natural.</li>
            <li>but people can not tell that i am wearing them because they look somewhat natural.</li>
            <li>They look so natural when applied.</li>
            <li>but I find that using a sufficient amount of glue (covering the whole band, especially the edges where it meets the beginning and end of your eye) will allow easier application.</li>
            <li>But they came early.  </li>
            <li>These are very inexpensive and when you get them in the mail (warning they take a LONG time to ship)</li>
            <li>Did not like the natural looking lashes so much but the one seem super thick and fake actually looked really amazing and natural</li>
            <li>The thin ones are...useless to me, because even when I wear more natural lashes, I still prefer them thicker than this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fake lashes with real hairs are way better.</li>
            <li>I DOUBLE them in order to get a more thick eyelash effect.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t mind, some women prefer the huge fake dramatic look, I use to myself but now that I am older I like more natural.</li>
            <li>However, I had to wait a very long time for these, the first ones did not come, when I did finally get them</li>
            <li>lasted a long time i didnt have to constantly run to the beauty supply spending $3 on one pair, Thanks.</li>
            <li>There was barely any lashes on they style 2.</li>
            <li>Like it, but they obviously doesn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li>For the price they are fine (as a back up when you run out if other lashes) but both boxes came crushed damaging 4 pairs in each box.</li>
            <li>they really are not that bad though,  have worn the thinner ones and  they look more realistic.</li>
            <li>They took long time to get here when I recieved the set the box was completely bent and tore half open but never the less I was able to salvage some of the eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>They feel like plastic there to long, and even if you cut them they would not give you the natural look.</li>
            <li>The thin ones you should know are not hair though they are a plastic like material making them kind if sharp.</li>
            <li>The darker, fuller looking lashes may look a bit fake, while the lighter lashes look long but more natural.</li>
            <li>The thick ones look so pretty!</li>

            <li> I know for sure I will be buying more!</li>

            <li> so awesome they are great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> and I think they will be fine for that!</li>
            <li> and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Still a fabulous deal at 10 pairs for a dollar!</li>

            <li> I love wearing eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Cheap!</li>
            <li> I tried the thinner ones and may keep the thicker ones for nights out :)</li>
            <li> Love these lashes.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Pay attention when ordering things so cheap!</li>
            <li> There cheap and everyone likes them!</li>
            <li> Better to get twenty pairs for four dollars than one pair for five dollars.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li> , just more plastic to the touch.</li>
            <li> Wish I could have got them faster but still love them.</li>
            <li> And I LOVE the way it makes me looks P:</li>
            <li> but I was pleased with it</li>
            <li> so I ordered more</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re okay for me though</li>
            <li> so I will probably have to get more</li>
            <li> you may need some practice and you will like #2 better.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> You can also use them more than once.</li>
            <li> Long beautiful lashes!!!!</li>
            <li> First off, this is an insanely good deal for the amount of pairs that came in the boxes.  </li>
            <li> the time to deliver was pretty good</li>
            <li> i guess i thought they will look better and have more of a stable curve to them to fit the eye linner</li>
            <li> However when they got to me some lashes were distorted but over all can&#x27;t get lashes like these for this cheap :)</li>
            <li> Lashes were easy to use with its bendable band.</li>
            <li> They will hurt your eye lids and they come off easily.</li>
            <li> Also, they do not bend easily to your eyelid.</li>
            <li> The thinner eyelashes can be trimmed to shape easily but the thicker pair</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and easy to clean the glue off and wear more then once.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get them in the mail, but not a big deal otherwise - great to have so many on hand.</li>
            <li> One pair was faulty but with a bit of trimming with a nail clipper it was fine.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> but for the price you get what you pay for and if it is an occasion then they are fine.  </li>
            <li> Fine for extravagant events like Marci gras or Halloween.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I am very pleased with how QUICKLY i received my order.</li>
            <li> The quality is cheap but that&#x27;s what you pay for.</li>
            <li> They are cheap plastic that I would not even wear at halloween.</li>
            <li> they are light weight but the texture of the lashes can improve.</li>
            <li> price was so cheap</li>
            <li> These are junk, can&#x27;t cut to fit.</li>
            <li> so that is why they are so cheap.</li>
            <li> Overall great value.</li>
            <li> They came securely wrapped in a bubble like package.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t bend very easily to fit on eye.</li>
            <li> the look of the think ones are really nice but the quality is cheap cause the lashes arent really flexible.</li>
            <li> They were prime available so made it more worth the purchasing.</li>
            <li> Packaging is plain but who cares because the eyelashes are great!</li>
            <li> And like most eyelashes, these can be reused over and over with the right care.</li>
            <li> The lashes aren&#x27;t exactly Ardell or Red cherry material, but they do the job and look great on, and since they&#x27;re so affordable, and come with so many, they can be used as practice lashes for beginners.</li>
            <li> They are going to be so much fun!</li>
            <li> So Much Fun!</li>
            <li> but well worth it!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re exactly as shown, and unlike a previous buyer, arrived in perfect condition, not a &amp;#34;lash out of place&amp;#34;, so to speak.</li>
            <li> Again, I am pleased with the quality, but mainly, how quickly i receive my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I loved the product , better than expected !</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t feel like i lost anything, but all 4 boxes are full sitting under my sink.  </li>
            <li> I like how you can see the individual hair from the lashes and they look good</li>
            <li> Good price for basic eyelashes.</li>
            <li> these are not bad but they are not on a track like the lashes</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering them again in the future :) thank you!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re now my &#x27;pretty&#x27; day uses!</li>
            <li> well they are a little cheap feeling but good priced</li>
            <li> The thinner lashes are quite nice, especially for this cosplayer.</li>
            <li> My friend laugh about me when I wear it at home just to see how it looks like...</li>
            <li> The thinner ones look more natural.</li>
            <li> but they are definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I gave these as a gift to someone who does a lot of fun makeup</li>
            <li> still Totally worth it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The darker for evening and drama while the others are nice enough to wear without mascara!</li>
            <li> but it was definitely worth the wait .</li>
            <li> if you just want to take cute photos, then these are good :) but definitely not for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> good quality definetly worth the money I spent on them.</li>
            <li> Packaging was good, might of had little dents but considering that their shipped from Hong Kong, not bad at all.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t bend right and just...</li>
            <li> The dark ones only, they&#x27;re beautiful!</li>
            <li> These are completely plastic and super cheap.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect them to get here as fast as they did , but so far I love them .</li>
            <li> I love them its easy to put on 20 pair will last me a long i really like might order more</li>
            <li> maybe it was to make them stick,  but overall very cheap and too legit to pass by.</li>
            <li> Some people tend to say that they aren&#x27;t great quality and kinda hard to put on, but I would have to disagree.</li>
            <li> You definitely get more than what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using eyelashes</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t you will be able to see the thread, and apply extra glue or it will not stick.  </li>
            <li> I love these lashes especially the price!</li>
            <li> It was what I had ordered, and as advertised exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> The thinner ones look real when on!</li>
            <li> Delivered fast!</li>
            <li> Look real!</li>
            <li> You get full and bold plus long and more natural all in one package.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised when i received these because i thought they were going to be like normal eyelash from a drug store to my surprise,they were even better there the real thing,well to me they look like it,i can cut to to adjust my eye size and curl a bit of mascara and all set.</li>
            <li> especially if your eye is like a hill shape, not a straight line lol</li>
            <li> but if someone where to look at you they would be able to tell they definitely are not you real lashes.</li>
            <li> I am actually quite surprised at how nice these are.</li>
            <li> the thinner ones come with a white lining on the top of the eyelash and it is very visible</li>
            <li> but I really love them, They make my dark eyes pop and look very pretty.</li>
            <li> I wear them on certain occasions.</li>
            <li> Next time I will spend a little more money and buy a better quality.</li>
            <li> For the amazing g low price I&#x27;m getting a bargain if only use the thinner set.</li>
            <li> Too much plastic.</li>
            <li> The thicker lashes though are just way too much, even for photos, though it could just be my face type.</li>
            <li> (I gave the rejects to my sister, who still appreciated them).  </li>
            <li> But for the price you cant really expect anything else.</li>
            <li> I really cant complain.</li>
            <li> i tought it took for ever but not reall thanks &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> There is a really drastic difference between the two lashes in thickness, both of which have their place in day/night wear.</li>
            <li> Come on for few bucks, these are incredibly nice.  </li>
            <li> and the other one I still haven&#x27;t gotten to wear it yet :3</li>
            <li> dont see a point in the think ones unless u stack them on top of each other for a noticeable look.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product any day to friends and family thanks Kristen.</li>
            <li> The light ones not really natural.</li>
            <li> I just grab four lashes, place two on top of each other and make new lashes instead to match my style.</li>
            <li> The suck and absolutely do not line up easily with my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> these lashes are good for co-play, but not good for normal wear.</li>
            <li> I go through these like water, so the value is decent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> The quality is fine, they are what I expected</li>
            <li> They were very easy to apply and not sure if it was the glue or the lashes</li>
            <li> I ordered these lashes and they came in exactly two weeks, which is super fast given the fact that they were supposed to be here in a month and a half since the came all the way from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> These absolutely suck don&#x27;t look natural at all</li>
            <li> Well these are not like the normal strips you get out in the US.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was fun to experiment with different looks.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if they require a special super glue, but these babies do not stay on...or even go on to begin with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 5 since I&#x27;m new to the eyelashes buying</li>
            <li> The thinner pair look so natural!</li>
            <li> Love the eyelashes and price, just wish it sent all different types of eyelashes, instead of multiple ones of the same type.</li>
            <li> but thats only because I had to cut them into peices to apply them at first in order to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> The lashes are strong and the bands are firm.</li>
            <li> would splurge for a little bit more personally if you are looking to wear these everyday.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t expect much for the cost of them, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t ever buy them again.</li>
            <li> The natural ones don&#x27;t look natural at all.</li>
            <li> These lashes look so natural.</li>
            <li> but people can not tell that i am wearing them because they look somewhat natural.</li>
            <li> They look so natural when applied.</li>
            <li> but I find that using a sufficient amount of glue (covering the whole band, especially the edges where it meets the beginning and end of your eye) will allow easier application.</li>
            <li> But they came early.  </li>
            <li> These are very inexpensive and when you get them in the mail (warning they take a LONG time to ship)</li>
            <li> Did not like the natural looking lashes so much but the one seem super thick and fake actually looked really amazing and natural</li>
            <li> The thin ones are...useless to me, because even when I wear more natural lashes, I still prefer them thicker than this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fake lashes with real hairs are way better.</li>
            <li> I DOUBLE them in order to get a more thick eyelash effect.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t mind, some women prefer the huge fake dramatic look, I use to myself but now that I am older I like more natural.</li>
            <li> However, I had to wait a very long time for these, the first ones did not come, when I did finally get them</li>
            <li> lasted a long time i didnt have to constantly run to the beauty supply spending $3 on one pair, Thanks.</li>
            <li> There was barely any lashes on they style 2.</li>
            <li> Like it, but they obviously doesn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li> For the price they are fine (as a back up when you run out if other lashes) but both boxes came crushed damaging 4 pairs in each box.</li>
            <li> they really are not that bad though,  have worn the thinner ones and  they look more realistic.</li>
            <li> They took long time to get here when I recieved the set the box was completely bent and tore half open but never the less I was able to salvage some of the eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> They feel like plastic there to long, and even if you cut them they would not give you the natural look.</li>
            <li> The thin ones you should know are not hair though they are a plastic like material making them kind if sharp.</li>
            <li> The darker, fuller looking lashes may look a bit fake, while the lighter lashes look long but more natural.</li>
            <li> The thick ones look so pretty!</li>
            <li> The regular long lashes look like your real lashes and I wear them everyday.</li>
            <li> Applying these are already hard for first timers.</li>
            <li> Its easy to put glue on but hard to apply, they are a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> I have used almost all of the regular long eyelashes</li>
            <li> I love having a dramatic look, so I originally bought these just for the thicker ones, but thinking about cutting the thinner ones for individual use.</li>
            <li> The thicker ones look very dramatic and costume like, but they are cute.</li>
            <li> When you hold them to the light they don&#x27;t look as fake as others, specially the thin ones.  </li>
            <li> The dramatic ones are so soft and fluffy, and the other ones are very long and exotic.  </li>
            <li> The eyelashes were a little plastic looking, not as natural as I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> The lashes are not natural looking.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind that it&#x27;s long, since you can always cut and adjust to how you want it.</li>
            <li> Those are a lot harder than human hair to glue and hold.</li>
            <li> I realize these are fake lashes, but fake lashes should enhance your lashes and look beautiful.</li>
            <li> The thick ones are very thick, and I LOVE that.</li>
            <li> The thicker one was a bit tooooo dramatic but its fun to wear.</li>
            <li> The only down fall is that the shipping took forever.</li>
            <li> these eyelashes looked super fake.</li>
            <li> The lashes are very thick and at whole sale price.</li>
            <li> They were delivered in two weeks, sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Justa big waste</li>
            <li> Came sooner than expected delivery date tpp</li>
            <li> And had absolutely no problems.</li>
            <li> A little plastic like, the thin ones are great but the thicker ones are very difficult to apply and don&#x27;t stay on very long even with glue.</li>
            <li> Very stiff and hard to apply but after a few uses and curling it properly in accommodation to your eyes, they work very well.</li>
            <li> It took a little long to get them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 and this was my first time wearing fake eyelashes</li>
            <li> I usually buy lashes at the local beauty supply for about a dollar a pair.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll have to straighten them out but other than that</li>
            <li> They look like my usual human hair lashes to me when I put them on</li>
            <li> If you are going for the natural look they won&#x27;t work, only if you are using them for a Broadway show where make up is exaggerated.</li>
            <li> One of my boxes came a little squashed but not much damage to the eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> the thick ones i have only worn twice</li>
            <li> However, I do have to trim them down to size.</li>
            <li> Thank-you SODIAL for not letting me down.</li>
            <li> When I applied the lashes the strip is so stiff that it irritated my eye, so be careful.  </li>
            <li> , If the small ones are too small, double them up to make them thicker</li>
            <li> They are a lot different then regular lashes but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> Bottom line, it&#x27;s sooo not worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> Not good or daily use.</li>
            <li> They are almost straight across so very difficult to put on and even harder to stay on.</li>
            <li> You need little scissors to cut off the ends of the eyelashes because they have like these little pieces sticking out of each side.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even look like my eyelashes not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> In fact it was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> right away I knew this was a bad choice.</li>
            <li> A little heavy but mascara fixes it!</li>
            <li> I had never put on fake lashes prior to receiving these; it took a few times to get used to</li>
            <li> very heavy, stiff and unnatural.</li>
            <li> Then the base is white so unless you have the black glue, you can totally see it.  </li>
            <li> themselves had bits of dried production glue on them, but hardly noticeable and still wearable</li>
            <li> I usually use a eyelash curler after putting them on.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have to admit I have never seen fake eyelashes that actually look plastic.</li>
            <li> Also, during shipping my eyelashes were smushed, so some were unusable as they were permatly stuck in different weird un wearable ways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to trim them.</li>
            <li> (obviously they know theyre fake)</li>
            <li> Really long and really thick baby doll eyelashes!!</li>
            <li> The thick ones are a little thick</li>
            <li> these lashes are SO FAKE looking, there is no way to even try to pull of &amp;#34;natural look&amp;#34;  they are so thick they are almost solid.  </li>
            <li> Second, for a little over $2.00 for 20 pairs both dramatic, for an evening look and a natural-day time look, YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG.</li>
            <li> Even the thin style looks awful and they don&#x27;t stay, even with strong glue!</li>
            <li> Con: they are hard to put on.  </li>
            <li> Horrible cheap plastic eyelashes...</li>
            <li> Besides cutting the sides where the extra lining is, there&#x27;s no need to trim/fix them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan if the thick ones</li>
            <li> The lining of the eyelashes are thick</li>
            <li> I mean I&#x27;ve never looked at someones lashes and said to look like plastic</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical placing an order over the web, being that I usually purchase all my items up-front, in person.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are stiff and REALLY difficult to keep on for longer then a couple minutes...</li>
            <li> but alas they will be nothing but 40 lashes in a box.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are utter crap.</li>
            <li> The thicker ones are just odd and look very FAKE.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless you are going for the dramatic or smokey eye look.</li>
            <li> Get one side glued and the other pops up and on it goes :(  </li>
            <li> Not very good quality and its very difficult to place on eye</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this product they look  fake.</li>
            <li> are clearly fake and all the attention goes there.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> They have this weird texture with thread running threw them, so if you cut them you have string hanging</li>
            <li> i wear fake eyelashes all the time</li>
            <li> I have been wearing fake lashes for 2 year</li>
            <li> I was so desperate to not give up....</li>
            <li> The thinner pair look really bad once you get them on.</li>
            <li> The worst eye lashes ever...hated it, hated it, wasted my money</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> These are the cheapest pieces of crap ever!  </li>
            <li> Terrible wouldnt stay on my eyes.</li>
            <li> And the thicker ones look horrible.</li>
            <li> These are the worst eye lash I have ever seen.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> They look better in person! You definitely get more than what you pay for. I recommend it. This was my first time using eyelashes and they worked perfect . I will post a picture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 and this was my first time wearing fake eyelashes and I&#x27;ve received several compliments. I usually use a eyelash curler after putting them on. I&#x27;m not a fan if the thick ones but I still like them. I will order again!</li>
            <li> Did not like the natural looking lashes so much but the one seem super thick and fake actually looked really amazing and natural</li>
            <li> I usually buy lashes at the local beauty supply for about a dollar a pair. These lashes were just as good and I will be ordering more. One pair was faulty but with a bit of trimming with a nail clipper it was fine. Still a fabulous deal at 10 pairs for a dollar!</li>
            <li> Too much plastic. Not flexibile enough. I guess I didn&#x27;t expect much for the cost of them, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t ever buy them again.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Love that it came in 2 different styles for a great price! My clients looked great in them. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> The thicker one was a bit tooooo dramatic but its fun to wear. and the other one I still haven&#x27;t gotten to wear it yet :3</li>
            <li> The thinner lashes are quite nice, especially for this cosplayer. They show up well in photos. However, I do have to trim them down to size. The thicker lashes though are just way too much, even for photos, though it could just be my face type.</li>
            <li> The thicker ones look very dramatic and costume like, but they are cute. The natural ones don&#x27;t look natural at all. The box came smashed and the lashes look used. It&#x27;s probably just my order but oh well. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it unless you are going for the dramatic or smokey eye look. Its easy to put glue on but hard to apply, they are a bit stiff.</li>
            <li> The quality is cheap but that&#x27;s what you pay for. Still hesitant on whether or not I should wear them. The delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> well they are a little cheap feeling but good priced so they&#x27;re fine. does what it needs to. i guess</li>
            <li> Not very good quality and its very difficult to place on eye and it doesn&#x27;t stay because it doesn&#x27;t have a curved angle.</li>
            <li> Packaging was good, might of had little dents but considering that their shipped from Hong Kong, not bad at all. They were delivered in two weeks, sooner than expected. I love them!!! &amp; Of course their plastic but their amazing! I&#x27;ve gotten soo many compliments with both styles. I highly recommend them to anyone. &amp; awesome price. I&#x27;m ordering more for me and my friends!!</li>
            <li> The worst eye lashes ever...hated it, hated it, wasted my money</li>
            <li> Both sets of these lashes are ADORABLE! For the price you can&#x27;t pass them up. I&#x27;m still using these lashes. The thinner pair look so natural!</li>
            <li> They are what they say they are. Long beautiful lashes!!!! The only down fall is that the shipping took forever. But i am very satisfied with the lashes. Thank you</li>
            <li> These lashes look so natural. I love them the look so awesome they are great for everyday use. I will order more again.</li>
            <li> Very stiff and hard to apply but after a few uses and curling it properly in accommodation to your eyes, they work very well.</li>
            <li> Pro: you get a lot of eyelashes. Con: they are hard to put on.  The lining of the eyelashes are thick so it shows on your eye lid.  You do have to trim to size it to your eyes.  but for the price you get what you pay for and if it is an occasion then they are fine.  If you want to wear them everyday...get a better quality</li>
            <li> These absolutely suck don&#x27;t look natural at all</li>
            <li> I love them its easy to put on 20 pair will last me a long i really like might order more</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this product they look  fake. I saw then and right away I knew this was a bad choice. They feel like plastic there to long, and even if you cut them they would not give you the natural look. If you are going for the natural look they won&#x27;t work, only if you are using them for a Broadway show where make up is exaggerated. Next time I will spend a little more money and buy a better quality.</li>
            <li> The thick ones are very thick, and I LOVE that. The thin ones are...useless to me, because even when I wear more natural lashes, I still prefer them thicker than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, nice.</li>
            <li> It is very plastic-y and heavy. The thicker ones are just odd and look very FAKE. I realize these are fake lashes, but fake lashes should enhance your lashes and look beautiful. Not look &amp;#34;oh god, you&#x27;re eyelashes are clearly fake and all the attention goes there.&amp;#34; Will not order these or these type of lashes again. ardell is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Lashes were easy to use with its bendable band. I used them on clients and they love how they look.However when they got to me some lashes were distorted but over all can&#x27;t get lashes like these for this cheap :)</li>
            <li> dont see a point in the think ones unless u stack them on top of each other for a noticeable look.  the look of the think ones are really nice but the quality is cheap cause the lashes arent really flexible. especially if your eye is like a hill shape, not a straight line lol</li>
            <li> these lashes are good for co-play, but not good for normal wear. They will hurt your eye lids and they come off easily.</li>
            <li> Horrible cheap plastic eyelashes... My friend laugh about me when I wear it at home just to see how it looks like...</li>
            <li> lasted a long time i didnt have to constantly run to the beauty supply spending $3 on one pair, Thanks. FYI., If the small ones are too small, double them up to make them thicker, (2 eyelashes on one eye)</li>
            <li> I am not sure if they require a special super glue, but these babies do not stay on...or even go on to begin with. I tried lash glue (obviously) and even wood glue I was so desperate to not give up....but alas they will be nothing but 40 lashes in a box. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Gave away as a gift and am being told best looking lashes ever. I would consider re-ordering if I was asked where did I buy.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are utter crap. DO NOT BUY. They are cheap plastic that I would not even wear at halloween.</li>
            <li> These are completely plastic and super cheap. The suck and absolutely do not line up easily with my eyelashes. Fake lashes with real hairs are way better. This is something you can buy at your dollar store.</li>
            <li> These are the cheapest pieces of crap ever!  You have to cut off both ends when you go to put them on!  Then the base is white so unless you have the black glue, you can totally see it.  They don&#x27;t bend right and just...I wouldn&#x27;t even waste your money!</li>
            <li> You need little scissors to cut off the ends of the eyelashes because they have like these little pieces sticking out of each side.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes. Packaging is plain but who cares because the eyelashes are great! Sturdy material and love the look of both sets!!</li>
            <li> I will never purchase these again. In fact it was a waste of time and money. The lashes are not natural looking.</li>
            <li> First off, this is an insanely good deal for the amount of pairs that came in the boxes.  One of my boxes came a little squashed but not much damage to the eyelashes.  Some of the eyelashes themselves had bits of dried production glue on them, but hardly noticeable and still wearable (I gave the rejects to my sister, who still appreciated them).  The thicker ones are luscious and perfect for nights out, and the thinner ones are cute and doll-like, perfect for anything else.  And like most eyelashes, these can be reused over and over with the right care.</li>
            <li> These lashes are great!  The dramatic ones are so soft and fluffy, and the other ones are very long and exotic.  Only downfall is that it over a month to get to me and somes had like residue on them maybe it was to make them stick,  but overall very cheap and too legit to pass by.</li>
            <li> These are very inexpensive and when you get them in the mail (warning they take a LONG time to ship) you will be able to see that they are not the best quality. I have to admit I have never seen fake eyelashes that actually look plastic. But for the price you cant really expect anything else. I bought them to put in a Bachelorette Survival kit and I think they will be fine for that!</li>
            <li> I love wearing eyelashes.  However, I had to wait a very long time for these, the first ones did not come, when I did finally get them, I tried to apply them.  As I have been doing eyelashes for over 8 years would be no problem, wouldn&#x27;t you think?? Well these are not like the normal strips you get out in the US.  They have this weird texture with thread running threw them, so if you cut them you have string hanging or it unravels.  Also, they do not bend easily to your eyelid. You have to use two eyelashes per eye just to cover your eyelid.  If you don&#x27;t you will be able to see the thread, and apply extra glue or it will not stick.  Bottom line, it&#x27;s sooo not worth the trouble.  I would not recommend these.  They are thinner than pictured.  When I applied the lashes the strip is so stiff that it irritated my eye, so be careful.  Also, during shipping my eyelashes were smushed, so some were unusable as they were permatly stuck in different weird un wearable ways.</li>
            <li> A little plastic like, the thin ones are great but the thicker ones are very difficult to apply and don&#x27;t stay on very long even with glue. They don&#x27;t form well with the eye.</li>
            <li> they are light weight but the texture of the lashes can improve. I wear them on certain occasions. The thinner ones look more natural. FYI to make them last longer use contact solution before you apply the glue</li>
            <li> these lashes are SO FAKE looking, there is no way to even try to pull of &amp;#34;natural look&amp;#34;  they are so thick they are almost solid.  price was so cheap i don&#x27;t feel like i lost anything, but all 4 boxes are full sitting under my sink.  i might try them for halloween?</li>
            <li> i wear fake eyelashes all the time but people can not tell that i am wearing them because they look somewhat natural. these eyelashes looked super fake. There was barely any lashes on they style 2. The style 1 could be worn to prom or a wedding but if someone where to look at you they would be able to tell they definitely are not you real lashes.</li>
            <li> Terrible wouldnt stay on my eyes. The place where you put the glue is plastic and big. Justa big waste</li>
            <li> I love these lashes especially the price! They look so natural when applied. I know for sure I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Thank-you SODIAL for not letting me down. It was what I had ordered, and as advertised exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Took about 3 weeks to get here, but who am I to complain, coming from where they did? They&#x27;re exactly as shown, and unlike a previous buyer, arrived in perfect condition, not a &amp;#34;lash out of place&amp;#34;, so to speak. VERY happy. 40 pairs for the price of one.</li>
            <li> Cheap! You get what you pay for. Synthetic. And the thicker ones look horrible. Doesn&#x27;t even look like my eyelashes not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> After watching over 10 youtube videos on how to apply lashes I came onto here and ordered these. They were prime available so made it more worth the purchasing. I received them within my 2 days and applied them on lol right in my work bathroom. I brought some glue and scissors because I was expecting them today anyways. They were very easy to apply and not sure if it was the glue or the lashes but I really love them, They make my dark eyes pop and look very pretty. I tried the thinner ones and may keep the thicker ones for nights out :)</li>
            <li> Love these lashes. I DOUBLE them in order to get a more thick eyelash effect. I could not be more impressed!</li>
            <li> I am actually quite surprised at how nice these are. The thinner ones look real when on! Very happy. Will buy again</li>
            <li> They took long time to get here when I recieved the set the box was completely bent and tore half open but never the less I was able to salvage some of the eyelashes.  This seller was awesome though very nice product over all I was pleased with. Would highly recommend this product any day to friends and family thanks Kristen.</li>
            <li> Love the eyelashes and price, just wish it sent all different types of eyelashes, instead of multiple ones of the same type.</li>
            <li> They are going to be so much fun! There was no adhesive on the back and some of them got flipped around when they were being shipped so I&#x27;ll have to straighten them out but other than that I cant wait to put them on!</li>
            <li> Considering g the low price. I really cant complain. The thinner eyelashes can be trimmed to shape easily but the thicker pair I&#x27;m not sure how to trim them. But that&#x27;s okay. For the amazing g low price I&#x27;m getting a bargain if only use the thinner set. Came sooner than expected delivery date tpp</li>
            <li> These are junk, can&#x27;t cut to fit. These are trash you can&#x27;t wear them. Don&#x27;t waste your money. These are the worst eye lash I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> You definitely get what you pay for. These eyelashes are stiff and REALLY difficult to keep on for longer then a couple minutes...</li>
            <li> Pay attention when ordering things so cheap! They are coming from china so that is why they are so cheap. They took over a month to ship. The quality is fine, they are what I expected but I prefer to order locally.</li>
            <li> very heavy, stiff and unnatural. you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it! There cheap and everyone likes them! Must buy! The thick ones are a little thick but I still like. A little heavy but mascara fixes it! I like them!</li>
            <li> Better to get twenty pairs for four dollars than one pair for five dollars. the thinner ones come with a white lining on the top of the eyelash and it is very visible but they are definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes were a little plastic looking, not as natural as I thought they would be. It would have been helpful to see a close up of the lashes instead of being in the boxes they come in. I go through these like water, so the value is decent.</li>
            <li> This pairs of beautiful eyelashes are cheap. You&#x27;ll love them. They have a really good price and quality. I recommend this lashes to you, use them daily to pop your eyes.</li>
            <li> I gave these as a gift to someone who does a lot of fun makeup They Love them!! So Much Fun!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these eyelashes! Delivered fast! And had absolutely no problems. I plan on ordering them again in the future :) thank you!</li>
            <li> I like how you can see the individual hair from the lashes and they look good, just more plastic to the touch. I don&#x27;t mind that it&#x27;s long, since you can always cut and adjust to how you want it. I&#x27;m giving it 5 since I&#x27;m new to the eyelashes buying and it&#x27;s a great deal for how many there is.</li>
            <li> Not good or daily use. Fine for extravagant events like Marci gras or Halloween. Band is visible no matter what you do to try to disguise.</li>
            <li> These came 2 days before the estimated ship time.  I was happy about that because they don&#x27;t provide tracking. The lashes are great. They look like my usual human hair lashes to me when I put them on but you can tell they are synthetic in the pack.I mean I&#x27;ve never looked at someones lashes and said to look like plastic so that&#x27;s not a big deal to me at all. These are not pre-glued and they have excess strip on the ends so you will need to cut. Overall great value.</li>
            <li> They were shipped on time. Wish I could have got them faster but still love them. The regular long lashes look like your real lashes and I wear them everyday. Easy to put on and easy to clean the glue off and wear more then once. This was also a great price.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these lashes! The dark ones only, they&#x27;re beautiful! Besides cutting the sides where the extra lining is, there&#x27;s no need to trim/fix them! They&#x27;re now my &#x27;pretty&#x27; day uses! The light ones not really natural. You&#x27;re going to have to trim it. I just grab four lashes, place two on top of each other and make new lashes instead to match my style. But for the price I cannot complain! Anywhere else, they charge you $1 - 5 a pair of lashes! I LOVE the deal I got these for! It&#x27;s a STEAL! And I LOVE the way it makes me looks P:</li>
            <li> i  havent tried them but they look good . the time to deliver was pretty good i tought it took for ever but not reall thanks &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t come with glue, like I&#x27;m used to, so get your own...still Totally worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was fun to experiment with different looks. I had enough lashes to share. I ended up wearing 2 pairs to an art party, since I have enough to play with.</li>
            <li> i guess i thought they will look better and have more of a stable curve to them to fit the eye linner</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical placing an order over the web, being that I usually purchase all my items up-front, in person.&lt;br /&gt;But I gave it a go. First and foremost, I am very pleased with how QUICKLY i received my order. It gave me a estimated delivery date... which I thought was fair, being that it where it was being shipped from and to. Second, for a little over $2.00 for 20 pairs both dramatic, for an evening look and a natural-day time look, YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG. They came securely wrapped in a bubble like package.Again, I am pleased with the quality, but mainly, how quickly i receive my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this product but I was pleased with it and it came onetime so I ordered more</li>
            <li> These lashes are a great price. They are easy to use and look great with cosplay! I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and excellent quality!  Many sets and each looks nice.  The darker for evening and drama while the others are nice enough to wear without mascara!</li>
            <li> I didnt know they were plastic. Those are a lot harder than human hair to glue and hold. Applying these are already hard for first timers. they&#x27;re okay for me though</li>
            <li> these are not bad but they are not on a track like the lashes u can go out and buy at the store so I am guessing they are the price that they are. they really are not that bad though,  have worn the thinner ones and  they look more realistic. my gfs said they couldn&#x27;t tell I had falsies on. I really don&#x27;t mind, some women prefer the huge fake dramatic look, I use to myself but now that I am older I like more natural.</li>
            <li> Like it, but they obviously doesn&#x27;t look natural.</li>
            <li> Really long and really thick baby doll eyelashes!! extra kawaiI! they are a bit longer than the description but fit my eyelashes perfectly!</li>
            <li> Great quality and long-lasting for a night out! I love having a dramatic look, so I originally bought these just for the thicker ones, but thinking about cutting the thinner ones for individual use. They don&#x27;t look too overpowering either. Look real! Perfect price on top of everything!</li>
            <li> one time use lashes. They do the job</li>
            <li> I loved the product , better than expected ! It took a little long to get them but it was definitely worth the wait .</li>
            <li> These are massive and gaudy!!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased them and ended up throwing them out. Even the thin style looks awful and they don&#x27;t stay, even with strong glue! Disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used almost all of the regular long eyelashes so I will probably have to get more but thats only because I had to cut them into peices to apply them at first in order to get the hang of it. the thick ones i have only worn twice but thats mostly because of my boyfriend (he says they look absurd) but I have gotten compliments from others when I wear them (obviously they know theyre fake)</li>
            <li> I like these lashes.They were a great price,and good quality.If you are a lash Diva then you can rock these.For those who are not- you may need some practice and you will like #2 better.I like the #1 style best. And for the price of $3-$5 a pair at Wally World-NICE!</li>
            <li> What a great set of lashes at a good price. You get full and bold plus long and more natural all in one package. The lashes are strong and the bands are firm. The lashes hold up well. Would buy again and recommend. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really liked the thinner design if the two boxes but the thicker ones are just too plastic doll like. The thin ones you should know are not hair though they are a plastic like material making them kind if sharp. For the price they are fine (as a back up when you run out if other lashes) but both boxes came crushed damaging 4 pairs in each box.</li>
            <li> It took a bit of time for these eyelashes to arrive but I didn&#x27;t need them so it&#x27;s okay. The darker, fuller looking lashes may look a bit fake, while the lighter lashes look long but more natural. I had never put on fake lashes prior to receiving these; it took a few times to get used to but I find that using a sufficient amount of glue (covering the whole band, especially the edges where it meets the beginning and end of your eye) will allow easier application. Good price for basic eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They are a lot different then regular lashes but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong I didn&#x27;t expect them to get here as fast as they did , but so far I love them .</li>
            <li> There are a lot of eyelashes in here. Nice price. You get a lot of eyelashes. Make sure you have your own adhesive as none is included.</li>
            <li> You get  a lot&lt;br /&gt;but they look kinda cheapy.&lt;br /&gt;I would splurge for a little bit more personally if you are looking to wear these everyday.&lt;br /&gt;But if you just want to take cute photos, then these are good :) but definitely not for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;they look to cheapy irl.</li>
            <li> I ordered these lashes and they came in exactly two weeks, which is super fast given the fact that they were supposed to be here in a month and a half since the came all the way from Hong Kong. The lashes aren&#x27;t exactly Ardell or Red cherry material, but they do the job and look great on, and since they&#x27;re so affordable, and come with so many, they can be used as practice lashes for beginners.</li>
            <li> I tried applying these and it took me forever! They don&#x27;t bend very easily to fit on eye. Look nice until you try to put them on. The thinner pair look really bad once you get them on. I have been wearing fake lashes for 2 year so i know what i am doing and these just don&#x27;t work. Yes they are low price but i would have saved the money for a different item.</li>
            <li> These lashes aren&#x27;t shaped like the ones on plastic holders at the store. They are almost straight across so very difficult to put on and even harder to stay on. Get one side glued and the other pops up and on it goes :(  I was drawn in by the price so I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste a lot of money.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to get here but well worth it! The lashes are very thick and at whole sale price. It would cost 5.00 a pair each if you bought them in the store. I only order my lashes from here now.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised when i received these because i thought they were going to be like normal eyelash from a drug store to my surprise,they were even better there the real thing,well to me they look like it,i can cut to to adjust my eye size and curl a bit of mascara and all set.So happy i bought !!</li>
            <li> I received them today (I ordered about a month ago) The delivery date was for may, since they shipped from Hong Kong! But they came early.  Come on for few bucks, these are incredibly nice.  When you hold them to the light they don&#x27;t look as fake as others, specially the thin ones.  The thick ones look so pretty!</li>
            <li> good quality definetly worth the money I spent on them. Many lashes for a cheap price, perfect ! I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never find deals like this in drugstores. They&#x27;re amazing! Some people tend to say that they aren&#x27;t great quality and kinda hard to put on, but I would have to disagree.</li>
            <li> There is a really drastic difference between the two lashes in thickness, both of which have their place in day/night wear. You can also use them more than once. Took a while to get them in the mail, but not a big deal otherwise - great to have so many on hand.</li>
